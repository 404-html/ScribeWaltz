00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.630
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:07.090
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,
uh,

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
June 30 2016 what's going on?
How the fuck are you?

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.660
Um,
I'm hanging out here Sunday night.

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.880
There's 30.2 seconds left and game six and up

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.160
<v 2>blurry.
Absolute mericle out there on the ice world.</v>

7
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:26.150
We have a lake placid sequel.

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.620
<v 1>I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the fucking Pittsburgh Penguins are</v>

9
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:35.230
going to win their fifth cup.
Is this the fifth one

10
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.830
that's fucking realize how successful that is?

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.530
They've only been around since 67 that Brian's been around forever.

12
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:43.810
We only got six.
You mother fuckers.

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.010
Congratulations to the Pittsburgh Penguins,
man.
That's fucking great.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.380
And uh,
really happy.
Fulfill Castle.
I,

15
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:55.030
there's actually a good one for me as a Bruins fan because Joe Thornton was a,

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.210
you know,
another former Bruins.
Either way.
I was going to say,

17
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:01.640
and I'd like both those fucking players,
you know,
I mean because of,

18
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.940
for the Phil Kessel Trade to Toronto,
we want a cup.
Granted,

19
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:08.930
we then traded everybody the fuck away,
but we did want a cup.
You know,

20
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800
so I can say some shit to fucking Montreal fence.
Finally,

21
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.030
20 seconds to go.
19.
I'll tell you this.

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.350
<v 2>Jeffrey's Trofeo fucker professional sports.</v>

23
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.003
<v 1>MMM.</v>

24
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.160
<v 1>This gotta be one of the most,
what the fuck was that icing?
The goalie played it.</v>

26
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.160
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
What does this,
the fucking NBA,
um,

27
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.320
by the way,
I kind of,

28
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.450
I guess I understand now why it's not as physical in the NBA.

29
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:40.600
I actually looked up some of the rules.
The uh,

30
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
obviously the three second rule and isn't even as like an offensive player.

31
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.540
Are you allowed to be that?
I don't know.

32
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.570
The one of these guys can go down the fucking lane.
Uh,

33
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.200
defensive player can't be in the fucking painted area for longer than three

34
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.090
seconds or it's an illegal defense.

35
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.600
He is allowed to stand there fees within arm's length of the guy that he's

36
00:01:59.601 --> 00:01:59.991
garden.

37
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.230
So all the guys got to do is just fucking run out to the three point land and

38
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.230
they just clear it.
Clear the path.
Right.

39
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.590
And it comes the honor roll student write down the fucking Lang

40
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.540
like Jack Day,
his quickness.
Yeah.
He has his first step.
Yeah.

41
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:17.810
And the fact that there's now a fucking rule that says you can't have some giant

42
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:21.020
fucking guy standing there.
Oh look it up.
Go and crazy.

43
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.670
Wow.
Another one in the box.

44
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.480
You know something I'm not close to phobic,

45
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.290
but one of the worst things you want to be after winning the championship is

46
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:38.260
that person on the bottom of the fucking pile.
You know,

47
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.730
you literally go from like celebrating that you'll want to not even being able

48
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.540
to breathe.
You're like,
and you get tackled and you just like

49
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.943
that shit.

50
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.870
Do you know that there's been times before who scored big fucking touchdowns and

51
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:02.920
they tackled by the teammates.
They get like the fucking leg broken.

52
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.400
It's unbelievable.
Um,
anyways,
congratulations to the Pittsburgh Penguins,
uh,

53
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.230
and Pittsburgh.
Great,
great fucking hockey town.

54
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.330
I know we've had a rivalry in that thing,

55
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.240
but I've just been there too many times.
I've got too many friends there and uh,

56
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.740
congratulations to Joe Barton.
Nikki's going to be going fucking crazy right now.

57
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.990
Um,
if I didn't have shit to do tomorrow,

58
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.270
what are you going over his place and watch the game?
Um,

59
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.210
San Jose sharks sell man.
You know,

60
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.930
he never made it to the final c got over that hump and I are going to have that

61
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.990
bitter taste in your mouth and hopefully you'll come back and win one unless my

62
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.470
fucking Bruins get their shit together.
And then we fucking finally one once.

63
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.110
So anyways,
um,
let's get on with the podcast here.

64
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.310
Uh,
I had a,
yeah,
had my birthday weekend.

65
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.350
Wonderful birthday weekend or Billy booze bag was fucking throwing them down.
Oh,

66
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:55.990
Billy postbag was acting a clamp,
right?

67
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.910
And fucking Joey roses was over right.
Came over on my birthday to my house.

68
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.380
When I say Joey,
Yo say roses.
Um,
he came over,

69
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.840
fucking guy was hilarious.
He came over with like a bottle of gin,
something,

70
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.060
some of fucking lemon.
And then he had those,

71
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:16.660
those fucking Red Cherries that might or might not cause cancer

72
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.150
to Phil Kessel looks like he fucking war.
He's like works with wood.

73
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.340
Doesn't he like some weird guy that never married,
but he could fucking,
you know,

74
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.010
make a Davenport out of a fucking tree stump.

75
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.230
You can't hate Phil Kessel though.
How's your breath?
Pretty bad.
A,
um,

76
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.090
oh,
and the wonderful traditional,
the NHL is shaking of the hands,

77
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:47.910
the shell of mutual respect,
I think.
Um,

78
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.060
anyways,
uh,
yeah,
so I fucking went,

79
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.930
I went way too hard on my birthday,
you know,
cause I didn't think any,
you know,

80
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.020
I didn't really do anything.
I worked all fucking day.
And then I came home,

81
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.110
I had a chorus light and I was just like,
you know what,
it's my birthday.

82
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.570
I'll fucking have a scotch.
Right.

83
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.010
Pick up my big giant fucking cube of ice.

84
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.890
And I threw down to scotches and next thing you know,

85
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.100
fucking roses was coming over and I already had three in the fucking three in

86
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.610
the win column.
So,
um,
I don't really remember most,

87
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.580
probably the third,
last third of the fucking night.
And,
uh,

88
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.970
I don't know.

89
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.310
All I know is I got a bunch of dirty looks from my wife the next day.
So,
uh,

90
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.240
last night I went out again and I only had like a couple of beers and a,

91
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.410
and then that's it.
That's it.
I'm shutting it down again.

92
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.520
That's how I stay in control.
You know the thing about your livers,

93
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:46.000
you don't want to spoil it.
You know,
I've slept it around enough,

94
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.750
so now I give it a break.
And then just when it starts to think,
hey,

95
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.110
you know what?
Everything is beautiful.

96
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:57.530
I give it the old fucking right there,
Fred.
It's what I do.
Um,

97
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.370
I had a,
I was actually great weekend.
I didn't do any stand up either.

98
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.770
I got to get my fucking shit together.

99
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:07.520
So maybe doing a couple shows this week around la cause I got,
um,

100
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.620
I got no work,
Atlantic City in Baltimore coming up this weekend,

101
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:15.590
so I got to make sure the act is ready to go.
Nice and fucking tight there.

102
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.230
And uh,
but this weekend,
you know,

103
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.650
obviously celebrating my birthday Friday night and um,

104
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.520
<v 3>okay,</v>

105
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.810
<v 1>let's see.
What did I do?</v>

106
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.400
Say I went to somebody else's fucking birthday party.
So,
uh,

107
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.650
and that one,
that was the one that I actually didn't really drink at,

108
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.680
but I still felt horrible because at one point I had a tequila and after that I

109
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:44.030
had birthday cake and then I smoked a cigar.
And then my body was just like,

110
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.870
all right,
can we,
can we fucking pick a road here?
Which,
which,

111
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.220
which way is the abuse going tonight?
You know?
But uh,

112
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.420
I was so hung over Saturday,

113
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:56.390
I couldn't even fucking walk the 10 feet to my gym and I was,

114
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.870
that's when I know it's like,
all right too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you doing?

115
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.340
So I shut it down.
It's over.
Put a padlock on it.
Um,

116
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.340
<v 3>okay.</v>

117
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.480
<v 1>I don't know how long I'm going to go.</v>

118
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.643
<v 3>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.040
<v 1>I don't know.
You don't want it.
Is this,</v>

120
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:14.510
this is actually once the fucking playoffs are over,
it's kind of easy,

121
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:16.250
but I'm also going to be starting peaky blinders,

122
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.010
so that might be hard if the way those fucking guys drink.

123
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.110
I don't understand how you watch a show.

124
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.590
Everybody's boozing and you don't fucking drink any alcoholics out there.
Like,

125
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:26.630
how the fuck do you watch that stuff and just be like,

126
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:30.020
well everybody else is drinking.
I feel like I'm being rude right now.

127
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.760
Um,
I'm thinking maybe I'm going to shut it down until I go to Europe,

128
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:41.630
but even that I can't really drink cause I got a show every fucking night.
But,

129
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:46.180
uh,
I did set myself up in,
um,
in a hotel,

130
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.030
uh,
on one of those dates that there's actually a,

131
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:51.400
a cigar bar right around the corner.

132
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:56.110
So I might have my one for July.
Um,

133
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.240
I don't know.
I feel like I'm just fucking babbling.

134
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.570
This is just me just trying to keep my bad habits at bay.
This is a deal.

135
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.140
Either I'm not drinking at all or I'm smoking too many cigars or I cut down the

136
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:07.540
cigars and I drink like a fucking lunatic.
You know what I mean?

137
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.470
Like I've said before,

138
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.010
I literally think the reason why people have kids is so they won't fucking drink

139
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:12.791
themselves to death.

140
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:16.600
Because once you fucking get yourself going in your career and you've got some

141
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:20.260
free time,
why wouldn't you?
Why wouldn't you walk over?

142
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:22.660
What are you going to fucking do?
Huh?

143
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.040
After that fucking horrible tragedy down there in Orlando,

144
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.940
which I will never fucking understand.
Lunatic religious people.

145
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I just never understand how you get so fucked up in your head that you feel like

146
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:43.960
that's your last act on earth.
Okay.
That's the last thing you're going to do.

147
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.270
And you think that you're going to go somewhere good.

148
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.280
That there's somebody after this.

149
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.640
If there is somebody after this that judged you,

150
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.800
that he's going to be sitting there going like,
all right,
wait a go.

151
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.590
They again,
that was the right thing to do.

152
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.680
Make millions of people sad.
You know?
It's just,

153
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:07.460
just the fucking worst thing ever.
And I'm,

154
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.750
I'm actually going to take a break here from TV,
probably four other than sports.

155
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.260
It's a great thing about sports is you can get away from that stuff because,
uh,

156
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.440
I can't handle when something like this happens.
How quickly,
Oh God,

157
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.140
is he getting booed?
Is he getting

158
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.660
<v 2>booed?
Uh,
you know,
it</v>

159
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.540
pluff acid every fucking year.

160
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.720
This is the funniest shit ever in hockey.

161
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.120
<v 1>Every fucking year.</v>

162
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.380
The commissioner of the League comes out and he just gets fucking,

163
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.150
I don't know why he's still getting booed.
Let's see this here.

164
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.090
<v 2>Hang on a second.
Steve Summers,
slave Somers,</v>

165
00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:56.570
route those words and now it's,
and on the side of the Stanley Cup lab,

166
00:09:56.571 --> 00:09:59.880
rub my balls on it right before it,
one of the greatest job,

167
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.060
he's an old spoiling at Mario Lemieux looking sharp.

168
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.040
He's got his anchorman sport coat on.
Tom Burton,
Tom Bergin,

169
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:11.380
he fucking the fuck's his name.
Oh,

170
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.223
we read comes.

171
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.933
<v 0>Wow.</v>

172
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.210
<v 2>He's complimenting him.</v>

173
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.200
This is one of the loudest buildings I've ever heard that Bo and them,

174
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.410
his children must cry every fucking year.

175
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.680
<v 1>So anyways,
back to the tragedy.
Sorry.
Um,</v>

176
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.980
I can't handle whenever something like that fucking happens.

177
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.150
And then you got to sit there and listen to all of these fucking people trying

178
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:48.770
to shoe horn their agendas in there.
They're uh,

179
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.730
you know,
the fucking theories.

180
00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:57.140
And then somehow it always becomes Democrat,
liberal,
fucking conservative,

181
00:10:57.141 --> 00:11:00.230
Republican,
Muslim,

182
00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:04.800
Christian fucking gun control the NRA and all that shit.

183
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:08.120
And you know,
it's fucking,
it's so stupid.
You know what's funny?

184
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:13.121
If you look at the Daily News in New York City,

185
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.420
right,
are anti gun,
which you know,
if that's what you want to be,

186
00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:21.320
that's what you want to be.
But if you anti gun and you really want

187
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.240
that to work,
wouldn't you?
Uh,
you need,

188
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:29.210
what you need to do is persuade the other side to come over.

189
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.190
Their headline is thanks a lot NRA or some stupid shit like that.

190
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.600
All that does is just get people's fucking backup.
All I'm saying,

191
00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:41.030
it's just going to be a bunch of people screaming and yelling

192
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.250
is going to be a couple of actors and actresses that are going to say something

193
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:50.300
stupid.
Right?
I don't know what,
but you know,

194
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.540
we're always good to do something like people in the fucking people who forget

195
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:58.420
that they're a dancing monkey and think that they could solve the country's

196
00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.254
problems

197
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.790
for the fucking life.
For me.
I mean,
I know I fucking talk about the ship,

198
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:11.260
but I never tried to offer solutions.
You know,
they will mind.

199
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.550
I tell Dick and shit jokes and fucking strip malls.
Um,
but I,

200
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.750
I gotta tell you though,

201
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.990
I just wish people out of respect for the amount of fucking paint that was just

202
00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:26.380
inflicted on,
I can't even imagine what that number 50 people,

203
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.010
how many people right now,
I just never going to be the same.

204
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.790
You would think that people could go 24 fucking hours.

205
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.570
<v 4>Okay.</v>

206
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.770
<v 1>Without making it about their cause and screaming and yelling as much as they're</v>

207
00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:43.160
trying to fucking help.
Can you just kinda about just,
you know,

208
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.220
can you go 20 fucking minutes before we got to listen to the people saying that

209
00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:51.740
it's Obama's fault and fucking this and that and everything.
You know what?

210
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.220
I don't know whose fault.
It's nobody's fault.
You know what it is,
dude,

211
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.030
unfortunately we're fucking,
we're animals.
That's what it is.

212
00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:02.340
Most of us are decent enough not to do that,
but it's just a,

213
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.190
what are you going to do?
It's just fucking horrible.

214
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.010
Why would I talk about this shit?
You know,
why?
Cause it's cause.
Why?

215
00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:12.990
How could he not?
How do you not?
Um,
anyways,
so Sidney Crosby,

216
00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:17.660
he got the MVP,
got that little shiny house with the fucking,
I dunno,

217
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.900
disco hat on top of it.
All right.
When's he given it to Phil Kessel.

218
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.980
When's he given it to Phil Kessel.
Who's he handed off to first?

219
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.070
Who's he headed off to first?
Well,

220
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.910
a greater ratios of all sports,
so I'll tell you ways.

221
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.940
Fucking 9,000 bugs till you put it over your head and it feels like a baby.

222
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.250
You're worried about dropping?
Yeah.
Be here.

223
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:43.320
All the stories about the Stanley Cup,
all the fucking,

224
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.860
I can't believe they drink out of that thing every year the amount of fucking

225
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.290
stripper asked that has been sitting in that big people pissing in it and all

226
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:55.530
kinds of shit,
Lisa and ends up with a bottom of a pool a couple of times.

227
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.430
You get some chlorine.

228
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.140
Now I'm exposing myself to the fact I don't know who anybody is on the fucking

229
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:03.840
penguins.
All righty.
He handled it.

230
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:08.190
He just handed the cup to not Phil Kessel,
not Phil Kessel,

231
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.590
not Phil Kessel holding it up,
holding it up,
turning,

232
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:17.730
spinning.
What number is he?
Number six,
not Phil Kessel.

233
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.770
Jesus Christ.
He should have fucking skated around a little more daily.

234
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.060
Dude,
I would fucking take off at that thing.
I swear to God,
if I ever get paid,

235
00:14:29.061 --> 00:14:32.700
we got to do that thing.
Be like when,
what's his face?
Uh,

236
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.030
it's one of his fucking shots at the end of his practice,

237
00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:37.650
speaking of which Jesus Christ,

238
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.510
I was hoping for at least at least a fucking six game series with the Cavaliers.

239
00:14:42.511 --> 00:14:46.410
I may guess that's not going to happen.
Right?
Um,
anyways,

240
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:48.750
let's plow ahead here with the podcast.
I'll stop watching.

241
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.460
I gotta keep this on until at least I would get to watch Kessel.
Oh,

242
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:56.450
he's the fucking cup here.
Huh?
The woodworker here.
Um,

243
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.940
anyways,
you know what I watched this,
uh,

244
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.770
sports this morning is I watched the,
uh,
the Formula One race,

245
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:07.670
the one up in Montreal,
kind of getting into that sport.
You know,

246
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.500
cause I never know what to do once hockey and basketball ends,
you know,

247
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:16.340
what am I going to read?
God knows I'm not going to fucking do that.
Right.

248
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.740
Um,
I'm just filibustering hey,

249
00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:23.970
can you just finally get the thing that Phil Kessel already for fuck sakes.

250
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.460
I Dunno if he's been waiting that long.
Come on.

251
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.530
<v 0>Okay,</v>

252
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.040
<v 1>you got to give it to Phil.
He's fucking adorable.</v>

253
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.580
Hey,
here we go.
Phil Castle,
fill castle.
Nope.

254
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.430
So I'm assistant captain.
Oh,
Jesus said smoking.

255
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.770
I didn't recognize him with a hat on.

256
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.210
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

257
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.210
<v 1>he's not one of those guys who's fucking mustache and beard doesn't connect.</v>

258
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.750
You know Jesus,
he's got a terrible patchy fucking,

259
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.120
I dunno what now what he's got going on there.

260
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

261
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.360
<v 1>That's really the thing.
People can either,
you know,</v>

262
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.630
you know what's the worst is the fucking neck beard,
you know,
all those people.

263
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.220
It fucking,
it starts off far right by the ear and then it just fucking goes,

264
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.510
does a nosedive.

265
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.860
And you guys like the Chin strap goes right up and under and they got like five

266
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:16.300
hairs in their upper lip and he's just like,
well,
what are you doing?
You know,

267
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.830
Tang has it now.
All right,
this has to be excruciatingly boring.

268
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:22.720
I'm going to hit pause here until Phil Kessel gets it.

269
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.463
<v 0>Okay.</v>

270
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.160
<v 1>And of course they cut it off before he fucking hoist the thing cause they had a</v>

271
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:31.940
cut immediately to gets you championship tee shirts and fucking hats.
All right,

272
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.390
I'll,
I'll find a fucking clip of it.
Um,
all right.
With that,

273
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:38.720
I'm gonna shut the TV off so I can actually focus here.
Um,
yeah,

274
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:40.580
so shutting down the booze.

275
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:41.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

276
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.580
<v 1>But if I can shut down the booze,
hit my little fucking gym out there,</v>

277
00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:45.414
you know what I mean?

278
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.710
Get myself a fucking man sports bra and fucking get after it.
You know,

279
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.180
not smoked cigars.
I will be the most in shape and board I've ever fucking been.

280
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.880
Um,
I got it correct.

281
00:16:59.881 --> 00:17:04.470
A couple of things from the last podcast I did on Thursday.
Uh,

282
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.810
John,
Sally is not dead.

283
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.510
I meant to say Anthony Mason.
I Dunno.
I was half a fucking sleeper.
Right.

284
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.780
And uh,
so I want to thank all you can't on Twitter too,
that like you,

285
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.270
you will,
you couldn't just write to me.
Hey Bill.
John Salley isn't dead.

286
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.050
You had to put at John Sally so he could have potentially saw it.

287
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.830
Why the fuck would you do that to you know why?
Because you're fucking bored.

288
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.850
That's why.
Well,
hoping some fucking Twitter dust up.
What happened?

289
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:39.560
I guess I just don't understand this whole fucking generation a Yolo Douche is,

290
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:41.900
they're all about filming people get them in trouble,

291
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:44.270
Hashtag and shit add and people on stuff.

292
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.820
Just trying to constantly cause these fucking fights.
It's unbelievable dance.

293
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.740
You go outside and pick up a stick and pay cowboys and Indians like we used to

294
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.510
get to walk around with your fucking iPad and your,
your go pro.

295
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.440
Oh Shit.
I got a Gopro for my birthday.
I'm such a hypocrite.
Um,

296
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.220
I wanted to get one of those things and uh,
you know,
I might,

297
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.300
I'm toying with the idea of doing that show the how long can he go,

298
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.970
which is basically me pulling out of the driveway of my house.

299
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:19.230
And then you see how long I can go without snapping on people.
Um,

300
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.920
but I just don't want to make myself look like a fucking lunatic,
you know,

301
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.400
cause I feel like I've built up a great reputation for being even killed on this

302
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:30.120
podcast.
Um,
all right,
let's do it.
Let's do a little fucking

303
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.440
advertising reads here for the week where they allow,

304
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.800
all right,
right here.
Okay.
MVMT watches everybody.

305
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.010
When you're in your early twenties and thirties,
money can be tight.

306
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.000
If you're not careful,
dressing well can quickly drain your bank account.

307
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.180
Like spending 400 to 500 bucks in a department store.

308
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:55.470
Watch there's some brands out there charging insane prices for watches then

309
00:18:55.471 --> 00:18:59.040
aren't even worth it.
Well,
if you want to look great when you go out,

310
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:03.530
but still have enough money to buy him or heard a drink,
check out the movement.

311
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.550
Him or her a drink.
Oh God.

312
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:10.350
This feminist agenda kicks up.
Is that happening out there?

313
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.620
You're really gone on a date and she buys the fucking drink.
Is that,

314
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.970
is that what's happening?
Is that why Bruce became Caitlyn?

315
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.240
He was so much of a man.
He goes,
ah,
oh,
ah,

316
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.980
by a drinks by whole life.
Nobody's buying me a drink.

317
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.010
I'm going to become a way.
All right,
check out movement.
watches.com.
Um,

318
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.850
I've seen them before and these watches are sharp.
Why did they fucking do that?

319
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:40.080
Stop saying that.
I've seen shit.
Jesus fucking Christ.

320
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:41.460
I fucking hate that when people do that,

321
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:44.820
just just give me the spiel and I'll read it.

322
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.600
Stop saying that I did things that I didn't do clearly.
All right.

323
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.600
Actually they did send me some watches.
I'm sorry.
MVMT.
You're right.

324
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.780
I did see them.
Oh,
Jesus.
All right.

325
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:58.290
Originally founded by two broke college kids movement watches.

326
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.860
Cut out the middle.
Well,
if you are broke,
how the fuck did you start the company?

327
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.930
This doesn't add up.
All right.

328
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.070
Movement watches cut out the middle man and they're a big brand retail markups.

329
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:11.310
In order to give you a stylish watch for an affordable price move in watches.

330
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:13.170
Start at just 95 bucks.

331
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.740
I'll watch with department store quality for a fraction of the price.

332
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.270
They're sleek and minimalistic and a modern twist on a classic style.

333
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.600
A modern twist on a classic style movement has grown organically purely by

334
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:27.570
supporters like you.

335
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:31.140
They started at a farmer's market right next to the all organic corn.

336
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.580
So join there more than 1 million social media followers and get a movement.

337

All right,

Everybody.

341
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.750
Don't you wish you knew how to cook but you didn't have to shop and they just

342
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:58.090
gave you all the directions on how to do it.
Well,

343
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.790
thank God somebody does all blue apron.

344
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.240
Blue Apron knows that when you cook with incredible ingredients,

345
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.270

346
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.770
So they set the highest believing I bought some great cuts of meat in my time

347
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:15.870
and I Christ yet cut that shit out of it.
Um,

348
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.980
so they sent the highest quality.

349
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.150
They set the highest quality standards for their community of artisanal

350
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.450
suppliers.
Now Jesus and what's that?

351
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:29.740
Some hipster slaughter and a fucking pig using some tool he bought off Ebay,

352
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:34.570
that some asshole made in 1870 family run farms,
fisheries and ranchers.

353
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.910
Whether it's Japanese ramen noodles,

354
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:40.270

tacos.
But I mean,
is it going to be anything special?

379
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.310
Excuse me?
What do you mean anything special,
Kamaya?

380
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.450
Before he started yelling at me.
I mean like when you make the tacos tonight,

381
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.490
you're going to add a little little Nini in there.

382
00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:24.700
He just going to fucking do it by the box.

383
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.440
I'm doing it by the box cause yeah,
I mean it's just tacos.

384
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.810
What do you,
what would be different?
I don't know.

385
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:34.630
You always look in the fridge and you go,
Oh,
you know what?
I'll feel good.

386
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.500
I didn't know we had bacon.
I'll throw that in there.
Well,
you know what I,

387
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.870
there is a little something different.
I take that back.

388
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.530
I did throw something in there that might be a little unexpected

389
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.640
when we return.
What have you done?
What do you mean?
What am I done?

390
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.770
Don't fucking talk to me like that.

391
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.810
How far in are you on this thing and then none of your goddamn business.

23 minutes.

Well,

I'm talking to somebody talking about right now.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.920
I'm talking about stamps.com oh,

395
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.230
No,
I haven't.

396
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.120
No,
they're not.
I to finish this.
All right,
well time it up.

397
00:24:22.121 --> 00:24:25.130
Why are you going to like,
like when you make them,

398
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.920
remember Fred Flintstone used to come home?

399
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:32.270
Well mom coming through the door and she had to have the Bronto Burger ready.

400
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.580
It's ready right now.
What?
What are you looking for?
What

401
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.650
my John Dacre what?
You know what kills me?

402
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:47.651
Somebody sent me a tweet and said dead on the opiate thing show in 2005 11 years

403
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:51.650
ago.
They showed me that come up.
Somebody sent me that too and they,

404
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:55.850
I had absolutely no recollection of that.
How would I forget that?

405
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:01.000
Because it was 2005 it was a long time ago.
I know,
but this is like that.

406
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.840
That's,
I still remember,
you know late.
We're late,
Charlie.
Bit My finger.

407
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:10.310
We're not late.
I feel like,
oh,
all these fucking assholes.
Look you.

408
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:12.380
Just so you didn't know.
It's like,
yeah,

409
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:15.830
I haven't had time to see everything on the Internet.
You fucking asshole.

410
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.670
That's so stupid.
I don't know.
The more I'm on this,

411
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.670
I like just talking into the abyss.
I got to stop fucking reading Twitter.

412
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.680
I fucking hate people.
You are truly addicted to Twitter.
No,

413
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:30.050
just my phone.
I'm not doing that either.
I was looking today,

414
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:31.640
I was looking up off Formula One drivers.

415
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:33.440
I watched to Formula One races in a row.

416
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.480
Now I need to know everything about this sport.

417
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.810
You're so rain man like that though.
You like,
that's what you like to do.

418
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.910
Get to know everything.
Got to find out everything.
Yeah.

419
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:44.330
And I get it all in there and then I forget it and then I move on to something

420
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:46.940
else.
And that's probably why I fucking forgot that that video.

421
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.930
Do you know there's a red bull team in Formula One and I'm just sitting,

422
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:54.890
I don't know that because I've just seen people wearing their jackets and

423
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:58.520
jumpsuits and it's on the side of cars.
How did you not see it?
If I know this?

424
00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.960
Well,
I was thinking,
well there's,

425
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:03.230
there was a Mercedes team and then there was the Ferrari team and then there was

426
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:05.990
like red bull.
I'm like,
they were fucking drink.
So I was like,

427
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:10.280
well who made their engine?
Who paid,
who made the car?
And then they said it was,

428
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:16.190
they said it was tag hoyer.
Renault.
It's like tag or is a fucking watch?

429
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.160
Well,
when I type in who makes you fucking engines?

430
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:20.930
I don't want to hear about the watch people.

431
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.670
Maybe you should leave out the fucking part

432
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.780
all to shea.
I didn't know that.
That's how you get into tag hoyer.

433
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.720
But no,
red bull is a huge brand.
So of course they sponsor stuff like this.

434
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.900
No,
but they was saying,
you know the Ferrari,
the Mercedes,

435
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.900
and then they would never say kind of fucking,
they never said the Renault.

436
00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.150
It's a French company making the fucking engine and I think it's a British team

437
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.320
and then they're talking about a fucking energy drink where the other has got to

438
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:58.080
be like Mercedes,
Ferrari and you get to be like,
yeah man.

439
00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:59.220
Of course those guys are like,

440
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.330
they've been doing it forever and all of a sudden red bull shows up.

441
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:07.810
The Yolo Douche is a fucking Formula One and they don't even tell me who makes

442
00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:11.400
their engine.
I mean that used to be like a big fucking thing back in the day.

443
00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:14.910
The reason why you want it was your proven you the best car company and then

444
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:18.570
everybody's like,
well shit,
Ferrari won the last five.
I'm going to buy a Ferrari.

445
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.960
We're not everybody people could afford it because I'm still confused.

446
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:25.830
What's your problem with Red Bull?
I didn't.
I didn't like how I look.

447
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:29.100
I want to know who's making that engine that's went in the fucking race.

448
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.860
I don't give a fuck about the drink.
Okay,

449
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.360
so you're haven't been able to figure out who makes the engine in this one

450
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:39.100
particular race car?
No,
I had to look it up.
Okay.

451
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.660
This fucking young punk kid was not letting the guy won the first three or four

452
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.260
get past them to get into fourth place and the guy got in patient and I knew we

453
00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:48.090
was gonna cause that's what I would've done.

454
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.190
And I knew we was a little bit older.
I'm like,

455
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:51.480
oh he doesn't have time for this kid.

456
00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:54.930
And he fucking tried to go around the right and then he locked up the brakes and

457
00:27:54.931 --> 00:27:59.310
he spun out and he fucked himself out of like two spots on the last lap and

458
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:03.510
everybody in the crowd went,
oh,
it's exciting.

459
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.140
So at the end of the day you got the information that you wanted.

460
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.590
It was just the fact that red bull was in there or annoyed by it.

461
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.340
It's really hard to follow you sometimes.
Like what?
Okay.

462
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.700
Mercedes is a maker of cars.
Yes.
Yeah.

463
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.760
So when I know it's the Mercedes team,
I know that the engineers,

464
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.860
the mechanics wouldn't fuck you.
Call them that.
That's their car.
Okay.

465
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.590
When they talk about the Ferrari team,
I know that that's their car.

466
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.150
I know who built the fucking thing.

467
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:38.070
When you say red bull who build the red bull car,
it's harder to figure out,

468
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.680
hey you want to his,
oh my God,
what the fuck?
What the fuck?
I already forgot.

469
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.670
Are you onto another topic already know cause that just Miami high or was it

470
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:48.960
just reminded me of a drink.

471
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.780
What my dad called grey goose one time he goes,
hey bill egos.

472
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.710
He was still drinking that Blue Swan.

473
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.840
<v 2>You know what a does occur to me.
That's where you get it from.</v>

474
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.050
That's where you get all that stuff.
The last days of Dracula,

475
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:11.370
two whores in a pool,
you know that we're the bitch go.

476
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.130
You get that from him.
Like you guys have a vague idea of what it is that you're,

477
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.790
when I'm doing the movie thing,

478
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.630
so you're just like throwing out like let's signifiers like you know that there

479
00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:25.950
is the,
there is a girl and she's being slutty and there was a pool.
So yeah,

480
00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:26.870
two horses and the pool.

481
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.500
It's a vampire and they're doing some sort of an interview.
So it's,
yeah,

482
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:33.570
the last days of Dracula,
like it's just,

483
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.920
well I know I'm doing a more like the $10,000 pyramid.

484
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.950
Like I'm throwing out clues for the listener and then they just go,

485
00:29:40.951 --> 00:29:42.010
what you mean?
Then I go,
yeah,

486
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.180
<v 1>I mean that because if I don't do that,
I'm going to sit there going,
ah,
ah,</v>

487
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:48.310
and I'm not going to remember.
And the thing would be tortured.

488
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.593
So it becomes like a

489
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.650
<v 2>game,
you know what I mean?</v>

490
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.680
I wonder how you would do on that pyramid show cause you know they're bringing

491
00:29:54.681 --> 00:29:59.630
it back.
I would do horrible on that show.
We just give them,
if I was giving you,

492
00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:04.280
let's glue ever,
right when you,
all right,
you know what?

493
00:30:04.281 --> 00:30:07.700
Let's play right now.
I'm going to get a fucking word and we're going to,

494
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.110
we're going to play right now and I'll see if I can guess what it is based on

495
00:30:12.111 --> 00:30:12.420
your right.

496
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.660
<v 1>All right,
we'll do the couple of these.
Get out of here.
Get you.</v>

497
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.810
You got to get a microphone.

498
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.110
Go get a mic in front of when I'm finished reading this fucking advertising
here.

499
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.490
Jesus Christ,
they started this like 20 minutes ago.
Hey guys,

500
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.690
you remember way back in the day when I was talking about stamps.com.
Guess what?

501
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:29.710
They're still in business.

502
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.870
Yes,
she had dinner.
Uh,
important.
Uh,
keeps your operations going.

503
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.670
I swear to God,
that's still a sentence.

504
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.520
But if you're making constant trips to the post office,

505
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:44.110
that's the routine you need to change.

506
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:49.380
There's a much more convenient way@stamps.com stamps.com brings all of the

I just realized you guys need to know what the fucking words are so you can play

510
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:01.660
at home.
All right?

521
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.390
It's why I was,
why I would suck at it.
I can't,

522
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.370
I certainly couldn't create the fucking show.
Paris,

I don't see me given the password or there I'd taken the fucking

561
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.780
<v 1>clues.
Um,
all right.
Gun to your head if you had to give a take.
All right.</v>

562
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.810
Okay.
Ready?
I'm ready.
Are we on the clock here?
Hey,

563
00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:11.400
guess add the tension.
Can we get a clock in?
Clock timer here?

564
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.540
I'm going to get one of these on youtube right now.
No,
we don't need to do that.

565
00:34:15.541 --> 00:34:16.170
All right,
here we go.

566
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.970
Use the stopwatch thing on the computer or the people at home.
The fans at home.

567
00:34:19.971 --> 00:34:24.700
I'm going to hear a fucking clock going.
All right.
Okay.
We're back.
And uh,

568
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.040
there's only 33 seconds on this clock.
So there's four things you got to get.

569
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.820
Okay.
Is there a topic or um,
no,
there's nothing.

570
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.940
This is just random shit that came out of my head.
I,
you got,

571
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.040
you got 33 seconds.
Let's see how many you can get.
Okay.
All right.
You Ready?

572
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.950
Ready?
And here we go.

573
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:46.920
Okay.

575
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.820
one of the great cities in the world and people love it and they talk down to

576
00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:55.610

They fucking hate you.

What?
You're a stupid American.
I'm better than you.

578
00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:03.200
You like my baret Harris.
Yeah.
Um,

579
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:07.280
Stick it in my twired.

583
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.860
You got a,

It's true.

586
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.640
It's all true.
Everything.
I pick this up,
White Swat and that.

587
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.800
What's supposed to be a clue.
I was thinking she did a porno.
All right,

588
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.300
let's do,

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.860
<v 2>All right.
Uh,

well,
while we're misunderstood,

595
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.840
I didn't bite that mailman.
He looked at me first pimple.
Yes.
Um,
all right.

596
00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:18.770
This is a,

597
00:36:18.771 --> 00:36:23.771
this is something that you say and people get mad and they can smell sometimes,

598
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.200
but if it's a fresh one,
it's great and you,
you fucking stick it.

599
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:28.970
You stick it right.

600
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:36.590
It's between your legs.
It's between your legs.
Keep going.

601
00:36:36.591 --> 00:36:41.430
It was the worst name.
Worst name,
cons worth.
Now that is bad.
Yes.

602
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.240
Woo.
You did it.
It did.
It did it.

603
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.340
Oh,
that was great.
That was great.

604
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.830
Be asked to be on the route egg pyramid show.

605
00:36:55.930 --> 00:37:00.190
That will never happen.
That come on to be like,

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.010
Oh,

608
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:14.480
<v 1>Um,
I will never be on a charades team with you.
Oh,
come on.</v>

609
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:19.570
I will never,
I got to come up with some and,
and do you,
well,

610
00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:22.070
why don't you do it?
Why don't you fucking come up with some and then I'll do it.

611
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:27.740
How about that?
All right.
Didn't you just say that?
Yes.
All right.
I want it.

612
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.760
<v 2>Wait,
what?
No,
I got it.
We'll do it on Thursday.
Okay.
We'll do one on Thursday.</v>

613
00:37:33.761 --> 00:37:37.240
All right.
You come up with the gut.
We got the quick little timer there.

614
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.780
<v 1>I know.
Stick it up.
My twat.</v>

615
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.431
<v 2>Actually,</v>

616
00:37:43.431 --> 00:37:47.450
I probably disqualified the last one because I used the word twice when I was

617
00:37:47.451 --> 00:37:50.600
trying to get the Kardashians,
right?
Yeah.
Mary around.
Hey look,

618
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.530
what would you won't believe what we're doing over here?

619
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.760
Keeping up with the Kardashians.
It worked though.

620
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.310
<v 1>It did work.
What do you want from me?
All right.</v>

621
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.780
Coming off a bender here.
Hey,
it's a rough one.
You know.
All right.

622
00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:10.610
You're talking about your birthday.
Uh,
yes I did.
I had a great time.
I,

623
00:38:10.611 --> 00:38:13.320
it was a whole birthday weekend.
Yes it was.

624
00:38:13.321 --> 00:38:18.321
It wasn't what I had my own little sad alcoholic one the night of mine where you

625
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:21.900
was stone sober and you watch me and Joe to Rosa just fucking,

626
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.440
we were having fun.
You were having fun.
That's true.

627
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:29.820
But eventually I had to leave.
Yeah.
Well you weren't partying so you know,

628
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:34.800
what are you gonna do?
Um,
and then,
you know,
last night was phenomenal also.

629
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:38.740
And then I went down to the Improv.
Ben Bailey was in town,
the Great Ben Bailey.

630
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:40.810
Yeah.
We hung out.
We had a couple of drinks.

631
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:45.050
Just fucking laugh and tell the stories and uh,
to Rosa was down and we had,

632
00:38:45.051 --> 00:38:47.620
it was a great time,
you know,
and I got to go to work tomorrow,

633
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:50.620
so let me read these things in a minute.
Go.
This was fun.

634
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.180
I'm going to go have a Taco.
I'm all right.
I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay.

635
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.930
Thank you for blank.
We have a wonderful addition of our home game.
For you.

636
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.940
I think you got it.
I think you actually got the two right in the end.
Um,

637
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.840
all right,
here's somebody else.
I'm late to the party with on Youtube,

638
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:11.110
but I'm sure I'm not the only one,
right?
Isn't that a song?

639
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.200
I'm not the,

640
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.490
I'm not the only one with mixed emotions.

641
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.810
Um,
you guys seen this kid that just,
it's,

642
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.500
it's fucking hilarious.
I feel bad cause he's,
he's got some sort of issue,

643
00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:27.730
but like he just,

644
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.920
he just fucking goes around and he tells people this,
this Charlie,
uh,

645
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.000
is it Zell enough?

646
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.430
He just fucking goes into gyms and tells people that he's the greatest.

647
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.600
And he goes,
let's spar and they have no fucking clue.
You know,

648
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:46.480
he just goes in and he fights in accounting and the cow and just kind of puts

649
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:50.000
his gloves on and this kid swings for the fences and fucking knocks out an

650
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:52.720
accountant and turns around and could see that one punch,

651
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.870
knock down an accountant deck.
And he's like,
that guy was a marine.

652
00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:59.170
He talked to all the shit.
He actually started calling up professional fighters.

653
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.620
And I was surprised that some of them actually took time out of their day to

654
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:04.270
fight the guy.
And uh,

655
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.010
I mean at some of the most compelling shit I've ever seen a,

656
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:12.670
granted they have like 74,000 hits,
219,000 hits,

657
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.550
105,000 hits.
So once again,

658
00:40:15.551 --> 00:40:19.810
I'm sure you're just finding out about it now.
Yes.
Yes I am.

659
00:40:19.811 --> 00:40:22.420
Have you watched the youtube video that it just shows how the fucking

660
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:25.720
differential works out the fuck.
Did you miss that?
Oh,
that's right.

661
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:30.130
Cause you don't have time to watch all of it.
All right.
So if you get a chance,

662
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.360
watch this kid.
Uh,
Charlie's Zellen off.
Um,

663
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.170
oh my God,
he's got the flip phone and he just calls.

664
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:40.210
This guy keeps calling this guy a fucking clown.

665
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.540
I don't know a lot about like people's like names and shit,

666
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:48.340
but I will say this about the kid.
He's got the fucking balls to go in there,
man.

667
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.290
I wouldn't do that.
Anybody can call up a professional boxer.
It talks shit.

668
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:57.190
But to actually show up for the fucking match.
Um,

669
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.130
I dunno,
he fought like he flood fuck Floyd Mayweather senior

670
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.980
and then he was losing.
So he stepped out of the,
uh,

671
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.880
stepped out of the fucking ring and then step back in and tried to sucker punch

672
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:18.220
the guy and then somebody jumped in like bare knuckle,
beat him down.
It was just,

673
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.880
it's insane.
Anyway,
she got it.
You got to watch it.
Charlie's Zellen off.

674
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.160
I'll spell it.
I'll spell it for you.
A.
Z.
E.
L.
E.
N.
O.
F.
F.

675
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.000
I hope he doesn't get hurt and I hope he doesn't hurt anybody.
And uh,
but he's,

676
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:36.680
he talks shit like,
who's that fucking will forte character.

677
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.330
Um,
Calhoun.
What the fuck was his first name?

678
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.860
We will forte

679
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.020
Calhoun.
Tim Calhoon.
Um,
Tim Calvin,
I,

680
00:41:49.021 --> 00:41:52.550
Tim Yellen think that we should sell the statue of Liberty.

681
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.730
He talks shit like that.
He's on the phone going,
you're fucking clown.

682
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.860
I'm gonna come down there.
I'm the greatest of all time.

683
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.520
Even been duck me for years.
You fucking clown.
And he never raises it up.

684
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:03.540
It's like,
it's some of the best shit talk.

685
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:05.930
And I've heard just as far as like a unique style.

686
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:08.630
So I got to give it up for that.
But it's definitely a,

687
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:11.590
some of the more bizarre shit that you're gonna Watch.
Um,

688
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.190
which of course sent me down a rabbit hole of watching people fight.

689
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.000
And I saw the bus driver that throws the upper cut at that girl who's fucking

690
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:23.060
screaming at him.
And A,
I know you're not supposed to hit a woman,

691
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:25.330
but in defense of him,
he led with an uppercut.

692
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:27.680
And I watched what happened when Buster Douglas did that.

693
00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:32.030
So in a way I thought that that was a gentleman he move before he grabbed her by

694
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:33.530
her hair and threw her off the bus.

695
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.790
I know the things that I find entertaining.
I know I'm out of my mind.
All right.

696
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.580
Poland,
everybody.
I got,
I got,
I got a letter from Poland.

697
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.880
Hey you freckled face fucker.

698
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:52.070
Why I want you to come to Poland is beautiful and we have great alcohol.
Um,

699
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.320
I would love to go there.

700
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.000
You know what the fuck I live on cause I live on the other side of the world.

701
00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:00.800
And you're the first guy that's asked me to go there.

702
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:03.860
Maybe I've had like maybe three emails.
I'll go there.

703
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.960
I'll stand there in front of five year Charles Bronson.
Look a motherfuckers,

704
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.380
I'll stand over there in front of you.
You know,

705
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:12.980
I don't give a shit or do you got nice beaches up north and there's a nice town

706
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:17.120
down south.
I Dunno about Warsaw.
I don't know what's going on there.

707
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.560
You guys still have horses in your army of you fucking updated.
Just Shit.

708
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:23.990
You know you can get still.
They live next to Germany.
You know,

709
00:43:23.991 --> 00:43:28.340
you've got to watch out for those cuts.
I was,
that was a cheap shot.
All right,

710
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.440
it's beautiful.
And we have alcohol.
All right,
just a question.

711
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:35.380
When will you come to the fucking Saudi or to the fucking Saudi Arabia or Dubai

712
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.800
or Kuwait?
Um,
I dunno when they like us,

713
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.340
I'm not going over there and getting kidnapped and get my head sawed off on

714
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:49.400
fucking youtube aids.

715
00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:52.910
Bill Berg just checking in on you and they fucking,
you know,
you'd have to,

716
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.170
you'd have to say something.

717
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.950
No you couldn't because they need to worry that they do something even worse to

718
00:43:57.951 --> 00:44:01.100
you.
I wait to write it as they got through the juggler.

719
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.900
Oh Man.
I would find,
yeah,
do a quick little filly set on,
uh,

720
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.600
just say everything that would piss him off,
which I would say what I know,

721
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.390
you know what I would be,
I'd be rocking and crying.
I'd be,
I'd be a bitch.

722
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.340
How the fuck do you just sit there waiting for them?

723
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:19.340
You saw your fucking head off.
Like I know that doesn't happen in Saudi Arabia,

724
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:21.410
but you know,
if you steal something in Saudi Arabia,

725
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.100
they chop your fucking arm off.
You know,
I don't need that pressure,

726
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.030
you know,
I don't fucking need that.
Some,

727
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.730
we just could just throw something stolen in your bag because they stole it.

728
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:36.510
Next thing you know,
I'm going to Chop Chop Square right?
Granted,

729
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.570
I don't know shit about any of these countries.
All I know is that we've,

730
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:41.940
we've thrown enough rocks at the beehive over there.

731
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:46.500
I don't feel like going over there and getting stung.
It said,
right.
Do by,
yeah.

732
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.450
I'd love to go to Dubai where they got a full,

733
00:44:48.451 --> 00:44:52.710
they got slave labor that built the whole fucking thing and they confiscated

734
00:44:52.711 --> 00:44:55.830
their passports and the number one cause of death with him,
his suicide.

735
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.630
I can't go there and support that shit dead.
Oh,
fucking city.
It looks like,
uh,

736
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.810
like the Kardashians designed it.
It's beyond fucking cheesy.

737
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:08.430
We've got the tallest building in the word Delia,
Kuwait.

738
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:11.370
I got no problem with that.
Saudi Arabia scares me.
Dubai,

739
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.690
when you start paying the people that build the skyscrapers,
I'll go there.
And,

740
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:19.770
uh,
Kuwait,
uh,
you know,
I don't know.
I mean,

741
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:22.770
you guys should kind of like us,
right?
We helped you out in the early nineties.

742
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.810
Well then we,
I dunno,
I have no idea that part of the world scares me.

743
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.280
I've connected in Dubai when I was coming back from Mumbai,
India.

744
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.880
But I just hear all these horrible stories that they promise all these people,

745
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:40.950
um,
in Asia that you're going to come over there,
there's all these jobs,

746
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:43.290
you're going to make all this money and then they come over and they confiscate

747
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:46.860
their passports and they don't let them fucking leave.
And A,

748
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:50.790
they see no way out and they killed themselves.
I don't know if that's true.

749
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:54.150
I don't know if it was that or if that was at Walmart.
I forget.
All right.
Hey,

750
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:59.100
Billy funk face.
There's no guitar in that Herbie Hancock Album,
the bass player,

751
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:04.020
the bass is played by Herbie on a synth and Paul Jackson,
the basis,

752
00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.560
uh,
plays the guitar line on the Higher Register.

753
00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:11.010
The base I never fucking knew that.
Love the podcast and stand up.
Let's jam some,

754
00:46:11.011 --> 00:46:15.790
see that I made funny.
And then what did you do?
Your taught me something.
Um,

755
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.450
all right.
X men and sexism.
Hey B is for bill.

756
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.990
I haven't seen the billboard Rose McGowan is upset about,

757
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.630
and I agree with your assessment on the situation,

758
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:32.430
but I think you miss characterize the effect of displays of male dominance over

759
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:35.730
women.
I mischaracterized it.

760
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.180
Is that a word?
Um,

761
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:42.600
it's not that someone sees a picture of a man choking out a woman that thinks

762
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:46.500
it's okay and then goes and does it himself rather.

763
00:46:46.501 --> 00:46:50.790
It's like a piece of a puzzle.
It's just one of these fucking agenda people.

764
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:54.690
Again,
a guy sees a picture of a man choking out a woman.

765
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.600
Then he sees a picture of a man yelling at a woman.

766
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:02.520
Then he sees a picture of a woman being backhanded by a man.
You get the point,

767
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.780
you see how they do this.

768
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:07.110
You see how he just led me across the fucking river to his side?

769
00:47:07.111 --> 00:47:10.380
Like I'm that fucking stupid.
No,
I don't get your point.

770
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:16.080
This is what I understand.
A kid fucking sees his parents.
Okay?

771
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:19.650
If the dad beats the shit out of his mom his entire fucking childhood,

772
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.600
I understand that.
He'll either not do it or totally fucking do it.

773
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.560
I understand that.

774
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:28.710
But this whole fucking thing that you see images and then you do shit.

775
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.000
Okay.
I watched the fucking racing car was red bull on it all day today.
I,

776
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:35.980
there's no fucking way I will ever drink.
It.

777
00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:38.740
Certainly would not put it in with some vodka ever.

778
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.630
I have no desire to ever drink that fucking drink.
Uh,

779
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:46.660
human beings are way more fucking complex.
Then the,
uh,
the,

780
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:50.320
the,
the cartoon version,
you know what I mean?
Like when,

781
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:54.220
when people have meltdowns and people film it and then like,

782
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.720
you know,
people would just,
oh,
he did that then therefore he is that.

783
00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.380
It's just people are way more complex than that and you don't just see a picture

784
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:05.830
of this and then see somebody yelling at this person and blah,
blah blah.
Oh,

785
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:10.150
that's all it,
it just takes billboards and TV shows and then all of,

786
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.630
all of the way that I was raised goes out the window.

787
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.990
I can tell you this,
sir.
All right.

788
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:21.991
With your little fucking Fisher price fucking point here that you're making is

789
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.790
when I was a kid,

790
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:29.650
the amount of violent fucking movies I watched all the Friday the 13th I watched

791
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:32.970
all the fucking a nightmare on elm street's.

792
00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.070
I watched all the Halloween's Halloween three one of the worst fucking movies,

793
00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:38.890
our season of the witch.
I watched all of those things.

794
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.010
I saw scar face when I was like,
what the fuck?

795
00:48:42.011 --> 00:48:46.600
Although 15 I saw all of that shit.
Okay,

796
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.970
and I can tell you this,
I never went out and killed somebody.

797
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.750
So explain that to me.
I never hit a woman.
I never did any of that,

798
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.513
so,

799
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:55.923
<v 0>okay.</v>

800
00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.590
<v 1>I just,
it's,
I don't agree with that.
I don't agree with that.
I,
having said that,</v>

801
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.930
I agreed with them saying that,
you know,
you could,

802
00:49:03.931 --> 00:49:06.750
could've picked a better picture.
You know what I mean?

803
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.060
I just looked at the picture.
I was like,
I don't want,

804
00:49:08.061 --> 00:49:12.360
I don't want to see when we get choked.
I don't want to see that,

805
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:14.690
you know?
I don't want to look at that.

806
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.530
Fast forward to where she breaks out of the choke.
Hold that.

807
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.500
I'd like to see that.
Um,
anyway,
so let's continue on with this.

808
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.670
You get the point.

809
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:25.780
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

810
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.960
<v 1>I fucking,
I,
I can't,
I can't stand people.
All right.
After a while,</v>

811
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.200
the man sees the overall picture that our culture condones dominance over women.

812
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:38.020
It's a piece of the larger cultural trend.

813
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.540
This is literally paint by numbers like this is,

814
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:44.920
this is all the shit that you see on TV.

815
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.490
This type of thing happened a lot in old movies.

816
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:53.730
Just watch any Humphrey Bogart movie movies can play a huge part in reinforcing

817
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:58.960
gender inequality and Co in a culture.
Can I ask you a question dude?

818
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.000
Or a lady?
Whoever the fuck this is itchy.

819
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.420
Do you ever see anything else in movies?

820
00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

821
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.580
<v 1>Do you ever see anything else in movies?</v>

822
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:10.700
Do you just see what the man does to the woman?

823
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.020
So what about now all these other movies,
you know,

824
00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.620
so then I guess you would then agree that the latest Mad Max was an anti man

825
00:50:22.221 --> 00:50:24.590
movie because I didn't see the movie.

826
00:50:24.591 --> 00:50:28.760
But evidently the Mad Max guy doesn't do anything and the woman takes the
reigns.

827
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:31.910
So judging that this is the way that you view x men,

828
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.590
then you must certainly see that the last mad max was obviously

829
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:38.260
<v 0>okay.</v>

830
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.420
<v 1>You know,
uh,
whatever.
Reverse misogynistic,
what is that fucking word for it?</v>

831
00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.660
But someone who hates men,
I always forget it because it's never used.

832
00:50:46.661 --> 00:50:50.020
It's never brought up.
It's just called being a strong woman.

833
00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.460
Hatred of men.

834
00:50:56.950 --> 00:51:01.820
Misandry I even if I'm saying it right,
am I s a n.
D.
R.
Y.
Um,

835
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.230
do you do see it as that?

836
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.100
I just don't think people are that simple.

837
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:13.360
I really believe that when someone is a little kid,

838
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.860
okay,
if they're a little kid and they're in your house and you're their parents,

839
00:51:17.861 --> 00:51:22.861
I really believe that whole thing that your words become their thoughts 100% I

840
00:51:23.411 --> 00:51:28.380
don't believe that people like you're with your kid every fucking day of your

841
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:30.460
kid's life up until when?

842
00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.550
I don't know the first time they go away for the first 10,

843
00:51:33.551 --> 00:51:37.990
12 years before they ship them off to camp.
Or even if you don't do that,

844
00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.380
you could basically be with them almost every fucking day of their life.

845
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.010
For the first 15 years of their life.
Okay.

846
00:51:45.011 --> 00:51:48.280
And you're telling me that movie,

847
00:51:48.281 --> 00:51:52.150
billboards and movies and that type of shit will undo

848
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:54.890
all of your parenting?

849
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.230
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

850
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.711
<v 1>I can look,</v>

851
00:51:56.711 --> 00:52:00.040
I can see some shit that you'll see a movie and it makes you want to go out and

852
00:52:00.041 --> 00:52:03.370
fucking,
you know,
play cowboys and Indians like we did.
You know?

853
00:52:03.371 --> 00:52:08.260
But I never really went out and fucking
killed anybody.
Right.

854
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.170
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't agree with that.
I don't know.

855
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.780
I understand that the images are bad and that type of shit.

856
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:17.250
I definitely get all of that.

857
00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:21.360
But the fact I can't make that leap that then it's all floating around in my

858
00:52:21.361 --> 00:52:22.470
head.
And next thing you know,

859
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:27.620
I punched my wife in the face and it's not because I'm a bad guy and had a bad

860
00:52:27.961 --> 00:52:28.794
father.

861
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:33.600
It's because I saw too many movie billboards in scenes in movies.

862
00:52:33.601 --> 00:52:38.460
I teach this to make,
to give movies that level of fucking power.

863
00:52:38.461 --> 00:52:42.480
I,
I,
you know,
I don't know.
You want to fucking make me go get a beer?
Okay.

864
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.770
I'll go buy a candy bar.
But I just don't see myself,
you know,

865
00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.700
upper cut and some old lady in the food line because I saw the wrong movie.

866
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:54.300
Fucking billboard.
I,
I disagree with you.
Agree to disagree sir.

867
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.680
Or ma'am.
Alright.
Fiance's parents are evil.

868
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.390
Um,
but I can't do anything about.
All right.
Uh,

869
00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:07.640
so I'm getting married this month.
Super excited to marry the love of my life.

870
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:10.160
Congratulations by the whole experience.

871
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:13.730
But the whole experience is going to be awkward and weird because their parents

872
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:18.720
don't like me.
Uh,
in fact they hate me.
Oh,
Jesus.
Uh,

873
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.590
I'll not give you the whole what is,
she comes from money and you're done.

874
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:25.440
You're fucking Billy Joel.
You marry an uptown girl.
Huh?

875
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.400
You singing it in your garage?
Uh,
let's see.

876
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:31.710
I'll not give you the whole convoluted story,

877
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:34.650
but the upshot is that they're conservative upper class,

878
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:37.650
highly successful Latin American business types.

879
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.100
While I'm in Australia and middle class left the arts graduate.

880
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:45.450
I knew they came from money.
Anyway,
we've been together for almost a decade now.

881
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:50.190
And even though I know they've said horrible things about me behind my back and

882
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.500
tried to talk her into leaving me numerous times,

883
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.970
they've always been pleasant to my face.
Oh,
that's even worse.
That said,

884
00:53:56.971 --> 00:54:00.270
there were a few years there where they didn't talk to either of us after we

885
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:04.740
told them we wouldn't baptize the hypothetic or children.
We still don't have.

886
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:06.380
<v 4>Okay.</v>

887
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.240
<v 1>Uh,
but we,
we don't mention that.</v>

888
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.453
<v 4>Okay,</v>

889
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:14.710
<v 1>so you guys are agnostic or something.
I don't know.
Basically,</v>

890
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.130
it's going to kill me to have to look at,

891
00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:21.030
at their stupid fucking heads on my wedding day.
Uh,

892
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.940
we only invited them out of a sense of obligation,
but now it's hitting home.

893
00:54:24.941 --> 00:54:27.220
Then I'm actually going to be part of this family now.

894
00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.570
What I need is a longterm plan of attack to survive the next few decades until

895
00:54:31.571 --> 00:54:34.390
they shuffle,
shuffle off this mortal coil.

896
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.830
I know living a happy life with their daughter should all should be all the

897
00:54:38.831 --> 00:54:41.770
revenge I need.
But if you saw her father's face,

898
00:54:41.771 --> 00:54:43.780
you'd want to give him the old right there,
Fred,

899
00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:48.430
to guess I need some kind of middle ground.
Any advice?
Uh,

900
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.520
Fanton nuts.
I don't even know what that means.
Go Fuck Yourself.

901
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:55.270
Come to Australia.
You mentioned that some sort of red nut over there.

902
00:54:55.271 --> 00:54:56.104
I have no idea.

903
00:54:56.570 --> 00:54:57.470
<v 4>MMM.</v>

904
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.620
<v 1>Oh,
Joe Barnett just texted me.
Said smiling like the butcher's dog.</v>

905
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.180
Um,
good for him.
All right.
Uh,

906
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:08.820
any advice,
uh,

907
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:11.490
the most important thing that you said there is that you're realizing that

908
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:14.310
you're marrying into this family and,
uh,

909
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:19.370
that is something that you never really fucking think about enough.

910
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.860
I don't think enough people do until you got,
Yup.
Just picture,

911
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:27.720
this person is going to hold your child someday and want to take the kid to a

912
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:28.554
ball game.

913
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.443
<v 4>MMM.</v>

914
00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.950
<v 1>You know,
or whatever.
So there's,
there,
there is that,
but uh,</v>

915
00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:38.860
I dunno,
the only way to do it,
I w there's one way to do,

916
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:43.390
you could just try to kill the guy with kindness or he could just sit down and

917
00:55:43.391 --> 00:55:46.960
look at the guy and just say,
look,
man,
whose kid?
No,
I know you don't like me.

918
00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:51.490
I know you're just being polite.
A lot of,
you know,

919
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.580
respect for your daughter or whatever,
but you don't,

920
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:57.340
you don't have to be nice to me anymore.
You know,

921
00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.070
we can see each other on the holidays or whatever.

922
00:56:00.071 --> 00:56:02.590
Anytime you want to come off or what?
I don't say that.
Don't see,

923
00:56:02.591 --> 00:56:05.620
you don't want to come over.
Uh,
Jesus,

924
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.430
that would drive me nuts if the guy was being phony nice to me,

925
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.270
I would at some point,
you know,
have to say to the guy that listened.
He didn't,

926
00:56:13.271 --> 00:56:16.210
you don't,
maybe it's just say that.
Go out golfing with a guy and just say,

927
00:56:16.211 --> 00:56:17.044
listen man,

928
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:20.470
I don't want to be any more of a thorn in your side than I already am.

929
00:56:20.471 --> 00:56:24.460
Just know that you don't have to pretend to like,
okay,

930
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.070
then me just fucking walks off the first tee.

931
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:33.400
Um,
I gotta be honest with you,
dude,
I don't know what to tell these.

932
00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:37.510
These are tough ones,
man.
This is really fucking,
how close do you live to them?

933
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.020
That's another one.
You know,

934
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:46.240
if you guys live a state away and you only see him three,
four times a year,

935
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:50.470
you can tough out a couple of weekends,
you know what I mean?
However,

936
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:54.490
if,
um,
you know,

937
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:58.060
if they live right down the fucking street,
you know,

938
00:56:58.061 --> 00:57:01.360
and then they don't approve of you and then you have a kid and then they're

939
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:04.170
going to question how you bringing it up and they're already getting involved

940
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.210
there already.
I can tell you this,
they're already way too fucking involved.

941
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:09.490
All right?
This is the deal.

942
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:13.330
You can say whatever the fuck you want about whoever your kids dating until they

943
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:16.840
get married.
Once they get fucking married,
you've got to back off,
you know,

944
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:21.050
unless it's obviously something horrible,
the persons,
one person's abused,

945
00:57:21.051 --> 00:57:23.800
abusing the other person,
but like they got it back the fuck off.

946
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.800
So maybe you've got to have that conversation.
Just be like,
listen,

947
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.120
I know you don't like me,

948
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:31.960
but I love your daughter and she loves me and we got married,

949
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:36.610
so you need to deal with that.
Yeah.
Fuck him.
Yeah,
he needed to deal with it.

950
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.960
We got married.
All right,

951
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:41.470
so I don't need you coming over here giving me the fucking stink face in my own

952
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:45.880
house.
All right.
You already did it.
Once you do it again,

953
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:48.100
I'm going to take your head on a stick it right in the fucking ice box.

954
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.830
All right.
If I fucking had enough of you.
Yeah.
Fuck this guy.

955
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.970
I have no good advice for this for you,
sir.
I don't know what to tell you.

956
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:59.230
I just hope it works out.
But uh,
don't take any shit from the guy.

957
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:05.080
And when it comes to you and your wife,
I would just make jokes about it.
Um,

958
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:08.890
you know,
I'd be like,
Hey,
you know,
I'm going to go hang out with your dad today.

959
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.990
She like,
really?
No,
he hates me.
Remember whenever,
you know,
just keep it late.

960
00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.860
Um,
but don't joke about it too much,
cause then she'll say,

961
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:18.820
but it really bothered me,

962
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.750
sir.
Um,
I think you're going to be okay,
but I'm not.

963
00:58:26.751 --> 00:58:29.300
I'd be lying to you for like seven if I didn't tell you that.

964
00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:33.500
17% of me thinks that you're really fucking stepping into some shit here,

965
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:38.360
but you know what?
Everybody who gets married does so good luck to you.

966
00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.090
Good luck to you,
but don't take any shit from that guy.

967
00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:45.920
I think he can get to the mom.
You can get something.
You can Scharmer.
Right.

968
00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:49.250
I bet you can charm her.
And once women have more forgiving,
right?

969
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:51.950
Until they're not,
and then they'll fucking kill you and you sleep.

970
00:58:51.951 --> 00:58:55.100
But generally speaking,
they're fucking more forgiving.
And I think if they just,

971
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.110
if she really sees the love between the two year,

972
00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.380
she could back off and then that's what you do is what you do.

973
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:04.880
You divide and conquer.
Fuck him.
All right.
I think I'm on it.
Some fuck that guy.

974
00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:08.600
Make,
make her mom love you.
All right.
That's it.

975
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.960
And then she'll start nagging at him and he'll either go one or two ways.

976
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:15.440
He'll either given and eventually like you or to heal.

977
00:59:15.441 --> 00:59:18.530
It'll fucking eat him up and will die sooner.
All right.

978
00:59:18.531 --> 00:59:22.520
Jesus had to go all the way to their bill.
It didn't like it did.
All right,

979
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:27.780
last one.
Here we go.
Dating an older guy.
Oh geesh.
Hey Bill.

980
00:59:27.781 --> 00:59:32.180
I'm a 22 year old female from Slovenia,
Slovenia,
modal.

981
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:35.820
Thank you for the podcast.
It makes me laugh out loud.
Uh,

982
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.540
which not many things can do.
That's fucking great.

983
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.760
I would love to go over there at some point.

984
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:43.910
Also that Eastern European tour is gonna fucking happen.

985
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.270
I just have to have time in my schedule.
Um,

986
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:52.490
because all of those countries I've never been to from fucking Lithuania and

987
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:54.170
fucking a story,
whatever the fuck.

988
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:58.820
And then other one is up there all the way down through Romania and backup.

989
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.170
All I know is,

990
01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:04.910
is if I can fucking somehow get over and then see all those countries get a

991
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:08.000
bunch of different stamps on my passport,
I'm into that shit.

992
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:12.080
Plus every one of those places like Prague or something has all those art deco,

993
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:15.140
all that art deco furniture that all the places over here,

994
01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:19.560
they order it from for nothing and then Jack it up over here.
What do I do?

995
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.670
Buy a desk over there and then ship it fucking around the world.
Like,

996
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:27.530
I'm going to save any money.
That's a stupid idea.
Anyways,
I'm 22 years of,

997
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:29.690
Oh,
okay.
I would love to hear you taking my situation.

998
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:34.430
I'm a university student and I play sports professionally here in Slovenia.

999
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.130
Uh,
keeping busy,
working out about eight times a week.

1000
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:41.870
My first coach since I was like 12 years old,
is now my really close friend.

1001
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.060
Oh my God,
his name is Ann Woody.
Is it?
Uh,

1002
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.300
he's since moved on to cow coach internationally.

1003
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.780
I almost said couch coaching internationally,
but we still keep in touch.

1004
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.350
He knows me from when I was a little girl and he used to always tell me I was

1005
01:00:57.351 --> 01:00:59.330
like his younger sister,
but I,

1006
01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.100
but recently I noticed he switched his approach grouse.

1007
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:08.750
He's a 35 year old single guy.
Oh my God.
The fucking red flags.

1008
01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:10.550
I can barely see the type here anymore.

1009
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.560
And he only comes to Sylvania and July through August we were always able to

1010
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:16.640
talk for hours,

1011
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:20.870
tell failed attempts at dating to each other and generally get along better than

1012
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:23.510
I have ever gotten along with anybody in my life so far.

1013
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:27.590
He's always make me laugh,
complements my personality and how good I look,

1014
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.920
but never in a creepy or disturbing way.
Okay.
All right.

1015
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:35.810
My experience with guys my age was never like that.

1016
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.330
I'm not trying to say I'm too mature for them,

1017
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:42.830
but I would always compare them to him and they would mostly bore me and

1018
01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:45.830
connection was never there as much as it is with him.

1019
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.260
I feel like boys my age are pushovers.

1020
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:52.160
At least those I had experiences with and I feel they couldn't offer me

1021
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:57.650
interrelationship more than this older guy offers me and just a friendship.
Uh,

1022
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.951
yeah.

1023
01:01:57.951 --> 01:02:02.951
And also when you're 35 this guy's going to be 50 so there's also that and then

1024
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:07.340
you're still going to want to go out and he's going to be ready for nap time.
So,

1025
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:11.510
uh,
no that too.

1026
01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.030
And he's 35 he's almost side of the leak if you're an athlete,

1027
01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:14.451
you know what I mean?

1028
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:17.960
35 that's when he got to start taking the illegal drug drugs,
you know,

1029
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:23.190
to hang around for an extra couple seasons.
Right.
Anyways,
she says.
Anyways,

1030
01:02:23.191 --> 01:02:27.090
we are hanging out a lot during this summer and I feel more and more vibes and

1031
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:30.390
attempts from him.
He takes me out to eat and drink.

1032
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.700
He is always asking me somewhere I,
I,
I know he's putting the moves on me.

1033
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:40.080
My issue is that I,
now I know we are in different stages of our lives.

1034
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.130
I know he wants to get married and have children to fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy.

1035
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:48.090
Fuck this guy.
You're 22.
You got the whole life ahead of you.

1036
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:52.440
When the fuck did he start hitting on you then?
Now this isn't fair.

1037
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:55.050
This is like shooting fish in a barrel.
You've known him since he was,

1038
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:59.340
you were 12 no,
no,
no,
no.
Stay away from this guy.

1039
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.480
This is how I know this guy's a creep because even I wouldn't do this.

1040
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.280
Okay.
Fucking walk away,
sir.

1041
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:15.830
Stand down.
I most certainly am not ready for anything like that.
Uh,
children,

1042
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.420
all that shit.
She's saying,
I like to go.
I like to drink,

1043
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:23.280
go out my friends getting compliments from guys all to soothe myself.
Esteem,

1044
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:25.650
which is not fully developed yet.
Exactly.

1045
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:30.000
I'm still finding myself and I know you will interpret this as I want to fuck

1046
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:32.880
around.
No I don't,
but this is not really the case.

1047
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:36.990
I actually want to find a right person and fall in love.
Well,

1048
01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:39.120
you're very mature for your age.
Actually.
22.

1049
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:43.410
I'm dodging his attempts and usually laugh him off when he puts the moves on me.

1050
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.010
Get away from this guy.
I don't want to read this,
this making me uncomfortable,

1051
01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.020
Yadda Yadda,
Yadda,
Yadda,
Yadda Yadda.
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck this shit.

1052
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:55.500
Fuck this.
She said,
sorry if that was hard to read.
My English is a little rustic.

1053
01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.580
English is tremendous.
Um,
yeah.
Stay away from this guy.
All right.
Um,

1054
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.090
I can't even,
it was,

1055
01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:07.090
that was so disturbing to me that I can't remember if he's still currently your

1056
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:12.330
coach.
Um,
anyways,
a film.
What vibes.
Wait,
wait,
wait.

1057
01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:15.420
Where the fuck is this thing?
I got to find my first coach since I was 12.

1058
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.500
He says,
move on to coats internationally,
but we still keep in touch.
All right.

1059
01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:23.430
I don't know when the fuck he moved on.
Uh,
but what it was he,
he,
he's,

1060
01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.750
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Fuck that.
All right.
Listen,

1061
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.970
this is what you got to hold on to.
Okay.

1062
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:32.760
The fact that you feel the way that you do when you're 22 years old,

1063
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:35.730
there is somebody out there your age that is like you.

1064
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:40.650
And if it was easy to go out and find love,
everybody would find it.

1065
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.880
All right?
But the problem is,
is you know,
you gotta,

1066
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:48.450
you gotta go through a bunch of mistakes first.
All right?

1067
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:52.050
So,
um,
I don't know you,
I don't know him,

1068
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:55.170
but this is not the person you're going to settle down.
Don't,

1069
01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:58.350
don't fucking do this.
Don't do it all right?

1070
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.780
He's got way,

1071
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:04.950
way too much of a mental advantage on you at 35 and 22 and he could really

1072
01:05:04.951 --> 01:05:06.680
fucking hurt.
Yeah.
Um,

1073
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.750
I say you deal with the fact that you find guys your age are not mature and,

1074
01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:13.950
um,
you're gonna run into somebody who is,

1075
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.100
you sound like you're really good looking and you're into sports,
right?

1076
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:19.780
You're getting these compliments when you go out.

1077
01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:23.770
So you probably have like these fucking,
a Yolo Douche is hitting on you,

1078
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:28.210
which you need.
You know what you need.
You need a nerd.
I think you need a nerd.

1079
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.990
Go find some fucking kid that likes to read,
you know,

1080
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:34.300
so he probably has an idea to build an APP.

1081
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:36.820
Whatever these fucking kids are doing,
that's what you want to do.

1082
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.940
You know when I go fuck around with your 35 year old creepy.
He are.

1083
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:45.460
I really want to get married and have kids.
Oh.
Dilia though.
Yet.

1084
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:49.000
That's why you hitting on a 22 year old you piece of shit there.
Fuck that guy.

1085
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.420
Fuck that guy.
All right.
Uh,
I would uh,
yeah,

1086
01:05:53.421 --> 01:05:55.680
stick with people your own roughly your own h.
All right.

1087
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.450
And that's coming from an older creep like me.
So you know,
it's good advice.

1088
01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.540
All right,
that's the podcast for this week.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
And uh,

1089
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.740
congratulations to a Pittsburgh penguins fans.
And you know what?

1090
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:09.790
Also the San Jose Shark fans,
they know I've been there plenty of times.

1091
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.200
Seeing the Bruins lose and finals to all those great Edmonton teams.
Um,

1092
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.810
so my condolences,
but hey,

1093
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.170
you actually got to the finals and you've got a great team to build on.
Um,

1094
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:24.850
and that's it.
One down,
one to go,
the NBA ends.
And,
uh,

1095
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.550
I guess I'll start watching a little bit of baseball,
but I'm,

1096
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.580
I think I'm going to stick with the Formula One racing until I get to football

1097
01:06:30.581 --> 01:06:33.520
season.
We'll see what's up.
All right.
That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

1098
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:35.170
Then I'll check ed idea on Thursday.
