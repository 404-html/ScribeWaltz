1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,770
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,680
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,790
just checking it on Ya.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,740
I'm checking in on you
because I give a fuck. Right.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,020
I care about you. Oh, who's the
freckled content gives a fuck.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,030
I do. Um, how's your week going?
Everything going good with you.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,600
I hope it is. Um, oh freckles.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,990
The pasty old fucking man.
48 years old.

9
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,130
My back feels better than it has since
that since I don't know when, um,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,040
just been going to the chiropractor and
get in this fucking the shit beat out of

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,820
me in a massage. This
is finally a, I dunno,

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,590
it's fucking great.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,550
I guess my spine was compressed
and twisted that for,

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,590
for decades. So, you know,

15
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,550
after having professionals beat the shit
out of me for like weekly for like the

16
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:07,110
last since May, I guess. Um,
I dunno. I think I finally,

17
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:11,700
I undid, they undid it or whatever.
But now, like when I go to stretch,

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,760
when I go to a, you know,
you know the whole thing,

19
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,940
you lay on your back and this young people
won't know this because they just get

20
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,310
up off the couch and start running.
They're fine because they're young,

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,590
but old people, you know that
she lay on the floor, right?

22
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,430
You get down on the floor, right?
You make that noise and you keep

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,890
going down and getting up.
It's the same noise. Ah, right.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,420
You get down on the fucking ground and
then you bring one of your knees up to

25
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,470
your chest,
right?

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,380
And then you bring it over to one side
and then you have your arms sticking up.

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,243
You know,

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,970
like almost like you're doing like some
sort of old timey football move right.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,910
High stepping over somebody.
But when I do that on the ground now,

30
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:50,400
I just bring that over in my back.

31
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,270
Just cracks from the lower back to
about three quarters of the way up.

32
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,280
And that never used to,
I wouldn't crack at all.

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,860
It was just all fucking jammed in there.
And um,

34
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,220
I feel good man.
I've been working out,

35
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:06,450
I won't spend eating like a fucking
animal though. Went to a barbecue Sunday,

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,690
so that's all she wrote with
that. Right. And I did a show,

37
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,650
so ate barbecue and then I also fucking
eight in a comedy club, Green Room.

38
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,280
And I was working down there
and how most at the, uh,

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,910
the comedy and Magic Club and um,

40
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,780
which is really fucking cool to go down
there now because whenever I look at the

41
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:28,740
pier, I'm like, that's the
thing I fly over. Right? But
you know, as I'm coming down,

42
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,090
you know,
there's the,

43
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:33,330
the hormone [inaudible] beach pier
and then Manhattan Beach Pier.

44
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,000
When you get to that one, you gotta
be down around like, you know,

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,380
like 300 feet. And that's when
you call lax and say, Hey,

46
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,100
I want to fucking skedaddles underneath
the fucking jets there. Right.

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,270
And I never knew what any of that shit. I
didn't have a new way. The beaches where

48
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,310
this redheaded cutting,
where the beaches are.

49
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,180
The only reason why I know where the
beaches are is so I know how to drive in

50
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,230
the opposite direction.

51
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,660
I fucking hate the beach.
I fucking,

52
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,070
oh my God,
I hate the beach.

53
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,280
I love the fucking beautiful brown
people that go there, you know,

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,660
10 and themselves up. God bless you. I
sit there like the boy in the bubble,

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
you know,

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,400
and one of those Ford Astros with the
slide and fucking door with the AC on

57
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,400
looking out like the boy in
the bubble. Right? Um, I,

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,850
I fucking hate it. I get there.
It's hot as fuck. It's boring.

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,520
I'm terrified to go in the ocean.
I'm not fucking going in there.

60
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,710
It's Goddamn sea monsters and
they're going to fucking grab you.

61
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,960
You know what? A bunch of 80, we're
kind of a fucking moron. I just,

62
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:44,140
I'll never get over there at the fact that
people just swim in the fucking ocean.

63
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,250
And Ella was a shark attack
today. Yeah. You know, it's funny.

64
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,430
Somebody goes to the fucking zoo and they,

65
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,290
they crawl into the fucking
cage and he'd get attacked.

66
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:58,000
Everybody's general consensus.
Consensus is yes, it's a tragedy. And

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,050
what'd you think was going to happen?
You know,

68
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,150
you go to the beach and you
go into the fucking ocean,

69
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,520
everybody acts like it's a big city.
Like it's a big surprise.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
How did that happen?
I can't believe it.

71
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,200
You went into an unnatural environment,
right?

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,170
And it's something where there was a
bunch of shit there that could kill you in

73
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,070
something. Did or took a chunk out
of you, took a fucking bite Audi,

74
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:25,690
if you know when you've come stumbling
out of there. I don't know why.

75
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,710
It just makes me think of an unfinished,
the Gar when somebody gets bit right.

76
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,960
You know what? I went to
this fucking party, right?

77
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,180
And I brought in Sony for my birthday,

78
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,510
had got me this really
incredible box of cigars.

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,660
So I,
uh,

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,550
I immediately call all my friends
because, you know, or whatever. It's like,

81
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,270
because I'm not going to smoke all 10
of these fucking things. First of all,

82
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,540
that's not what cigar smoking. It's about.
It's a social thing, right? And secondly,

83
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,420
I don't want to smoke all of them because
I'm trying to keep the habit at bay.

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,800
All right. Special occasions
once to twice a month. Right?

85
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,030
So I brought it over there and there
was a bunch of hover and [inaudible] who

86
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,841
all showed up.

87
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:09,400
Everybody acting like they're fucking
cigar smokers and some handing them out to

88
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,590
these people,
I don't fucking know.

89
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,380
And I turned my back and
like 15 minutes later,

90
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,450
like three of them had been stomped out.
They like, they weren't even halfway done

91
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,070
fucking idiots anyway. So then
I just, I figured that's, yeah,

92
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,510
you get bit by a shark. You know,
he'd come in, it takes like, you know,

93
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,680
the bottom 30 you off and
you come out like a, like a
fucking unfinished. The gar.

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,560
No, I don't fucking know. It made sense
to me visually. That's what I thought of.

95
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,910
They're not all going to beat Jess.
Relax. This podcast doesn't even count.

96
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:47,080
This is me just checking in on
you. Oh, Billy back brace. Huh?

97
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,330
I took it off like fucking Forrest Gump.
I actually feel like I could run,

98
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,530
the only downside to my back feeling as
great as it does right now is I have to

99
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:03,170
fight myself from doing
something really stupid. Um,

100
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,150
but uh, but has always, I was psyched.
I didn't have to use any drugs.

101
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,010
I stayed away from all of that shit.

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,550
And it reminded me of that guy
when I used to watch that doc,

103
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,460
the doctor drew show,
the celebrity Rehab,

104
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:20,420
and there was that guy from taxi who since
passed away and he kind of got hooked

105
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,320
on painkillers and shit. He's
always bitch about his back. And a,

106
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:27,950
I remember I had, for whatever reason,
I was just thinking about that. Go, man,

107
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,980
I wish that guy went to a
fucking chiropractor, Mizzou.

108
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,610
So instead of going down the fucking
painkiller route, I don't know. Who knows?

109
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,440
He might have fucking done heroin first.

110
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,320
He might have fucked up
his back nod off on heroin,

111
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,330
although they tend to
stand pretty upright there,

112
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:45,110
but he keeps it back straight and
then their legs bent. I don't know.

113
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,760
But as always, I don't know what
the fuck's going on. Um, yeah.

114
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:54,410
So Monday night, Sunday night,
sorry, I went to, uh, went
to the comedy Magic Club,

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,850
uh, worked. And that's not an easy
road. It's not an easy room to do. Well,

116
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,670
and as those people have seen a
ton of fucking comedy, you know,

117
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,830
Jay Leno goes down there every Sunday so
they used to seeing the top notch shit.

118
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,560
So you know, if you go down there and
you have fast that you've got a bomb.

119
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,000
So it had,
I had a good set.

120
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,240
Fortunately I had something in
the middle of my set though I was,

121
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,670
I was leaning on the mic stand
and they had, and I had my,

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,450
my arm sorta like instead of
leaning on to how I usually do,

123
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,810
I had my arm up and something
was like pushing into my elbow.

124
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,700
And when my hand was like that,

125
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,510
I went to close my make a
fist and like my middle,

126
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,510
my index and my fucking
bring finger wouldn't close.

127
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,450
It was like in slow motion
really freaked me out.

128
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,900
I don't know what the Hell I did, but
what I'm basically telling you, people's,

129
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm falling apart. Um, but my
back feels good. So anyways,

130
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:46,400
so that was the first night
of me and like an asshole.

131
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,550
But I still work out every day
fucking crushing the elliptical.

132
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,450
I give it back at night,

133
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,840
a little bit fucking drink
here are fucking cheese stick,

134
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:58,760
whatever the fuck I have. Right?
But uh, then Monday last second,

135
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,220
a buddy of mine called me up and said,
hey,

136
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,860
sting and Peter Gabriel a playing at
the fucking Hollywood bull, right?

137
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,310
So I said, you know what, I bet
Vinnie call the UDAs playing drums.

138
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,520
I got to go see that.
That's like a bucket list.

139
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,890
He's one of my favorite
drummers of all fucking time.

140
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,770
And he's one of those guys
who just keeps getting better.

141
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,870
He's an absolute monster.
I mean,

142
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:25,871
the guy's like pushing 60 years old
and he could still like blow away young

143
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,930
drummers in the teens. You know what I
mean? A lot of young drummers just think,

144
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,910
you know, all the young guys are the
shit and they're all fucking flashy.

145
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,020
And then as guys get older, you know,
they stopped practicing or whatever.

146
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,370
He's one of the few fucking guys,
there was no dropoff.

147
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,880
He just kept getting better and better
and better and better. So I say,

148
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:48,170
fuck this, right? So I
called up somebody, you know,

149
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,260
who was in the know and I was like,
Hey, is Vinny playing tonight?

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,340
And they were like, they got back to
me and I was like, fuck, that was the,

151
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:57,030
that was the game right there. I was
like, I gotta go fucking see it, right?

152
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,590
So I go on the, uh, the hub of
the stub there, the old stub hub,

153
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,840
and just pay through the fucking nose,
get as close as I can.

154
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:07,380
So now I'm all fucking excited.
I'm all down low, right?

155
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,110
And I'm fucking going, oh my God. You look
at, they've got to drum kits up there.

156
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,410
I'm guessing Peter Gabriel's
going to open. Do is set,

157
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,810
then stings going to do with
fucking set. And then, uh,

158
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:22,920
in the end they're going to come out
and sing fucking Hava, Nagila, whatever.

159
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:26,040
They're gonna do some sort
of encore together, right?

160
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,380
The fucking show starts. Okay. And

161
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,090
there was so many fucking people on stage.
I didn't know what was going on.

162
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,180
And Peter Gabriel all of a sudden is like,
yeah,

163
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,930
you guys like right in front of us.
He sings one of his fucking, I dunno,

164
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,830
world music songs. It was amazing. And
his voice sounded fucking incredible.

165
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,880
And I'm like, okay, the Peter
Gabriel and his giant band here,

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,330
this giant ass fucking band,
but two drummers and shit is,

167
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,080
is going to fucking open and then
stinks going to come out and,

168
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,540
and get to see Vinny, right? He
finishes the first fucking song.

169
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,020
He walks offstage and then all
of a sudden sting just walks out.

170
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:08,580
Everybody's like, what the fuck?
Right? And he starts playing the AFI.

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,110
Amba you right. He starts
singing that song and I'm like,

172
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,640
wait a minute,
wait a fucks Vinny.

173
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,290
I realize he's been playing the whole
fucking time. He's just behind these,

174
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,500
this fight. I don't the fuck it
was somebody amps or some shit.

175
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,900
So I could see was like
the top of his head.

176
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,450
But there was like
video screens and stuff.

177
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,610
So of course I was standing
on my tiptoes to watch it,

178
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:34,110
but what killed me about his
playing is, uh, you know,

179
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,950
every great musician has a voice, right?
I know this is like hacky to say that,

180
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,030
but that fucking guy,

181
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,020
the bell of his ride cymbal and when
he plays the cross stick on his snare,

182
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,530
it's just undeniable. You're like,
that's fucking Vinny [inaudible].

183
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,190
And the fact that I would,

184
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:51,150
he was making that noise that close to
me and I was immediately hearing it and

185
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,390
just all the Times that I've listened to,
uh,

186
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,910
all the music that he's made
with staying in everybody else,

187
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,940
the fact that they were actually
reproducing it live right there,

188
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,320
it was fucking nuts to me. You know,
like their plan, this, the songs for us,

189
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,670
this is fucking incredible,
right?

190
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,290
So then the consequences and they just
keep flip flopping back and forth.

191
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,400
So stink finished his fucking song.
And then Peter Gabriel came back out,

192
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:15,720
but staying stayed

193
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,860
in fucking played bass on Peter's shit.
And then he,

194
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:22,710
they just kept going back and forth.
Then occasionally Peter did too.

195
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:23,850
And then staying do a couple,

196
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,510
only sting would walk off and Peter
would do his thing and then vice versa,

197
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:32,000
whatever, and filing in
the middle of it. Um, oh,

198
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,560
maybe towards the beginning.
And I can't, they,

199
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,450
they talked to the crowd a couple times
and they basically said that they were

200
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,600
just that a,

201
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,610
they both had bands and they're kind
of competing with each other band.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
And Peter Gabriel's band was the red
band and strings was the blue band.

203
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,130
And then I, then I finally noticed
cell one drummer's got red,

204
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,820
the other Vinnie's playing on
blue drums. And I, you know,

205
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,770
the way he told the story,
they would just, you know,

206
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,080
having battle of the bands and they were
like, why don't we fucking go on tour?

207
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,770
All I can say is,
it was an incredible night.

208
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,270
They played like all the fucking hits.

209
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,560
Peter Gabriel played big time
sledgehammer of shocked, a monkey,

210
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,230
a red rain, uh, staying played, fucking,

211
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,100
uh, sending out. And it's
so as a bunch of shit off.

212
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,570
10 Summers tails,
uh,

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,170
some shit off a sole cages. It was some
police stuff. It was fucking amazing.

214
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,670
It was fucking amazing. And, uh, you
know, definitely a bucket list night.

215
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:31,150
But of course I was in the
crowd and at the Hollywood bowl,

216
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,780
the either drink wine,
which just gives me a brutal hangover oil.

217
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:38,480
They had these giant fucking beers.
Um,

218
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,040
which I gotta be honest with just does
nothing to me. It's just this, it's like,

219
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,270
it's like somebody just handed a job here,
why don't you drink this? Like, yeah,

220
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,220
fuck. And I get it. I get
really nothing out of it.

221
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,650
It's why I like Whiskey, you know,
it gives you the right there Fred,

222
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,510
and it's just a couple of
swallows. Um, but anyways,

223
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,390
Jesus Christ, the level of
musicianship, the backup singers,

224
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:04,780
one in particular was just, they kept,
you know, given her solos and stuff,

225
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:09,550
she was incredible. Um, got
to watch stink, played bass,

226
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:10,840
got to watch them up close.

227
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,350
And the weird way he kind of comes
from the side rather than might've.

228
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,090
Bass players are kind of have their hand
up top rest of their thumb on the low e

229
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,030
or whatever the fuck that string is.
And he's,

230
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,120
he looks like he's coming at it
from the side, like a fucking crab.

231
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,320
It was really interesting.
But uh, anyways,

232
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,380
it was like some of the best
musicians you ever going to see.

233
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:33,250
So that's what I did Monday.
And uh, then Tuesday we came in,

234
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:37,810
we did the Polish up after the table read
of episode 10 and we recorded episode

235
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:40,060
10, and that's it. Oh,

236
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:43,870
fucking Billy red faces on
fucking a summer vacation here.

237
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,430
Then I got a nice, um, I
don't know where I got,

238
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I got about nine days before I go off to
the European tour and I'm going to work

239
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,860
out like a madman still, you know, have
a couple, two, three drinks, whatever.

240
00:13:56,861 --> 00:14:01,360
It work hard, play hard. What are you
gonna do? And I plan to have a nice,

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,890
um, I want to have a healthy
fucking tour over there.

242
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,940
You know,
my wife isn't going on this run.

243
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,560
She's going to meet me
over there afterwards,

244
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:16,330
when to take a few days to hang out. But
uh, during the whole run, it's a thrash.

245
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:18,100
It's like a different
city every fucking night.

246
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:21,250
So it's kind of boring and pointless.

247
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,940
You're really just saying to the
person who isn't doing shows like, Hey,

248
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,080
do you want to,
uh,

249
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,860
do you want to go over to Europe and
like pack and unpack every fucking day?

250
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,640
And they're like, yeah, no, I
don't in barely see anything.

251
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,710
That's what I'm offering you. So
what I want to do, the first died,

252
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm working with Joe to Rosa in Dublin on
one of the shows. It's an earlier show,

253
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:47,110
which is odd to me, but whatever.
It's not my fucking deal. Right?

254
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,490
So that night's a wash. I mean,
we're going to get shit faced. Um,

255
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,200
then the next night I'm in Belfast and
I got to drive up and drive back so that

256
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:01,730
night I'll fucking take it easy. The
Irish people bitching. I already asked,

257
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,650
stop being a pussy drink every night.

258
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:07,120
I can't do it cause I got to make sure I
have good shows. And then I got Gallway.

259
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,580
But a chill for that,
that London chill for the first night.

260
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,880
Second night I'm going to maybe,
you know,

261
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,490
knock a few back and then I go
to Scotland, I believe. And,

262
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,700
uh, two nights stair. I'll just fucking
chill. And then the third night,

263
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,090
you know, that's going to be hard
because it's, it's the whole fucking,

264
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,990
the festivals going on over there.
Somebody, me being a ton of Comedians,

265
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,500
that might be a rough one. And then
Jeremy, I don't gotta worry about Shit.

266
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,140
Who's kidding? Who? I got to go out
and have some beers that you, okay.

267
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,880
It's going to get a little rough
and once I get around Scotland,

268
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,640
who's kidding who but, but
the, the first half of it. Aw,

269
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:44,180
that first half I'm going to be healthy.
Um,

270
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,420
does Amsterdam in there?
All right. You know what?

271
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:50,920
This whole thing just went off the rails.
Okay.

272
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,270
For the first few nights in Ireland,

273
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,850
I think it's going to be okay one
night in London. Other than that, yeah,

274
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,670
it might be a little rough,
but if I can eat well,

275
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,260
yeah.

276
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,650
The problem is when you go over to Europe
though, there's just this, just fuck it.

277
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:05,130
There's no treadmills. They, these
people just don't work out. It's weird.

278
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,880
They're not like necessarily fat,
but they're not in shape either.

279
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:12,930
They just sort of, people mean,
you know what I mean? Like, yeah,

280
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,870
those are arms, you know? Yeah. They're
connected to your torso. They got

281
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,200
like, I think ellipticals
are illegal in England.

282
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,490
I don't know what the fuck it is.

283
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:31,110
Everybody's so jammed in there and that
little island, um, I'm fucking with you.

284
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:32,190
Obviously they have gyms over there,

285
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:36,540
so I'm going to try to hit treadmills
and shit as much as I can. And, uh,

286
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,680
I already know how I'm going to open my
set when I'm over there, you know. Um,

287
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,510
it's, it's going to be, it's
going to be a great fucking time.

288
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,620
I can't wait to do it.

289
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:53,010
And I'm so site that we got the
first big chunk of work done on a,

290
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:57,720
on f is for family. I feel I
can, could finally fucking, uh,

291
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,900
can finally fucking chill out and
coming up this week, by the way,

292
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:06,120
next Monday night is the second,
uh,

293
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,720
the two year anniversary of
the goddamn comedy jam and a,

294
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,950
they're going to have it at the rock
seat down on sunset boulevard. And

295
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,910
rumor has it that I'm,
I might be down there.

296
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,170
I'm going to be down there for that show.

297
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,030
It's next Monday night if
you are in the area and uh,

298
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm going to be busting out the fucking,

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm going to bust out the
fucking green spark a Ludwig Kit.

300
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,580
I'm going to bring it down there for that.
And I bought it two years ago.

301
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:38,500
I've never played it. I got this
71 Ludwig, it's fucking gorgeous.

302
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,370
And right as I got it,
I had it all set up and everything.

303
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,650
We got what we had the
water damage on the house.

304
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,910
Fortunately thank Christ it didn't come
down in the room where the drums were.

305
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,620
So immediately went out and I got drunk
cases and I put the fucking things away.

306
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,420
And then, um, you know,

307
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:59,930
that was a year getting the house fixed
and they stayed in cases and then the

308
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,621
next year my truck,
shit,

309
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,980
the bed I had to get the engine rebuilt
because it was going to do is put them

310
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,930
in the cases and take them
over to a rehearsal space.

311
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,010
I was never able to do that at a,
that my truck was better.

312
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,870
And then I started writing
on f is for family.

313
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:16,190
So and just like that fucking two
years goes by. So I busted them out.

314
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,210
71 Ludwig kick, I got the fucking Pisces
symbols, that whole bottom set up,

315
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:27,130
the 15 inch high hat, the 24 inch
ride, complete fucking overkill.

316
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,180
And I'm going to play a couple songs.

317
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:31,570
I actually sat down and played drums
today for the first time since like March,

318
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,670
I played like a drum kit,
you know,

319
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,220
other than a cup that I think I took
two lessons. But that's, you know,

320
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,160
different than sitting down and playing.
And I'll tell you right now,

321
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:43,590
I fucking inside, oh Jesus, oh, sorry.

322
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,470
Just blew out the uh, you're saying, oh my
God, that was fucking terrible. Terrible.

323
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,600
I better get my shit
together by Monday night.

324
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,080
Or I'm just going to look like a dish
with a really nice kid who can't fucking

325
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,830
play. Um, but I'm really
looking forward to doing that.

326
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,020
And I'll let me do a little,
still read here.

327
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,610

ziprecruiter.com/ [inaudible] all
right, there you go. Sorry about that.

347
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:34,380
I fucking thought I had the levels down.
I guess when you scream zip recruiter,

348
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,080
it's bound to go off the
rails after a while. Um,

349
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,230
all right. So what else did I
want to talk about? Anything? Um,

350
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,550
somebody said that the New York Times
did this article and for the love of God,

351
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:48,010
I can't,
it they did it.

352
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
And talking about the legalization of pot
and was saying in states where weed is

353
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,840
become illegal, dep, uh,

354
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,550
prescriptions have gone down drastically,
obviously for pain,

355
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,280
anxiety and all of that other stuff.

356
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,660
And it's really starting to become the
wonder drug man that all the hippies

357
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:11,710
always said. And I always
fucking was like, no, booze
is legal, blah, blah, blah.

358
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,700
And now it's really looking at like,
booze does way more fucking damaged. Oh.

359
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:20,620
But it's so delicious. Does way
more damage than we does. So,

360
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,660
according to this New York Times article,

361
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,960
according to this person who said it
was in New York Times article, um,

362
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,970
that the pharmaceutical lobbyists are
now going after legalized marijuana in

363
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:37,480
every state and then they're going to try
and start trying to fucking, you know,

364
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:38,950
basically go,
oh my God,

365
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:43,951
it's the devil in Blahblahblahblahblah
and get people to stop using it and have

366
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,700
all this shit about side effects it,

367
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:49,860
but they'll start showing commercials
and all that. But I got to tell you, um,

368
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,210
the fact that this is the pro ball,
maybe they won't,

369
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,660
I was gonna say the problem that they're
going to have is now that the cat's out

370
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,940
of the bag,
okay.

371
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:04,810
In the states are making so
much money in tax revenue,

372
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,110
right? Like this, this whole
thing going on at Denver,

373
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:11,560
because it's legal at a state level,
but not at a federal level.

374
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,310
You don't pay federal income tax
and it's this weird fucking thing.

375
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:19,210
So nobody knows. Oh, I know
banks won't accept the money,

376
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,130
you know, cause the banks,
federal banks or whatever,

377
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,460
can't accept the money or whatever.
So what these,

378
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,270
these people who grow the wheat are
doing and they're just buying up land.

379
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:33,770
So in Colorado, from what I heard,
once again, I never read, I, I,

380
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,280
I listened to people and whatever they
say to me, I just considered it as,

381
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:42,060
as a fact, right? It's so much
easier than doing research.

382
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,550
And you know what's great about it?
If you fuck up,

383
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:48,990
it makes other people feel
smart, you know, nothing,

384
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:52,500
nothing structure Rigo like
correcting another human being.

385
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,610
That's a human being. That thing
can speak. It could drive a car.

386
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,940
Maybe you can fly a plane to be right.
I mean,

387
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:03,180
anybody can be right when there's a dog,
you know,

388
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,500
there's a fucking dog in the room that
doesn't do anything for you, you know?

389
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,480
But if it's another fucking Parson right,

390
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:13,380
he's got a thumb and shit and getting
like hold a hammer. If you're fucking Rad,

391
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:17,310
that just, it's the greatest.
I actually, ah, that was,

392
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,580
it was actually 1897 yes.

393
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,040
1890 set Spanish American war.

394
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,730
Anytime you get to do that and then you
get to watch them be all fucking mad.

395
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,710
Like when I was talking about George Bush,

396
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:32,070
I thought everybody was making fun of
them cause he deep, he didn't dance well.

397
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,030
I didn't realize it was some
memorial service for, you know,

398
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,830
fallen officers or, or, uh, an officer in
particular. And I didn't, I didn't look,

399
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:45,030
I just watched the fucking video. Oh. And
it just rolled in, you know, everybody,

400
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,670
oh, let's, let's, let's fucking
correct old Billy red beard. You know,

401
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,830
everybody had a great fucking time doing
that. Um, but I'm off the rails here.

402
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,690
Okay. I still have to say, you know, you
know, as much as that was inappropriate,

403
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,350
which was completely
inappropriate, obviously, it
was fun to see him, you know,

404
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,110
it was fun to see that he's
enjoying his retirement.

405
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,270
It's like when you see Letterman,
he let the beard go out.

406
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,000
He got rid of the fucking two page.
It doesn't, it doesn't give a shit.

407
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,490
And when you look at him, a lot
of people were saying, you know,

408
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:17,450
maybe George was a little drunk.
And, uh, you know what? Good for him,

409
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,230
good for that fucking guy
because that fucking guy,

410
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,210
he held it together for eight
goddamn years. You know,

411
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,000
granted he gave a speech.
The way I read advertising,

412
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,140
granted we winded and into wire rack
because there was weapons of mass

413
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:35,240
destruction and we never
fucking found Eddie.

414
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,580
I love all that fucking story goes away.

415
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,890
But if you make fun of
fat people as a comedian,

416
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:43,160
all of a sudden you get in trouble. And
was like, what about this fucking guy?

417
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,980
This guy here was playing
fucking patty cake,

418
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:50,330
Patty cake bakers man at a
fucking funeral. Good Lord.

419
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,200
That guy is like, he's like you
when you talk about failing upwards,

420
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,640
I think you know something.
There's something about that guy.

421
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:01,490
He's just smart enough to
know that he's not qualified.

422
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:03,170
And I think that that's why he drinks.

423
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
I think that's why it's got to hate
that fucking vibe. He just, he,

424
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,300
he's kind of like Rodney, like he does
everything but tugs on his collar.

425
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:16,130
Like it'll tell you it's a rough
one, you know? Um, I dunno.

426
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,120
We'll see. We'll see. What
the fuck happens. But what
was I talking about? Oh yeah.

427
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,430
In New York Times they were saying that,
you know,

428
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:26,000
that these pharmaceutical lobbyists, you
know, we're, we're going to be trying to,

429
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,620
you know, fight back to win back some of
their money, capitalistic society here.

430
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:34,820
Right. What do you do? Somebody taking
India, you're cutting India territory.

431
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,680
What he had done. Yeah.
You go on the offensive,

432
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,240
you start making up shit about him. You
lie, you know, that's what you do. So,

433
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:42,074
um,

434
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,270
I was going to say now that the cat
is out of the bag legally with weed,

435
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,120
um, and I think it's going to be
really hard. I was going to say,

436
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:57,710
because not only is it appearing to have
all these positive effects medically

437
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,960
according to stuff that people said to
me that they allegedly said scientists

438
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:07,730
did. Um, it also makes you feel good.

439
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,050
That's a rough one. You know what I
mean? Whereas all that other shit,

440
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,310
a lot of the pharmaceutical stuff
just sorta like numbs the pain,

441
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,510
all of that stuff.

442
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,940
And then you all of a sudden you get
onto the harder drugs and all that.

443
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,570
It's really fucking evil. You
know, I got a friend of mine,

444
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,670
she had problems with there. She
couldn't some going on with the shoulder.

445
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:28,820
She couldn't pick a fucking
arms up past shoulder.

446
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,060
I referred it to this same as suits
that I went to and she immediately was

447
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:37,820
getting results and she,
she was, according to her,

448
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,840
was stuck going to these
fucking doctors. I'm, look,

449
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:45,510
I'm not totally shitting on doctors
and stuff like that, but, uh,

450
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,341
I don't know.

451
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:51,630
It would be nice if the mainstream medical
would kind of let these other people

452
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:56,410
come in. You know what I mean?
It's just that I think the,

453
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,500
the people outside people outside of the
mainstream medical basically hospitals

454
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,320
and shit, I don't know what mainstream
medical means. It just sounds right to me.

455
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:08,250
Right? Oh Jesus. I am so out of my fucking
element. You know what? It feels good.

456
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,870
I feel like I could start swinging
my arms at a funeral right now. Um,

457
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,240
when you get outside of hospitals
and stuff, you could actually,

458
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,530
most people you'll find,
don't know what the fuck that dude,

459
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,690
but if you find that gem that's outside
of the fucking studio system, basically,

460
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,880
they actually can cure, you know,
where a lot of this other shit is.

461
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,630
Just treating it and treating it and
treating it and treating it until you then

462
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,630
get symptoms for something else and
then treat that, treat that, treat that.

463
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:41,160
You know, I dunno. It's, it's
a fucking shady think and uh,

464
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:45,030
it's a big fucking problem and it
requires a lot of reading and research.

465
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,350
And I have to be honest with you,

466
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:49,500
I did none of that before I started
talking about seven minutes ago.

467
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,390
So there's that subject.
What are we up to here? 27,

468
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:56,630
almost 28 minutes.
Um,

469
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,730
this is all drawn nerd shit,

470
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:01,890
but I saw Steve Smith has
playing with journey again.

471
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:04,650
I'm gonna have to go fucking see that.
You know,

472
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,630
I've never seen him when he
played with vital information.

473
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:10,800
I've never seen that guy play life. Got
All his fucking DVDs and all that shit.

474
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:14,970
There's another one I got to check off
the fucking bucket list. But uh, um, if,

475
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:19,140
if that, that sting Peter Gabriel
tourists coming to your, uh,

476
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,310
neck of the woods, do not sleep on
it. Like I've never seen like staying,

477
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:25,430
having so much fucking fun and ever,

478
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,710
never realized how like goofy
and silly Peter Gabriel was.

479
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,340
It's got all these sychronized dances
and shit. It's fucking hilarious.

480
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:37,341
And he's funny as hell and like sting
was just like really just taken a back

481
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:40,650
seat when letting Peter,
Shane and all of that,

482
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:43,800
I'll let you know all that fucking drama
that you always heard in that band.

483
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:46,230
The police, it was great seeing
stink. Just fucking, I mean,

484
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:47,310
granted the guy's still,

485
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,650
he looks better than he looked
when he was in the police.

486
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,810
It's fucking ridiculous.

487
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,920
Jesus Christ clean living and,

488
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:59,921
and fucking yoga and whatever the fuck
he does that tantric where you come for

489
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:04,590
like fucking 50 minutes, whatever that
shit is. It's unbelievable. I mean,

490
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:09,210
the guy looks better than
he did fucking 30 years ago.

491
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,830
His hair somehow grew back. I, I dunno,
I dunno what the fuck this guy is doing.

492
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,310
He looks like it's a combination of like
a teen idol and he said like Mad Max

493
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,250
all at the same time.
He never kind of would like,

494
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:25,050
as far as like his wardrobe though,

495
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:29,670
I will say that guy is never
sort of advanced past um,

496
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,620
uh, that synchronicity tour, you know?

497
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,300
And when he yells, he always has to
put an o at the end of it. You know,

498
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:43,630
when he did Roxanne and then when he had
wanted to do a call and response with

499
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:48,450
the crow with the crowd is going
like,

500
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,580
where did they all come
from? He loves the, Oh,

501
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,620
I bet he does that in his castle. You
know, his wife yells up, you know,

502
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,720
up the fucking goddamn stone stairway.
Stay

503
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,500
for lunch, lunch, lunch. And he's
up there. Let's sandwich. Yo,

504
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,490
she's fucking driving her
nuts. Fuck does he put, oh,

505
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:17,430
at the end of everything just fucking say
sandwich. All right, you fucking cunt.

506
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,190
What? You get knighted and all sudden you
can put an o at the end of everything,

507
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,580
you know. Anyways, what am I doing
here? It was so fucking great show. Um,

508
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,760
all right, so I still have to go to work
tomorrow and how we do the animatics,

509
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,680
I'll take you through the whole process.

510
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:32,680
Everybody over the next year as we wait
for this fucking thing to come out.

511
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,690
So once you write the thing, and once
you record it, before they animate it,

512
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,590
they had these things called animatics,
which is just rough sketches.

513
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,990
Okay. Of the scenes, the way that they're
going to draw, draw, like, you know,

514
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,490
they look at the script and says,
you know,

515
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:50,590
frank walks into the house so
they know it's in the house,

516
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,830
but there's a lot of other stuff that
has sort of variables about where people

517
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:55,120
are standing and where they're sitting,

518
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,720
how they're eyes are moving and
all of that shit. And it's that,

519
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,140
this is where it gets a
little bit tedious. But, uh,

520
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,370
it was much harder the first season,
the second season.

521
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,650
Now everybody kind of knows
how everybody creates and shit.

522
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,570
So we go in now and we'll look at
the animatic for like the second,

523
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,390
first or second episode. And
you just look at, you know,

524
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:15,100
is the scenes go and you'd be like,
all right,

525
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:20,101
frank needs to be standing up here or
sue needs to be doing this or whatever.

526
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,380
And um,
I have to be honest with you,

527
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,880
I am decent at arm gestures,
but I'm really bad at the directing shit.

528
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,200
Like this should be a two shot that
should be a master and all that. Um,

529
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,270
not only make bad at it,
I have no desire to get good at it.

530
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,710
So that's a tough thing.

531
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:40,711
Like I don't give a shit that is that
there's nothing more boring to me then

532
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,720
that just sitting there going like,

533
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,450
this should be over this guy's
shoulder and this should be a two shot.

534
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,210
Can we Dolly in? Can we get
a fucking whatever the fuck
they say. And I just said,

535
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,550
I just glaze over.
It reminds me of when,

536
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,670
for whatever stupid fucking reason,

537
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,020
my junior year of high school,
like

538
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,610
I took Algebra two and
fucking trigonometry and it
was just like I fucking had

539
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,810
to go to summer school after Algebra.
I barely got out of that shit.

540
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,850
I got to fucking d minus in geometry
just because my teacher was cool.

541
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,920
I flunked it.
She gave me the d minus,

542
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:27,070
so I didn't have back to back going
to summer school and the district,

543
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,550
I mean, I was lost by, I was done. I
was done three weeks into September,

544
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,740
Algebra two and trig.
It was fucking over.

545
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,180
And I ended up in fucking
motherfucking summer school again.

546
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,420
I swear to God, my geometry teacher
didn't hook me up with a d minus.

547
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,450
I would have had like a dynasty.
I would have three years in a row,

548
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:48,770
a summer school, fucking dope. Um,

549
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,410
I don't know.
I'll tell you this right now.

550
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,860
This is how dumb I am is I can't even
remember why I even just fucking told you

551
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:57,830
that. What the hell was I talking about?
I just sat up in my whole memory, went,

552
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,510
what the fuck? A hell of his. What right

553
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,420
did I started talking about? I
don't, I don't, I don't remember. Um,

554
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,110
but you know what the great thing is is
I don't have to remember anything else

555
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,660
who gives a shit because this is,
this is the a,

556
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:13,190
this is just me checking in on you.

557
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,210
Just peeking into your cubicle or maybe
you've got an office. You've got a door.

558
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,600
Huh? You feel good about yourself. You
like that door. He puts stuff audit.

559
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,520
Do you close it and say,
no calls makes you feel good.

560
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,240
Then you close the door and you snicker
to yourself. Like I just said, no calls.

561
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,110
Um,
the no calls guy hold my calls.

562
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,780
Um, anyways. All right, that's
it. That's, that's a podcast. Uh,

563
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,770
please go see Peter Gabriel and
sting on tour and he amazing Vinny,

564
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,180
call euro and everybody else
in both of those bands. Uh,

565
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:48,950
I should have known more than
names. I should have looked
it up. But, uh, you know,

566
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:52,190
I'm running around like a fucking
loan to tick. Um, and that's it.

567
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:55,160
If anybody can find that New York Times
article, I would really love to read it.

568
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,750
And,
um,

569
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,830
I'm also going to try to read up on all
that whole fucking European Union thing

570
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,330
for when I go over there just in
case anybody's a cunt to me, uh,

571
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,280
about not knowing what the fuck's going
on in the world, which, which I don't. Um,

572
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,380
I do know that there was some sort of
fucking failed coup attempt in Turkey.

573
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,690
Jesus Christ. The only thing scarier
than trying to overthrow the,

574
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,180
the government is attempting
it and then failing.

575
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,050
This is one of the scariest
couple of paragraphs I ever read.

576
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,980
Turkey's President Tayyip t double.

577
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,670
Why Ip Ert again,
tell you bird again.

578
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,470
Um,

579
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,120
declared a state of emergency on Wednesday
as he widened a crackdown against

580
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:49,050
thousands of members of the security
forces judicial to judiciary,

581
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,530
civil service and academia
after a failed military coup.

582
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,940
All right, here's where it gets
scary. Erdogan, however, you said,

583
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:03,770
said the state of emergency lasting three
months would allow his government to

584
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:08,771
take swift and decisive measures against
supporters of the COO and was allowed

585
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,890
under the constitution.
Yeah,

586
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,860
they're about to kill a
couple thousand motherfuckers.

587
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,530
Jesus.

588
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,510
That right there is the definition and
the Joe [inaudible] and the old right

589
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:29,030
there, Fred, right. There's
no cold lotion in there. Okay.

590
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,053
MMM,

591
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,090
you're not cold. Lotion is, is
is your final meal on death row.

592
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,120
Yeah, man. We'll make you whatever you
want. Uh, you guys in sweetheart. Yeah.

593
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:46,510
And then we're going to electrocute
you. Ah, Jesus. Then. All right. Um,

594
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,900
that's the podcast,
but just checking in on you.

595
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,810
I'll see you guys again on a talk to you.

596
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:55,650
Get on Monday and um,
that's it.

597
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,530
Thank you to everybody who helped
fix my fucking back. I feel great.

598
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,450
I'm in a great mood.
Please enjoy this music.

599
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,960
And then we got 30 minutes
of some throwback podcasts.

600
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,660
Greatest hits from a podcast in a year.

601
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,273
All right.
See

602
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,093
you soon.

603
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,123
Okay,

604
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,090
so I got that out of the way.

605
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:20,660
Then I had two days to hang in New York
and then I came down in New Jersey and

606
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:24,170
I'm like, this is going to be great. I
got the pressure, a Letterman off me.

607
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,910
That's off my fucking
back. And uh, now what?

608
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,830
Now what do I do? I get to go to one
of my favorite clubs in the country.

609
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,080
Okay.

610
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,570
The stress factory. I was already talking
to what Vinnie brand? The club owner.

611
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,500
He's got a boat. We were going
to go out on his boat on Sunday.

612
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:46,320
Everything was going to be great.
All the shows were fucking sold up.

613
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,070
Had a great time and then what happens?

614
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,590
These fucking nerds on the
weather channel. What do they do?

615
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:58,590
They turn out all the lights in their
studio and they put a flashlight under

616
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,424
their Chin

617
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,400
and just start scaring the living shit
out of people and you know what kills me

618
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:12,600
is every fucking time people buy into it.

619
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,770
I was joking about it all weekend.
I'm like, nothing's going to happen.

620
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,150
I am in my hotel. Tell them I don't
even have a fucking snickers bar.

621
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,030
Nothing's going to happen.
You're going to be fine.

622
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,900
All these people going out
gathering up fucking food for what

623
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,230
people do. You realize how long you can
go without food. Food is no big deal.

624
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:39,190
You need water. That's what the
fuck you need. That's what you need.

625
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,700
I'm actually looking here on a,
who gives a fuck.com?

626
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,500
How long can a person survive
without food and water? Uh,

627
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:52,060
basically it depends on a number
of factors such as bodyweight,

628
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,530
genetic variations, other
health considerations, whether
you're a fat fuck or not.

629
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,910
Uh, most importantly, the presence
or absence of dehydration.

630
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,460
As long as you got water people,

631
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,350
you can basically go 46
to about 73 days without,

632
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,070
without food.

633
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:14,070
Then that was based on a 10 individuals
who died on a hunger strike and they all

634
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:18,460
died between 46 days and 73 days.
As long as they drank water.

635
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,640
If you don't have water, I believe
you dead. And about three days.

636
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,440
All right,
so enough with the fucking milk and eggs,

637
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,970
all the soccer moms now for the
next fucking three weeks. Who wants,

638
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,610
who went theorial?
Who wants what you have in theory?

639
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:35,920
Alanya having an Omelette
isn't going to go to waste.

640
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,600
He's fucking people telling you to fill
up your goddamn bathtub full of full of

641
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,700
full of water just in case

642
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,020
Jesus fucking Christ. I'd rather
die than drink out of my bathtub.

643
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,350
All right.
I wash my fucking dog in there,

644
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,110
not drinking out of that thing.

645
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,470
What can I just stick my head out
the window and drink? The rain drops.

646
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:10,200
I think those when those be cleaner than
the God damn tub that I watched my dog

647
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:13,560
in and then hit with chemicals,
love stomach cancer.

648
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,420
By the time to fucking rescue boat comes,

649
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,070
you just get water.
Everybody get water.

650
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,260
Get yourself a couple of fucking zag
nut bars and they'd go down, go down,

651
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,700
go down to a god bad in fucking
seven 11 and go buy an $8 Poncho.

652
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,050
You find you were in a house,
you fine.

653
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,980
It's fucking people or whether
she know how much they cost me.

654
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,330
Half my God Damn Gig money.

655
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,170
We could've had shows we
could add show Saturday night.

656
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,270
It was raining hard Saturday night.
It could have done both shows.

657
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,040
Everybody could have
got their fucking labs.

658
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,120
Everybody goes home and then
at night [inaudible] Boegli

659
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,740
the fucking hurricane. Hurricanes come
through the north east. It's like,

660
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,040
it's like an old price fighter.
By the time it comes to us,

661
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:12,270
it's all fucking punch drunk and people
have no business standing out in it

662
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,180
cause they should've got knocked out,
have no fucking problem.

663
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:19,180
Then they just sit there laughing
at it. All right. That's what it is.

664
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:23,470
That's what a hurricane is
in the northeast. It, you
know when it's down south,

665
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,490
it's Cassius clay.
Right before he becomes Muhammad Ali,

666
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,940
by the time it gets up to Jersey
in New York, it's fucking Ali.

667
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:35,900
When he fought Larry
Holmes every fucking time.

668
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,910
Yet these people,
they all run out

669
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,770
the weather channel.
How long you guys,

670
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,380
you guys think Fox News
lies to you or CNN?

671
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:48,200
Depending on what side of the
political fence you're on, you want it.

672
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,510
You want to see some lies
put on the weather channel.

673
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,740
Anytime there's a storm
scaring the shit out of you,

674
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:58,470
every time there's going to be,
it's going to be four to six edge says,

675
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,490
Holy Shit,
that's almost up to my calves.

676
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,910
How will I ever get to where the food is?

677
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,470
46 inches. Jesus Christ.
Who are they talking to?

678
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,340
80 year olds.

679
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,600
Okay.

680
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,530
Even then, you know, 80 year old
people, they'll be fine. You are there.

681
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,020
They're already wearing a sweater.

682
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,600
Okay.

683
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,430
They're dressed for a blizzard year round.

684
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,910
Does anybody will work
for the weather channel?

685
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,860
Does anybody who listened to my
podcast, can you please tell me? Well,

686
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:39,180
who's behind you? I think the
supermarkets have behind that, right?

687
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,610
Ralph's Shaws,

688
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,670
Gelson's fucking whole foods.
All of them. That's their payola.

689
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,240
You know, with a big time corporations,
they wait for the political elections.

690
00:42:51,241 --> 00:42:54,630
That's when they start throwing their
money around and start calling up a truck

691
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:58,950
full of hookers to go blow some
Bible belt and Douche bag. Right?

692
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,770
Oh, married. I got five kids. I love my
wife and I love Jesus. Support the troops.

693
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,760
Right? And then what do they
do? They throw a big pile
of money at them. Have two,

694
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:12,320
three horse drop to their knees. And
next what? Next? What happens next? Huh?

695
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,380
He comes on his blue blazer.
That's what happens.

696
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:20,880
Everybody goes all over his red tie
and then he goes, AH, Jesus Christ.

697
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,480
All right, you got me, you
own me. You got video of it.

698
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:25,920
Just tell me what you want me to do.

699
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,090
I will pass any bill you want
me to pass for the love of God.

700
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:31,230
Don't let my wife see that.

701
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,600
Okay.

702
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,270
That's basically how that works. Well,
let's, let's stay on track here. Okay.

703
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:40,200
The fucking weather. Does anybody listen
to my podcast work? Did they ever work?

704
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:45,090
Can you give me any sort of anonymous
behind the fucking scenes over there? Why?

705
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,650
Every time it's just going to rain.

706
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,930
Okay.

707
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,550
Did they scare the living shit out of us?
Why is that?

708
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,383
You know,

709
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,510
how often are they right?
It always is.

710
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,920
It's always downgraded to a tropical
storm. By the time it comes here,

711
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,300
someone was telling me the entire
east coast, the way it's shaped,

712
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,490
that's from years of hurricanes
comes right into Florida and Georgia.

713
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:16,491
South Carolina gives it a nice fucking
upper cut to their southern balls and

714
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:21,300
then slows the fuck down right
over the Carolina, Virginia.

715
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,520
Yep.
Then what?

716
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,100
Trimet,
it hits DC.

717
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,990
Barack Obama's out on the porch
drying off his nuts with those. Nice.

718
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,310
That nice hurricane when,
right. Oh Jesus. I don't know.

719
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,410
I'm talking about, I just want to
fucking go home. I was actually thinking,

720
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,840
you know, when you, you, you know, when
you fuck up in life, feel like God,

721
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,630
if I could just go back 48 hours,
Howard do this differently.

722
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,180
There's an Avis in the lobby of my,
uh,

723
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,870
you know Jesus as a callback. I remember
this time we left this comedian,

724
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:57,930
he was always late.
We had a car service to the airport.

725
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,240
We were so sick of waiting for when
we were going to miss our flight.

726
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,440
We just took off with
that and we said fuck him.

727
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,050
And we got halfway to the airport and he
calls up all pissed off. It's like, Yo,

728
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,550
where the fuck boy you put a fuck.

729
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:12,000
Why are you like do we waited for
your 20 minutes? You didn't show up?

730
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,380
And he's like,
I was in the,

731
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,870
and that became the catch
phrase for the rest of the tour.

732
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:25,900
I was in the lobby anytime you
fucked up and people will call him,

733
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,030
calling you on some shit. You went over
your time. No I didn't. Yes you did.

734
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:34,050
I was in the lobby.
Oh.

735
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:37,260
And it made us laugh. I don't know if
it made you laugh. I don't give a shit,

736
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,020
but he expected from
me. I'm, I'm stranded.

737
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,620
I feel like I'm being held hostage in
my captors. Forgot about me, you know?

738
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,620
And maybe it was just all a practical
joke. I have no idea. So whatever.

739
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:52,454
Here I sit.

740
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,010
Okay.

741
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,460
You know, it was anything sadder than a
stranded comedian with no shows to do.

742
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,353
Yeah.

743
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,200
They got a 24 hour gym downstairs.
I haven't used it.

744
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,890
Okay.

745
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,190
Um, but talking to you guys about all
the way to eat, the way you lose weight.

746
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:13,270
I haven't been doing it dummy pizzas.
I had fish and chips today.

747
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,850
I had fucking to hamburgers.
This is all during a hurricane,

748
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,900
big bad hurricane Irene
fucking over rated.

749
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,660
So I'm sitting here, I realized,
you know, tomorrow I'm like,

750
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,780
finally I'm getting the fuck out of
here. Go home. Could see my girl,

751
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,090
I can see my dog.
Right?

752
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,770
Can I have a good fucking time,
you know,

753
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,070
can cruise around in my hybrid.

754
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,150
That's what I was looking
forward to doing. And, uh,

755
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:52,730
all of a sudden I realized that
was stranded here. So what do I do?

756
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:58,580
Do I handle it like a man? What do
I start cursing like a little bitch?

757
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,990
You know what the answer is? So once I'm
done having my fucking temper Tantrum,

758
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,520
excuse me, I a sufficient
chips. I say, all right,

759
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:11,390
I'm going to run a fucking
rent a movie here in the hotel.

760
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,680
So I go to rent a movie.

761
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:19,490
It's called catching hell to documentary
about the guy with the glasses who was

762
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:22,540
at the cubs game, who, uh,

763
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:27,590
reached up for that foul ball that
Moisis Lou was allegedly going to catch.

764
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,340
So I hit the info to watch the
trailer and they're talking about,

765
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,420
they got this guy on,

766
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:38,830
they're gone and says how he worked for
sports illustrated and his assignment

767
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,200
was to find this guy.

768
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:42,640
Okay,

769
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
whatever the fuck his name was,
Steve [inaudible]. I don't know.

770
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,650
I'm not from Chicago, so I don't give
a shit. I don't know what his name is.

771
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,790
All right. His, as he goes, my assignment
was to find this guy and he goes,

772
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,410
my heart sank. You know, because
I actually felt for this guy,

773
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,650
I didn't want to go see him.
And I said to my editor, editor,

774
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:02,320
why can't we just leave this guy alone?
Can't we just leave the guy alone?

775
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:06,850
He goes, no, go find them. And then they
shout showing the highlights of this dude.

776
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,650
And for those of you don't know the play,

777
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,360
basically the cubs have won the
world series since 1908. You know,

778
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,020
there a game away from going there,

779
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:21,070
five outs away from going to the fucking
world series. Sorry to all the cub fans.

780
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,760
Just hit fucking mute for
the next 10 minutes. Um,

781
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,460
okay.

782
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,460
They got the five outs
away. So some dude, right?

783
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,820
A lefthanded batter hits a slicing
foul down the left field line.

784
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,820
It's right there.
And uh,

785
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,060
the cubs left field or Moises Alou, he's
got a chance to make a play and all the,

786
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:44,810
all these fans reach up to
grab the ball. But the, the,

787
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,960
it just hits one guy and a Moises Alou
flips out cause he doesn't catch it and

788
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:54,480
he sorta yells towards the fans. Like,
what the fuck I could've caught that.

789
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,090
And then after that the
wheels start falling off,

790
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:01,110
but they got a double play ball.
Good solace could have made it.

791
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:03,690
Buddy booted it man first and
then they let up eight runs,

792
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,090
they lose the game and
then they lose game seven.

793
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:08,970
And then everybody wants
to murder this fucking kid.

794
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:10,680
So this guy is basically sold that.

795
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,590
They're going to basically interview
the guys far as I could fucking tell.

796
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,430
And I'm like, Jesus Christ,
that's fascinating. I want
to let me watch this. God,

797
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,810
God knows I got the time.
Let me watch this movie.

798
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,220
All right, so I go to order
it and it doesn't allow me to,

799
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:29,550
so I got to call downstairs
to have the uh, you know,

800
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,210
I dunno what somebody had kids or
something. I didn't want to run a porno,

801
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,790
so I had to get that,
you know,

802
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,740
just switched over so I could actually
be an adult and pick out a movie.

803
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:41,790
So I watched this fucking thing.
All right. About the cubs,

804
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,090
about their history,
about their curse,

805
00:49:45,091 --> 00:49:49,140
about this poor bastard that
got used as the scapegoat.

806
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:53,280
This is what I was sold. This is
the bill of goods. I was sold.

807
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,830
Okay. After 36 hours of being lied
to by the fucking weather channel,

808
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,670
I want some truth in my life. This is what
you're telling me. This thing is about,

809
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,280
this is how your advertising
and I want to see it.

810
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,100
Do you know what the first
15 minutes of that movie was?

811
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,940
It was taking me through the red sox
in 1986 as they excrutiatingly slowly

812
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,950
replayed the bill Buckner incident
and I'm sitting there watching it.

813
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:24,180
All of a sudden I'm looking
at bill Buckner. I'm like,

814
00:50:24,181 --> 00:50:27,470
what the F did I order the wrong
fucking thing? I don't want to see shit.

815
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,430
Do you understand? This is like my
baseball nine 11 I don't ever want it.

816
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,380
You know that like the 10 year anniversary
of of nine 11 is coming up and like

817
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,150
they,
I don't want to watch any of that.

818
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,980
I don't ever want to
see that footage again.

819
00:50:39,981 --> 00:50:44,180
Like how the fuck could you ever forget
it? It's absolutely fucking horrific.

820
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,380
Horrific.
I don't want to see it.

821
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,760
I don't need to see it to remember it.
I'll never forget. It's our Pearl Harbor.

822
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,600
My grandmother still doesn't like
Japanese people because of Pearl Harbor.

823
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,820
Okay. If she can remember that
shit, I don't think I got a problem.

824
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:05,180
Remember something 10 fucking
years ago. Okay, so now. Anyways,

825
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,430
total total fucking tangent there.

826
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:12,260
So I'm watching this thing and for the
first 20 just to worn red sox fucking

827
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,094
fence,

828
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,640
the first fucking 15 minutes of this
movie is the bill Buckner thing.

829
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,800
The thing that we left behind.

830
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,570
It's so funny because Paul Versey just
texted me then the night before during

831
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:29,120
the hurricane,
typical fucking Yankee Fed,

832
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,550
typical Yankee Fan living in the
past, right? He, he texted me,

833
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:37,910
he goes, hey bill, what was, what
was worse for a Red Sox Fan? He goes,

834
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,690
Buckner or Aaron Boone
just out of nowhere,

835
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,440
we won't even talk in baseball.
And I was just like,

836
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,040
I was like neither do to it.
It's like,

837
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,460
I don't even think about that shit
anymore to be honest with you.

838
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,990
And then he gets mad at me about a typical
red sox fan. Terrible fucking answer,

839
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:59,480
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like,
I don't know what he wanted out of me,

840
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,640
so I just texted back. It's like, dude,

841
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:05,930
I haven't thought about that shit since
2004 it's over. You know what it is.

842
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,670
It's Yankee fans used to be able to bully
red sox fans about that shit because

843
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:15,160
we hadn't won one forever, you know?
So they just, I think that they,

844
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:16,280
they miss,

845
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:20,540
they're kind of like our big brother who
just beat the shit out of us forever.

846
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:24,770
And then one day we were the same height
and kick the shit out of him, you know?

847
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,850
And then they just, they, it was
over. We're not scary anymore.

848
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,630
We expect to beat you.
It's fucking over. And I,

849
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:38,540
I think they still don't know what to do.
You know?

850
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,130
Wait a minute, we used to tease you
and we used to always win and yeah,

851
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:44,750
now you don't,
now you don't.

852
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:49,010
Now we got this the biggest choke of all
fucking time as hung around your neck.

853
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,150
That will never be beaten.

854
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,040
When do you guys think another
$220 million $10 million team,

855
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,890
whatever the fuck it was with five first
ballot hall of famers are going to lose

856
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:00,230
four games in a row,
have to be an up three games to none.

857
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,160
I'm asking you to a fucking team that
hasn't won a world series and like a

858
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,993
hundred years.
Right.

859
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,810
He had just asked me about that and I
swear to God I had not thought about

860
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:09,644
Buckner.

861
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,773
Yeah,

862
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,690
yeah. Since like all for it was
fucking, it was over. It was great.

863
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,040
I don't even give a shit now. I don't
even give a shit. And I got to tell you,

864
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:25,041
it's phenomenal to sit down and watch
a red sox game and something good to

865
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,530
happen.
And when something bad happens,

866
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,180
you get upset at the player rather than
some sort of specter or some sort of

867
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:36,540
ghost or some overly boogaloo horse shit.
Right?

868
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:39,643
So

869
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,510
I'm going to watch this fucking thing.
And all of a sudden out of nowhere,

870
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,630
this show, and I may do, they broke.

871
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:53,180
They almost broke down bill Buckner more
than they broke down this poor cubs fan.

872
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:54,560
Yeah.

873
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,430
And in the end the dude doesn't get
the interview. There's no interview.

874
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,240
They just talk all day.
But what I still recommend it,

875
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,590
I'm still wrecking recommending
it because they show,

876
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,250
um,
they talk to the people.

877
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,450
Some people, I guess they found the
people who like through bear Adam,

878
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,240
they talked to the security guard.
He was removing them,

879
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:22,440
giving them shit that he now feels bad
that he did and they have the footage of

880
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:27,441
him going out of the ballpark
and putting the jacket over him.

881
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:31,620
It's fucking amazing what
happens to this dude.

882
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,120
And uh, I, I totally
recommend it, but I just,

883
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,110
they should have been some sort
of warning for a red sox fan.

884
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:44,160
It was like walking,
go run in into your old psycho girlfriend.

885
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:45,580
Okay.

886
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,290
Somebody who stopped you or something.

887
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:52,150
Just somebody who just hadn't even
thought about 2000 for seven years.

888
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,380
I haven't thought about that shit.
I haven't even thought about that.

889
00:54:56,381 --> 00:55:01,300
And fucking seven years. And all of a
sudden this documentary about the cubs,

890
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,000
they just go blow by blow
through the Buckner thing.

891
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:05,590
Cause I guess they wanted to show

892
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,750
how Buckner was used as escape goat,

893
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:14,050
despite the fact Bob Stanley through the
wild pitch and how this kid was used as,

894
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:15,690
as the goat for the cubs,

895
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,920
despite the fact that Gonzales
booted a fucking double play ball,

896
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:23,070
which would've got him out
of the [inaudible]. Um,

897
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,500
okay.

898
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,150
I Dunno, it's, I, it's
definitely interesting, but
I was, I was more than upset

899
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:35,110
that and an elder and they even
show the Aaron Boone home run,

900
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,980
which I don't even remember because
that was basically annoying for about 12

901
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:40,570
months,
you know,

902
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,180
because it was immediately rectified

903
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,250
and,
uh,

904
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,260
but it was just one of those things.
I don't know. I don't fucking know,

905
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:53,650
but I gotta be honest with you,
I never really felt bad for cubs fans.

906
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,450
I never did because, you know, they
didn't have that anger did the Midwest,

907
00:55:58,451 --> 00:56:01,840
I don't know what it is. They're
positive. I don't know what it is.

908
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,390
They just didn't have
that anger or misery.

909
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:05,510
Okay.

910
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,400
You know what? The Red
Sox, back in the day,

911
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:12,050
it was every Yankee success was
our failure. And with the cubs,

912
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:16,600
they just, you know, hey,
let's play two zip Betty do.

913
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,530
Du was like a big fucking keg party,

914
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,853
you know.

915
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,400
It's like they didn't even give a shit.
Even their curse was stupid.

916
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:26,440
The curse of the goat.
It was just fucking stupid.

917
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,183
MMM.

918
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:32,140
Made no sense. It's a ballpark. You've
got a goat. It doesn't belong here.

919
00:56:32,141 --> 00:56:36,060
It's going to shit all over the place.
Get it Outta here. I curse you. Really?

920
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:37,843
MMM.

921
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:43,480
Any fucking waste. So they actually
bring up what, like skateboarding,

922
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:45,880
my sheet ruining this entire thing.
You probably don't have to fucking run it.

923
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:49,630
They start talking about what? It's,
how they came up with that terminology.

924
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:52,870
The scape goat and it went
back to religion. Oh Gee.

925
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:57,430
That I guess back in the day, I don't
know what the hell religion it was.

926
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:02,080
They're all fucking stupid when you really
get down to it other than they're due

927
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:05,560
on to other stuff that every religion has.
Um,

928
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,210
they would basically have a goat.
They bring a goat in and I'm thinking,

929
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:13,210
all right, they're going to sacrifice
it or whatever, and they wouldn't have,

930
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:18,211
the priest would lay his hands on a goat
for once instead of some unsuspecting

931
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:20,194
child.

932
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,380
Oh, a little molestation joke for
ya. How'd you guys like that? Huh?

933
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,440
Do you like that on your Monday? Do you
think that that was crossing the line?

934
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,840
Well, fuck you. I'm
stranded in New Jersey.

935
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,140
Okay.

936
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:41,090
Fucking New Jersey, Huh? Jesus
Christ. What? A bunch of animals.

937
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,550
You know what amazes me about New Jersey
is how they still support Jon boat.

938
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:50,590
Jon Bon Jovi or the Bon Jovi bend to the
point that that band can sell out giant

939
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:55,170
stadium
still.

940
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,320
Okay.

941
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,580
Unbelieve let's Jersey for it's
70,000 people singing, singing along.

942
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,280
Lay Your hands on me.

943
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,420
Your love is not bad.

944
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:12,300
Med is to [inaudible].

945
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,390
Whoa.

946
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:19,610
Fucking acid wash as far as
the eye can see, dirty jersey.

947
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,830
Actually, I think New Jersey underrated
is New Jersey. It's fucking phenomenal.

948
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:29,860
All these New York snobs,
Paul Versey being one of them.

949
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:35,020
I'm really trashing him this week.
Paul versus your typical New York snob.

950
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:37,290
And I hope you're listening
to this, Paul, our help born,

951
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:42,250
somebody sends this to you. Um, yeah,

952
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:43,120
he's,
he's a snob.

953
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:47,140
He's one of those guys who just thinks
because he's on the other side of an

954
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:49,390
imaginary line that all of a sudden,

955
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,450
I don't know what that the
trees are greener. The grass is,

956
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,360
I don't know what the fuck it is.
You know what I really realize,

957
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:02,810
like most New Yorkers judge New Jersey
on their drive to Newark Airport where

958
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:07,570
they go by all those chemical plants,
look at it. It's so fucking shit hole. Oh,

959
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,463
right.

960
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,670
Despite the fact that all some of
the most major celebrities live here,

961
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,540
we think they live next to the plant.
You know,

962
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:22,490
all those fucking guys down on Wall
Street, the children of the Illuminati,

963
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:26,630
they all live out there. And
Red Bank with their fucking, uh,

964
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,170
Rockefeller estates.
I know,

965
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:34,140
but they got New Jersey license
plates. Therefore it must suck. Anyway,

966
00:59:34,141 --> 00:59:38,270
let's get back to the
scapegoat. Um, so basically the,

967
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:39,520
uh,
you know,

968
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:43,760
the priest would take a day
off from dental and kids
and he'd lay his hands on a

969
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:47,600
farm animal and one would think he
would grab the horns and then start

970
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:50,360
fornicating. But this,
that's another story.

971
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,900
What they would do with the goat is
he'd lay his hands on it and he would

972
00:59:55,911 --> 01:00:00,080
basically, somehow, I guess after
everybody confessed to this douche bag,

973
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:05,081
he would then place all of the sins on
the goat and then they would just banish

974
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:10,310
the goat and send it out of town with
all the sins in everybody's souls.

975
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:13,910
We're going to be clean again. But this
is the funny thing. As the goat left,

976
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:17,960
people would line up on either
side of the street and they would,

977
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,830
they would heckle the
goat and jeer at them. Eh,

978
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:25,850
you fucking adulterous piece of shit.

979
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,500
Yeah.
Why don't you jump off again?

980
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:34,430
You can't just yelling about
the sins that they did.

981
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:39,260
I don't know what it was. Yeah. It
keeps stealing from the pot at work.

982
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,500
You selfish prick,
yelling at a farm animal,

983
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,130
you know,
I swear to God,

984
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:51,131
I would love to have a segment on here
of all this stupid fucking things that,

985
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,560
that, that they do in religion
that people, you know.

986
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,580
Yeah,

987
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,290
there's no fucking way,

988
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,940
there wasn't somebody like me back
then go into it. This is fuck.

989
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,600
Why are we yelling at a goat?
You know?

990
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:15,300
I mean how you're banged somebody
fucking wife. You stole money from work,

991
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,830
you know,
you're booted an old lady in the ass.

992
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,730
Do you really think it's in the
goat now and it's just walking?

993
01:01:23,731 --> 01:01:27,930
I just don't fucking get it. Even if they
filled your head up with it as a kid,

994
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:31,260
at some point you gotta be looking
at it like this is a fucking goat.

995
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:32,810
Okay.

996
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,220
It's got nothing to do with it.
So anyways,

997
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:37,310
they would just Jared this thing and
they'd send it out of town and then

998
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:40,640
everybody would be absolved and I
don't know where to go. It would go.

999
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:43,760
Sometimes they say they take the goat
and they would throw it off a cliff,

1000
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,510
you know? I know it's extra painful
for me because I fucking love goats.

1001
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,930
I really do.
I was actually feeding some this morning.

1002
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,280
I don't know what it is about them.
I think they're fucking hilarious.

1003
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:02,380
You know I got this buddy. He lives out
here, right? He's got this giant house,

1004
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,610
there's all this fucking land
and he's got farm animals,

1005
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:11,170
farm animals on it and I'm thinking he's
got these fucking things because he's

1006
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:15,150
like me. He's, he likes, he thinks
goats or funny or whatever. And it is,

1007
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:20,151
and I found out that there's tax laws
out that if you farm on your land,

1008
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,590
you only have to pay
property taxes on one acre.

1009
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,730
So he went out and got these goats.
He doesn't even give a shit about it.

1010
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:40,720
Can you fucking believe that he's got
like 10 goddamn goats and he has to go out

1011
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:42,350
there with this bucket of feed every day.

1012
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,540
He's got to feed these things and it's
hard as an in it. That's what kills me.

1013
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,880
It's just just pay.
It's just paid the taxes.

1014
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,281
If I,

1015
01:02:56,281 --> 01:03:00,660
it would be worth it to not get up there
with that lunch pail of cheerios every

1016
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:01,560
fucking morning.

1017
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,230
Okay?

1018
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:07,490
Jesus fucking Christ. What is what? It's
just money. It's paper. Who gives a fuck?

1019
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,320
You just, you know, work a couple extra
hours. Fuck it. What do I owe you?

1020
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,770
You sit down, you're writing
numbers on a piece of paper.

1021
01:03:15,771 --> 01:03:20,270
You stick it in a magic envelope. You'll
fucking lick it. You send it out next.

1022
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:28,280
Jesus Christ are you gonna sit there
and have a bunch of goddamn livestock.

1023
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,790
It's fucking guys swear to God.

1024
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,270
Okay.

1025
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:38,860
If, if, if you had a Giraffe, oh, what
do you guys want? What do you guys want?

1026
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:43,780
Hang on. This is the hotel.
Yeah, sorry about that.

1027
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:44,830
I had to go answer the phone.

1028
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:47,050
I couldn't even figure out
how to work the fucking phone.

1029
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,600
He's probably somebody above me
that was probably yelling too loud.

1030
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,320
God knows what they are mad about.

1031
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:55,220
Okay.

1032
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,690
Anna, just thinking about some of
the Shit I've made fun of. You know,

1033
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,990
Jesus beastiality and Bon Jovi

1034
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,340
and they all hold the same
weight here in New Jersey. Um,

1035
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:10,470
the hell was I talking about? Oh yeah.
This fucking guy. I swear to God, if he,

1036
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:14,500
if he would get a giraffe, you
get like five giraffes. If,

1037
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:16,730
if he only had to pay
like a quarter acre tax.

1038
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:18,500
Okay.

1039
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,100
They always amazes me when people
like that in the money, you know?

1040
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:23,790
Okay.

1041
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,900
I mean, I obviously give a fuck about
money. I want to have enough to survive.

1042
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,553
But uh,

1043
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,320
the amount of shit that didn't
work and I never took it back.

1044
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:36,720
Okay.

1045
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,910
Just blows my eye.

1046
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,860
I've probably kept at least 25 grand worth
of shit that doesn't work in my life.

1047
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,550
I just gotta you gotta be shitting
they same as what? The fucking prime.

1048
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:53,450
He's fucking pieces of shit and I go off,
then my girl goes to last.

1049
01:04:53,451 --> 01:04:55,580
You return it. Ah, not doing that shit.

1050
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,230
Standing down there with the sales slip,
like some angry old fucking lady.

1051
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:01,064
I'm not doing it.

1052
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,780
Who to hell would be calling me now
I'm all self conscious about whatever.

1053
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:09,930
If I'm too loud, knock on
my door, I swear to God.

1054
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:13,730
I bet it was the Bon
Jovi Shit. Um, anyway,

1055
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,830
so let's get on with the podcast. This
is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody,

1056
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:21,190
if you're to this podcast,
welcome. Um, this is yes,

1057
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:24,400
and if you're thinking this is extra
dirty and extra angry this week, no,

1058
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:27,940
this is how it is every fucking week.
All right. Do one of these every week.

1059
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:31,750
I do them on Monday mornings because I
know most people hate their jobs or they

1060
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:35,770
hate their commute. They hate their
spouse or they hate themselves,

1061
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,260
you know, and they need,
they need to brake.

1062
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,150
And it's also a great way to horror
out wherever the fuck I'm going to be.

1063
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,440
Uh,

1064
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,660
speaking of which I am
going to be in a Columbus,

1065
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,850
Columbus, so Ohio at the funny
bone down at the mall. Dot.

1066
01:05:55,851 --> 01:06:00,080
Bragen on the, uh, September
9th, 10th and 11th.

1067
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,570
That is my next gig. I'm gonna try
to go to that, uh, Ohio state game.

1068
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:11,750
You know, it's in September. That's
always a dangerous one. You know,

1069
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:14,810
to go to a college football game is
September. Who were they playing?

1070
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,350
They playing Wentworth
technical institute.

1071
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:22,880
You know,

1072
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,820
I'm new to college football the last
couple of years and evidently that's what

1073
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:26,654
they do.

1074
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,800
They've got all their cupcake games in
the beginning of the year and I guess

1075
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:34,490
these other colleges,
uh, they pay money to,

1076
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,970
to play these giant teams and get
the living shit kicked out of them on

1077
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:39,140
television just to,

1078
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:44,300
I don't know what to expose to get TV
exposure for their school. I have no idea.

1079
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,730
Speaking of scapegoats,

1080
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:50,120
their entire fucking division three team
goes out there a bunch of up against a

1081
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:54,050
bunch of roided up division one guys
or whatever the fuck they're doing now.

1082
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:57,390
I don't know. And then they get the shit
kicked out of him, but I don't know,

1083
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,710
every once in a while an
Appalachian Mountain state

1084
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,400
community college will beat a Michigan.

1085
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:07,190
So I don't know who they're playing that
weekend, but I'm going to go down there.

1086
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:09,583
Uh,

1087
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,850
I was looking forward to it until I spent
fucking 14 straight days on the road.

1088
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,250
But, uh, anyways, the podcast.
Um, anyways, if you want it,

1089
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:22,310
if you wanted me to read any emails, any

I interview interesting people.

1103
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,690
I've only done one of them,

1104
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,320
but I like to speak of them as if
it's a giant library. I got one.

1105
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:17,321
The 99 cents is a great
to contribute 99 cents.

1106
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:21,440
Andy gets something if you want to
listen to NFL football star, right?

1107
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:22,820
Tackle Ephraim Salaam.

1108
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,480
Talk about trying to rip
somebodies voicebox out as they,

1109
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:31,070
as the guy tried to fucking break his arm,
that interview was there and a,

1110
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:36,071
I will be doing Monday morning podcast
selects as I meet interesting guests.

1111
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,180
That's how I'm doing them. All right. When
somebody, uh, somebody different. Okay.

1112
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:43,940
Because,
uh,

1113
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:46,730
I don't want to interview other comedians.

1114
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:48,560
I just feel too many
podcasts or doing that.

1115
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:50,960
I've done too many podcasts
talking about comedy.

1116
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,900
I don't have any comedy stories left.
I really don't.

1117
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,570
And I gotta be honest with you,

1118
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,750
aside from a couple of
people who are really good
interviewers, the Mark Marin's,

1119
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:02,050
Joe Rogan's and that type of shit,
uh,

1120
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:05,990
I probably should have
saved most of them for, ah,

1121
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:07,460
the unmasked that I did

1122
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:08,890
okay.

1123
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,420
With, uh, Ron from Ron and Fez,
I dunno where you can find that,

1124
01:09:13,421 --> 01:09:16,700
but I did one of those
this past week and, uh, ah,

1125
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,120
I've just been running my yap
all fucking week late. Why don't,

1126
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:23,520
why don't we get to something entertaining
here? Uh, somebody sent me a, um,

1127
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,270
this youtube video of this week,
you really have to watch it. Okay.

1128
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:30,940
It's one of those shows. It's
basically, it's a rip off of the view.

1129
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:34,600
It's for broad sitting around and
they got the same thing. You know,

1130
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,940
they got the older one,
they got the sexy one,

1131
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:40,190
they got the one who was fat and then got
her fucking stomach tied up like a God

1132
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:44,410
damn balloon. Not now she's dropping
weight faster than a junkie. Right.

1133
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,380
I don't even know if that's true. I
just looked around them. You know,

1134
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,660
they got the racially mixed chick and
they all got on their fucking shoes.

1135
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:57,850
Right. The little outfits. Uh,
hang on a second. Hang on a second.

1136
01:09:57,851 --> 01:10:01,550
Somebody's knocking. I'll let
you know what this is. All right.

1137
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:05,900
You guys not going to believe this shit
that was security and they just said

1138
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,920
that they had a noise complaint.
There was a lot of, uh,

1139
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,010
the guy comes to the, I
go to the door. Right?

1140
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,410
This is so pathetic that at 43,
I'm getting reprimanded.

1141
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:22,190
I feel like I'm in fucking high
school and I talk like it too. Um,

1142
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,250
let me just the levels here or maybe
turn up yours cause I don't want to get

1143
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:28,160
kicked out of here.
Um,

1144
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:33,170
and say open a door and there's a
security guard. And he goes, Ah, you Ben?

1145
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,173
And I'm like,
no.

1146
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,513
Okay.

1147
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,030
Cause I know he, I know that he knows
my name's bill. Well this is the thing,

1148
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,520
when security interrogates you,

1149
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:54,430
you never offer any information,
you know,

1150
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,780
are you bent? No. And then
I just looked at him like,

1151
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:59,810
is there anything else I can
help you with? And he's like,

1152
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:05,240
and he looks down on a piece of paper.
Oh, are you bill? And I was like,

1153
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:10,010
yes, yes I am. And he
goes, uh, yeah, we, uh,

1154
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,740
we get a noise complaint from
people on either side of you.

1155
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:19,380
Uh, these are VIP rooms on either side
of you. And, uh, talking about, uh,

1156
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:24,780
it's very loud. There's a
lot of cursing. And I'm like,

1157
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:28,320
all right. He goes, is there anyone
else? No. Wait, wait, wait. He told me,

1158
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:33,060
can you step out in the hall?
And I go for what? He goes,

1159
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:35,190
I need you to step out in the hall.
And I said for what?

1160
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,520
And then he just goes into a Spiel,

1161
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,850
you know the fuck the want you to step
out in the hall for [inaudible] am I

1162
01:11:42,851 --> 01:11:43,830
gonna be able to hear you better?

1163
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,340
You know I sit in the racking
like your Goddamn state trooper,

1164
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,420
you're fucking sport coat on. It has
the name of the hotel and the lapel.

1165
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,290
I'm supposed to step out in the hall.
I don't know who you are. Right?

1166
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,280
I'm such a Dick. It's ridiculous. Right?

1167
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:04,110
So I made them basically say I just
didn't doorway and he asked me, he goes,

1168
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,070
is there anybody else in there?
And I was like no. And then yeah,

1169
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,600
that's what he basically said.
I'm being too loud.

1170
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,930
Jesus Christ. I was cursing, I think
it was you realized that he said this,

1171
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:20,931
people on either side trying to sleep
and I was singing Bon Jovi songs at the

1172
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:25,170
top of my fucking lungs.
All right.

1173
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,670
I was also talking about beastiality
and I was trashing Jesus.

1174
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,840
You know what? This hotel is cool as hell
cause when you really think about it,

1175
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:36,060
they probably should have
kicked me out. Um, all right,

1176
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:40,620
so this is going to be my voice for the
rest. This is bill on punishment voice.

1177
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:46,290
I'd like to apologize to everybody
here at the Sheridan. Um,

1178
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:47,971
anyways,

1179
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:51,180
you know what some rich cons on the other
side of the door with a fucking piece

1180
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:54,570
of one of those really fancy glasses
that they think came from France but

1181
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:59,400
actually came from a fucking pottery
barn. Um, if you can hear me,

1182
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:04,290
go fuck yourself. This is what you
get for nuke in the economy. Um,

1183
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,970
all right. So anyways, so
I'm watching this show, these
four fucking broads on it.

1184
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,730
Okay. Listen, nothing too. I had
to be, oh, he told me this is,

1185
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:19,500
this is your one and only
warning next time you will be.

1186
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,200
And he say objected from the hotel.

1187
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:27,160
He had such hacky security,
uh,

1188
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:32,370
like terminology, you
know, a fucking enough.

1189
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,411
I do,

1190
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:38,280
you know how bad I just want to yell
cunt at the top of my lungs right now and

1191
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:41,250
get ejected from the fucking hotel.
Just so I can get out of Jersey.

1192
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:45,060
Maybe I should call up Paul version.
Tell me to, you know, fuck that.

1193
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,980
That's what I'm going to
do after this podcast.

1194
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:50,940
I'm calling up Paul Versey and I'm having
them coming down and get me all right.

1195
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,480
You know, fucking threaten me next time I
come up here. What do you my fucking Dad

1196
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:59,760
fucking douchebag Christ. I swear to God.

1197
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:03,510
You know what's funny about
the male voice is it, uh,

1198
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,500
is it carries,
you ever noticed that

1199
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,950
when there's a couple next door,
you can never, the woman's voice,

1200
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:16,230
you're just hear the guy every
once in a while go, Ooh, the Lulu.

1201
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:22,490
Whoo, whoo, whoo. Yeah.
You never hit the broad. So

1202
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,250
I'm probably gonna get kicked out.

1203
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:26,730
Okay,

1204
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,350
what do I do? And you know
what? Go Fuck Yourself.

1205
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,670
I'll take a cab back to New York.

1206
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:31,780
Yeah.

1207
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:34,750
Then they drop courses.
They probably won't show up
because they're still afraid.

1208
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,550
Afraid of the weather channel. Um,
anyway, so these four fucking broads,

1209
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:40,420
they're on TV,
right.

1210
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,190
And they ended up there talking
about that guy that doing that story.

1211
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:48,070
You know that story where that
dude get his dick cut off.

1212
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,990
I'm gonna have to raise the levels here.
There we go. How's that? Is that better?

1213
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,290
All right. So talking about that
guy who got his dick cut off

1214
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:01,730
his wife, drugged him, tied him to a bed,

1215
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:05,770
cut his dick off, threw it in a
garbage disposal and turned it on.

1216
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,380
And it was basically because

1217
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,970
he wanted to get a divorce from her.
She mutilated them.

1218
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,830
She ended the guy's fucking
life and he saw of quality.

1219
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:22,831
Life is over and these women are
talking about it and lo and behold,

1220
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,490
it's fucking hilarious to them.

1221
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:33,150
They had all they could do to keep a
straight face during the first minute of

1222
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:35,140
setting up the story.

1223
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:39,250
And then all the jokes come and they
are laughing their fucking asses off.

1224
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,770
It's the funniest fucking thing ever.
And this right here,

1225
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:50,460
it's because of that type of shit that
I don't feel that I am misogynistic.

1226
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:56,470
I just don't.
I think that I am just like women.

1227
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,740
I trashed women the way they trash guys.

1228
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:03,610
It's just nobody pays attention
to the broads. They don't.

1229
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:10,230
Do you think of a guy mutilated a woman
in any shape or form that four guys on a

1230
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:15,340
pregame NFL show would be
laughing about it? You know,

1231
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,980
Sharon Osborne was the guest and she goes,
somebody asks,

1232
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,780
you think the guy deserved, and she goes,
well, it depends on what he did. You know?

1233
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,643
I mean,

1234
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:31,710
that thought is totally overlaps.

1235
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:36,751
The thought of those morons in the
Middle East who cut women's clits off,

1236
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,943
you know,

1237
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,660
it's fucking medieval thought
and it's just considered silly.

1238
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,940
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

1239
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,700
But it maintains what
I've always fucking said,

1240
01:16:48,701 --> 01:16:53,701
that women will do a to you exactly what
they don't want you to do to them if

1241
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:55,654
you let them.

1242
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,700
And I think why so many guys are miserable
in marriages is they get married to

1243
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:05,020
fucking young before they really know
how to stick up for themselves in a

1244
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:09,320
relationship. And that's why
before you know it, yeah,

1245
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:14,321
married and all your shit is either in
the basement of the garage and she's

1246
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:17,090
barely touching it and a,

1247
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,650
and you're wondering what the fuck
happened to your life. You know,

1248
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,520
I don't know.
The video is,

1249
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,640
is going to be up on the [inaudible]
podcast.com. You know something.

1250
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:29,500
This is actually,
I like this talking like this.

1251
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:34,501
This is very challenging to try and
be funny with a late night DJ voice.

1252
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:40,930
All right. This next chunk of the
podcast goes out to the ladies. Ladies,

1253
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:44,650
if you're out there and you're single,
hang in there,

1254
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,200
there's a date rape is on the horizon.

1255
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:51,910
This next song rape me by
Nirvana. Who was, I'll tell you.

1256
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,700
Um,
I know that somebody,

1257
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,870
some Vanderbilt on either side to
may going Keith curse thing again.

1258
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,350
MMM. Anyways, uh, being on the road,

1259
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,550
what did I want to talk about?

1260
01:18:05,551 --> 01:18:08,730
Bitches laughing at Dick being
cut off already talked about that,

1261
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:14,210
wanting to go home. Talked about
that. All right. Last week, uh,

1262
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,061
I was,
I,

1263
01:18:15,061 --> 01:18:19,380
we showed that youtube clip about that
guy running on that soccer field and

1264
01:18:19,381 --> 01:18:20,790
getting, uh, you know,

1265
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:24,810
getting beat down by the cops and then
the crowd overwhelms the cops and beats

1266
01:18:24,811 --> 01:18:25,644
down the cops.

1267
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:30,650
And I wanted to hear from the police
officers to just ask basically why they're

1268
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:35,910
such dicks when they pull you over.
Uh, not in a judgmental way, but just,

1269
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:39,570
I'm just basically asking the question,
the way all drivers talk.

1270
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:44,280
So we have a cop responding here. He
says, hey bill, not all cops are assholes.

1271
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,510
Some are just lazy. Uh, the summer
after my sophomore year, oh, no, no, no,

1272
01:18:49,511 --> 01:18:53,260
no. This is a different ones. What
the fuck is the one from the cop?

1273
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:57,890
That's the one I want to hit. Oh,
here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

1274
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:02,980
Let's see if I can read this before
being ejected from the hotel. Uh,

1275
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:04,990
you're not going to be,
the worst is if I do get ejected.

1276
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:08,110
This guy's going to be standing here,
uh,

1277
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,100
with this security fucking
jacket on in my hotel room,

1278
01:19:12,101 --> 01:19:15,520
watching me gather my things.
So once again,

1279
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:19,120
I already have a game plan for that.
If I come,

1280
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:23,230
if there's another knock at my door,
I'm not opening it.

1281
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,720
I'm going to look through the peephole
and I'm talking through the door.

1282
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,670
So we opened the door please.
And I'm going to go, why?

1283
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:36,000
Uh, uh, cause and I'm just
going to ask him straight out.

1284
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:39,270
Am I being ejected from
the hotel? Uh, yes sir.

1285
01:19:39,271 --> 01:19:42,420
You need to let me know and I'll just
bolt the door and I'm going to be like,

1286
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:45,090
listen, I'm going to gather my things.
I'll be out there in five minutes.

1287
01:19:45,091 --> 01:19:47,340
You just sit tight.
All right.

1288
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,650
You with no fucking badge.
All right.

1289
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:57,480
What are you going to do? Take off your
shoe? Is that what you're going to do?

1290
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,270
Try and throw it through the crack
in the door. It's not going to hit me

1291
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,910
fucking asshole. Can you step out into
the lobby until the hallway please

1292
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:10,080
go fuck yourself.

1293
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,533
Huh?

1294
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:16,350
You fucking half a cop?
You half a security guard?

1295
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:22,720
Like step out into the hotel? No, I won't.

1296
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,740
Okay, then I'll just, just
stay there then you douchebag.

1297
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:34,070
Um, anyways, let's plow
ahead. So here's a cup. Uh,

1298
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,750
um, okay, Bill. Uh,

1299
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,740
the thing about this job is basically
that we have no fucking idea who we are

1300
01:20:41,741 --> 01:20:45,670
dealing with at any given time. Just
because someone looks sweet and innocent.

1301
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:48,310
And just because the situation
isn't likely to escalate,

1302
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:52,360
it doesn't mean that they're not capable
of murder or that the situation may go

1303
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:54,820
pear shaped quickly.
I don't even know what that means.

1304
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,410
Okay.

1305
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:59,470
Pear shaped, I don't want to
shape is a pair of shaped like

1306
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,560
what, what, what shape is it before it
goes pear shaped? Is it an apple shape?

1307
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,810
Somebody he can't talk shop
cause you're gonna lose me.

1308
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,970
I'm not that bright a guy. Um, anyways,

1309
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,960
I can't tell you how many times
that someone said to me like,

1310
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:20,550
I'm going to do anything people or what
about that person running upstairs? Hi,

1311
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:24,010
can you eject that eight, eight year
old out of the fucking hotel. All right.

1312
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,490
You know, I feel, I feel
like right now like, uh,

1313
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:30,990
okay.

1314
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:35,150
Either I'm announcing a golf match or,
um,

1315
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:37,480
okay.

1316
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,050
Um, I'm reporting live from
a hostage situation. Okay.

1317
01:21:42,051 --> 01:21:43,610
There talking to him right now,

1318
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:47,150
he still has the weapon
up to the woman's head.

1319
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,280
You can clearly see that
she's frightening. Okay.

1320
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:53,810
There's somebody flanking him on the left.
Oh, he doesn't like, okay, he's fired.

1321
01:21:53,811 --> 01:21:57,140
A shot it missed. And Al, they
just took them down. Oh my God.

1322
01:21:57,141 --> 01:22:02,020
He's been shot in the head
and they have to woman. Um,

1323
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:05,420
anyways, plowing ahead
here. Um, so anyways,

1324
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,840
the amount of time just got pulls people
over and the person behind the wheel

1325
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:13,700
says like, I'm going to do anything.
People think that I know. Oh,

1326
01:22:13,701 --> 01:22:14,151
the people,

1327
01:22:14,151 --> 01:22:18,530
the drivers and stuff think that I know
them their whole lives and know that

1328
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:21,740
their Cape, that they're incapable
of harming anyone. But I don't,

1329
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,180
I always think back to the academy and
all the videos we watched of cops getting

1330
01:22:26,181 --> 01:22:31,181
killed or nearly killed because they
made one mistake or had a lapse in the

1331
01:22:31,671 --> 01:22:35,210
paranoia that keeps us
safe. See that? I knew it.

1332
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,780
I knew it was something that they
showed them at the academy. I said,

1333
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:42,650
another thing to remember is that there
is a gun at every call and every traffic

1334
01:22:42,651 --> 01:22:44,180
stop the gun on my belt.

1335
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,080
No Man is invincible and a lucky
punch can knock me unconscious,

1336
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:52,700
leaving me vulnerable to take to them
taking my weapon and killing me or others.

1337
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,980
For this reason,
we like to keep some distance.

1338
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,290
We don't like to be touched in a bubble.

1339
01:22:57,470 --> 01:23:01,460
We can't allow people to get the
opportunity to take control of our weapon.

1340
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:06,970
Um, so when someone's sir, uh, squarely
or not listening to my commands,

1341
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,350
they may get cuffed and put in the back
of my car until everything is figured

1342
01:23:11,351 --> 01:23:15,610
out. They may not like it, but I am
going home at the end of my shift,

1343
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:20,110
not to the morgue. Uh, that
leaves another point of control.

1344
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,810
No one likes to be bossed
around and told what to do.

1345
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:24,130
But when the police are there,

1346
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,430
were there for a reason someone called
us or we have a reason to believe that

1347
01:23:27,431 --> 01:23:32,290
we're needed. Once we're there, we have
to be in control. We call the shots, not,

1348
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:37,510
um,
not forgo or to be on a power trip,

1349
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:40,450
but because if we lose control,
we're fucked. It's our ass.

1350
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:43,140
If someone gets hurt and our president,
and it's literally Rs,

1351
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,350
if we get hurt or killed,

1352
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:47,470
if someone thinks that they can
do what they want or walk over me,

1353
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:52,240
how am I supposed to do my job? Uh,
as for the videos you recently posted,

1354
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:55,870
those cops with the name changer
were absolutely terrible.

1355
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:00,580
If there is a lawful warrant for
that guys arrest despite the reason,

1356
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:04,540
uh, it is their job to arrest him. Um,

1357
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:09,460
the suspect knew about the warrant.
I didn't know what video is.

1358
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:12,820
It didn't take care of it. Now he
asked to see a judge they should have,

1359
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:16,570
they should have used much more
forced to take them into custody.

1360
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:21,160
But the reality of it is you can't just
be able to keep passively resisting a

1361
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:25,990
cop until, until the cops let you
go. Uh, they can't let you go.

1362
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,840
All right, here we go. With the
video at the stadium was disturbing.

1363
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:32,080
They shouldn't have been. Obviously
jabbing the guy with their batons,

1364
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,270
but they had the right
to take him into custody.

1365
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:37,810
People running around sports fields
isn't and shouldn't be tolerated.

1366
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,830
Are they supposed to stop the game and
wait for him to be finished with running

1367
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:44,290
around?
What if he assaulted or killed an athlete?

1368
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:46,720
Then everyone would be crying
that the cops didn't do anything.

1369
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,660
There's a great point.
Also when we deal with people,

1370
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,920
90% of the possible danger
from them is their hands.

1371
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:58,660
If you're laying on your hands and I
can't see them, I will expect the worst.

1372
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:02,020
How am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to know what they are?

1373
01:25:02,021 --> 01:25:05,410
Lay that they aren't laying on a weapon.
Uh,

1374
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:10,300
when I want your hand gimme your hand or
I will use force to get them out. Yeah,

1375
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,390
they go, uh, one last thing is tasers. Uh,

1376
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:19,630
they are amazing tools. I've been
tased and training and yes, it sucks,

1377
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:23,320
but it beats getting thumped or
shot. Uh, we're in the old days,

1378
01:25:23,321 --> 01:25:26,080
a guy may get the crap beat out
of him or his brain can cost.

1379
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:28,330
Now he gets an electric
ride for five seconds.

1380
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:32,170
It's also amazing because the suspect
can be cuffed while being taste.

1381
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,340
Basically less chance for everyone to see,
to get seriously hurt.

1382
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:40,720
Why should I risk getting seriously hurt
or killed going hands on with someone

1383
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,770
when they can just be taste. Um, that,

1384
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:47,380
you know what somebody told me a
long time ago, if you want to make,

1385
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:49,210
if you get pulled over by a cop,

1386
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:55,230
a great way to help them relax and maybe
bring down them being a dick to you is

1387
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:59,740
a have your hands where they can see them.
You know,

1388
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,860
if it's during the day, I always put
on like right on the steering wheel.

1389
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:08,720
I get pulled over a lot by
the way. Uh, not as much. I
guess back in the day I did,

1390
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:13,460
cause I used to just drive 80 miles an
hour anywhere I was going, you know,

1391
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:17,210
there's only so many fucking
farm she can look at. Um,

1392
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,520
it was funny. So I'm still nervous
about getting thrown out of here.

1393
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:25,270
And the only reason why is because some
of the roads are washed out and I don't

1394
01:26:25,271 --> 01:26:27,260
know where the fuck I would go by.

1395
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:30,100
I don't know why I'm nervous because
I am now speaking in a speaking tone.

1396
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:31,540
If I'm not allowed to speak,

1397
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,730
this is actually great stuff. What if
I show the hotel security my hands,

1398
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,020
maybe he'll allow me to stay.

1399
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,130
So anyways,
um,

1400
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:46,070
okay.

1401
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:49,610
Yeah, I put my hands right on top of the
steering wheel where they can see them.

1402
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,040
Um,
if it's a sunny day,

1403
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:55,550
I have one hanging out the car
window where they can see it.

1404
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:59,720
And the other one I just put on top of
my head, like an ape chilling out in, uh,

1405
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,550
in the zoo.
You know,

1406
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:04,270
when they sit there and they just have
that one arm draped over their head,

1407
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,470
uh,
I sit like that.

1408
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:14,140
And then when they show up, I just had
my hands on the steering wheel and, uh,

1409
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,230
and you know what,
there's still assholes,

1410
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:24,240
you know, it's kind of a
crap shoot, you know, so,

1411
01:27:24,241 --> 01:27:25,980
but I think this guy run
up a lot of great points.

1412
01:27:25,981 --> 01:27:27,840
What the fuck is he supposed to do?
And that's a great point.

1413
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:29,880
If the guy ran on the field and
did something to an athlete,

1414
01:27:29,881 --> 01:27:32,460
then they would blame the security and
they would be screaming and yelling at

1415
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:33,510
them,
you know,

1416
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:36,180
which probably goes back to the weather
channel then if they don't scare the

1417
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:39,570
living shit out of people that they
would get blamed for not warning people.

1418
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,890
But I think it has more to do with, uh,
scaring people, gives them great ratings.

1419
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,540
Um, so I don't know any
more cops want to weigh in.

1420
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,320
I, here's one for you. I want to know
what, what do you guys think about that?

1421
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:54,750
You can anonymously
talk about this as cops,

1422
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,850
that kid who got shot on
the subway platform and died
new year's Day in Oakland,

1423
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:05,520
um, they do definitely
wasn't being compliant. He
definitely wasn't giving them,

1424
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:11,070
showing them his hands. And this guy, I
dunno, he's like the Manchurian candidate.

1425
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:14,820
All of a sudden the guy said the wrong
thing. The guy's laying on his stomach.

1426
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:16,900
Okay.

1427
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,870
One cops got his foot on his
neck. I mean, the dude is down.

1428
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,250
And all of a sudden this
one kid just stood up,

1429
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,520
takes out a gun and just shoots the
guy right in the back. And I do,

1430
01:28:27,521 --> 01:28:30,820
it's like what the fuck is shot me?
And he ended up dying.

1431
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:33,890
Um,
you know

1432
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,050
what about that one?
That's, that's, that's one,

1433
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,530
this is what I should say for the podcast.
So like,

1434
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:43,050
cause that's what I want to ask and I
didn't want to like just have so many go

1435
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:47,790
on there anonymously and just say what
you think about it should have that cop

1436
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,390
gone to jail because uh,

1437
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:56,510
he got what basically usually happens
when a cop shoots somebody is he got off?

1438
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,890
Um, I dunno, but

1439
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:05,490
I don't want to, I don't want to do
this whole cop thing attack and cops,

1440
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:10,260
I'd like to try to create some sort of
forum where you can actually anonymously

1441
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:15,450
present your side and that worry about
pissing off other cops or worry about

1442
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:18,360
pissing off victims or any of that type
of shit. Cause I think it's, I don't know,

1443
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:21,510
it's one of those things for
some reason I guess I know why.

1444
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:25,190
The reason is it's too much shit at
stake so people don't talk about it. Um,

1445
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:27,240
that could have been a lot more fun topic.

1446
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,490
I didn't have to speak
in my time out voice.

1447
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:34,440
This is officially the first Mlm podcast.
Timeout on. Oh wait a minute then.

1448
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,180
Fucking old bastard downstairs.

1449
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:38,250
Yeah.

1450
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,410
You know something?
I think I'm allowed asshole.

1451
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:42,590
Okay.

1452
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:47,030
I think that that's what it is. You
know, on both sides of the country.

1453
01:29:47,031 --> 01:29:49,730
I've been told that I'm too loud.
I need to shut the fuck up self.

1454
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,220
They know at some point you gotta look
in the mirror and realize that you,

1455
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:55,070
all right, let's plow ahead of here.
All right. Advice for the week.

1456
01:29:56,390 --> 01:30:01,310
They'll have known this young lady for
a few years and we're very fond of each

1457
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:04,280
other. Uh, but she has had, she's had,

1458
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:08,420
she has a possessive boyfriend with a
stupid haircut in a couple of times when

1459
01:30:08,421 --> 01:30:11,450
she's broken up with him,
she's come to me. Uh,

1460
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:16,340
but then she goes back to macro man.
Uh, this is the thing that bothers me.

1461
01:30:16,341 --> 01:30:18,800
Whenever things have got
gotten sexual between us,

1462
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:22,850
like I go down on her
and blower fucking mind.

1463
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:26,930
This guy has definitely got confidence.
He goes, she never returns the favor.

1464
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:30,140
She gets disgusted.
She even gets disgusted.

1465
01:30:30,141 --> 01:30:35,141
If I sulk in my seat that I didn't
get any dude sulking is like,

1466
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,920
I don't, I'm not gonna sit here and
act like I know what turns women on.

1467
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:44,360
But I can tell you the exact
opposite of turning a woman on.

1468
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:48,290
If you want to have the exact opposite,
Spanish fly would be sulking.

1469
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:52,640
Nothing makes a pussy dry up like sulking.

1470
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:56,330
Just let you know right there. Okay. Um,

1471
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:02,120
but nothing that makes it wetter with
complete indifference. Um, anyways,

1472
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:06,500
once she said callously Oh,
after she did,

1473
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:09,290
after the guy went down to her and
then she, he didn't get a blow job.

1474
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:10,820
She wants callously said,

1475
01:31:10,821 --> 01:31:15,821
have a blank to alleviate my horniness
after having her completely naked on my

1476
01:31:16,701 --> 01:31:20,240
chair worshiping her and
pleasuring her holes,

1477
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,420
Jesus Christ body.
Thank God I'm that yelling.

1478
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:26,330
That one right there where
it kicked me out. Uh,

1479
01:31:26,331 --> 01:31:30,620
it was just me with the Styrofoam Cup.
Another time when we had intercourse,

1480
01:31:30,621 --> 01:31:31,340
we were drunk.

1481
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:35,270
She stopped me halfway through and
she even stopped halfway through,

1482
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:40,450
uh,
shit doing you a favor hand job.

1483
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:42,400
She's never made me come.

1484
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:46,780
These are the only examples of
when she tried to get me off.

1485
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,990
And I'm a good looking chappy,
so it's not that.

1486
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,800
Recently I boycotted her body.
I said,

1487
01:31:53,801 --> 01:31:57,790
let's be friends to be strictly platonic.
I won't even play with her.

1488
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:01,540
NORCS I'm guessing her
titties. Uh, this is,

1489
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:07,050
this has had the result of her trying
to rekindle things like the old magic.

1490
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:13,210
Um, if she's not that into me, what the
fuck is going on? I'm finished with her.

1491
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:17,260
But any insights you can give is a
treasure. All right? First of all, dude,

1492
01:32:17,261 --> 01:32:19,390
you're not finished with her.
Um,

1493
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,900
just halfway through writing that you
probably realized what a PSAP you were

1494
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:26,590
being. All right. Okay. First of
all, who's couldn't? Who you're,

1495
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:30,820
you're fucking with the
psycho. All right. And, uh,

1496
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,250
I don't know if this is a very, this is a
very touchy one to talk about here, but,

1497
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:36,550
um,

1498
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:41,110
this girl strikes me is one of those
girls who wants to be put in her place and

1499
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:45,400
wants to be bent over something and once
a guy to tell her what the fuck is what?

1500
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,180
All right, okay. Consensually.

1501
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:53,410
Do you understand what I mean?
Okay. Don't take this the wrong way.

1502
01:32:53,411 --> 01:32:57,640
Going and just fucking give him a
forearm. Give her a forearm shiver. Right.

1503
01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:01,660
I'm not saying to do
that. All right. You know,

1504
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:04,450
some girls that concert and they
know their account and they want to,

1505
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:08,770
got to basically tell them that
they, it, it could be this,

1506
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,780
I have no idea,
but I could tell you one thing right now,

1507
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:14,730
sulking and keep coming back for more.
You like Charlie Brown,

1508
01:33:14,731 --> 01:33:19,300
she keeps pulling the football and uh,
you know,

1509
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,090
if you want to fuck this girl,
walk away from her,

1510
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:25,680
stop returning your phone calls
and all that type of shit. You,

1511
01:33:25,681 --> 01:33:29,740
you basically started to do that when
you boycotted a body. But then you said,

1512
01:33:29,741 --> 01:33:33,160
let's be friends. That's
a weak move. Okay.

1513
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:38,530
What's this girl I think wants to
see you be a fucking man. All right.

1514
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,590
And you're not,
you're going down on her.

1515
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:43,210
You're pleasing her and
she's doing everything.

1516
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,460
Everything she can to disrespect
you and you're allowing it.

1517
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,613
MMM.

1518
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:56,000
And I think that's turning on off. And I
think she's a fucking statistics psycho.

1519
01:33:56,330 --> 01:34:00,410
So she's getting you off as she's
leaving you with blue balls, you know,

1520
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,730
I don't know.
That might be it.

1521
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,060
Or she might be fucking angry at something
else and she's taken it out on you.

1522
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:10,000
All I now do is walk away from this girl.
Just walk away from our birth.

1523
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:13,820
Some fucking reason. You still want to
bang her one more time. Blow her off,

1524
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:18,290
blow off her texts in or calls
for like a week and a half,

1525
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:22,760
and then randomly answer one.
And when you pick up the phone,

1526
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:28,070
just just have a whatever vibe. Hey,
what's going on? And I being me to,

1527
01:34:28,071 --> 01:34:32,090
to make calls and me, I to make
takes and been busy. What's up?

1528
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:37,400
You want to hang out now?
Why not? Yeah. You know,

1529
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,710
I dunno. What do we want to
handle you for and get blue balls.

1530
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:48,560
You know, you fucking selfish.
You're fucking annoying.

1531
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:50,143
Leave me alone.

1532
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:54,350
You know I was probably too
angry but I'm sorry guys.

1533
01:34:54,351 --> 01:34:58,790
I'm fucking angry right now that
I have to talk like this. Yeah,

1534
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:03,290
just blow her off and just be, you
know, and when you go to meet her,

1535
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,580
meet her in a public place, don't go
over a place where she can immediately,

1536
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:10,670
she's going to dress extra sexy when you
come over there cause she's trying to

1537
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,960
get that power over you again.

1538
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:16,730
Meet her in a fucking pop place and be
talking to her as you kind of glancing

1539
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:18,620
around the room,
you know?

1540
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:23,990
So what I hit on another girl while
she's standing there, I'm telling you

1541
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:29,060
it out and when she asked you
to go home with their, don't

1542
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:34,400
just say I'm cool or whatever,
you know,

1543
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:38,720
fucking blow her off and if she ever
calls you again, she wants to cook,

1544
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:41,120
hang out or whatever,
tell titled to come over to your place.

1545
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:47,120
And the second she starts acting like
a Douche, kick her out. I don't know.

1546
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:51,620
I had shit. It's what sucks about
a girl like that as immediately.

1547
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,160
You got to try and get into her head.
Then you got to start playing games.

1548
01:35:55,161 --> 01:35:58,100
It's not worth it. There's, there's too
many decent girls out there who will,

1549
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:01,910
when they take the dick out, they will
fucking complete whatever you want.

1550
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:03,320
So I would just walk away from her.

1551
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,133
MMM.

1552
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:11,110
Let's be friends, Jesus Christ, body
that and sulking you need to take.

1553
01:36:11,111 --> 01:36:14,200
Those are the two parts of your game.
You need to work on this off season.

1554
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:19,450
All right? And then maybe next
year you'll get the ring. Okay.

1555
01:36:19,451 --> 01:36:24,100
Good luck. All right, next one.
Bill. I'm a cubicle dwelling,

1556
01:36:24,101 --> 01:36:25,960
suffocated engineer in Texas.

1557
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,500
I was rushed through the college
machine with all the rest of the cattle

1558
01:36:29,501 --> 01:36:33,850
destined to find a job,
don some pleated Khakis and live the rest,

1559
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:38,470
live the rest of our lives and has
steadily paid servitude of the man.

1560
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,630
But a few years ago out of college,

1561
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:42,920
uh Oh,

1562
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:46,140
but a few years ago out
of college and I hated,

1563
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:50,350
I think you saying I'm a few years
out of college and I hate it. Uh,

1564
01:36:50,370 --> 01:36:52,920
I wish I'd followed my desire
to be some sort of a writer.

1565
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,940
And after listening to your podcast among
others and hearing from friends that I

1566
01:36:56,941 --> 01:37:01,260
should have, I wish I'd given stand
up a shot. Well, now I'm 30 years old,

1567
01:37:01,261 --> 01:37:05,310
staring down the barrel of 35 more
years as a cozy smug engineer,

1568
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:10,170
making six figures, but hating five
out of every seven days of my life.

1569
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,480
I don't have any wife or kids,

1570
01:37:12,481 --> 01:37:15,690
but I feel like I'm too old to jump
back into being a starving artist.

1571
01:37:15,691 --> 01:37:18,390
What do I do?
Ah,

1572
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,500
this is on you.
All right?

1573
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:27,780
I would never tell somebody who's got a
six figure paying job to jump into this

1574
01:37:27,781 --> 01:37:32,060
fucking awful business. All right? Um,

1575
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,630
but I would never tell you not to do it.

1576
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:39,380
All I got to tell you is you can't
half ass getting into this business,

1577
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:44,850
all right? Or you are going to be,
you think you hate in your life. Now,

1578
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:49,740
uh, just picture hating five
out of every seven days,

1579
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:51,720
except you're making fucking,

1580
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:58,290
you're making low five figures and you're
old now and nobody wants to fucking

1581
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:01,980
book here. And you don't have any wife
and kids, I'm telling you. All right,

1582
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:07,530
I'll give you this advice. If you
decide to become a fucking comedian,

1583
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:11,820
there's no turning back. All
right? And you got to go into it.

1584
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:16,770
You can't even consider quitting.

1585
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,080
And it has nothing to do with fucking
talent and has to do with desire.

1586
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:27,180
I'm telling you. Um,
that's what I would say.

1587
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,130
So what I would do if I was you,

1588
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:34,160
I would keep my six figure job and
I'd start doing some open mics.

1589
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,040
That's what I would do.
All right?

1590
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:42,960
And if you feel in your heart is you're
standing on stage that this is what the

1591
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:44,610
fuck you want to do with your life.

1592
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:50,070
I would do it in a second
because six figures, seven
figures. If you're miserable,

1593
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,650
it's not going to be worth it.
All right?

1594
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,160
But I don't know if you
know you're into comedy,

1595
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:02,700
you know, the way I'm into playing
drums, drums, or a hobby for me,

1596
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,500
I absolutely fucking love them.

1597
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:09,390
But there's no fucking way I would have
always about to climb into a van with

1598
01:39:09,391 --> 01:39:13,800
three other fucking guys,
you know? And he pasta,

1599
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:16,410
I'm not going to do it. It just, I dunno.

1600
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:20,190
I actually played drums and
I realized I didn't have it.

1601
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:25,590
You know, I didn't, I didn't have it as
a musician and I didn't have that drive.

1602
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:30,840
Um, but when I got on stage,
the first time I did comedy,

1603
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:35,370
I just, I never looked back and I was
just like, this is, I'm doing this shit.

1604
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:38,760
So, um, they go,

1605
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:40,950
so you have to answer those questions.

1606
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:44,580
So the best way to do it is
to sign up for some open mics.

1607
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:48,960
I see how it goes and see how you feel.
And like I said,

1608
01:39:48,961 --> 01:39:51,390
if you feel like that's what
you want to do, then I would,

1609
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,460
I would work towards it, but I would
not quit that six figure paying job. Uh,

1610
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,990
you don't just quit your fucking job.

1611
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:04,070
You don't build up your time so you can
swing out of that job into some fucking

1612
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:06,830
paid gigs. That's how I did it. Um,

1613
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:11,670
I kept my day job until I moved to New
York City and I had saved up a bunch of

1614
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:16,620
money. Um, you know, I
had paid off all my bills,

1615
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:18,270
I didn't have a car payment,
I had nothing.

1616
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:22,920
And I moved to New York and I had a
nest egg of fucking money. And, uh,

1617
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:27,510
and yeah, I've told these stories
before. I hate fucking spaghetti.

1618
01:40:27,511 --> 01:40:31,950
Every God damn night,
three pieces of bread filled up my stomach

1619
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:38,340
and I just did stand up every night and
I just did. I just wasn't doing standup.

1620
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:40,500
I was working towards
getting better at it,

1621
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:44,910
analyzing what I was doing wrong and um,

1622
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:50,970
you know, but I would, I would
never tell you to quit your job.

1623
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:54,880
And I would also never tell you that you
can't start comedy at 30 years of age

1624
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:57,700
because you can't. All
right, so there it is,

1625
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:02,440
but at the ball's in your fucking court.
All right. Youtube videos of the week.

1626
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:07,270
Uh, we had an earthquake
here, um, this past week. Uh,

1627
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,090
best earthquake reaction.
This is hilarious.

1628
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:13,810
It's like three guys on the MLB network
or something like talking about baseball

1629
01:41:13,811 --> 01:41:16,240
and all of a sudden the hurricane comes.
Uh,

1630
01:41:16,241 --> 01:41:19,240
it's fucking hilarious because people
on the east coast don't know what an

1631
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:23,720
earthquake feels like a, so they're
sort of looking around like, um,

1632
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:29,700
wait a second. Is anybody else
feeling something moving? Uh,

1633
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:33,220
in defense of them? I was one
of those little shaken ones. Um,

1634
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:38,690
somebody sent some home videos
of Peyton manning as a kid, uh,

1635
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:43,730
running around whining or whatever. But,
uh, I, I'm too hard on Peyton manning.

1636
01:41:43,731 --> 01:41:45,460
He gets fucking ridiculous
how hard I am on this guy.

1637
01:41:45,461 --> 01:41:49,930
But everybody wind is a kid, but at this
still funny as a patriots fan to watch.

1638
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,110
Um,
and here's two that I got.

1639
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:59,830
Um, it's called fuck, fuck the
police one. And this is hilarious.

1640
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,130
This is some guy,
I dunno if he's in Brooklyn or what,

1641
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:08,190
this black dude who knows his rights
has been harassed by the police.

1642
01:42:08,371 --> 01:42:11,020
You can tell his entire life or whatever,

1643
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:15,760
but he's screaming at the cops.
That's the mistake he makes.

1644
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,950
They don't arrest him, but the shit
he's saying, if he would just say it,

1645
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:26,440
if he just said it, I think he would
have been fine, but he's screaming it.

1646
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:28,540
Uh,
and it's really funny.

1647
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:33,580
It's actually the sky goes
on for like 20 minutes.

1648
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,700
And, uh, I've said before,

1649
01:42:36,701 --> 01:42:39,940
it's all about not losing your
shit and this guy loses his shit.

1650
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:44,410
But I don't think he ever gets arrested,
but it's fucking hilarious. Um,

1651
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:46,660
and he has a youtube video of the week.

1652
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:50,230
This was actually suggested
by Paul Versey, uh,

1653
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,980
Oh will forte. And this is a,
a sketch with Peyton manning.

1654
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:57,040
Peyton manning is fucking
hilarious in the sketch. Um,

1655
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:00,550
it's basically will forte,
you know,

1656
01:43:00,551 --> 01:43:03,850
everybody comes walking in there like
a basketball team and they're getting

1657
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:07,870
their asses kicked and will forte comes
in and basically tells people that they

1658
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:12,871
shouldn't quit and that he had a coach
and they played him the song one time

1659
01:43:12,911 --> 01:43:17,350
when his team was down by 60 points and
by listening to the song and amp them

1660
01:43:17,351 --> 01:43:18,184
all the way up.

1661
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:22,510
And then he basically puts on some
fucking song from the 1930s and starts

1662
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:26,530
dancing to it. And it's fucking
hilarious. Underrated for the week.

1663
01:43:26,531 --> 01:43:31,510
Will Forte guy is, is
fucking hilarious. And uh,

1664
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:36,100
please watch the director's cut of
macgruber highly recommended that.

1665
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,310
And what else do we got here?
We got the a woman cuts.

1666
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:41,710
Guy's Dick off all the four.
Brad's laughing at that.

1667
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:46,300
And I got one other one here. What the
fuck is it? Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1668
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:52,400
Um,
I'm the worst.

1669
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:56,510
The fuck did it go? All right.
Oh wait, don't say it too
loud. Don't curse too loud.

1670
01:43:56,511 --> 01:44:00,680
We will eject you from
the Sheridan. Um, oh.

1671
01:44:00,681 --> 01:44:04,130
Future gun owner.
I'll creepy game show host.

1672
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:08,390
There's another one that we have.
Creepy fucking game show host.

1673
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:09,051
She used to see this.

1674
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:13,970
I can't believe that this guy actually
was allowed on air and I showed it to

1675
01:44:13,971 --> 01:44:17,360
Bobby Kelly and he was laughing
at just this guy's fucking,

1676
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:22,190
the game show was basically a mother
and a daughter. You know something.

1677
01:44:22,191 --> 01:44:23,810
They already showed this on tosh point.
Oh,

1678
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:26,090
I really try not to do that because
I figured everybody sees him,

1679
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:27,500
but we'll put it up there just in case.

1680
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,900
But Bobby Kelly actually
showed me another one.

1681
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,060
I don't know where the fuck this took
place. It sounds like it's in Scandinavia.

1682
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:39,770
And this guy calls this kid up to sing
a song and he basically just starts

1683
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:44,480
kissing his back. It's
unbelievably disgusting. Uh,

1684
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:48,470
nibbling on his ear in the back of
his hair is this kid is singing.

1685
01:44:48,471 --> 01:44:52,760
It's fucking brutal.
Um, alright. Overrated.

1686
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:55,520
Underrated for the weekend. Then I'm
going to fucking rap this pie. Holy Shit.

1687
01:44:55,521 --> 01:45:00,440
Hour and 15 minutes. Time flies when
you're whispering in a super eight, um,

1688
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:02,090
overrated hand sanitizer.

1689
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,420
I've been sharing the company restaurant
with a bunch of coworkers who believe

1690
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,680
using hand sanitizer is the equivalent
or even superior to washing their hands

1691
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:11,030
with good old soap and water.

1692
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:15,620
It's not the rubbing alcohol and the
hand sanitizer kills the bacteria and

1693
01:45:15,621 --> 01:45:18,680
destroys virus presence on the hand.
And that's about it.

1694
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:23,890
It does not physically remove the genital
grime deposited on the hands after guy

1695
01:45:24,021 --> 01:45:27,980
has finished jiggling his junk to
get rid of the last drops of pests.

1696
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:32,150
These people also use other commodities
such as the company refrigerator,

1697
01:45:32,151 --> 01:45:36,290
therefore effectively covering every God
damn thing that they touch with their

1698
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:40,370
dead penis and vagina
cells. All right, that guy,

1699
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:45,290
he's not short of descriptive adjectives,
a overrated lawns.

1700
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,740
People dump all kinds of chemicals
to make them look pretty. Personally,

1701
01:45:48,741 --> 01:45:53,120
I prefer a clean water over a pretty
long, uh, overrated. The overnight,

1702
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:57,890
the other night I decided to have a
nice wink and crash out for the night.

1703
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:02,300
So I hop on the generic porn site and
started browsing. Next thing I know,

1704
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:04,340
two hours have passed,
I was still awake,

1705
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:09,140
hadn't ranked and barely even
had a Fleetwood Mac, soft rock,

1706
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:14,240
half Chubb, et Cetera. Uh, I
didn't even watch a full video,

1707
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:17,600
which I think no one really does
total fucking waste. Instead,

1708
01:46:17,601 --> 01:46:21,170
I just use the girl's section of a
Hurley catalog I had laying around,

1709
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:25,370
which worked pretty well just
so we all know. All right.

1710
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:28,430
Underrated paper.
Grocery bags,

1711
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:33,080
plastic bags are given to you by default
at all the grocery stores I've been to.

1712
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:37,820
They should give you paper and if you want
plastic, he should have to ask for it.

1713
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:42,950
Uh, all right. This ends the, uh, comedy,

1714
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:45,920
the Monday first Monday morning podcast,
comedy timeout.

1715
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,990
And I feel lucky because I did
get injected from the hotel.

1716
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:55,890
Um, that's it. I hope you enjoyed
this weird ass fucking podcast.

1717
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:00,300
This podcast was like a nirvana song
started off loud. Then it got quiet,

1718
01:47:00,301 --> 01:47:05,160
but never got loud again. Um, so I
guess it isn't, it's like the first,

1719
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,060
now feels shut the fuck up. All right. Go
fuck yourselves. That's the podcast. Sia.

1720
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:32,340
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible].
