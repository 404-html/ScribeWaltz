1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,410
Dude. Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Bird,

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,030

before Friday, Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:08,864
And

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,450
just checking in on you.
Um, what's going on?

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,950
I am back the United States of America.
Well,

6
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,300
you can get a gun.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,670
You can marry a man and where,
uh,

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,700
I dunno, you can, you
can go get a big goal.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,060
You can do whatever the fuck
you want here man. This is mark

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,530
land of the brave.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,240
Okay.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,960
Well the
land of the slurpee.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,820
Um, yes. Got back yesterday. Uh,

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,980
pretty easy flight. You know,
I thought it was going to be a,

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,310
I was going to be a rough one. Okay. Um,

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,290
got on with my wife
and my lovely daughter.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,560
And of course my daughter
started screaming bloody
murder right in the beginning.

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:03,250
Cause you know, poor thing,
it's tough for him. Right?

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,150
And this fucking guy in front of us,
right? We're flying business class.

20
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,090
Everybody's got a little bit of the
uh, Hey, you know, we almost made it,

21
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,460
didn't we didn't we almost it all

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,660
20 rows away from first class.
Um,

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,400
and my daughter did some high pitched
scream and the guy just fucking put his

24
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,050
hand straight up in the year.
Like really?

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,110
They started and then he started
turning around looking at us.

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,140
So I fucking pop my head up like a
goddamn something to meet his eyes.

27
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,190
Like, dude, a really, it's a
fucking baby. He used to be a baby.

28
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,950
You were on a plane and you were
screaming, you fucking asshole.

29
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,700
People like you have problems with
babies crying, like, you know,

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,320
as much of a cunt that I am, I, I
have not had a problem with that.

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,970
It actually, you know, baby
start crying or playing,

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,350
it makes me set this before it makes
me laugh because they're expressing

33
00:01:56,351 --> 00:02:00,160
literally what I'm thinking.
I'm ready to just start crying.

34
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,550
I don't want to fucking do this,
you know,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,930
how far is it [inaudible]
you born in Queen,

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,770
I guess, right? They,
nobody listens to them.

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,310
They're all standing up this shoving
jackets in the overhead compartments,

38
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:19,360
you know, they're acting like
a bunch of babies. So anyways,

39
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:22,350
but later on the flight, I
ran into the guy up front, uh,

40
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,850
when he was poured himself a drink and I
went up, then I got to drink. I said, hey,

41
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:28,240
sorry about the baby crying.
And he's like, oh no problem.
It's a baby. But both, oh,

42
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,690
now you're a good guy. Now you're giving
them for the rest of the flight. He was,

43
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:35,310
he was cool. He just make it faces at
her and shit. You know, I get it. Yup.

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,300
Yup.
You're paid for business class.

45
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,030
You're about ready to take a 10 hour
flight and some kids screaming bloody

46
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:43,210
murder yet, you know, really
kind of ruins it. But you know,

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,500
that's what they made earplugs for.

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,100
There was like three babies
in our section and uh,

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,550
they were all putting on their own show.
But um,

50
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,600
after a while my daughter settled down,

51
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,800
but she scared the daylights
out of a lot of people. Um,

52
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,960
there's a lot of people that are
just fucking selfish assholes.

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,000
Like they were born adults.
You know, the looks that they,

54
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,450
they've, they fucking give you or the,
we even worse, they'll give you a kid.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,140
It's just like, wow. It makes me feel
better about myself, man. I mean, I,

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,290
I know I'm an asshole,
but Jesus, you know, I,

57
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,360
I stopped short of mean
Muggin of fucking toddler.

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,230
Uh, I know I've probably
done that, not a toddler,

59
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:31,231
but when I see a fucking spoiled Brat in
a store and his parents have no control

60
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:36,070
over him or her and she wants something
or he wants something and they don't get

61
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:40,120
in, they start fucking crying. Oh Man. If
they make eye contact with me, I'll, I'll,

62
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,890
I'll shoot him a look. I admit
it, I'll do it. You know,

63
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,940
I love it when the parent doesn't give,
it,

64
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,060
doesn't give the kid the fucking
toy or the peace, whatever,

65
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,770
the candy bar or whatever
the fuck the kid wants.

66
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,630
I don't know what it is about me about it,

67
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,070
but it just gives me so much joy when
the kid doesn't get what he wants,

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,230
you know? And when the fucking
kid gets what he wants. I just,

69
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:07,800
I always think you fucking pussy.
I always think that, I don't know,

70
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:12,190
it has to do with my childhood has
nothing to do with children or, or, or,

71
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:17,191
or my beliefs in a what we're
trying to do with acis or item.

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Just being honest with you
fuckers. Sorry, I'm after.

73
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,790
I'm punishing these people with my French.
I'm trying to get my American,

74
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,130
my American back together. We speak
American over here. This is America.

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,980
We speak English.
Um,

76
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,670
anyways,
uh,

77
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,360
sought guns and roses for the
first time in my life Monday night.

78
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,960
And uh,
got ridiculously hooked up.

79
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,410
Yeah.

80
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,900
But I'm not going to name any
names and be a douchey here,

81
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,980
but I just want to thank everybody who
fucking was a part of hooking me up.

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,950
And it was insane.
We basically sat on the side of the stage.

83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,380
They gave us these inner ear monitor.

84
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:01,381
So we heard the band mix and you could
hear axle making jokes in between songs

85
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,470
and stuff. You know, if he saw
something, just making a random comment,

86
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,680
it was fucking amazing.
It was amazing.

87
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,710
It was like being in Bill Bella checks
headset and I have to tell you something.

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,520
That fucking show might've been
the best concert I've ever been to

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,153
and

90
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,900
I don't even know where to begin.
First of all,

91
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,310
we're in a fucking giant
field right outside of Paris.

92
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,750
The Sun was going down,
there was all these beautiful clouds.

93
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,070
And my view is basically
I see the backs of, uh,

94
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:41,840
of all the musicians s which
with the son fucking going down,

95
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,650
I got some killer. I mean granted his
cell phone pics and everything. But like,

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,130
first of all,
they didn't tune down any song.

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,690
They played every song in the exact same
key that axle sang them in 30 fucking

98
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:56,870
years ago. And he crushed it. I,

99
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,800
I can't overstate how well that
guy's voice, how well he song,

100
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,810
how great his, we sounded like the fucking
record. And they did a three hour show,

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,570
three hour show. I'm an old man.
Okay. Fucking hour and a half.

102
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,370
I'm, I'm usually ready to be done with
it. But this three fucking hours in,

103
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,230
I was actually sad when it was over.

104
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,963
MMM.

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,930
I, I don't even know where to
be. It was fucking unbelievable.

106
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,200
Slash took this amazing
solo axles. Uh, uh,

107
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,000
voice sounded incredible.
Duff sang a song and then they had,

108
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,860
they threw some covers in there too.
You know,

109
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,110
I don't want to ruin the show for
people who want to go see him,

110
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,760
but every covered they did,

111
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,423
mmm.

112
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,780
Was by some other B singer
that sang really up in the
higher register and a axle

113
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,090
crushed all of it.
And um,

114
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,430
it's the best the band is sound sounded
since way back in the day. I feel, uh,

115
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,270
back when that classic one that they
aired on MTV that I watched a thousand

116
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:03,160
fucking times, that one where they
were, I think they were at the Roxy.

117
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,820
Was that what it was in New York?
And um,

118
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,110
okay.

119
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,790
I remember that was on,
I had taped it on VH VHS tape on the fee.

120
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,750
And there was, who's that fucking
VJ with the long blonde hair?

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,850
And he used to wear the leather jacket.

122
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:22,750
He was from Europe or
something and he was going, uh,

123
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,760
this band supposed to be the next big
thing. If they live long enough. Right.

124
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,090
What's amazing is 30 years
later they're all alive. Uh,

125
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:34,720
but that was the big thing.
Um, but anyways, I, I,

126
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,770
it was fucking unbelievable.
That's all I'm going to say.

127
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:43,180
So if you get a chance to see them
on this tour, definitely go see them.

128
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,490
Like I said, I, I can't remember the
last time they sounded this good a,

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,880
this might be the best day ever
sounded so, and um, and that's it.

130
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:56,860
And Neil was going fucking nuts
during the show. She actually,

131
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,800
she actually got a reaction from duff
and slash and I'm sorry, and a axle,

132
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,140
duff big smile laugh and watching how
crazy Neil was going and then actual

133
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:12,460
actually imitated the dance that
Nia was doing. So needless to say,

134
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:17,200
she had a great fucking time and, uh,
I am smiling now thinking about it.

135
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:21,010
There was, it was the perfect
fucking way to end that trip.

136
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,380
Um, so there you go. Um,
and now I am back and I,

137
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,070
Oh pilly Oh, freckles is
jet lagged. I did my best.

138
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:31,660
I stayed up until eight o'clock.

139
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,033
MMM.

140
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,820
You know, last night. But then the old
Kiddo got up at three in the morning,

141
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:43,260
so I've been up since three and that's
been a mess. Um, I uh, oh by the way,

142
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:48,261
I finally broke into that fucking bottle
of that chocolate salted vodka lik core

143
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,940
and what it was something I don't
even, what the fuck it was. Holy Shit.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Was that a hangover?
I don't even have that much.

145
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,030
I was just drinking vodka was just
pouring it into kind of like, you know,

146
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,990
spruce it up and it tasted
like ass. But uh, you know,

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,150
it was given to me by a relative,
so it was like, I got it.

148
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,460
I got it out of respect for them.
I got to drink some of this shit.

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,500
And the next day I woke up and I was like,
oh my God.

150
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,910
It wasn't even a hangover. It was like
a body pain. And I felt like I was,

151
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,790
I was going to Puke. Like, I just
need to get something to eat.

152
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,560
So I go down, I go down
the hall, the hall,

153
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,310
I'd say sample.
Oh.

154
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,390
However the fuck they talk over there
and I'm looking for a bull jury that is

155
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,830
open. Yeah. And I find one night
I just got a couple of croissants,

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,130
a couple of pounds do
shock a lot now for me,

157
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,940
I was getting it for everybody
and uh, but I, I was,

158
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,970
I was fucked up until I got on the plane
and I basically had to start drinking

159
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,540
again. It was one of those sort
of hangovers and uh, oh my God,

160
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I got so mad at my wife where they had
us with a 6:20 AM pickup and my wife

161
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:08,670
goes, man, that sounds kind of early. You
know, we not taken off til 10 20. Right.

162
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:13,080
And she pushed the pickup
back by 40 minutes, you know,

163
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,810
and I love how she doesn't live in Paris,

164
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,300
made this judge that same sounds early.
So for an extra 40 minutes asleep.

165
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,570
And,
um,

166
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm one of those people if they tell
you to get there two hours before I get

167
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:33,360
there two hours before, you know,
not a care in the fucking world.

168
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,620
Cause I know I don't do well with
that kind of stress. All right,

169
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:39,840
you want to stick me in a
bar with a bunch of animals?

170
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,690
Fucking throwing shit at a stage.
I can handle that.

171
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,310
I don't know why cause I grew up with it.

172
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,180
A bunch of animals but like when it
comes to that type of shit. All right,

173
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,020
well you looking at,

174
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:53,310
you know you got your wife and your kid
and you're looking at a 10 hour flight.

175
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,160
If the fucking people who live
there and know where the airport is,

176
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,320
say it's a to to get picked up at
six 20 to get picked up at six 20.

177
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,460
Okay.

178
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,960
She pushed it til seven

179
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,850
and everything was going great till we
got there. Those Air France, grumpy,

180
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,200
grumpy fucking people working there.
We asked this lady was like no help.

181
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,390
Where the fuck do we stand in line?
Where do we check in?

182
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,560
They tell us this one line.

183
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:24,880
We stand in it and then we get all the
way to the front and this fucking asshole.

184
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,770
Okay.

185
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,890
Is they knew him is you, you got to do it
online. The WWE beard. You do. But, but,

186
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,270
but it's like fuck it.

187
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,450
Some of wearing the exact same shirt as
you told us this was the right line and

188
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:37,920
he was just like, it was one of
those guys who just takes joy. Okay.

189
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,600
Fucking ruining your day. So then
you, then you had to go over it.

190
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:44,230
You had to basically check yourself in,
put the tags on your bags,

191
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:46,330
weigh your bags through the whole thing.
I was a fucking,

192
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,440
I was working at the airport.

193
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,210
Yeah,

194
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,100
I'll tell you, I'm just, give me a
self, a tip at the end of it. Okay. Um,

195
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,980
it was ridiculous. And then
we finally get through, um,

196
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,750
you know, all know, and then
she had to go, you know, go,

197
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,800
go in exchange or whatever the fuck you
do there with getting your tax money

198
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:07,480
back.
She had to go fucking do that.

199
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,770
We stood in the wrong line and time's
ticking. Time's ticking. Time's ticking.

200
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,330
And we got picked up 40 minutes later,

201
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,460
then they said we should
have and next thing you know,

202
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,980
we finally get through fucking
security and I'm just going like,

203
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:22,480
this was so fucking stupid.
We get through security and we have to,

204
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,740
before we even go, not security, we get
through customs, we get through that.

205
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:27,574
Then we have to,

206
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,330
we've discovered at that point we
got to walk over half a terminal,

207
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,800
get on a fucking train before we get
into this shit show security line.

208
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,160
And uh, yeah, we were
going through the line.

209
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:42,430
They were already boarding the plane
and I, oh my God, was I fucking mad?

210
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,420
I was just like, it wasn't so,
it didn't have to be this way.

211
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,030
So my wife does what she always
does when she's wrong is,

212
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,890
and she knows she's wrong.
She just immediately apologizes,

213
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,193
you know?

214
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,210
So then now what am I supposed to do? So
now. Okay. Oh well she said she was sorry.

215
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,540
She said, you're right. I
messed up. I'm sorry. But yeah,

216
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,890
but now we're still in this situation.
I don't know.

217
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,890
My wife would do that in war,
you know,

218
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,800
if I was up on a fucking roof and she
gave away our position and then all of a

219
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:17,010
sudden we're taking on fire and she'd
just be like, you're right. I'm sorry.

220
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,870
I shouldn't have shuffled
my feet like that. What?

221
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:26,700
I said I was sorry. You know
what? They do that shit. What?

222
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,400
I thought it was, sorry, I didn't know.

223
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,210
You know what you just like being mad,
you know,

224
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:36,600
and that they just turn the whole
fucking thing around on you.

225
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,520
So I'm sitting there,

226
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:42,120
go on their board and the fucking plane
right now and all these fucking animals

227
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,270
are going to be taken our overhead
compartment space and I'm just

228
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:48,540
catastrophizing. I'm fucking, I'm
like that dude and platoon, look,

229
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:53,541
I got a bad feeling about this
man and she is acting like a,

230
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,500
what's his face and Kelly's
heroes. Um, uh, what's his,

231
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:01,110
it's a puts a beautiful bridge
baby. It's going to be there, right?

232
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:02,730
She's all fucking Donald Sutherland.

233
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:05,520
She's all fucking relaxed and
I'm flipping the fuck out.

234
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,970
And of course we get on the
plane, you know, we get there,

235
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,240
they're still boarding the plane.
We get on, everything's fine.

236
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,100
The overhead compartment above
our seats close and I'm like,

237
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:18,090
it's going to be fucking pack was shit.
And I opened up, it was completely empty.

238
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,840
Everything was great. And uh, you know,

239
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,840
then she tries to turn it around
like you see, he see, look,

240
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,410
the planes even leaving late, like
what's the problem? I said, oh,

241
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,310
that's a great idea.

242
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,550
So next time we go to another country
or we're not really familiar with it,

243
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,260
let's leave 40 minutes later and let's
just count on the fact that the plane's

244
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,240
going to be late. Know,
look, I thought it was,

245
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:47,890
sorry. I don't know what more you
want from me. What do you say to that?

246
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,470
It's like, I don't want
you apologizing now. Okay,

247
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:55,070
I got to get the anger out
first. Then you apologize. Okay.

248
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,590
What? I said it was sorry. And then it
all fucking goes away. Jesus Christ,

249
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,210
you know, God forbid I do something
fucking bring it up for nine years. Right.

250
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:10,080
What I said it was sorry. Yes, but
that doesn't, blah, blah, blah.

251
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,320
Anyways, so I'm back here in the states.
I been up since three in the morning.

252
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,150
I got caught up on some of my, um,
some of my shit that I had on the, uh,

253
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,260
I still call it the Dvr, whatever the fuck
he called them digital God damn thing.

254
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:28,400
Now I watched the, a moto
GP race from, uh, Spain.

255
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,130
I watched Jorge Lorenzo
absolutely dominate, um,

256
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,540
I guess he's won two races in a
row for Ducati, right. Davitt CEO,

257
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,100
so crashed out for the second
time in, uh, in two races,

258
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,410
three races I guess.
Um,

259
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,410
so I guess that's causing a
weird situation over there.

260
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:52,040
I don't know much about it,
but I can tell you that, uh,

261
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,080
I'm hoping since divisio seems like
he's rapidly going to be out of this,

262
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,280
that uh,

263
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,210
Lorenzo keeps winning racist because
I would love to see him and mark has

264
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,980
basically go neck and neck for
it the whole way, uh, to the end.

265
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:11,660
You know, I hate when like to guy
basically has it wrapped up in September.

266
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,950
You know, Valentino Rossi made his third
fucking podium in a row. It was great.

267
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:19,130
Cal Crutchfield finally got around that
cut, took him like fucking 20 laps,

268
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,950
but he did it. Um, I
enjoyed it. You know what?

269
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:24,170
I was very tempted to
try and go to that race,

270
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:27,440
but I just couldn't leave my daughter,
you know what I mean?

271
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,950
We had a relative over there helping us
out and, uh, it was going to leave them,

272
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,460
you know,

273
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,810
it just felt weird leaving a con country
that isn't my country and leaving my

274
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:36,980
daughter.
So I said fuck it.

275
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,530
And I was getting a little bit too
caught up in the am turning 50.

276
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:44,030
You only turn 50 once. Yeah. You only
turned 51 once or 49 once, asshole,

277
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,570
you're a dead. So I was like,
all right. You know, um,

278
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
I got hammered on the plane though. My
wife got, she was fucking pissed at me,

279
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,290
um, had a little bit, you know,

280
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,880
I was thinking I was already
going to be on the wagon,

281
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,860
but that's just sit that long ass flight.
And um,

282
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,970
I watched that. Oh, I watched
that fucking movie. Dunkirk nine.

283
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:08,450
All you guys saw it in Imax. I fucking
blew it. I was too busy and I missed it.

284
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:12,770
I watched it on a little airplane, um, TV,

285
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,640
but oh my God.

286
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:18,290
Was that movie unfucking believable and
I knew it was going to be unbelievable

287
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:23,291
because this is thing out here
in Hollywood where when people

288
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,060
cannot handle that somebody is that much
more talented than them. They act the,

289
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,840
they say the same thing.
I had a buddy of mine saw that movie goes,

290
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:39,020
did you see Dunkirk yet? And I was like,
no, I did. And I got to see it. It hurt.

291
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,810
It's unbelievable. He goes, yeah.
He goes, I left. The movie was like,

292
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,620
I don't even know what I just watched.
Like I don't even know what I just want.

293
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:47,930
I think what you mean, you've donated
that fucking so fucking war movie.

294
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:51,870
You asshole. Jesus Christ.
Brush up on the history channel.

295
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,040
World War II hit Liz,
driving the allied forces into the ocean,

296
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,190
made a huge fucking blender
because he made a left turn.

297
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,300
He couldn't resist Paris.

298
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:04,350
He went down to Paris to go down to get a
Boulogne jury to get, you know, a shock,

299
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,390
a lot to panic,
a little fucking frosting.

300
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,690
And His fucking Charlie Chaplin Mustache,
he fucked up.

301
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,820
What he should've done was annihilate
us on that goddamn beaches.

302
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,810
What the fuck he should have done?
It's one of the great military blunders.

303
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,300
Even I know that, I know that cause
Joe Barton, Dick taught me that, right?

304
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,970
Joe [inaudible] Nick is a, is a, uh, he
knows all about fucking World War II. Um,

305
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,950
and then I watched the movie and it was
just basically a about these people,

306
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,080
you know, in, in the, uh, was
it, what's it, the French army,

307
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,580
the English are mainly English army.

308
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,110
There was some French people there
to try and get the fuck out of there.

309
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:42,060
So they didn't die.

310
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,650
I mean it was pretty basic
what was going on there.

311
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,540
But the way it was shot was incredible.

312
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,320
And I've just noticed out here in
Hollywood was when somebody is like,

313
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,300
like when you see a fucking movie at
that God damn level, I mean I don't,

314
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,680
how would you even write that script?

315
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:03,540
It was just so much action going
on with no dialogue. And it was,

316
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,220
it was breathtaking moving. It was
incredible. And like, you know,

317
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,400
one of the great things about knowing
that you're a fucking moron as you can

318
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,110
enjoy somebody else's genius.

319
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:14,880
Yeah.

320
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
I was just sitting there, God, I could
never fucking do this. This is incredible.

321
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,030
And I loved it and his buddy of mine was
just going, yeah. I don't even know why.

322
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,030
It's just watched.

323
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,510
Okay.

324
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,150
Well,
I mean,

325
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,170
I can see if you fucking watched you and
one of those stat films and somebody do

326
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,870
shit on somebody. I don't what
the fuck I just saw, but I have,

327
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,090
I'm trying to forget it.
Um,

328
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I remembered that when that Batman movie
came out with that actor who played the

329
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:42,500
joker and won the Oscar.

330
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,243
MMM.

331
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm so bad with the names and like
his performance is the joker is,

332
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,660
is right up there with anything
I've ever seen any actor do.

333
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:57,530
And I remember seeing this other big
actor after he watched that movie saying

334
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,820
the exact same fucking thing. Like, I
don't even know what I just want. I mean,

335
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:04,790
maybe I'm not smart enough. I don't
know what that movie was supposed to me.

336
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,624
I mean,

337
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,060
okay.

338
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,090
I, and I didn't want to just walk
and maybe you don't, you just watch,

339
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,180
you just watch one of the great acting
performances of all time and it's making

340
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,570
you feel a little fucking
certain way about yourself.

341
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:17,900
Okay.

342
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,940
Give it up. You asshole. What's
the matter? Huh? What do you play?

343
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:22,220
The green lantern and all of a
sudden you fucking can, in a way,

344
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,270
this guy played the joker. Um, I don't
even know what he's just watched.

345
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,220
So anyways, so I watched that movie
and uh, I had a script to read.

346
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,130
I'm a Hollywood guy. Even in business
class, I'm reading scripts, right?

347
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:38,180
That's what I do. Okay. To See, Ooh, which
cop am I going to play in this movie?

348
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,960
So anyways, I, uh, I started,

349
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,190
you know, I went up to
the front, you know,

350
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,280
I was walking my daughter up down
the aisles and then I see this,

351
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,320
they got a bottle of Glenn
and I was just like, Oh shit,

352
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,680
there we go. All this stupid wine
and cheese in this fucking thing.

353
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,310
And I just poured myself a glass of wine.

354
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,290
And when I saw, when I saw that, why
couldn't have done that, I wouldn't have,

355
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,350
I couldn't have done that for my kid. I
know a lot of the flights at Blur, right?

356
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,200
So I brought my kid back and then
that's where I had the glass of wine.

357
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,720
And then I saw that Glen 11 and I
was like, oh, that's what I want now.

358
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:24,370
What the fuck do I do with this?
So I just sucked it down

359
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,370
and yeah.
Then I started drinking that stuff.

360
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,340
And the second I break out like
any sort of fucking brown stuff,

361
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,290
like Nia eyes are on me.
And,

362
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,360
uh, you know, I had the glass of wine,

363
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,860
I had some shitty American food and I
had like three of those Glen Levitz and I

364
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,510
got a fourth one. Right. It's a
10 hour flight. I was pacing it,

365
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,960
I was keeping myself, I was
doing the Keith Richards
thing. He did nice. You keep,

366
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,860
you get, you get nice, right? And
then you just kind of keep it there.

367
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,970
You don't get fucking messy or
whatever. But uh, I got the fourth one,

368
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:58,070
she gave me the eyeball,
so I just set it down right.

369
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:00,710
And then I fucking took a nap
for not more than 20 minutes.

370
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,710
And when I woke up it was gone
and I was looking at,

371
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,940
she fucking told that lady to take the
Goddamn thinks and I had to just sit

372
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,290
there,
you know,

373
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,550
beginning my initial descent and to
just sitting there stone fucking sober.

374
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,460
Yeah.

375
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,293
MMM.

376
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,620
I Dunno. So anyways, that
was my last little hurrah.

377
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,460
So now I'm on the wagon on the wagon,
you know, woke up this morning,

378
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:24,140
he had my steel cut oats,

379
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,650
my two eggs over easy banana
and some strawberries.

380
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,730
Then I'll probably have some Ezekiel
bread with some fucking almond butter.

381
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,440
And of course for lunch
I've already made my keen.

382
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,780
So I learned how that's how you
say it with some black beans,

383
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,650
maybe a little salsa. Then
I'll probably, I dunno,

384
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,860
later on the afternoon have some
exciting chick pea pasta that I'll have a

385
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:53,021
protein size of my hand with some sort
of garden salad and then I'm just going

386
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:58,400
to crush waters and a hit the elliptical
back to that grind.

387
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,430
My vacation is over. No more
questions. No more baguettes,

388
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,500
no more. Glen Levitt. All right.

389
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,530
Back to being regular.
I'm back to fucking Clark Kent.

390
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,600
Uh, it's actually good. You know
something. What's great about eating,

391
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,690
drinking like a pig over
there is you fucking,

392
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,823
you know,

393
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,150
by the way we, we, we, we have, you know,

394
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,850
I told you I had a relative
on the plane too. Okay.

395
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,180
So it wasn't just my wife's sitting there
is her husband got shit faced. Okay.

396
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,070
It was my wife and another relative
staring at me while I got shit faced.

397
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:39,250
I get shit faced. Right. But I got a,
you know, I was definitely tailgating.

398
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,580
How am I going to lay off?
I, I'm going on the wagon.

399
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,800
They got the bottle
sitting right up there.

400
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,010
I paid all this money for business class.
Um,

401
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
I always give her shit. I've given I, you
know, am I going to get into it? You know,

402
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,740
she gives me shit.
What the fuck are you going to do?

403
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,723
Okay.

404
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,470
You know what I should've
done? I should've worked.
What? I'm sorry. You fucking,

405
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:08,270
you can't be drinking all this.
You're going to,

406
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,390
you're going to pass out and you got to
pick anything. That'll be what I said.

407
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:15,500
I was sorry. What? I said I was sorry.

408
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,030
Um, all right, me undies,
everybody. Here we go. Oh Dude. Oh,

409
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:25,460
don't [inaudible] me undies drinking
on the fucking plane. Doo, Doo,

410
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:29,660
Doo Doo beyond these Maya,
Andy's, my wife is a fucking pain.

411
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,990
If I pass out,
she takes my drink.

412
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,630
I wake up and I make a stick and then
she doesn't talk to me for a couple of

413
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:43,220
movies. And then we land
at lax. Where in me undies.

414
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,760
Mandy's. You've definitely heard me talk
about me undies. Hey, who's kidding?

415
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:50,340
Who you've heard me sing about
me on these? You know the fun,

416
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:54,410
comfy undies that feel as good as they
look to those of you haven't tried them

417
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,260
yet. Listen Up. You can get an incredibly,

418
00:24:57,261 --> 00:25:00,530
you can get incredible underwear
sent to your door with me undies,

419
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:03,920
meaning no more hunting around for the
perfect pair at a crowded store and

420
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:07,850
eventually setting for settling for
good enough monies are made with a

421
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:11,180
sustainably source material
from beechwood trees.

422
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,810
Still don't know how you make
underwear out of trees in there. Soft.

423
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,190
Okay.

424
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,690
Fucking Barney rubble shit.
They're naturally soft.

425
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:22,740
Fiber makes a fabric that
won't sag down or write up.

426
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,740
Okay? That's what it is. It's flying.

427
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,010
The underwear flies in formation
with the nuts. Trust me, once you,

428
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,680
you put on a pair,
you're going to get it.

429
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,860
Mondays is so sure you'll love the
first pair that if you're not happy,

430
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:38,280
they'll do whatever they can to get you
into the right pair and if they can't,

431
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,810
okay.

432
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,591
I just realized,
you know,

433
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:43,380
some people's balls hang one
hangs lower than the other.

434
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,460
Maybe that's what the problem is,
you know, get somebody on there.

435
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:50,280
Can you describe your, uh, your genitalia.

436
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,790
Okay.

437
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,790
Um, and if they can't keep
them and they'll refund you.

438
00:25:55,791 --> 00:26:00,140
So it really is risk free to try
the best underwear ever. Okay.

439
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,470
Now are you looking in a
mirror and make sure your left,

440
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:07,010
you're saying your left
testicle hangs lower. All right.

441
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,370
Is there anybody there that can confirm
this can look at you just in case cause

442
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:13,220
we know but would just be packed.
People when they look in a mirror,

443
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:17,360
they get conf confused about which uh,
ball they're looking at.

444
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,410
All right? We're just trying to make
sure that this is, is a wind. Winfield.

Not to be confused with nature's box.

460
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,080
Mother Nature's butchers box.
Put your box delivers healthy,

100% grass fed and grass

00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,650
organic chicken and heritage bread.

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,450
Pork heritage bread breed, B, r, e.

464
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,390

ever effing had. Okay. It's,

467
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,950
it's fucking delicious.

468
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,130
The incredible quality of butcher blocks
meets starts with the commitment to

469
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,620
raising animals humanely before we
kill them and free of antibiotics and

470
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:59,850
hormones. Each box comes with at
least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

471
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,450
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

472
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,740
You can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

473
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:12,660
beef and pork. The mixed box. The custom
box with such, you choose your own cuts.

474
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,060
A Guy, I cannot tell you how many. Oh my
God, that pork chop, that piece of port.

475
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,300
Oh my God, it was fucking delicious. How
about butcher? How put your box works?

476
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,290
First we feed the animals
that we let them outside.

477
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,520
Then we shoot him in the head.

478
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:31,260
Choose from curated boxes including a mix
of high quality beef, chicken or pork,

479
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,490
or customize your own box.

480
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:37,350
Meat is frozen at the peak of
freshness in individual vacuum packed

481
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,160
biodegradable packaging. All meet is
delivered right to your doorstep for free.

482
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:43,770
This is 100% true.
This is exactly what was my experience.

483
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,010
Then you throw it in your freezer.
You thought what you want,

484
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,930
you take out your fucking skillet,
right? You sear it on both sides.

485
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,850
You finish it in the oven,
take it back out,

486
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:57,570
give it a little butter bath
with some fucking garlic. Oh,

487
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,610
is that a tasty portrait?

488
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,830
What's your box believes in a healthier
food system where everyone has access to

489
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:09,240

Can I please hosted the fucking
national spelling bee? Uh,

494
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,330
meat can use it in a sentence.
A, a fucking meet me over there.

495
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,920
Okay.

So I'm going to cut off the healthy high.
Something other convenience.

499
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,220
Think of butcher box is your neighborhood

501
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,710
Choose your delivery frequency
with customs and I's level.

502
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,480
Subscription recipes are
available on butcher box.

503
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:02,800

504
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,720
So you get this great cut of meat.
You don't want to fuck it up.

505
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,210
They'll show you how to season it and
then pretty soon they'll have videos.

506
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,150
They're doing everything but coming
over and cook in this sink for you.

507
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,370

There's nobody on the planet like you
and that may or may not be a compliment

520
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:05,360
depending on how you are. So why would
you buy a mattress built for everyone else

521
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,890
working with the world's leading
sleep experts? That's as a,

522
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,930

Go back to your high school reunion.

523
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,290
What ever happened to you?
I'm a sleep expert.

524
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,000
Helix sleep developed a
mattress that customized to you.

They can even customize each
side for you and your partner.

536
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,340
A very progressive
did not say spouse too.

537
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:06,240
They say partner, right? Although gay
people get married in most states, right?

538
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,710
Maybe you call your dog partner and what

546
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,850
I'm just picturing somebody punching
it like you'd do it with anything else.

547
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:40,190
There's be something more to it than that.

556
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:18,541
I did 50 minutes a yoga this morning
at like four in the morning because my,

557
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:19,564
uh,

558
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,020
my lower body is not feeling good
these days riding on all these goddamn

559
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,340
airplane. So I'm going to go get a
fucking massage today. Have somebody jam.

560
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:31,870
They're fucking elbow into my hammies.
Try to free him up again, you know?

561
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,760
But calves are all fucked up.
Um, I got to Smith Seuss, right.

562
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,590
Fucking kills me in a good
way, right? I swear to God,

563
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:45,700
like my calves when she was pushing down
on it, no one's ever like, I didn't know.

564
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,270
You know, back in the day, if anybody
ever gave me massage debate, anybody,

565
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,090
any part of your body's sensitive
like, yeah, my calves, my calves.

566
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,410
So they would stay away from,

567
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,930
I didn't realize that that meant
they were all glued up and shit.

568
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,790
So this person has been
working on it and I,

569
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,140
I'm literally coming up off the table at
barely any pressure from the elbow and

570
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,970
she goes to see what's, what does it feel
like? Like what, what type of paint I go,

571
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,260
it feels like there's a ball of Hornets

572
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,890
in my fucking calves.
Um,

573
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,610
but I've just been too
busy to have her finish it,

574
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:24,130
get it all back to the
way it used to be because,

575
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,620
because whatever cause in my fucking
life. But I have to tell you man, um,

576
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,330
being a 50 year old man now, if you,
if you could find a good misuse,

577
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,230
uh, the, the quality of life that
you're going to have, you know,

578
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:41,030
if you stretch,
if you eat right,

579
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,580
if you don't drink Glenn all the
way back from Paris, which I did,

580
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,970
I'm exaggerating for comedy
effect. All right. I'm

581
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,350
like, I was having this
problem where I would be,

582
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:59,351
I would lay down and I would watch TV
for like sometimes as little as like 20

583
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,620
minutes. And when I would go to
stand up, like I had to stretch.

584
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,310
That's like how fucked up my calves were.
And um,

585
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,560
like I felt like my Achilles
tendon was going to snap,

586
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:11,940
like something was going to snap.

587
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:16,941
So I've just been having this woman
beat the shit out of my legs and a Co,

588
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:17,521
this is,

589
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:21,260
you know why I found out it was back
when I had that sciatic nerve issue. Um,

590
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,640
and I felt a little twinge of
that starting to come back,

591
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:27,180
just that little bit of
tightness. So, uh, I dunno,

592
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,720
she can to turn me into hamburger tomorrow
hopefully. Um, and that's it. All right.

593
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:34,140
That's the podcast here for this week.
So great to be back here.

594
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:38,010
Thanks again to everybody and a Dublin,
Ireland,

595
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,050
Ireland that came out to the show thanks
to everybody, London, England, uh,

596
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,100
you know, thanks to everybody in Paris,
France for putting up with my French.

597
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,550
Um,

598
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:53,350
thank you to guns and roses for putting
on the best concert I've ever seen.

599
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,340
And uh, that's it. I guess
I'm just really good. Thanks.

600
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,500
Enjoy the music.

601
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:03,610
And you can listen to another half hour
of a Thursday afternoon just before

602
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,170
Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

603
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:10,060
Greatest hits from the Thursday early in
this year or years ago. I have no idea.

604
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:13,750
All right. That's it.
Have a great weekend.

605
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,923
Yes.

606
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:02,923
Yeah.

607
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,310
And then we started watching this
series on Netflix.

608
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,200
It was something about these chefs.
It was all these, these French cooks.

609
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,641
And uh,

610
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:58,600
it was great to hear the French language
cause I kinda stopped once again,

611
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,110
it was picking up, you know,
little phrases here or there
that made me feel good.

612
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:05,950
And these fucking,
these chefs were incredible.

613
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,340
We watched like two or three
episodes of it. Of course,

614
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:10,750
I don't know what the name of it is,

615
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:20,140
but it made me want to live in Paris for
like fucking three months, four months,

616
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:20,441
five,

617
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:24,370
whatever it would take just to get kind
of passable and take a pastry making

618
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:29,020
class. I know that sounds
like the stupidest thing ever,

619
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,100
but this fucking guy,

620
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,800
he takes like an apple and he was
going like this guy was an artist.

621
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:34,390
He was just sitting there going like,
you know,

622
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,700
I was so of making all these fucking
thing. Hey, I had to come up with some new

623
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,750
thing to do with an apple.

624
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:45,110
And he fucking just imagine if he
just kept peeling a thing. Right.

625
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:46,550
If you would just peeling the skin off,

626
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,470
but you just kept going all
the way down to the core.

627
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,740
He did that and it was all one piece you
did with some hand crank thing and he

628
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:54,531
said,

629
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:58,460
I wanted to make a rose out of out of an
apple and he somehow did it and turn it

630
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,300
into a dessert.

631
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,740
Oh, fair visual. All the hose. No.

632
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,080
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

633
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,180
[inaudible] [inaudible]
city sauce to Lima.

634
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:32,010
Fucking chop did duck in a, in a chicken
in half of he sewed them together,

635
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:36,960
which was very naziesque slash American
horror story that kind of creeped me

636
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:37,680
out.

637
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,513
Sse Cohen.

638
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,283
They were

639
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,800
afraid of access. Security on
perceive smiles, I'm presuming.

640
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,100
And then of course they had to show how
they fucking, they were cooking lobsters.

641
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,050
Live lobsters over an open flame. Can
I can show you guys a question. What,

642
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,250
what are the lobster ever do to us?

643
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,310
Yeah.

644
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,780
Every other animal has the decency of
being dead before we fucking least in this

645
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,160
country.
I know other countries,

646
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,420
they got fucking maggots running around
their apple jacks for extra protein.

647
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:15,180
You know, that's like us putting
way potter into our shakes.

648
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:18,000
They put like fucking bugs and stuff,
you know what I mean?

649
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,300
Puts a little spring in your step. A
little twinkle in your eyes. So anyways,

650
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:24,250
I'm watching this fucking lunatic and um,

651
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,490
for the life of me, I don't know why they
just can't. At least just can you just,

652
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,910
yeah.

653
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,080
Fucking,
I dunno.

654
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,320
Can they make it like a little
lobster hammer and just fucking knock,

655
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,011
knock it out.

656
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:40,120
At least does it have to be squirming on
the flame and you have to keep telling

657
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:44,020
me that it doesn't feel pain.
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

658
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:46,360
Whatever the fuck they try to say.
It's just like,

659
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,170
okay,

660
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,380
like what? It's like an
Amoeba. It isn't. Okay.

661
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,780
The fucking things got eyeballs and shit.
It's walking around.

662
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:55,210
It's got its little tentacles.
What'd we call it? Those,

663
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,630
those big fucking thing's coming out.
It can see it breathes.

664
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,370
You got to have paid. That's
part of survival, right?

665
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,380
Which shows a way to shut it off.

666
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,773
MMM.

667
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,170
Jesus. I'm all over the map. I
was talking about La fucking nut.

668
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,040
She always talking about Alabama, USC,
now where the hell am I? So anyways,

669
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,260
the guy got sick of talking about a big,

670
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:20,260
after a while he just got sick
of the blood of all the animals,

671
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,160
excuse yourself, of a sig.
[inaudible] city Tammany

672
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,373
eight.

673
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,933
I push her button.

674
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,560
Do you have your own fee charging?

675
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,830
And he got three stars over in and um,

676
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,520
in France in three stars
is the highest you can get,

677
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,400
which is so fucking Parisian.
You know what I mean?

678
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,880
This is so fucking understated and classy.
I hate to say it as America,

679
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:57,050
but they really are. They really earned
their snooty fucking behavior over there.

680
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,300
The people that style that closed it,
did they crush it? You know, Mr t,

681
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:05,180
we got himself a gold chain and
there was this like, you know what,

682
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:08,750
one isn't enough. Let me get fucking
9,000 of them and hang around.

683
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,490
They're the exact opposite of that.

684
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:13,430
They got like all more
muted colors and then Bam,

685
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:17,480
a sick ass pair of shoes or a hat
or the ladies with their bags,

686
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,790
just fucking class. It's not like, you
know, it's not like as loud Americans,

687
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,683
you know?
Huh.

688
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,570
But it's good to be loud sometimes.

689
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,060
Hey, what's going on? It's Belper
and it is the Monday morning

690
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:10,120
podcast for Monday, June 21st, 2010.

691
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:14,560
How the hell are you? God Damn
it. You like that? That's my like,

692
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,570
come on, let's fucking do this. You know,

693
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,280
like he gave up on your dreams and you
picked an easy fucking drone route.

694
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,560
Got a job at a corporation and
I'm the first guy that, you know,

695
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,800
you're going to meet and I'm trying to
get everybody on all, on the same team.

696
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,450
Come on everybody.
You know,

697
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:39,730
let's go look at some spreadsheets.
Okay?

698
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,980
Why can't I fucking hear myself?

699
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:45,160
I'm screaming right now and I'm not
hearing the volume in my headphones.

700
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,640
He's had phones getting old. Okay.
You don't, are they made in America?

701
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,350
Is anything made in America anymore?
I have no fucking idea. But anyway,

702
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:58,990
so I'm actually taping this
on, um, what is it? Sunday,

703
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:03,550
June 20th. So it is father's day.
So happy belated father's day,

704
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,200
everybody, you know, I hate that word.
Belated happy birthday. Happy Birthday.

705
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:12,400
Happy Father's Day to all the
fathers out there who stuck around,

706
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,200
you know, happy father's Day. You know,

707
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,640
even in the father's, you know, you're
married some Twat, you realize you didn't,

708
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,680
you didn't love her anymore and you know,

709
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:27,310
she fucking took off and started banging
the fucking dude down the street.

710
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,880
So you flipped out,

711
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,040
he threw some furniture and now you're
considered a danger to her and your

712
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:35,880
children. You can't really see him
today. Happy Father's Day to you too.

713
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,850
But no happy father's day to somebody
who just knock somebody up and never hung

714
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:44,220
around.
You're not a father.

715
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:49,140
You're a guy with the Dick who shot a
load into a vagina and you fucking left.

716
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,280
You left, you're riding the
bench. You're not in the game.

717
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,090
So a
happy father's Day fuckers.

718
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,520
Um,
what'd you get?

719
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:06,060
You get some shit gifts like all guys get,

720
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,360
you know what a women, what do women get
on mother's Day and what did they get?

721
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,290
How they get fucking pancakes.
You know,

722
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:17,610
what does a guy get a new breathable
shirt for when he goes out and Mo's the

723
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:20,160
lawn that day? Is that
what you get? Some fucking,

724
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,920
what do you get a new driver?
I'm a dad.

725
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,000
Get some fucking tool for the garage.

726
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:33,270
Something to help you fix the
fucking place up. You know,

727
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:38,271
I got a lot of balls actually got my girl
a gift certificate to gift certificate

728
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:43,170
to some cooking classes, uh,
one year for her birthday,

729
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,650
you know, and that was one of those gifts.
As I gave it to her, I was like, this is,

730
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,340
she's either going to love this or I'm
really going to piss her off because it

731
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:53,710
is a very nice gift. But
there's also an element of, uh,

732
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,960
why don't you learn how to Cook
Bitch. Um, but it wasn't that,

733
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,840
you know, this is actually
a Gore Mace, you know,

734
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,390
whatever I'm going to
fucking make out in the deal.

735
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,520
So douchey gift and I gave it to,

736
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:08,820
I've looked her right in the eye and
said he'd go, here's my gift to you.

737
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,970
That will make my life better because
you'll become more of the person that I

738
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:16,410
want you to be. Does
that make sense? Anyways,

739
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,250
I had an awesome weekend working down the,
uh,

740
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:24,330
the Improv in Hollywood sold out three
shows. And let me tell you something.

741
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,700
It's a small club,
but it's still,

742
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,120
I was very impressed that everybody came
up because that's a hard ticket to sell

743
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,310
here in Hollywood.
You know,

744
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:38,190
when Leonardo Dicaprio's also having
a pool party the same fucking night,

745
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:41,700
do you think anybody wants to come
down to the Melrose Improv? They don't.

746
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:48,740
When the fucking corona girls are showing
their twats up on Fairfax and Sunday

747
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,830
sunset, Sunday sunset or whatever, that
all that Hollywood shit's going on.

748
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,000
So the fact that everybody came
down to see me was really awesome.

749
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,840
And even though the Improv spelt
my name incorrectly on the Marquee,

750
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,400
B U R R r Bill Burr,

751
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,660
we'll be performing tonight. Uh, I had
a great time working out my new hour,

752
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,110
some hiccups here or there and,
uh,

753
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:19,140
all the shows went great except for
the late show Saturday night. Uh,

754
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:22,680
it was kind of had a weird show
where there was this woman talking.

755
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,130
This lady was rubbing it,

756
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:30,850
running her fucking mouth as they
do, you know, they can't help it.

757
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:31,983
They're emotional.

758
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,730
Do you know women say like twice
as many words a day of men.

759
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,280
What you fucking Dick?
I didn't notice.

760
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,550
Do you think none of us didn't notice?
You know,

761
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,300
just cause you're saying twice as many
words during the course of the day

762
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:50,860
doesn't mean you're really
saying anything. You know,

763
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,700
ever been hanging out with people and
everybody's running their mouths about how

764
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:58,840
to solve a fucking problem and there's
that quiet person in the corner and like

765
00:47:58,841 --> 00:47:59,770
when three words,

766
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,360
they sum up what the fuck we should be
doing this because you're running your

767
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:06,490
Yap doesn't mean you say anything.

768
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:10,120
Just cause all you broads out there
are so fucking afraid of silence,

769
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,040
you know,

770
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,510
because your clock is ticking or whatever
the hell's going on with your fucking

771
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:19,300
bodies.
Jesus Christ.

772
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,310
The of fucking cycles.

773
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,840
Sorry, I don't know why I'm
being so ignorant right now.
I respect women, you know,

774
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:36,670
and their wounds and their ability
though to uh, you know, take a load,

775
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,591
you know,

776
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:43,591
and then fucking walk around as it gets
created with no effort on their part

777
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:46,030
whatsoever.
You know,

778
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,350
me shooting the load really doesn't
take any fucking effort, you know,

779
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:52,960
a couple of strokes back and forth.
I'm a good two minute man.

780
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,030
Does that feel good? Ah, that's
it. That's my game. Deal with it.

781
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,920
You got to focus.
This is really disgusting.

782
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,880
I usually don't do sex jokes like that.
A lot of bodily fluids so far.

783
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,650
But once again, I'm doing, I'm
doing this, uh, this part. Oh
No, no, no. Stay on target.

784
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,540
Stay on fucking stay on. Stay focused
here. I was going to talk about that. Um,

785
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,530
the, uh, the third show. So
I'm doing my show and you know,

786
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,250
it's going great and I hear this
yammering and the, you know,

787
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,410
out of my left ear and I
look over and Lo and behold,

788
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,980
it's some woman talking to this
other woman. And I said, hey, hey.

789
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:35,280
And she was so involved
in a conversation that I,

790
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,320
she couldn't even hear me,
you know,

791
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:41,560
standing 10 feet away with a
spotlight and a microphone.

792
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,790
She couldn't hear me say loan.
Hey ma'am man.

793
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,170
Yes you ma'am, please. Huh? When
you listen to me, thank you.

794
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,080
So she shuts up. I do my shit
and then like five minutes later,

795
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:59,050
I don't know what she did. She
started heckling me. And by the way,

796
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:04,290
when the crowd gives me shit that's
heckling when I give them shit,

797
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,740
I'm not heckling. There's like four
people came up to me this weekend.

798
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,920
I liked how you heckled
that woman in the audience.

799
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,550
Heckerling is what an
audience member does.

800
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,230
We'll have the definition up on the EMM
podcast.com where you can get all your

801
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:21,220
little tidbits,

802
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,730
you little fucking bacon bits off of
the podcast if you new to the podcast,

803
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,381
eat.
If I,

804
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:30,860
if I throw out references that you don't
understand and when I recommend youtube

805
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,990
videos and you're like,
Jesus Christ,

806
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:36,950
do I have to go to youtube and I
have to look up all these videos?

807
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,150
Wouldn't it be great if there was a web
page that just had all the videos that

808
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:45,650
he recommended and pictures
of the references that he
made in links to shit that

809
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:46,484
he talked to.

810
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,960
Rather than me having to make a list
on posted after posted in my fucking

811
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:52,700
cubicle.
Well,

812
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,730
we got that for
you@wwwdotthemmpodcast.com you go there,

813
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:02,510
you'll see all of this shit
and I described that so
well I totally forgot what

814
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:04,190
the fuck I was talking
about. Oh, that's right.

815
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:09,191
A definition of a heckling tackling is
what somebody in the crowd does to a

816
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:14,480
performer. All right? There's
all different kinds of heckles.

817
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:15,741
There's you.

818
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:19,010
You could be heckling even saying
something nice fucking up my rhythm.

819
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:24,470
I was walking down the street the other
day. Oh, I've done that. I love streets.

820
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:29,840
You know, that's a form of heckled. It's
one of the hardest hecklers to deal with.

821
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:34,070
All right, but when I'm trashing someone
in the crowd, I'm just doing crowd work,

822
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,960
doing crowd work. If they didn't say
anything, hey, where are you from?

823
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:41,450
That's playing with the crowd.
But it is not heckling.

824
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,070
So stop coming up to me at
the end of my show is going,

825
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:50,870
I like the way you heckled that guy in
the crowd. How exactly did I do that?

826
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:54,890
Did I sit in the audience and then
put the audience on fucking stage.

827
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,160
All right bill. We got it. You made your
point. Okay. You're right. You're right.

828
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:03,160
Sorry. So anyways, um,
anyway, she like after I said,

829
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,900
ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, hello,
I'm trying to do my act here.

830
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:10,400
I got back into my act like five,
six, five or six seconds later, um,

831
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,830
she yelled something at me, something,
some sort of non sequitur. Oh, I said,

832
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:20,720
I got to take my dog to the dog
whisperer. And she goes, should I go?

833
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,600
What? She goes, you said dog.
Whisperers so I went, Shit.

834
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,230
And it was just dead
silence. I was like, what?

835
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,590
And I was literally looking at her
like, does this, does this person,

836
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,980
is this person mentally
challenged before I go?

837
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,050
Because you've got to make that assessment
because you don't want to do that,

838
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,980
you know? So, uh, I dunno, you know,

839
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:43,460
what ended up happening was she had a
major issue with the fact that I called

840
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:48,320
her ma'am, you know, which brings up,

841
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:48,651
you know,

842
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:53,651
a very interesting point in your life is
where a woman goes from young lady to a

843
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:58,730
ma'am. And when a guy goes
from young man to a sir,

844
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:02,540
you guys all remember the first time
somebody called you sir or Ma'am and you

845
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,760
were like, Jesus Christ, I'm fucking old.

846
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,300
But after a while you deal with
it and you start, you forget.

847
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,730
You forget that people
are even saying that.

848
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,510
Especially cause most of the time
nowadays when someone's calling you sir or

849
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:17,750
ma'am, it's some Douche on the phone
that you're trying to get to help you,

850
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:22,130
but they can't help you. Yes. And
sorry sir, I understand sir. Yes.

851
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:26,280
Well there's nothing I can do. Therre
ma'am, ma'am, I'm trying to help you,

852
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:29,670
but I'm sorry, I don't know why
they transferred you to me ma'am.

853
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,780
And you're just more pissed off about
the subject. But there is that moment,

854
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,610
the first time somebody calls
you sir, man, which I get,
but if you saw this lady,

855
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:43,380
she was at least fucking
eight years into being a man,

856
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,710
you know. In fact, a good friend
of mine watching the show,

857
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:53,700
Neil Brennan was standing back at the
back of the room and after the show he

858
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:58,350
goes, she was so a ma'am,
you know, and she was,

859
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,030
she looked like that girl who played
Nelly on little house in the prairie.

860
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,440
Remember that? The 13 year
old cunt with a fucking, uh,

861
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:12,470
Cindy Brady haircut it 15
and she was just a cunt,

862
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,850
the entire fucking series.

863
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,500
We'll just imagine if that client
was now fucking like, I mean,

864
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:24,090
this girl was like 36,
37 easy eg. You know,

865
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:25,020
she already had,
you know,

866
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:28,960
when you start getting the
[inaudible] is that whatever that the,

867
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,400
it's not your chin, they call it
a double chin, but it's really,

868
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,730
it's the flesh between Your
Chin and your Adam's apple.

869
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,430
It starts to sag a little bit.
Gravity has been pulling on it.

870
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:43,050
She had that and about two tons
of fucking blush on her face.

871
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,990
And um, oh, she was such a, you
know, she's Douche bag of the week.

872
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,200
She was really douche bag of the week.
She just kept running her mouth.

873
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,760
And um,
I know I got to think why I try.

874
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,760
This is hilarious after everything I just
said this week on the podcast so far,

875
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,460
I try not to attack this few
things. I don't do, I don't,

876
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:06,360
I don't make fun of mentally
challenged people. You know,

877
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,250
I did that a couple of times in my career,

878
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:11,400
did not go well and I felt
like an asshole afterwards.

879
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:14,790
So I cut that out and uh,
you know,

880
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,120
I don't go after women's looks.
That's usually,

881
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:23,121
that's usually a last resort because a,

882
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:25,680
I don't know, it just, it just,
you know, this, believe it or not,

883
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:29,030
this certain things that are to me,
but on the podcast,

884
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:32,070
evidently I can fucking go off on
women. Is that what it is, Bill?

885
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,010
I'm trying to think of all the
shit I said in the last 12 minutes.

886
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:37,770
I'm sure I'm being totally fucking
hypocritical right now. But whatever.

887
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:42,210
It's my podcast.
I'll speaking of that shit.

888
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:47,040
My girl was watching one of these dumb
ass fucking shows this week. You know,

889
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:51,270
those shows the, uh, the real fucking
horny housewives a fucking Toledo,

890
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:53,041
you know,

891
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,570
and they got their faces fucking Yank
back and they're desperately trying not to

892
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:01,170
be their age for whatever fucking reason,

893
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,550
for whatever reason. You know, why
can't they have them looking like moms,

894
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:07,560
you know,

895
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,560
so he can actually relax and enjoy the
show and look at someone who's 42 who

896
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:17,550
looks 42 and they're happy and they're
in some sort of a stable relationship.

897
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,410
Rather than showing these cuts,

898
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:23,860
going to these fucking art
shows and sipping wine,

899
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:29,190
is it doing squats up against a fucking
refrigerator desperately trying to hold

900
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:35,230
on to their youth. It's fucking over
lady. You got like three kids relax.

901
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:39,430
I'm not saying become disgustingly out
of shape, so you have heart disease,

902
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,950
but to sit there and go to the mall
and at your age and by the latest,

903
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,400
the same fucking genes
that the kids are wearing,

904
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,980
you look ridiculous.
You look for Dick this whole fucking,

905
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,790
uh, what is it? Cougars, is
that what they call them?

906
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,230
You know, it's sad. The same way.

907
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:06,250
It's sad when you see a fucking older guy
doing the same shit hitting on fucking

908
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:10,060
younger girls. It's sad. But of course
when women do it, it's empowering.

909
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,520
Anything they do, it's fucking empowering
the exact same shit. We do all this,

910
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:16,540
you know,
we're sad.

911
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,660
We're sitting at Hooters and we're
fucking pathetic and everybody goes off

912
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,870
saying, I'll, you know, fucking sad.
Our lifestyle to a woman does it.

913
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:29,140
They can make a goddamn series of it.
Why can't you know that Cougar town,

914
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,520
when they make dirty old man town

915
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,170
and they do it in the
fucking guy would be,

916
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,610
would be considered a fucking
creep and a woman does it for us.

917
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,130
I guess it's considered an accomplishment
because guys are so visually motivated.

918
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,630
They're like, wow, an old bag. Like
you can still get a young guy. Good,

919
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,820
good for you.
Good for you.

920
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:54,670
You with your lizard tits and see,
there you go. Being hypocritical again.

921
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:58,270
Sorry. So, uh, anyway, she's
Douche bag of the weekend.

922
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,320
I actually use one of the few times I
ever have somebody kicked out, you know,

923
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:04,750
the bouncer came over the first, I
was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

924
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:08,560
I'm kind of enjoying this. I like a
little bit of back and forth and um,

925
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:11,290
I thought we were going to get
to some sort of resolution,

926
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:14,680
but like by the fifth time I went back
and forth with her, the whole crowd,

927
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:19,330
they weren't laughing. They just went, Oh
God, shut up. So then that becomes like,

928
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:20,164
okay,

929
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:25,990
now people aren't getting their money's
worth and that's gonna Affect my fucking,

930
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:29,860
you know, career. So you got
to go. So they kicked her out,

931
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:34,360
they kicked her out and I'm sure she drove
home feeling like it was some sort of

932
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:38,530
victory thi that he kicked me out
because he couldn't deal with me. Hey,

933
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,460
that's her playing with their chins.
Um, it's like, no, if you just,

934
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:47,620
you just sort of a content,
everyone wanted you to
leave. You know what I'm say,

935
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,090
cut too much more in this podcast.

936
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:51,940
I've noticed that and all of a sudden
I've made up for it in the last three

937
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:55,120
minutes I made up for
the last 26 podcasts.

938
00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:00,400
Um, so anyways, what else? Oh
Jesus. Let's delve into it.

939
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:05,401
The Boston Celtics loss to the
Los Angeles Lakers in seven games.

940
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,160
Man, it was fucking brutal. Uh,

941
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,720
one of the ugliest seven
game sevens I've ever seen.

942
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,470
And um,

943
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,340
if you really look at the series in
general, it was a pretty ugly scene,

944
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,460
the whole fucking series.
And uh,

945
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,270
I don't remember last week when I was
like, you know, we're in a good spot,

946
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:30,530
but I can't, I can't get any read on
this series because it was so fucked.

947
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,270
So the only pattern I could
see was the Celtics were old.

948
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,220
So when they flew out for game one,

949
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,260
they were tired and they got
the shit kicked out of them.

950
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:42,500
They get a good night's sleep.
They went game two. All right.

951
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:45,680
They fly back to Boston, they're
tired again. They lose the game,

952
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,500
get a good night's sleep to come back.

953
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:53,180
They went games four and five fly
out to la. They're tired again.

954
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:57,020
They get their fucking asses kicked,
they get a good night's sleep.

955
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,100
I'm thinking they're going
to win game seven. And uh,

956
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:04,730
they did not, unfortunately. I just
think, you know, Kendrick Perkins,

957
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,810
that was just too much for us to lose,
took on too much water and uh,

958
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:14,080
the Lakers were just younger,
more talented and um,

959
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,980
you know, when they get 13 of
the first 15 fucking rebounds,

960
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:22,970
I don't know how we were still
winning that game, but um,

961
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,880
you know,
it was definitely brutal.

962
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,780
It was fucking brutal and as much
respective I had for Pau Gasol,

963
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:33,950
I started the fucking hate him again.
You know the fucking asshole man.

964
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:37,160
It's like he,
before he even drives to the hoop,

965
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:38,660
he already has a look on his face.

966
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:42,560
Like he's getting fouled in
the way fucking flops around.

967
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,090
I was joking around this weekend,

968
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:48,740
you have a drive by some shitty carwash
and they have like that sell restock

969
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:53,600
fucking looking thing. It looks like a
guy and they, and they shoot air up into,

970
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,460
and it's fucking arms flap all around.

971
01:00:55,461 --> 01:01:00,080
That's what Pau Gasol looks like
going to the fucking hoop. And I'm,

972
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,400
and I got to tell you something,
you know,

973
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,420
I'm not taking anything away from the
Lakers because I just think out of all

974
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:06,500
four major sports,

975
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:10,760
the officiating in the NBA is
absolutely fucking horrific.

976
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,610
To the point I've been
saying this forever,

977
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:18,220
that the refs literally dictate
the pace of the game. You know,

978
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:21,410
it used to be the point guards when they
wanted to speed it up and slow it down

979
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:26,210
or whatever, guys on either team would
do things. The point guards, they would,

980
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,580
they'd pick it up or slow it down. Now
it's the refs. Now it's the Reps. Oh,

981
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:35,090
let's let them play first half.
We fucking tackle cobia one play.

982
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,390
They let it go. I'm like, that's exactly
how you should be calling this game.

983
01:01:38,391 --> 01:01:39,770
It's game seven,
let them go.

984
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,640
And then when it really fucking
counted in the fourth quarter,

985
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,700
they were just running down the
court with their whistles in there.

986
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:51,020
Miles and I don't want to be country here,
but what the fuck?

987
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:53,923
You know what I mean?

988
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:58,130
None of the Lakers were fallen people
and then all that bullshit with the

989
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,420
relationship. I mean, I get it.

990
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:02,960
Kobi drives into Rashid kobies
the face of the league. I get it.

991
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:07,100
He's going to get the call the same way
Tom Brady gets the calls the same way

992
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:10,520
Jordan gets the calls. I
get that and I, you know,

993
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,970
but if Rasheed Wallace is
standing sideways with his
arms down by his side and

994
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:20,850
he's not moving it
fucking jumps into them.

995
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:26,280
I get the no call because it's
Colby and he gets to superstar rule.

996
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:30,930
But if you're gonna call a foul that's
fucking offensive to put Coby on the line

997
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:36,060
on a horse shit call like that during
game seven. Man. That's the fucking refs.

998
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,450
And I'm not shitting on the lake
cause I'm not taking this away from,

999
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:43,020
but I fucking hate the NBA reps
get out of the Goddamn way.

1000
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:47,220
Let them play.
So fucking annoying.

1001
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,600
Go all the way to game seven and
it's decided on penalty shots.

1002
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,490
It's like that fucking World
Cup soccer such as, you know,

1003
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:59,070
I've, I've gone back to saying
it's a stupid fucking sport.

1004
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:03,540
Can somebody explain to me
the offsides and soccer,

1005
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,380
why you're not allowed to
get behind the defender.

1006
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:12,000
That defeats the fucking purpose
of every sport. I understand.

1007
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,560
Like,
you know,

1008
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:17,550
one guy just can't run down the field and
be hanging down by the other guys net.

1009
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,150
I get that.
But the way the dif,

1010
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,780
the defense is the offside line that
basically moves down the field and you'll

1011
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:28,290
see an offensive players start to run by
it and the defensive player just stops

1012
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,124
running.

1013
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:34,290
So then what the offensive player has to
stop running because of defensive guys

1014
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:38,760
out of fucking position. It's, it's no
wonder you have one to nothing games

1015
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,630
Neal. Neal, what a contest.

1016
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,740
Jesus Christ and those fucking
idiots down there blowing those,

1017
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:51,210
those horns that sounded like mosquitoes
for the whole fucking game. I haven't,

1018
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,330
I'm going to get involved in the second
real reason why I haven't gotten into it

1019
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:58,080
was because I was watching,
um, I was watching the Lakers,

1020
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,990
Celtics and uh, you know, whatever.
Congratulations. Lakers fans, you know,

1021
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:09,090
whatever. God bless you. I'm
past the hate. I don't do
that shit. But, uh, you know,

1022
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:11,460
and that was a hell of a celebration
too, that you guys had. You know,

1023
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,700
that was awesome. You win a championship.
Yeah. Let's go tip over a car.

1024
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:20,040
Take that you fucking automobile
talking shit. The whole series.

1025
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:24,090
Now what do you got to say?
Huh? Storefront window.

1026
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,470
I didn't think so.

1027
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:31,050
That was what really surprised me is
the classless level of fans out here.

1028
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,160
I don't get it. It's so
bizarre. We have the, uh,

1029
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:39,390
the court side Laker fans,
which is the highest douchebag factor,

1030
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,090
even more so than the Boston fans.

1031
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,540
The few who dress up like leprechauns
that make me want to hang myself. Um,

1032
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:50,670
the douchebag factor. Everybody
went there. Ashton Kutcher,

1033
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:55,500
bing Crosby hats on
and their rockstar jewelry.

1034
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,460
Did you see that one game? I think it was
game seven when they won and they won.

1035
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:03,600
They were cutting to, uh, the three
guys announcing the game. Van Gundy,

1036
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:09,270
Mark Jackson and a fucking whatever
the other guy's name was ed. Uh,

1037
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:13,560
that fucking like 48 year old
guy holding his gold jewelry.

1038
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:16,500
I think he had like a Laker pendant.
You know,

1039
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,200
like he's 21.
The whole fucking thing was ridiculous,

1040
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:22,630
but I don't get how you
have like around the court,

1041
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,070
you've got these fucking fans.

1042
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,320
They show up like halfway through the
second quarter that are on their cell

1043
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:32,650
phones and shit. Text messaging.
Like, did you see Courtney cuts?

1044
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,400
Cox sitting us speaking of Cougar town
sitting courtside she looked like she was

1045
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:37,870
waiting to get a fucking nails done.

1046
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,530
No emotion just sitting
there in her leather pants.

1047
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:48,790
So it really looks like there's not a
lot of passion or at least on the side

1048
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,610
court behind under the hoop you
can start to get real Laker fans.

1049
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:55,710
But then like up top, like,
I don't understand those
people. Those people take it.

1050
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,420
I think they're making up for the,
uh,

1051
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:04,230
who gives a fuck attitude of like
the cast of whatever new hits.

1052
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:07,780
Sit-Com got the fucking court side
seats and they start tipping over shit.

1053
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:13,180
I Dunno. It's like, what
are you Canadian fans?

1054
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,280
I gotta be honest with you for
as much shit as they give Philly.

1055
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:22,750
Philadelphia fans, you know
they, they throw, they throw a,

1056
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,960
they threw snowballs at Santa Claus.
Oh yeah.

1057
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:28,720
Did they tip over a police
car and light it on fire?

1058
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,640
Did you see that shit after they won?
That's what kills me.

1059
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,430
They won and it looked like
fucking Tiananmen Square.

1060
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:41,950
The only time I ever saw that in Boston
was after we broke an 86 year curse and

1061
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:43,570
you knew some shit was going to go down.

1062
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:49,120
You knew it that much fucking rage.
But they want it two years ago.

1063
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:52,900
You see that? I'm justifying
when we act like Douche bags,

1064
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:55,900
but when we win a basketball championship,
we don't freak out.

1065
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:01,480
I don't know. I gotta be honest with
you. Sports out here, it's, it's not fun.

1066
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,261
Like back east,

1067
01:07:03,261 --> 01:07:06,460
there's a lot of shit talk and there's
a lot of ball breaking and believe me,

1068
01:07:06,461 --> 01:07:07,960
I took a ton of Shit in New York,

1069
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:12,490
but there was an element of fun
with the misery. But out here it's,

1070
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:16,930
it's not fun. You go to games out here,
you know, you go to a game in Philly like,

1071
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:21,400
okay, someone's going to dump a beer
on me, me, bell get puked on, you know,

1072
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,150
you come out here, you like, you know,
I think I'm going to get stabbed.

1073
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:32,550
And I had that experience at a fucking
charger game at an angel's game and uh,

1074
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,540
actually not at a Lakers game, just at
a charge was Lakers and a Dodgers game.

1075
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:41,380
And um, you know, I dunno,
I mean granted, the,

1076
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:45,040
the common denominator in all three of
those is the fact that I went to a game,

1077
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,460
but whatever, I talked, shit, I
get a little drunk, I talk shit,

1078
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:51,520
Talk Shit back to me,
you know,

1079
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,010
that's now what we're supposed
to be doing. But you know,

1080
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:56,530
to take it to the level that
you're going to fucking stab me.

1081
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:01,930
I don't fucking know. Ah, right. Let's
get on. And then I'd like an asshole.

1082
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,900
I sat there and I watched the,
the post game,

1083
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:10,230
the Lakers post game where they had a
Michael Cooper when some chick from the

1084
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:12,610
WWE NBA,
you know,

1085
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:16,730
you would think with all the Great Lakers
that they could another fucking Laker.

1086
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:19,300
Great if they wanted a former player.

1087
01:08:19,301 --> 01:08:21,910
But I get it that trying
to hype the fucking w NBA.

1088
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,010
So this fucking twat comes on there,

1089
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,373
right?

1090
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:31,010
And starts the WNB.
A chicken starts trashing Kevin Garnett,

1091
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,830
which is such the classic cunty thing
to do where it's like, first of all,

1092
01:08:35,831 --> 01:08:36,460
sweetheart,

1093
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,640
you are on the edge of your seat and
didn't know the Lakers were going to win

1094
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:43,390
this series until there was about 41
seconds left and now that you won,

1095
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:46,170
you're going to act like it was in
the bag and she's, she was trashed.

1096
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:49,440
And Kevin Garnett, right?
Kicking him when he's down,

1097
01:08:49,441 --> 01:08:53,970
the guy comes off major knee surgery,
his fucking arm was jacked up.

1098
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,230
He never bitched, never made
any excuses, never responded.

1099
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:03,060
When Pau Gasol said he's lost a step,
never said shit and this shit goes,

1100
01:09:03,061 --> 01:09:07,950
the big ticket should have called
them the big coupon. You know,

1101
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,210
if Katie, what a fucking
classic. It's just unbelievable.

1102
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:17,250
Say out of a fellow athlete, you're going
to do that. I could see, you know, even,

1103
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,540
uh,
a former NBA player maybe,

1104
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:24,580
but a WNB a play. I was joking
about that shit all this weekend.

1105
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,340
The W NBA really? You're going
to talk shit about Kevin Garnett.

1106
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,410
Fuck it. Yeah. What do you get your w NBA.

1107
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:36,890
You got to have a fucking bake sale at
halftime. See a check doesn't bounce.

1108
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,610
I Dunno.
It was really,

1109
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:44,470
I was really surprised that the classless
level of behavior with the fucking

1110
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:48,810
people trashing the downtown,
her talking Shit,

1111
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:53,760
and even Michael Cooper still being
like a cunt where it's like you won,

1112
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,390
you don't have to think is it's
really easy to be classy when you win.

1113
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,140
And they couldn't even do that.

1114
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:02,270
So I kind of lost an element
of respect for the Lakers,

1115
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:06,080
but I'm sure they don't give
a fuck. But, uh, um, I dunno.

1116
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,410
But I'm actually proud of the Celtics
because if you looked at it on paper,

1117
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:14,230
we should have got absolutely destroyed
and somehow it went seven games.

1118
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:17,860
And I don't know. I don't know how the
fuck we ended up losing it in the end.

1119
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:22,790
We actually, we know what the Lakers made
a great adjustment. MMM. What's his face?

1120
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:25,870
Ron Artest when he started
shutting down Paul Pierce. Yes.

1121
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,790
And no one else could step it up.

1122
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,430
I thought that they made
a great adjustment and uh,

1123
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:35,020
we couldn't overcome it and then they
went on like that fucking 13 zero run.

1124
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,420
And uh, that was it. And what really kills
me as a Celtic fan is that Coby shit,

1125
01:10:40,421 --> 01:10:43,220
the bed shit,
the bed,

1126
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:49,720
like we're talking about a John
Starks level in a game seven. Okay.

1127
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,133
And once again,

1128
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,830
I was going to feel vindicated the
same way I did with Peyton manning when

1129
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:57,770
everyone was saying you're arguably
looking at the greatest quarterback of all

1130
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:00,560
time. Same thing with
Colby Bryan. All right.

1131
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,430
It's fucking guys who keep trying to say,
compare him to Michael Jordan. He's not.

1132
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:13,180
Okay. Who's the second guy to
go to the moon? Does anybody?

1133
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,130
Exactly.

1134
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:18,720
Cause no one gives a fuck.
Did a second guy go to the moon?

1135
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:23,240
Did we ever go to the moon? That
was a bad example. You know,

1136
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:27,120
who's the second guy who made a
light bulb work? Nobody knows.

1137
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,960
Just be you doing something that's already
fucking been done by somebody great

1138
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:36,000
does not make you on
the same level of great.

1139
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:39,060
It's when you do something great
that's never been done before.

1140
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,720
That's what separates you. Okay? I'm not
going to go into this fucking rant again,

1141
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:47,400
but Coby Bryant shit, the fucking
bed and that fucking Mark Jackson,

1142
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:51,480
Jesus Christ, he's got a
poster, a Coby over his bed.

1143
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,821
At one point,

1144
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:58,821
Coby was too for 19 and game seven two
for 19 it's somebody a fucking van Gundy

1145
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:02,760
brings it up when you had
fucking Jackson's like, yeah,

1146
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,680
but he's got 12 big rebounds,
but guy, he runs down the court.

1147
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,630
I love the shape of his calves.

1148
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,310
He shit the bed,
Pau Gasol kind of shit.

1149
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:16,710
The bed to miss missing
all those foul shots,

1150
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,720
that bearded ballerina with his
fucking fundamental European game.

1151
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:26,730
You don't miss those, but it
was game seven. He bitched
up a little bit, you know,

1152
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:30,950
but you need a little bit of luck to
win it. And I think a Rashid going down,

1153
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,620
same with the Celtics. We got lucky in
2008 when uh, when buying them was up,

1154
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:37,980
you need a little bit of luck and
the Lakers had it. God Damn it.

1155
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:42,330
And they want another one. And you know,
there are up to fucking 16 championships.

1156
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:47,730
The franchises and Laker fans can stand
hand in hand with another man from

1157
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:52,731
Minnesota and say we together have 16
or as in Boston we can stand like men on

1158
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:59,100
our own and said, we got 17 all
right, fuckers, you fucking cunts.

1159
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,600
Oh God, I'm so pissed. Jesus Christ.
This was really Russia to watch baseball.

1160
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:03,900
I Dunno.

1161
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,290
Why tapped off from baseball or watch
the Bruins lose four games in a row.

1162
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,000
Have to be an up three games to none.

1163
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:13,410
And then I watched us lose a seven game
fucking heartbreaker to the Goddamn

1164
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:16,350
Lakers. I was so hoping we were going
to drink champagne. Jesus Christ.

1165
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,660
What were you fucking Laker fans do?
If you lost,

1166
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,910
burned down the staple center,
you have to go back to the fucking forum.

1167
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,490
That would actually be better.
I like to form better.

1168
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:30,000
If you guys ever been to the form, he
got to go out there. It's legendary,

1169
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,550
legendary. You come in there, you can,
you just can see the old showtime Lakers.

1170
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:40,230
You know, you can see all the whores
lining up waiting to fuck magic.

1171
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:45,240
He used to get head right on the bench.
It's back when the NBA was great.

1172
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,500
They'd let you play and the
fucking players would get
blown right on the bench.

1173
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,620
There was no w NBA,

1174
01:13:50,621 --> 01:13:55,620
those bitches were on their knees blowing
the star players and the NBA check it

1175
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:59,880
out. It's all up on youtube if
you don't believe me. So, uh,

1176
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:05,460
so I got a couple of predictions.
I have, um, the same way, uh,

1177
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,330
how the steroid case,
um,

1178
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:11,010
started off small and became,

1179
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:15,190
I think that the NBA has a major
problem with their fucking officiating.

1180
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,980
All right. And once again,
I'm not making excuses.

1181
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,680
I gave it up to the lake because you
were younger and you're more talented,

1182
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:24,490
you deserved it. You clamp
down on defense. Okay, we
good? Can I make this point?

1183
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,830
There's something going on. I don't
know what, I'm not on the inside,

1184
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:34,810
but remember I said that
there is something going on
with those officials there

1185
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,531
either.
You know,

1186
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:40,531
they had that one guy who got busted
for having mob ties and somebody claims

1187
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:44,200
somebody at the Improv last
night was trying to tell me,

1188
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:46,660
and I obviously I can't back
this up like most of my shit,

1189
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:52,020
but they were trying to claim that some
gamblers have been calling this guy in

1190
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:55,414
prison,

1191
01:14:55,660 --> 01:15:00,490
call a phoning this guy and they'd been
asking for gambling tips and he's pretty

1192
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:01,570
much dead on.

1193
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:06,250
If you tell him who's playing
in what the officiating crew is,

1194
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,050
he can't pick against the spread,

1195
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:11,770
but he can tell you who the
fuck is going to win. Um,

1196
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,430
just because he knows the personal
vendettas they have and you know,

1197
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:19,360
and if you look at Rashid
has been a dick for years.

1198
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:20,530
The refs fucking hate him.

1199
01:15:20,531 --> 01:15:25,270
That's why when he standing flat footed
sideways and Colby jumps into them,

1200
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:30,490
it's an offense. It's
a defensive foul. So,

1201
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,660
and I get it.
It's hard to set your personal shit aside,

1202
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:40,330
but it was game seven. You fucking
Asshole, you know. But anyway,

1203
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:42,910
I don't know. I think, uh,
I think it's a little fixed,

1204
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,500
but it can't be fixed because
the Lakers didn't even cover,

1205
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,080
I don't know what's going on,
but there's something weird going on.

1206
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:53,320
This at the very least is
some new officiating style.

1207
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:58,150
I think the reps might be finally just
fed up with the fact that they only make

1208
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:02,680
150 grand to fucking run up
and down a basketball court,

1209
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,690
which to Uri is a great job,

1210
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:09,691
but I think they're sick of getting
cursed out by 22 year old tattooed

1211
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:14,380
millionaires. I think they're tired
of it. And they've decided that, um,

1212
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:20,350
I dunno what they decided something,
but I don't know, you know, something.

1213
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,230
I don't watch NBA hoop enough nowadays to,
to,

1214
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:27,310
to really be 100% about debt.
But any,

1215
01:16:27,311 --> 01:16:29,650
any hoop fans out there?
Can you, can you go with me?

1216
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:33,980
That doesn't seem like there's
something weird going on. It's,

1217
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:38,200
it's the, the, it's like
even when you watch baseball,

1218
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,300
if somebody has a fucked up strike zone,

1219
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,020
it's a consistent strikes
on for the most part. Okay.

1220
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:47,500
He sees he's calling that low on a
strike tonight and for nine innings.

1221
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:48,880
That's what the fucking guy does.

1222
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,850
And as much as it pisses
you off your first at bat,

1223
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:55,390
now you kind of know the guy's parameters.
But like with the officiating,

1224
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:57,070
it's like they,
they letting it go,

1225
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:01,240
then they're calling everything and
it starting to make me feel like,

1226
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,860
because it is a business that if one
team goes, goes up by too many points,

1227
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,010
the officials kind of do shit to make
sure that stays close so they get that

1228
01:17:10,011 --> 01:17:13,250
advertising money.
I Dunno.

1229
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,500
Am I just pissed because my team lost.

1230
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,860
I was saying that shit before when I
went to that game when Garnette blew his

1231
01:17:18,861 --> 01:17:23,150
knee out and fucking a Utah that it
seemed like something weird was going on.

1232
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,240
Who knows?
Who knows?

1233
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:30,050
We'll see what I think next week when I
maybe started to get over this fucking

1234
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:32,720
loss. You know, it's the worst is when
you, when your team shits the bed,

1235
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,880
like the Bruins stayed.
Or if your team

1236
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,630
loses a seven game heartbreaker
to your absolute arch rival.

1237
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,490
The hardest thing is like, you can't watch
TV. You can't watch any sports TV camp.

1238
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,200
I've been watching like the food network.

1239
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,130
I was actually watching a
show the other day on a,

1240
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:58,090
on this HD channel that has all this
shit with like a bunch of cars and stuff

1241
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:02,390
like psycho into cars. My Ocd. Um,

1242
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,660
I've gotten totally into cars and uh,

1243
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:09,920
so I keep going to this channel and they
actually had this unbelievable show.

1244
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:15,730
It was basically about the bird and magics
of like marine corps and army snipers

1245
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:22,040
throughout the history
of the u s military.

1246
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:26,900
They had the Michael Jordans of
snipers and they had this dude,

1247
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:31,700
man, it was fucking, it was the
most fascinating God damn show

1248
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,410
I've seen in a long time.
And I,

1249
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,230
and I stumbled on it because I didn't
want to watch the sports center, you know,

1250
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:42,260
the sports and watch sports center
and listen to bill. You know,

1251
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:44,000
Celtics didn't get a dog,
you know,

1252
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:47,090
you know those things to do and there
you didn't do it. It ain't good.

1253
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:50,930
I can't fucking watch that shit.
I know. I got it. They lost.

1254
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,393
Um,

1255
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,690
and I also didn't want to watch Colby
jump up in the score table and do his one,

1256
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:58,640
two, three, four, five, five rings.

1257
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,060
But he really should be doing is counting
how many fucking points he had that

1258
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:06,470
weren't from the foul line.
Sorry, had to get one more in. Um,

1259
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:11,060
so they showed this dude like, uh, I
remember, uh, that big battle in Fallujah,

1260
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,320
I guess it was in 2004 if
he could fucking believe it.

1261
01:19:13,321 --> 01:19:14,810
It was already like six years ago.

1262
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,440
And there was this marine corps sniper
who had like 32 kills in 30 days and they

1263
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:27,371
were talking about this guy was like
shooting through like a softball size hole

1264
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:34,310
at targets that were like four or
500 yards away. And it's something,

1265
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:39,080
again, accuracy up to 600 yards, six
fucking football fields. All right.

1266
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,410
And you're peeking out from behind
the rubble. I think it's okay.

1267
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:46,580
And then Blab,
you're fucking the backyard.

1268
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,020
It gets blown out.

1269
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:53,330
And they were talking about what a
psychological mind fuck that was.

1270
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,890
And then there are also,

1271
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:58,430
they try to find you but they can't peek
their heads out because this guy was so

1272
01:19:58,431 --> 01:20:02,630
fucking bad ass.
Like Rick Barry from the foul line.

1273
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:07,500
He's picking these dudes off and then he
picked the dude's off who would try to

1274
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:10,950
drag the dead dude out of the street
just like in saving private Ryan but

1275
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:15,350
reverse cause it was an
American guy doing it and uh,

1276
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,360
Eh, it was, it was absolutely
fascinating. Then they went to,

1277
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:23,940
after they were talking about that guy,
he has to sit there and those guys,

1278
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:27,420
what they do on the other side is
they just start lobbing like, uh,

1279
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:32,400
was that mortar, those, you know, they
stick it in that tube and goes, you know,

1280
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:35,670
it shoots over a couple
of condos and he goes,

1281
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:40,530
you just got to sit there and hope one
doesn't have your name on it. You know,

1282
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:45,660
why do I watch action movies where there's
actors who pretend to be bad ass when

1283
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:48,490
you can watch shit like that.
It was,

1284
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,300
it was one of the fucking manliest
things I've ever seen in my life.

1285
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:53,040
This guy was just picking people off.

1286
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:57,360
He has to take into
consideration cross winds,

1287
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,960
how quickly these guys are running.
He was going after the guys like the,

1288
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:06,300
it's like a video game. Like the RPG
guys were like worth like 2000 points,

1289
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,111
you know,

1290
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:10,110
if you just got some guy running across
the street trying to get a fucking to

1291
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:13,890
bully salad, that was
worth like 25. Anyways.

1292
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,040
So then after they got done talking to,
talking about that guy,

1293
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,240
they talked about that they
cut to this dude and um,

1294
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,680
in Vietnam who had like
93 confirmed kills and uh,

1295
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:32,220
he went head to head with
some other bad ass sniper. Ah,

1296
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,390
who's on the Vietcong and the
Vietcong guy spotted them.

1297
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,880
This is how bad ass the Vietcong guy was.

1298
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:43,170
He shot around by his foot as a challenge.

1299
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:47,100
You know, this guy was bored
with picking off regular people.

1300
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:52,110
So he wanted to go mano a mano with
this other sniper and for like four days

1301
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:56,190
they're tracking each other through
the, through the jungle, you know,

1302
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:59,670
coming up on each other's flank,
whatever the fuck that means.

1303
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:04,140
One dude would be like 300 yards in front
of the other dude and then they'd be

1304
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:07,320
crawling on the fucking elbows is
somehow by the time they were done,

1305
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:08,820
he'd be where that dude was.

1306
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:13,200
And then the other dude was with the other
dude was and just one day the via con

1307
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:17,550
guy got unlucky
and it was the afternoon sun in it.

1308
01:22:17,551 --> 01:22:21,310
It glinted off his fucking,
whatever the word is there.

1309
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:26,280
This is his gun scope in this guy
literally did the shot from saving private

1310
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,390
private Ryan.
He,

1311
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:32,460
he shot it through the guys' scope and
blew out the back of his fucking head and

1312
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:35,460
the guy had a southern accent talking
about, went through the scope,

1313
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:37,200
didn't even touch the sides.

1314
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,920
It was great. He was like, he
was talking about some fishy cut,

1315
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:49,440
a Yay shit buddy. I was down. I
caught a fucking fish on dry land,

1316
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:52,470
mother fucker top that one bitch.
He was doing that.

1317
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:55,250
But talking about killing
guys, I don't know. I have,

1318
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:59,460
I wish I knew the name of the show,
but I found it absolutely fascinating.

1319
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:02,510
What are those shows that
so manly that you get,

1320
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:05,890
you almost get insecure watching that you
have to somehow start fantasizing that

1321
01:23:05,891 --> 01:23:07,720
you're the guy in it,
you know,

1322
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:10,270
and you start talking shit like you're
the guy getting interviewed and you're

1323
01:23:10,271 --> 01:23:13,810
whisper and to yourself on the couch
and then you catch yourself going,

1324
01:23:13,811 --> 01:23:18,010
Jesus Christ. Am I fucking
crazy? You know, for the record,

1325
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:19,390
I was getting interviewed on Oprah

1326
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:25,090
and then you wonder why I'm
in this business. All right,

1327
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:28,600
it is hot as hell in here. I've got
to keep the windows close. You know,

1328
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:31,600
when you say cunt, every fucking three
seconds, I get to keep the windows closed.

1329
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,950
Um, all right, let's, uh, let's get to
some of the shit here on the podcast. Oh,

1330
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:37,770
I wanted to,
I forgot to mention that I was going to,

1331
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:42,130
I was on Joe Rogan's podcast.
Um, had a great time.

1332
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,230
I went out to uh,

1333
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:48,710
his bungalow and I did as podcast two
and a half hour podcast that went by in

1334
01:23:48,761 --> 01:23:52,960
like three seconds. Um,
and for the life of me,

1335
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:54,700
I don't know where the hell
did he tell you to go get it?

1336
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,440
Just look up Joe Rogan podcast.

1337
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:01,860
He's like hardcore into the Internet
and technology and I'm sure his website

1338
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:04,840
will take you by the hand and
lead you right to his podcast.

1339
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:06,880
So please check that out.
And uh,

1340
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:11,350
one of the things we talked about on our
Rogan's podcast was he was absolutely

1341
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:15,430
beside himself that I was
not on Twitter yet. Um,

1342
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:20,260
oh first that I didn't have a what does
that thing you have in your car when you

1343
01:24:20,261 --> 01:24:25,090
don't want to look at a map anymore?
Keeps saying Gee, cast g map.

1344
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,560
I map map 2.0 fucking do it for me.

1345
01:24:29,561 --> 01:24:33,790
I don't want to think
anymore. Um, mapquest,

1346
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:37,330
fuck, what is it called? Whatever.

1347
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:42,370
I don't have that thing. I
just had, I have a map. Can
you tell me where you live?

1348
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:46,900
And I look it up and then I, I I
get there. There is no problem,

1349
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:48,640
but for some reason people
are blown away by that.

1350
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,760
But it was even more blown away with by
the fact that I, I wasn't on Twitter,

1351
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:56,740
so he actually signed me up for a Twitter
account and I told him I don't do that

1352
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:59,620
shit. And he goes, uh, he kept saying,
you gotta do what you gotta do it.

1353
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,660
It's the best way to hype you gigs.

1354
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,040
So I'm asking you guys,

1355
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:10,030
should I get on Twitter because I don't
want to go into that on there and tweet

1356
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:14,860
about some fucking cheeseburger. I just
had, um, I get like most people do,

1357
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:19,660
but a Rogan was swearing up and down. This
is, this is the best way to do it. Like,

1358
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,340
he's like,
you don't even need to do radio.

1359
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,240
You just get a bunch of followers on
Twitter and you tell them where you're

1360
01:25:25,241 --> 01:25:27,760
going to be and then they
can all go out and see you.

1361
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:33,040
Like that fucking Korean barbecue truck
that drives around here out in La.

1362
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:38,200
People are on Twitter to see his fucking
truck that has insane Korean barbecue.

1363
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:43,360
And people are like, you know, follow the
thing on Twitter and they're like, Hey,

1364
01:25:43,361 --> 01:25:47,020
I'm on so such and such and vine and
everybody drives over to go get some

1365
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:51,130
fucking Korean barbecue. So, um, anyways,

1366
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:55,360
we have a poll on the Mlm, podcast.com.
If you guys, you know, if you'd like it,

1367
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:59,380
if you want me to be on Twitter,
uh, I'll do it. I'll do it.

1368
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:04,130
But I gotta be honest with you. I'm not
going to be, uh, I'll only be tweeting,

1369
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:09,500
you know, I'll tweet like I just put
the podcast is, uh, just got posted.

1370
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:14,960
I can't even, I can't do Twitter
tweet. That's fucking ridiculous.

1371
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,820
You know what it is? This part of me
though, I got to stop fighting this shit.

1372
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,050
You know, by the time I got onto
Facebook, it was fucking irrelevant.

1373
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,770
Nobody gives a shit. Now
everybody's on Twitter, you know,

1374
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:33,560
I'm giving it a little bit.
I'm compromising. Fuck it.
What do you want me to do?

1375
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:38,030
Huh? You want me to be the
spokesperson for BP? I'll do it

1376
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:41,320
shit.
And you know something,

1377
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:43,700
I could do a better fucking job
than their spokespersons are doing.

1378
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:48,230
What's their latest spokesperson?
What? What the fuck is that guy saying?

1379
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:54,380
They're only birds.
I got to open the window here.

1380
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,370
Sorry, Cleo. Sorry. She gets so
fucking freaked out whenever I do that.

1381
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:03,080
Then she starts shaking
uncontrollably. Sorry. All right,

1382
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,330
let's get back to the podcast,
so let me know what it's,

1383
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,870
it's Twitter is stupid as I think
it is or is it actually decent,

1384
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:11,150
but I'm going to be honest with you.
If you say, do you get on Twitter?

1385
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,710
I'm not going to be tweeting.

1386
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:19,040
Just got an ice cream and the host
scoop fell in my laugh. Omg, lol.

1387
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:22,460
I'm not fucking doing that. All right,
I'll, I'll have the most boring tweets,

1388
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,650
but then that's the thing you
get on there. Then you got to,

1389
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:29,630
you got to try to be fucking
interesting. Oh, gives a fuck. Go.

1390
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:32,090
Go on the [inaudible] podcast.
Let me know what you think you know,

1391
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:34,790
and maybe send me some emails and let
me know some of the positive things.

1392
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:38,960
Even think, if you really think it's
sucks, just let me know. All right,

1393
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:43,160
so there you go. All right, 45 minutes in.
Let's get to some of the questions here.

1394
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:46,370
Um, if somebody send me, here's
another tech question for you. Uh,

1395
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,960
somebody sent me something about a saying,
hey bill, I don't have an iPhone. Can,

1396
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:53,740
uh,
you know,

1397
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,330
can you make it easier for me
to listen to the thing at work?

1398
01:27:56,331 --> 01:28:00,830
I don't want to have to be, you
know, I guess I don't know what,

1399
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:04,550
listen to it on the computer. So I,
I emailed the guy back like, well,

1400
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:06,080
can't you listen to it on your iPod?

1401
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:09,020
They seem like he had one of those jobs
where he, I forget what his job was,

1402
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:12,830
but it was like he went to job sites.
Um,

1403
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,121
I dunno,

1404
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:19,100
is there another place where I can post
the Monday morning podcasts for people

1405
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:24,080
to listen to it on their phones? I
mean, I don't know. I have no idea. But,

1406
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:26,450
uh, he seemed to be the only guy
who said some shit like that,

1407
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:29,360
but just in case it was a problem.
Uh,

1408
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,900
if you guys have like tech
savvy fucking questions,

1409
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:33,950
I don't know what to do about it,

1410
01:28:33,951 --> 01:28:37,310
but if you can point me in a direction
that will make it easier for you to

1411
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:41,390
listen to this thing, I'll try to do it
as long as it doesn't involve, you know,

1412
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:46,190
900 bucks in like three
weeks worth of work here. Um,

1413
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:47,241
all right.

1414
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:50,990
And also I added a couple of Boston
dates I got to put up on my website.

1415
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:54,020
One is up in New Hampshire for
the life of me. It's Sunday,

1416
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:56,480
so I don't know where the fuck it is.
I got to talk to my agent tomorrow,

1417
01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:01,450
but the other one is on August
12th, I'm going to be, and um,

1418
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:07,100
the 2010 Newport summer comedy series
at the New Newport yachting center.

1419
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:13,800
Huh? You like that moving
up in the world? Um,

1420
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,750
yeah. Um, it's a seven 30 show August
12th that by the time you listen to this,

1421
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:19,561
I'll at least have that,

1422
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:22,740
post that up on my website and I
know the day before or the day after,

1423
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:26,910
I'm going to be up in New Hampshire. So
all you people up in Maine, you know,

1424
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:28,260
you people over in Connecticut,

1425
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:33,240
you know there's a couple of gigs that
are easier to drive to. Hang on a second.

1426
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:39,690
All right, here we go. Um,
youtube videos for the week.

1427
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,440
Um,
here's one that I think is really funny,

1428
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:46,230
but also I can't tell if it's fake or not.
Please let me know.

1429
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:51,830
It's called BMW chase and it's a couple
of rednecks judging to people in this

1430
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:53,400
little BMW car.

1431
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:58,200
They chase after him and for some
reason they're filming it and um,

1432
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,980
you think the guy in the BMW is going to
get his ass kicked and all of a sudden

1433
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:05,370
the tables turn. It's uh,
it's pretty interesting,

1434
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,250
but I don't know if it's real or not.
Um,

1435
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,870
and also the 21 foot rule over that
last week, the guy put up one more,

1436
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:17,010
he did a final video where he
actually hurts himself. Evidently

1437
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,150
this guy is out of his mind.
And if I worked for the FBI,

1438
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:27,720
I would definitely be watching
this guy at all fucking times.

1439
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:32,790
21 foot rule, final video, go to the MM
podcast.com. All right. Just go there.

1440
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:35,520
We'll have all of these up here.
And if you're a dog lover,

1441
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:38,730
please do not watch this one.
All right,

1442
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:43,830
dear versus dog. Um, it's a long story.

1443
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:48,090
There's a baby deer and then the mother
dear comes in or it looks like an

1444
01:30:48,091 --> 01:30:50,640
adolescent tier to make
sure the baby deers okay.

1445
01:30:50,641 --> 01:30:55,080
And there's a cat that gets a
knocked around a little bit,

1446
01:30:55,081 --> 01:30:58,260
but the dog gets absolutely pummeled.

1447
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:02,910
The dog gets pummeled
and it's,

1448
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,610
it was really uncomfortable to watch.
But uh,

1449
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,470
for some reason I'm telling
it to you and I'm laughing.

1450
01:31:07,471 --> 01:31:10,380
I don't know why cause it wasn't funny.
So if you add enough,

1451
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,800
if you don't like watching a dog,
get pummeled by a deer, check it out.

1452
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,220
But for you, future serial killers who
have already begun torturing animals,

1453
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:21,540
there's a video for you. All right.
Underrated. Overrated for the week.

1454
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,120
Um, this is a great one. Underrated.

1455
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:29,100
Letting your frozen pizza cool for the
recommended two minutes after pulling it

1456
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:30,990
out of the oven.
Good Lord.

1457
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:36,450
That's such a classic drunk food or
like you're just absolutely starving and

1458
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:40,620
you've just fired it in the microwave
or the oven and the second it's done,

1459
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,600
you just fucking,
you'd do a couple of,

1460
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:47,230
and then you bite into it and then
you got to do that. You gotta like,

1461
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,040
you know like fanning your
mouth as if that's ever worked.

1462
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:54,000
And then for the next four days, because
you didn't, you didn't wait two minutes.

1463
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:57,060
You have that white burned flesh.

1464
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:01,630
The top of your mouth have
somehow dislocated my jaw,

1465
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:03,130
the fuck is going on here.

1466
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,280
Went to the dentist and they gave me a
fucking mouth guard because I grind my

1467
01:32:08,281 --> 01:32:09,750
teeth at night cause I'm a psycho.

1468
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,380
Oh,
fucking Corolla.

1469
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,160
Evidently I do that at night.

1470
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:17,790
So I got this mouth guard and now all
of a sudden my job pops in and out.

1471
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,850
And you fucking dentists out there.
I gave you a big shout out last week,

1472
01:32:20,851 --> 01:32:25,740
but I'll let you know that I know both
canines a six and 11 eight nine or

1473
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:29,030
downtown. Right. Okay.

1474
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:35,290
MMM. Yeah. If you know how to fucking
do that every once in a while pops out.

1475
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:40,660
Anyway, sorry. Plowing ahead here.
A overrated, those membership cars.

1476
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:45,220
This guy obviously is a new listener, so
I think I'm up to 15 listeners here. Uh,

1477
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,160
overrated. Listen to this.
This is unsolicited by me.

1478
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,460
This guy's obviously a new listener
because sir, if you're listening to this,

1479
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:56,580
I've done numerous podcasts about these
things and I also have a bit about it

1480
01:32:56,651 --> 01:33:00,930
coming in my upcoming special,
okay. Coming out in September, uh,

1481
01:33:00,931 --> 01:33:03,480
overrate he said those
membership cards with all the,

1482
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:06,930
that all the fucking chain stores in
[inaudible] now trying to push on you.

1483
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,180
Apparently if I give them my name,

1484
01:33:09,181 --> 01:33:13,110
email address and a record
of my shopping habit habits,

1485
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:16,650
I could be saving hundreds
of dollars a year. Really?

1486
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,660
I'm supposed to believe a giant soulless
corporation wants to help me out. Sure.

1487
01:33:21,661 --> 01:33:25,910
I may save a buck or two,
but when I buy a seat when I buy a CD,

1488
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:30,680
but at what cost? At what fucking
cost. Exactly, sir. Congratulations.

1489
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,190
You're a thinking human being. These
other people are just like, oh,

1490
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:36,680
they're trying to help you out.

1491
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:40,910
They want you to save money
while they make less money,

1492
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:46,340
despite the fact that you would go
to the store anyways. They're morons.

1493
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:51,950
And here's a recommended video. A movie.
Actually, I didn't check this out,

1494
01:33:51,951 --> 01:33:56,050
but this sounds like a great psycho movie.
I talked a little bit here.

1495
01:33:56,051 --> 01:33:59,300
I talked about snipers. I th I made
a reference to a serial killer.

1496
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,690
So I think this is a fine way to end
the podcast here by wrecking them

1497
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:08,530
recommending a movie called rampage.
At least find out more about it.

1498
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:10,330
I guess it's a small independent film,

1499
01:34:10,331 --> 01:34:15,331
but it says a dejected by the futility
of is tedious life of bitters,

1500
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:20,380
small town resident takes matters
into his own hands by constructing a

1501
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,950
bulletproof outfit,
uh,

1502
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:27,830
picking up his semiautomatic weapons
and attempting the largest killing spree

1503
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,540
killing spree ever seen,

1504
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:34,610
written and directed by a
controversial filmmaker who we ball,

1505
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:37,220
I don't know you. W. E. B. O. L.

1506
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:40,700
L is that EU ball ball.

1507
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:45,230
This ultra violent action
movie feature features jarring,

1508
01:34:45,231 --> 01:34:50,231
handheld camera work and original
dialogue largely improvised by the cast.

1509
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,980
How you watch that movie

1510
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,790
is beyond me. I would love to hear
that. Improvised Dialogue, doot doot.

1511
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:09,110
Oh, don't shoot. I mean,
what else would you fuck it?

1512
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:13,940
Say acting like it's
fucking, uh, Larry, uh,

1513
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:18,590
what's his face? Uh, Larry David,
I'm so bad with the fucking names.

1514
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:22,070
Uh, anyway, sets the podcast this
week. It's a little short this week.

1515
01:35:22,071 --> 01:35:25,430
I got to admit I'm a little fucking
burned out. I did a podcast,

1516
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,410
I did my podcast,
Adam Carolla's podcast and I did,

1517
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:33,980
um, Joe Rogan's podcast. I did,

1518
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,590
I'm literally making an unpaid career

1519
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,670
out of these podcasts,
but they're there.

1520
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:44,930
They're just a fucking there tie for that.
Say I did Adam Carolla's podcast to,

1521
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,680
um, check his out. Is tis
actually, he actually,

1522
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:52,310
he's one of those guys who actually
has 2 million fucking listeners and

1523
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:53,390
advertisers.

1524
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:57,020
His podcast is everything that I want
this thing to beat at some point,

1525
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:59,840
but I'm just too fucking lazy
to go out there. You know what,

1526
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:04,280
I would love to have a bunch of of
of advertisement on this podcast,

1527
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,020
but it's of Shit that I enjoy.
You know,

1528
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,150
like my respect for snipers.

1529
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:14,060
Like if somebody wanted to
advertise their sniper scope,

1530
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:16,670
are you sick of your neighbor?

1531
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:22,160
Do you want to scare the shit out of
them or maybe take out a house pet check

1532
01:36:22,161 --> 01:36:26,860
out the fucking x m 3000
millimeter fucking gun.

1533
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:30,910
Scalp,
even a fucking mute.

1534
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:35,570
Good kill someone a 300 fucking
yards through a picket fucking fats.

1535
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,840
Some shit like that.
Maybe we'll have that.

1536
01:36:38,841 --> 01:36:40,580
Maybe we'll try out advertising on this.

1537
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,660
Do free advertising for random shit.

1538
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:51,490
You know shit that I actually fucking
use like toilets now you shit,

1539
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,750
you sick as shit and outside. Why
don't you get a toilet? You dumb. Fuck,

1540
01:36:56,751 --> 01:37:00,110
it's 2010 I like how everybody,
if there are more on,

1541
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:02,720
has to have a southern accent.
I've addressed that in my act.

1542
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:08,660
What else would I went out with it
kind of advertising Belvedere, vodka,

1543
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,710
limes. If you make limes,
you grow limes, I should say.

1544
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:21,110
What else? That's about it. Vodka,

1545
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:25,040
guns, scopes and toilets. Let's
start there. That'll be the, uh,

1546
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,850
the advertising, you know, their
minds be a long time ago. Um,

1547
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:33,380
when guns and roses there,
their appetite for destruction came out.

1548
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,950
They had that song called night
train and the people of a,

1549
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:40,160
I guess it's some sort of cheap booze,
I don't know if it's wine.

1550
01:37:40,161 --> 01:37:43,050
I don't know what the fuck it was.
Um,

1551
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:49,240
but the people at night train one slash
to be a spokesperson and do this is back

1552
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:51,920
in the day where if you were
a spokesperson for something,

1553
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:56,550
like you lost like 30% of your audience,
you were considered a sellout.

1554
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:00,150
Nowadays, these fucking Lady
Gaga guys can be fucking,

1555
01:38:00,151 --> 01:38:05,130
have their legs spread around some Yo
play yogurt, make an extra fucking money.

1556
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:08,430
Nobody gives a shit. But back in
the day, that was a big thing,

1557
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:11,880
but he actually would have got away with
it because it would have been so funny

1558
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,890
because their whole thing was
that we're were alcoholics. Um,

1559
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:21,120
but at the last second, uh,
some groups complained. Yeah.

1560
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:25,110
Um, that it would actually,
what would that do to the youth?

1561
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,050
What would that encourage them to do?
And that's one of the Times,

1562
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:32,070
few times that they were actually
100% right. Because if, if slash

1563
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:33,620
okay.

1564
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:38,360
In 1988 89 told me to drink
night train, I would have, okay.

1565
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:40,160
I would have would have been hilarious.

1566
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:44,180
We would've drank night terrain while we
listened to night train and out and our

1567
01:38:44,181 --> 01:38:47,090
safe suburbs. We would have thought
we were bad ass on some level.

1568
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,393
Okay.

1569
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:53,050
All right. I think that's it. That was
a little, a little fucking reminiscing.

1570
01:38:53,051 --> 01:38:57,840
I took you back to 1988 you know when
the first George Bush was in office,

1571
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:02,780
you know when he had some
sort of restraint sorta
stick and move in the Middle

1572
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:06,190
East. Just fucking blast him
right in the face and then leaf,

1573
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:10,990
let them think about it. Don't let
them fly around the country. Um,

1574
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,260
anyways, let me hide my guest for
this week. I am beyond excited.

1575
01:39:14,261 --> 01:39:17,380
I'm going to be in Las Vegas this weekend.

1576
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:21,940
Co headlining with a
comedian and television star,

1577
01:39:21,941 --> 01:39:25,320
Tom Papa,
the host and star of the marriage.

1578
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:29,230
Ref on NBC. Please watch
the show. Tom Papa,

1579
01:39:29,231 --> 01:39:33,050
good friend of my podcast,
and I'll be advertising.

1580
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:37,940
I'm advertising Tom Papa right now and
we co headlining with him at the Orleans

1581
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,970
Casino in Las Vegas a Friday
and Saturday night this weekend.

1582
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:43,730
Uh, what the fuck dates of
those? Hang on. Hang on.

1583
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,270
Don't get your panties in and up. Raw. Uh,

1584
01:39:47,271 --> 01:39:51,800
that would be the 25th
and the 26th of June.

1585
01:39:51,801 --> 01:39:54,470
Come on out. All you people in Vegas,
but asked me to come out there.

1586
01:39:54,471 --> 01:39:58,580
I finally got a finally got a gig
out there and, and as a comedian,

1587
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:59,750
it's an honor to perform there.

1588
01:39:59,751 --> 01:40:03,470
That's the last place I guess
George Carlin did stand up. So, uh,

1589
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:08,760
I'm going to try to talk to a security
and see if maybe I can not take a peek at

1590
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:10,560
the theater.
Maybe make a quick little video.

1591
01:40:10,561 --> 01:40:12,960
I always promise videos and then
I never ended up doing them.

1592
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:18,380
But maybe I can make a quick little
video of me working in Vegas. Uh,

1593
01:40:18,381 --> 01:40:19,310
actually cool Vegas,

1594
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,550
Vegas video when I'm not out there
acting like strip clubs are fun

1595
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,370
rather than their,
if they're fucking,

1596
01:40:26,810 --> 01:40:28,580
that's overrated.
Titty bars.

1597
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:32,150
Titty bars are overrated unless
you're under the age of 23.

1598
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:33,740
Okay.

1599
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:36,920
You fucking, you know, 23 are under
strict. Did a titty bars are great.

1600
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,650
Well you get a little bit older than that.
It's fucking horrific.

1601
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,590
You just wasted money and it
makes you fucking hate women.

1602
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:44,890
MMM.

1603
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,720
And I think actually the strippers,
they start to hate guys after a while,

1604
01:40:48,721 --> 01:40:51,990
but I think that they would like guys a
lot more if they were fucking wide eyed.

1605
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:56,950
2021, 22 year olds. Oh boy.
Oh boy. Look at the vagina.

1606
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,520
I gave her a dollar and she showed
me her titties. Oh boy. Oh boy.

1607
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,990
This is a greatest night ever
when you're still in that phase.

1608
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:09,840
And I'm not making fun of 22, 23 years
old, old. Cause I wasn't that, that, uh,

1609
01:41:09,841 --> 01:41:10,120
you know,

1610
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:13,030
I was that guy at that age and I'm sure
a bunch of you will email me now and

1611
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:16,780
telling me how fucking bad ass Sherra and
all the pussy you're getting. You know,

1612
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:21,420
I don't give a fuck. Okay.
I was your age actually.

1613
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:25,300
It was I getting any at that age. I had
a badge. I was a late fucking bloomer.

1614
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:30,630
You know, you don't, you know, the
middle period where mark McGwire uh,

1615
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:33,580
right before he started doing steroids,
when he fucking tapered off.

1616
01:41:33,581 --> 01:41:36,250
That was like my pussy getting
career in my early twenties.

1617
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:44,560
And then I moved to New York and
uh, it all worked itself out. Yeah.

1618
01:41:44,561 --> 01:41:46,930
If you can't get laid and moved to
New York, by the way, it's, it's just,

1619
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:50,710
it's fucking impossible not to get this.
They're just walking down the street.

1620
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,740
I was back there last weekend.
I forgot about that.

1621
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:58,330
Like when you're driving
around La, they're in cars.

1622
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:01,510
He can't get to them.
They're boxed in.

1623
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:04,140
But in New York you can just
harass the shit out of him.

1624
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:07,120
And it's like the host cities.
Just a big construction site.

1625
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:12,790
It is sweet tits. Oh, come on.
You're going to be like that.

1626
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:16,600
It's a matter. I just made you
uncomfortable. I just threw out a,

1627
01:42:16,601 --> 01:42:18,820
maybe you're going to get raped,
vibe. I can't believe you.

1628
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:21,970
You're fucking giving me this
attitude now. I was never that guy,

1629
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:24,640
but I actually,

1630
01:42:24,641 --> 01:42:29,320
I used to always meet girls in the gym
and oddly enough I actually met a couple

1631
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:30,154
on the subway.

1632
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,540
I think because they have their
guard up not to get mugged,

1633
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:36,310
but they don't think that you're
going to start hitting on him.

1634
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:38,530
And what I would usually do,
I think I told this story,

1635
01:42:38,531 --> 01:42:42,610
I would wait for somebody to do
something weird or fucking stupid,

1636
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:44,380
which happens all the time on the subway.

1637
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,840
And if they would react to
it by laughing a little bit,

1638
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:50,410
then you went in and I had to do was
make a joke and then I was in, you know,

1639
01:42:50,411 --> 01:42:53,690
and hopefully if they had,
you know, if I got, you know,

1640
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:56,530
I try to just get their number,
but if I got desperate,

1641
01:42:56,531 --> 01:42:59,950
I would whore out the fact that I was a
comedian. Yeah. Actually I'm a comedian.

1642
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:02,590
I'll be down the comedy cellar tonight,
which is such a bitch move.

1643
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:03,970
But I did it all the time.

1644
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:09,060
Shamelessly had a business card with
me fucking holding a microphone.

1645
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,370
So they knew I was a comedian.
You know,

1646
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:18,280
the fuck I did what I had to do. Look
at me. I looked like Richie Cunningham.

1647
01:43:18,281 --> 01:43:22,960
What do you want from me? I look and
I'm over an hour again. Just like that.

1648
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:26,500
That's how it goes. All right, so that
is, oh, a new episode of uninformed.

1649
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:28,780
My taped with, uh, Joe to Rosa,

1650
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,070
the new young teen sensation
of the opiate Anthony show. Oh,

1651
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,400
I want to thank those guys,
by the way,

1652
01:43:33,401 --> 01:43:37,780
last week having me go on and height my
show, and I want to thank the guys, Kevin,

1653
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:42,781
and being out here in La and Adam Carolla
for let me hide my shows out here in

1654
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:47,860
Los Angeles. All the show sold
out and, uh, makes you feel good.

1655
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:51,800
So that's it. Hope you guys have
a great week and let me know.

1656
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:55,180
You want me to do the
tweak thing on Twitter? Um,

1657
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,460
I know I'm really copping out here.
I'm acting like Julius Caesar.

1658
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:01,340
Do you want me to kill this sonic
God, I mean, it's up to you.

1659
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:06,140
I'll do whatever you want me to dope.
Uh, but God, the, uh, the FM podcast.com,

1661
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,170

start watching the world cup. All right.

1662
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:12,610
That's it.
