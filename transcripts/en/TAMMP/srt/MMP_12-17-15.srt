1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,650
Okay. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:06,280
It's bill burr and it's time for the
Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday.

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:07,750
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:12,751
Dan Checking

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,290
in on Ya. How are Ya?
What's going on? Oh Shit.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,350
It's the day before the
fucking space movie comes out,

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,620
but about

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,530
35 so fucking religion out there,
right?

9
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:35,210
Keep in mind dad,

10
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:40,211
Obi wan Kenobi has died for
us and he's using the force.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,860
You
he had that dirty robe.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,760
Maybe that's why he got sliced in half.
Um,

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,690
all right,
so I have,

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,440
I have a little cartoon coming out
called emphasis for family tomorrow.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,920
I know it's not the big space
movie that everybody wants to see,

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,290
you know with r two d two and c three
Po and that fucking green thing that got

17
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,080
shot in the bar way back in the day.
Bob Power bar.

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,240
But was I was the evil one
goal as the evil song go

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,520
fucking same goddamn movie.

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,510
Why are you guys going to see that when
you don't know what's going to happen

21
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:31,200
and after it's for family, you know
what's going to happen in Star Wars?

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,630
Good is going to try him over evil,
doesn't it always except for that one.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,460
You know where they ran around on
those mechanical fucking lamas,

24
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,990
whatever the hell the word,
the ad ads.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,240
I know all this shit
cause one of my brothers,

26
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,780
he had all the fucking action figures,
you know,

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,510
I remember that Shit. You
know, I just, you know,

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,540
I talked about uncommon and I just missed
out. I didn't see it at the right age.

29
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,310
And then when I saw it I was like,
you know,

30
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,510
the hype was just so fucking big
and I was just like, this was what,

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,600
this was the big deal.

32
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,440
This is the big that I thought the first
one was boring and then the next one I

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:09,330
loved. I liked the one that fucking
dude cut to go it go with the blackout.

34
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:13,730
Darth Vader. Darth. Yeah, they Veda Joe.

35
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,450
Okay. Yeah. About Daniel fucking
guy moved into the neighborhood.

36
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:23,480
Fucking Darth Vader. Dude.
It's fucking ride is kid.

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,600
Um,
yeah,

38
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:30,950
he cut off Luke Skywalker's hand in that
air conditioning shaft, whatever it was.

39
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,480
None of it's explained by the way.
It's just all spacey looking shit.

40
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,590
You know what I mean? A
bill. You're a grumpy con.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,150
Why can't you let people enjoy it?
You know they like it. You know what?

42
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:45,710
You're right. You're right. I wish I
cared. I wish I was in. I like Scifi.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,590
Hey, I like Scifi. Why can't I come along?
Um, that'd be a great youtube video.

44
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:54,230
Just have people driving by just
heckling people in the lines.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,400
Don't do that. Please don't do
that. Those people in that line,

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,600
they've been through enough.
You know what I mean?

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,130
I think the people who are into star wars,
but they've been through enough,

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,050
maybe not the younger ones.

49
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,930
Maybe then we can give shit to because
they haven't been bullied cause it's been

50
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,450
like outlawed right now.
Bullying.

51
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,910
How the fuck is this generation going
to produce another generation of great

52
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:24,080
comedians if nobody got their heads
stuffed into a toilet? I mean, it's just,

53
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,990
it's a fucking shame, you know, for
as much as people shit on bullies,

54
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,230
they're really the reason for
some of the great musicians,

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,330
comedians and all that.

56
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,050
They channel all that pain and
humiliation to the tone in their guitar,

57
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,520
right when they get through it. But
the silliness, you know what I mean?

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,110
Learning how to fucking who new toilet
water would make your cowlick finally

59
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,290
laid down. Who knew that, you
know, get jokes out of it. Nothing.

60
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,870
He's Auntie Star Wars. He's pro bullying.
This isn't what I signed up for.

61
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,800
Um, Sony was, so I'm done.
I'm done with my press. Uh,

62
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,980
I had a great time on
found that I did Conan.

63
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,010
I did like a fucking thousand goddamn
radio things and print things and all of

64
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:10,040
that. And uh, the cartoon finally
comes out tomorrow to go see star wars.

65
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,150
I'm just fucking with you guys,
man.

66
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,120
It's just fun to shit on
something that everybody's into.

67
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,310
They have so fucking good movies. What?
They're there for the kids, right.

68
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,450
You know what I mean? If the kids,
please tell me that for the kids,

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,730
please tell me you're not sitting there
with nobody in your life with a bunch of

70
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:26,510
stuffed animals.
He walks on some manmade shelf.

71
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,290
I guess they're all manmade but homemade,
you know,

72
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,240
a little fucking two by
six right above your head

73
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,630
with your action figures still in the box.
So they're worth more money.

74
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,520
But you know,
you're never going to sell them,

75
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:44,510
but you can't get yourself to open
them up. Why don't you take it out,

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,380
you know, do your little Chewbacca
impression. Oh, it was it Yoda.

77
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,823
Huh?

78
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,220
That fucking weird way. I knew my boy. He
talks, you know at the desk you must sit.

79
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,380
What are the fucking dies?
Oh my God.

80
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:06,620
What an annoying little green
can't. Yeah, you can't hate Yoda.

81
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,070
You know what you could,
if your drove cross country,

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,150
he'd have to do some gen I shit like every
half a state before he just like toad.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,140
You either need to do some magic
stuff where you have to stop talking.

84
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,620
Okay. Because, uh, my fucking brain,

85
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,340
you're hurting or whatever the
fuck you say to him. Oh, you know,

86
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:29,090
you'd be annoying. Just start
imitating them. Roof really get Douche.

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,250
Um, no, what's wrong with me? You
know what's wrong with me is, uh, I,

88
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,860
I need to just fucking
chill out and I can't,

89
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:40,910
I got two shows tonight cause I gotta
get ready for my new year's show here in

90
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:43,340
la at the Orpheum.
Who's going to be on the show?

91
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:45,500
Got Damn at the four horsemen
are coming into town.

92
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,890
Well I guess I'm already
here. So three of them. Uh,

93
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,770
well I had lived out here to
open up Bart next out here.

94
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:55,850
One of them is coming to town. Sorry,
I just totally blew that out there.

95
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,910
One of them is coming to town. I'm
usually good about pulling the microwave.

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,910
One of them's is to town and the other
three are already here. All right. God,

97
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,030
God, go that. That's the
magnificent seven bill.

98
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,900
You need three more writers. Uh,
it's going to be me lot head Barnett.

99
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,410
Can Paul Versey at the Orpheum,

100
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:20,411
the legendary Orpheum downtown
downtown la first shows at seven 15.

101
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,590
For whatever fucking reason. I don't
know why it's not seven or seven 30.

102
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:28,220
It's seven 15. Everybody just to
make sure you're paying attention.

103
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,230
And then the, uh, the other one
is at 10 o'clock. All right.

104
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,280
Two fabulous shows. So last night we
had the premiere for F is for family.

105
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,440
And uh,
I told the lovely Nia that I was going to,

106
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:43,790
you know,

107
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,750
go up there with the Great Mike Price
from the Simpsons co creator of the show.

108
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,030
We were going to thank
everybody for coming out.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,100
And the second I thanked everybody,

110
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,280
I was immediately going to walk right
out the movie theater because I did not

111
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,930
want to sit there. You know, watching
people watch it because that's just,

112
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,900
I can't describe that feeling after
years of being a comedian where you can

113
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,140
adjust, you know, if it's going bad,
you can speed up, you can slow down,

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,240
you can do this, you can do
that. The fucking, you know,

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,600
TV show is locked. It's
done, it starts bombing.

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,800
All you can do is just sit there
and I also want to have it.

117
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,820
So that was my game plan.

118
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:24,821
I thanked everybody and then I started
to walk out the theater and I just felt

119
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,460
everyone was looking at me and I'm like,
that's not good.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Everyone's going to think he
doesn't like his own show.

121
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,450
So I just walked in and I just sat
down in the nearest empty seat,

122
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,490
which was it next to my wife.

123
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,170
I just sat there and within three
seconds of watching it, I was like,

124
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,840
why the fuck did I do this?
And they played three episodes.

125
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,980
Fortunately people were
laughing, but um, yeah,

126
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,750
I sat there squirming for a, a good
fucking or whatever, however long it took,

127
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,880
90 minutes to watch.
But fortunately everybody loved it.

128
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,340
Everybody can relate all different
ages and that type of shit.

129
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:02,810
So I'm hoping you're going to like it
there. I'm done. I've done promoting it.

130
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,460
Um, why do you feel guilty
promoting your own projects?

131
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,850
You know,
you deserve it and it's your podcast.

132
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,090
You should have the right to
talk about whatever you want. Um,

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,110
is that what Yoda would say?
But in that douchey voice,

134
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,650
but why do I attack star was what,
every time it comes out,

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,150
I just can't handle the fact.

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Okay.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,060
I do the same thing. You know, there's a,

138
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,640
there's a lot of shit that
everybody likes it. I don't like it.

139
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,190
And maybe I should just be like,
you know what bill, maybe, uh,

140
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,070
maybe have to lighten up it a little bit,
you know?

141
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,703
Okay.

142
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,050
No, you know what I mean? You bought,

143
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,810
why don't you just let people like what
the fuck they like. I like Scifi that,

144
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,530
that fucking Sam Rockwell movie moon.
Did you guys see that? I liked that one.

145
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:49,840
I like Stanley Kubrick space. 1990 now.

146
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,470
The fuck was it called last
computer on ours. I'm sorry Brian.

147
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:59,390
I can't do or whether the fuck he
used to say 2001, a space odyssey.

148
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,500
I liked that movie Mo.
Uh,

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,110
so say Moonraker that was struck in James
Bond when he was in the space shuttle.

150
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:10,250
That wasn't it. Blade
runner. I liked that one.

151
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,170
I like those ones set in the future where
everybody lost their rights and we're

152
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,500
out of fucking natural resources.

153
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,970
Those are the ones I like, you know,
and then they got to fight back against,

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,610
oh fuck. Am I explaining it? I
think I'm describing star wars,

155
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,650
I guess it says self help.
I don't know what it is.

156
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,430
All right. You know what I'll say.
You know what? It's too nice there.

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,230
That's what it is. It's just too
fucking nice. You know what I mean?

158
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,820
Like they got a couple of malls out
here in la. They both called the grove.

159
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,920
You then you go down there,
right?

160
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,921
And it's all brand new and they got this
stupid fucking trolley going down the

161
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:56,520
center, right. Making it look like
it's this old style town. And you know,

162
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,400
it only runs like a hundred yards
and then it just turns around again.

163
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,950
But when you're in the middle of
this mall, you know, and that plane,

164
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,980
Sinatra and Tony Bennett,

165
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,320
if I ruled the world every day would be
the first day of spring and you fuck,

166
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,490
you're walking around,
there's a trolley, you fail,

167
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,190
you get a little spring in your step
and then it hits you. Like, dude,

168
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm going into the gap.

169
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,540
Okay.

170
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,190
Uh, buying a bunch of Shit I
don't need, what am I doing here?

171
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,410
They create this whole fucking
atmosphere that's so fucking nice.

172
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:35,160
It uh, oh, it drives me up the wall.

173
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,260
I got to come with something positive.

174
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,490
You know what the most positive thing I
saw this this past week was I saw, um,

175
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,430
I saw these kids playing two on two
football in a basketball court at a,

176
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:50,610
when I was in New York that time when I
had the fight with the person at the gym.

177
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:54,360
So I went to that outdoor place.
You could do pull ups and uh,

178
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,740
I dunno, he just never see
that. You never see it anymore.

179
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,490
Which kids did that more, you
know, I wish kids weren't so fat.

180
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,290
I wish they'd go outside the house,
you know,

181
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,960
but you can't let them out
of the house now. Right.

182
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:10,500
Everybody is a fucking pervert
by having every fucking tree.

183
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,500
You know, they should give kids guts.
Yeah, just hear me. I said give,

184
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,250
if you give kids guns,
just somebody goes to snatch your beak.

185
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:23,500
It just fucking pull his gun out,
blow the guy's braids out.

186
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,350
And then if they shot each other, as
sad as that would be, it would probably,

187
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:33,910
it would definitely obviously help the
population problem. You know what I mean?

188
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,180
Cause one of them would be dead and
the other one would be going to jail.

189
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,080
That will be FBI would just
sticky when this place, you know,

190
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,790
you like leaning it stabbed.
That's weird, right?

191
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,580
It's desperate times.
You know,

192
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,970
someone's trying to tell me to watch
something that was trying to say that

193
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:55,420
fucking Miami is going to be
like finished in 10 years. Miami,

194
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,410
New Orleans, all of these fucking places.
And I was just like, dude, I don't,

195
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:02,550
I don't want to hear that. You know,
I'm, I'm going to be one of those guys.

196
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,710
They're going to figure something out.

197
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,640
I think everybody's saying that
all the way up to the top. Um,

198
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,410
so anyways, hey, I'll put my bro, it's,

199
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,290
they've been winning lately
and I had been so busy,

200
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,420
I haven't watched last
night I watched the uh,

201
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,390
the second period and uh,

202
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,280
just long enough to watch McQuade
take a puck to the fucking mouth.

203
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,630
I don't remember if you've never played
hockey. I took one time, but just once.

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,420
Okay. I'm played a lot of hockey
in my life. Just one fucking time.

205
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,320
One fucking time.

206
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,520
I took a risk off my big fucking toe.

207
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,980
All right. Just some fucking
novice guy. We were in Canada,

208
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,070
so it's probably a better wrist shot
than I would have run into down here.

209
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,440
I took it right off the firewall,
you know,

210
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,800
I wasn't doing anything in the game so
I wanted to do something productive for

211
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:54,634
my team.

212
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,290
I was like a minus 53 minutes into
play and pick up hockey and a I.

213
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:03,970
For some reason I decided
to block a shot in a,

214
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,880
in a pickup game when I had
a standup gigs at night.

215
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,910
It hit right off the inside of my, the
arch in my foot, in my fucking toe.

216
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,490
I felt like I got shot in the foot
and it didn't even hit me that hard.

217
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,110
This guy took a professional fucking
thank God it wasn't a slap shot. It was,

218
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,430
I think it was a wrist or took,

219
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,080
he wa he fucking turned
around to see what was up,

220
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,330
like where were the puck was
and it was like right there.

221
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,570
It's like when Tom Brady throws to
pass, you know, before you even turn,

222
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:32,380
the ball's already come and you're like,
oh shit. Right. If you've got like me,

223
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,290
you break your finger cause you didn't,
you didn't open them wide enough,

224
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,160
quick enough. Right. Um, took
it right in the fucking mouth.

225
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,660
That's it. And he's rolling around on
the ice and he announced, he's just like,

226
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:48,220
well fortunately you don't need
teeth to play hockey. Now was it,

227
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,300
could you imagine if a soccer player
took a fucking puck to the mouth,

228
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,130
he'd still be lying there.
He will be riding in the stands.

229
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:01,990
They had tear gas and all that
type of shit. Um, but anyways,

230
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,991
I am completely out of the loop with
that is one of my random picks for this

231
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,310
week. All right. If you're a gambling
man, if you're going on that draft king,

232
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:12,101
so that whatever,

233
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,250
if you go in old school and
you're actually betting a
team rather than players,

234
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,290
you know, um, I like the giants this
weekend. How do you know how many,

235
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,610
I don't even know how many fucking
points to get. I don't even,

236
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:26,830
I don't even know how many.
Let me see how many fucking points again,

237
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,550
they're playing the fucking panthers.
So I think everybody's going to be like,

238
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:32,590
all right, the panthers are
going to fucking kill him.

239
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,800
They're going to give the giants all
these fucking points cause everybody's

240
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:36,910
gonna bet the panthers.

241
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,580
You're going to get all these
extra points and I'm telling you,

242
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:43,300
fucking Odell Beckham and
Eli are going to be enough,

243
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,390
even though the giants have no defense.
Let me see. Right? That giants,

244
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,340
panthers bedding lie. Oh,
spread when I used to that.

245
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:54,640
That's easier. Huh? Though?
What's the fucking spread?

246
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,530
I launched last week too,
but lifetime. Lifetime.

247
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm up like 660 bucks on the book, right?
Isn't that what all your friends say?

248
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,230
Nobody's ever, he admits. Nobody
knows what the fuck they figure is.

249
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,090
The second you gambled for more
than three weeks, you have no idea.

250
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,780
Okay,

251
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,120
dude, lifetime. Maybe
I'm the giants. Panthers,

252
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:20,040
odds to giants have a chance
against unbeaten. Carolina. Uh,

253
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,850
let's see here.
Just give me the fucking line.

254
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,240
I hate this new era.
I really do.

255
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,470
Draftkings they have all kinds of fucking
shit wasn't eighth I was going to bet

256
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,340
on, you know, Odell Beckham,

257
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:37,750
just him odds point spread week 15.

258
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,460
All right. The weekly odds,
where is it? Where is it?

259
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,380
Line Carolina minus four. That's it. Yeah.

260
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,283
Okay.

261
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,220
What the fuck is that game

262
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,060
under rovers 49. All right. You know what?

263
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:01,950
Fuck that I wanted eight gimme a
fucking points. I'd Bet Carolina.

264
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,980
What's the Games in New
York? You know, Bill,

265
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,940
he kind of helps you fucking looked
it up before you got involved in this,

266
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:13,650
wouldn't it? What have
helped. I don't give a shit.

267
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,420
All right. Anyways, let's,
let's plow ahead here. So I
gotta get my shit together,

268
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:21,560
man. I have, I have not
been working out and uh,

269
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
but I've been kind of maintaining and
I also haven't been doing that much

270
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:27,330
standup cause I've been promoting this
show and I got to get my fucking ass

271
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:31,320
ready for this, uh, for this
New Year's Eve shelf. Um,

272
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,960
and that starts tonight.
If you're in La,

273
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:37,980
I'll be done the laugh factory and
I'll be uh, at the comedy store,

274
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,070
although by the time they post this to
chose a, probably already have happened.

275
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,190
So that didn't make any sense. Did it? All
right. I don't know where this is going.

276
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,790
Hang on a second. Let me, let me look
up some shit, man. Give me something.

277
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,190
Give me something to talk
about here. Right. You don't,

278
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:56,010
what if you noticed lately I've had to
hit the pause button a lot. I think.

279
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:59,250
I think I'm coming to the end of
this podcast or at the very least,

280
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,710
at some point I'm going to have
to have a fucking guest. Right,

281
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,100
okay.

282
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,630
I mean, after a while
you just see, I mean,

283
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,240
when it gets to the point
you're making pie crust videos,

284
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm pretty much at the
end of my rope here.

285
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,400
People telling me told you should
make some more fucking videos.

286
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,310
It's like there's nothing else that I
kind of know how to make that interesting,

287
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,144
I don't think.

288
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,703
Right.

289
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,910
I Dunno.
I have no idea.

290
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,560
We're finally getting the fucking my
house fixed up on the outside. You know,

291
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,950
the gates and everything
were falling down. It's never
ending. It's never ending.

292
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:34,130
I think when I get that fixed,
then I got to move on to the garage,

293
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,150
that hunk of Shit,
I'm never going to get my money back.

294
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:41,780
And I'm just doing this stubborn German
Irish shtick that I don't give a fuck

295
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,790
and I'm doing everything first
class. I don't give a fuck. Well,

296
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,110
we could use this PC shit.
Uh,

297
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,930
we could use this one that's
decent or we could use the tub

298
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,120
top of the line.

299
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,820
I'm like fucking John Bender. You know
when, when the press and breakfast club,

300
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,800
when he's going, I got you to Saturday.
She wanted another one. He's like, yes,

301
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,950
that's Drake.
Good

302
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,680
as with the construction people are
doing. Yeah. You know, uh, we, we,

303
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,980
we found another fucking problem.
It's going to cost another three grand.

304
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,003
Okay.

305
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,870
You want another, I'll keep digging.
I'll keep looking in your fucking walls.

306
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,690
The is really no sympathy here,
man.

307
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:31,350
This is my own God damn fault for buying
a 90 something year old to a hundred.

308
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,130
Yeah. 92 year old house. It's
my own fucking fault. Um,

309
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,450
and I have to be honest with you, I think
I'm over old shit. I think I'm over it.

310
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,950
Like the next house I buy is going
to be totally fucking modern.

311
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,380
Brand new,
you know,

312
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,270
just conk fucking two,
three concrete slabs.

313
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,010
Looked like a parking garage.
Now just build some walls around it.

314
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:03,870
Everything's going to be brand
fucking new and up to code. I've uh,

315
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,250
I, I've just, I've had it,

316
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,760
I've had it every motherfucking thing
cause you know what it is about this house

317
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:14,370
is it's settled to over the
last 90 something years, right?

318
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,870
So everything's fucking cockeyed and
twist it and all that type of shit.

319
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,140
So when they go to fix something,
they always go, well, you know,

320
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:26,490
this isn't really square and it's going
to look dumb. So I got a square it up.

321
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,970
So I go, hey, square it up. You know,

322
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,660
go ahead and square it up enough.
I just come walking out, you know,

323
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:36,030
at this point, anytime anyone he
could structure and talks to me,

324
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,700
I immediately decided my
eyes are squinting. I got
my fucking eyebrow furrowed.

325
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,200
Like, just, you know, I'm doing
that. Come on, come on, come on.

326
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,960
Just tell me how much it's going to be.
Wait, where do I sign? Yeah, go ahead.

327
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,890
Don't give a fuck. I'll be on the road
forever. Don't mind me. Don't mind me.

328
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm just a guy just to
guide, pay in for it. Um,

329
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,160
but seriously, eventually
I have to do, uh, you know,

330
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,810
I got to Redo my fucking piece of shit.
Fucking do it yourself.

331
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,610
Tree fort of a garage and um,

332
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,220
I got a slip that one by the wife,
you know,

333
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,380
they're all about the shit that's in
their world, you know what I mean?

334
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,730
But the garage, which is funny,
which is where most, you know,

335
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,730
most guys who live with women,
you end up in the garage.

336
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,110
So when you say you want to do something
to the garage, like your wife is just,

337
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,430
I don't understand what
he's talking about.

338
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:34,080
His stick around and faces the garage.
Anyway, I just, I just feel like,

339
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,400
I feel like that's the place
where we just drop shit off.

340
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,110
You know?
I would eventually like to do a,

341
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,950
put a little bit of a gym in there.
That's what I should,

342
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,600
if I just had some fucking
here, but I heard this fucking,
those, those treadmills,

343
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:54,600
it's like running like 15
refrigerators at the same time.

344
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,630
So when I'm thinking of doing here me out,
this is my plan,

345
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,650
redoing the garage and on top of you
make it solar powered so it's just

346
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,380
completely off the fucking grid.
Right.

347
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,690
And then I can maybe guilt free,

348
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,310
have some sort of fucking elliptical
assumption that would tell you the time

349
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,270
when I was living with Bobby Kelly,
Robert Kelly from uh,

350
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,820
um Oh sex and drugs and
rock and roll a right.

351
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,510
He plays the drummer. We used to live
together and he was such a pack rat.

352
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:27,360
He used to just bring shit
in off of the fucking street.

353
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,180
And I remember one time I was kind of
living back and forth between La and New

354
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,100
York and I came back from La,

355
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,160
it's like the late nineties and he had
taken from off the street the most boot

356
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:45,330
leg fucking stairmaster
I'd ever seen in my life.

357
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,110
I swear to God it was made out of like,
I don't even know what I mean.

358
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,440
It was whatever the material was,
it just qualified to be metal.

359
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,550
I remember it was white with these red
stripes and you got on the fucking thing

360
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,880
and it had this little digital
clock and you'd start going on it.

361
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:07,320
And as you held the handles,

362
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,400
like any sort of body weight with
like sort of the whole thing,

363
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:14,250
fucking moved like the
frame that it was on.

364
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,540
And I remember he got it and he stuffed
it over in the corner and I just went

365
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:22,180
like, I was like, Bobby, what the
fuck is that? He was like, dude, wait,

366
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,580
talking about dude, you're fucking to
stem as to, I got it off the sidewalk.

367
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:30,930
I got it for free. Do you want
to use it? It's like, no, dude,

368
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,370
I'll go to the gym. Fucking Jim's like
15 bucks a month. It gives a shit.

369
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,370
So, uh, I remember watching him using it
one time and I was laughing my balls off

370
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,750
because he weighed like, and um, he
wasn't, you know, the size he is now.

371
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,790
I'm not trying to make fun of him here.
He just was,

372
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,620
he was 10 times the size of the thing.

373
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:52,530
It looked like it was built for an eight
year old and he was over in the corner

374
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,600
and it's a little ass
fucking liver numbers.

375
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,400
I'm trying to watch this little kitchen
TV that we had that was sitting on this

376
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,010
TV VCR. Oh my God. TV,

377
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,920
VCR Stan that I made in wood class,

378
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,520
like my junior or senior year in high
school that I gave to my dad and he was

379
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,780
supposed to put the TV on top of it and
then underneath it was the VCR and then

380
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:20,430
it had to drug doors that opened on the
bottom like cabinets and in there you

381
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:24,540
put all your VHS tapes. My Dad
took the fucking, I gave it to him.

382
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,200
He took the back off the thing
and he stuck the TV underneath it.

383
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,210
It was so stupid. Yet a lay on the
Florida fucking watch it. Who's classic?

384
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:40,710
My Dad like he's just, I guess I'm
like Kim, like I just see shit.

385
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't see it for what it is. And
then people look at me like, dude,

386
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,920
the fuck is run. That same way that when
I stand in front of a stage, a stage,

387
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:52,670
a stove, and it says turn on
the front burner. To me it's,

388
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,840
it's what everybody else
considers the backburner.

389
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,580
Because the way I look at the stove is
it's like I'm standing behind a car.

390
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't know why.

391
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:00,920
Okay.

392
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,830
Did I just look at it like, I don't
know. Maybe it's my low self esteem.

393
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:06,470
Like I'm standing in the back of the line.
So the front of the lines guy,

394
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,520
I have no fucking idea.

395
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,870
So he took the back off it and
shoved the TV under there and a,

396
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:16,730
I remember all my friends who also took
shop class when they would come over my

397
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:19,940
house like years later drink and they'd
be like, to, what the fuck is a TV?

398
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,350
And I was like, dude, don't even, I don't
even want to tell you I met with my dad,

399
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,120
took the back off,
he ripped the shelf out.

400
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:28,160
He just stuck the TV down
there and they were laughing.

401
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,180
They thought it was the funniest fucking
thing. Ever Day one, here you go, dad,

402
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,080
you know, merry Christmas or
whatever. And Yeah, just fucking,

403
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,230
he modified it. So anyway, so I, yeah,

404
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,260
when I moved out I got it back minus
the back or the shelf and I finally,

405
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:48,560
I remember it was a proud moment that I
put this little piece of shit TV on top

406
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:50,150
of it,
so that things sitting on top,

407
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,540
we got a VCR underneath it and then a
bunch of fucking tapes and shit like water

408
00:24:56,071 --> 00:25:01,070
boy and all that stuff that was fucking
was coming out in the late nineties. And,

409
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:04,160
uh, we had all these Adam Sandler movies
and all this shit that was in there.

410
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,630
So I'm sitting down, oh my
God, it's spring break. We,

411
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,490
I had a fucking couch and uh,
and uh, like a lazy boy that,

412
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,170
but it didn't recline that

413
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:15,930
okay.

414
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,470
Was From my dad's dental office
from the early seventies.

415
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,960
So it had this horrific floral pattern
and it was made out of this wood that

416
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,100
weighed like 9 million.

417
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,480
It took like 10 guys to pick up the
fucking sofa and of course it was busted.

418
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,843
Um,

419
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,180
okay.

420
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,610
So I'm sitting there, right. And I'm,

421
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:37,780
I'm in the fucking lazy
boy that doesn't recline.

422
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,530
And Bobby's over in the corner on this
fucking hunk of shit. Stair master.

423
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,090
I'm trying to watch TV and he's over in
the corner. Go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:50,350
Fucking sweating and shit.
And I'm laughing at my
balls off. He's to fuck you.

425
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,810
Stop making me laugh. Did Right. He's,
he's trying to go on this thing and uh,

426
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,283
okay.

427
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,050
Oh, is this the day? I may
be. I may be combining days.

428
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:03,180
I just remember going into the bathroom

429
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,880
and as I was in the bathroom, you
walked out like the giant, Ooh,

430
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,770
this big living room. You, he
was a railroad apartment, right?

431
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,920
So you walked to the right,
he's in the back left of the room.

432
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,370
I walked to the right and then immediately
make a right into the bathroom.

433
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,980
So it's like a fucking hairpin turn.

434
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,210
So I go in and take a piss
and as I come walking out,

435
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,110
Bobby get picked up a racket ball
and threw it as hard as he could.

436
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,283
Okay.

437
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,620
To hit the wall. It Rekesh. It
was a perfect shot. Records,

438
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:38,590
she couldn't even see me
ricocheted off the wall,

439
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,640
came right in and hit me right in the
mouth and like split my lip a little bit,

440
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:43,474
my lip.

441
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,920
And I remember I had an audition to do
Conan O'Brien that night at the fucking,

442
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,100
uh,
at the comic strip

443
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,620
and I was so fucking mad at
him and he was dying laughing.

444
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,570
Cause see what it was like
a one in a million shot.

445
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,730
It was literally like Larry Bird,
you know,

446
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:07,350
off the fucking camper off the house,
Blah Blah, blah. Nothing but net.

447
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,400
Like he couldn't even see me.
He was on this fucking piece of shit.

448
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:16,401
Stair mastery farm from an off to Simon
and he fucking just fire this thing hit

449
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:22,170
me right in the God damn mouth. So I
just sit there and put pressure on it.

450
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,480
And he kept saying he was sorry,
but I knew he wasn't. And uh,

451
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,090
then I had to get them back and that's
what it was like living with him.

452
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,380
Ah Fuck Man. I don't know how it came
up with that. And that was a long, long,

453
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:44,381
long ass time where I moved into the end
of that place in 1995 and I moved out,

454
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,330
I want to say in 2000,
um,

455
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,790
this fucking railroad apartment.

456
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,480
And I had a walkthrough bedroom and
this little single mattress bed mattress

457
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:03,020
fucking thing, just sitting on a
frame. And I remember my roommate,

458
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:08,000
this Nigerian dude who was into the
Rangers, played hockey and all that shit.

459
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,160
He, uh, he had to walk through our,

460
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,420
like my bedroom to get either to

461
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,760
okay,

462
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,210
his bedroom or to go into the basic
railroad apartment means it's just side by

463
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:19,511
side.

464
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:24,370
So when his bedroom and then my little
half a bedroom and then the living room,

465
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,480
then there was a little hallway with
the bathroom and then the kitchen and it

466
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:31,600
was all just lined right up, like, uh,

467
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,090
people standing in line for
some coffee or some shit.

468
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:38,140
So he had to walk through my
bedroom. So obviously, um,

469
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,790
there was a tremendous lack of fucking
privacy and I remember living there.

470
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,580
And then when I,
I started living in La,

471
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,310
I like sublet it out to Bobby.

472
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,970
And then the roommate was cool to let
me come back when I was in New York to

473
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:55,750
crash. They for like a week or so, we were
all young guys. We didn't give a fuck,

474
00:28:55,751 --> 00:29:00,520
right. So it was fine. And
um, I remember after a while,

475
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:04,330
a couple of years of being
there, I remember Bobby
telling me going like, dude,

476
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,110
we'll be talking about getting
them an apartment. Like,

477
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:10,600
do we should just get an apartment.
I can't fucking do this anymore.

478
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,220
I can't live like this anymore. We living
like, fuck, we will live in like animals.

479
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,320
And uh,

480
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,900
okay.

481
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,090
I remember Bobby just go,
dude, I just want a door.

482
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,970
I just want a door to a room
that's mine that I can close.

483
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,070
And uh, and I remember just sitting
like, oh my God, that'd be unbelievable.

484
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,310
Like that was the big,
that was the big fantasy back then

485
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,360
to just have a fucking door
that you could close. MMM.

486
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,480
Jesus Christ. Was that 20 fucking years
ago? I guess it was. I'm an old man.

487
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:53,160
All right. It's time for some
fucking advertising here.

00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:31,770
I'm done. Uh, you gotta you can't,

563
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:35,750
you have a great weekend and I'll talk to
you on Monday. Bye. Right glitch. Go Pam.

564
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,520
[inaudible]

565
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,280
those guys always get on Monday.

566
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,100
Cross country, fucking flight. So anyways,

567
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:26,290
there was this adorable
woman next to me and uh,

568
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,560
she was from Australia,

569
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,790
had the little fucking accent
and all that type of shit.

570
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,740
So what have long story short,

571
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:38,100
we've taken off from JFK and
one of the runways shut down.

572
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,310
So it's taken for fucking ever write
a couple of people on the plane or in

573
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:46,240
wheelchairs. So that takes more time. You
know, you prefer bial fat fucks, you know,

574
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,700
the whole deal. So, uh,

575
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,590
we take off like an hour and a half late.
Is it just the whole fucking thing.

576
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,620
The bedtime, we land, we
land, there's no gate.

577
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,070
And then we got to sit there and wait
to get towed into the whole thing is

578
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,470
taking forever and sheets does this
shit was, she just goes, she says,

579
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:07,020
she goes as is everything in America slow,
you know,

580
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,610
so I let it slide and then the plane
lands and we're all trying to see who won

581
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:15,070
the Celtics and the Lakers cause
we all miss the fucking game.

582
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,840
Thank God ESPN showed the replay.

583
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,090
I caught the second half and it goes
around the plane, like wildfire fire,

584
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,920
you know the Celtics won,
Celtics won and this girl Maya,

585
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,990
we're always joking about
how much people gives a shit.

586
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:28,810
And then this girl makes comics something
that, you know, Americans fucking Blah,

587
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,330
blah blah blah. And it's
just like, you know what,

588
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,200
I let it slide with the first fucking war,
but it's just really like,

589
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,150
they always talk about
the ignorant American.

590
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:42,050
What kind of a fucking asshole comes here
from another country and shits on the

591
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:47,040
country to somebody who's from this
country. When I was over in England,

592
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:51,240
I didn't walk around saying the English
people how fucking awful their torsos

593
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:55,620
where I didn't do that. They
said I enjoyed England. I'm
like, it's fucking great.

594
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,010
I can't believe I'm over here.
Royal Albert Hall. It's beautiful.

595
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,760
I can't wait to come over here again.
Phenomenal fucking city.

596
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,740
I didn't say your food sucks. You
guys all have will. Pharrel mushy.

597
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:10,380
Torsos I didn't say any of that shit.

598
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,360
I didn't talk about your
teeth being fucked up.

599
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,130
I didn't talk about the weird inbred
look because you've all been fucking each

600
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:21,530
other and the same God damn strip of
land for fucking thousands of years.

601
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,530
I didn't do that shit.

602
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:26,240
I was on my best behavior and here I am
sitting next to this fucking clam who's

603
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,770
everything in America
slow as opposed to what?

604
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,520
That beacon of speed
that fucking Australia is

605
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,680
fucking people. You know,
I went to Australia, I was
there for like three days.

606
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,070
I had a good time down there, but you
know, I could've picked that place apart.

607
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,880
All the unemployed people
just sitting in bars drinking.

608
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,883
Okay.

609
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,720
I fucking hate, you know, same
fucking cunts. Same Goddamn just cuts.

610
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,030
That's all it is.
Everybody taking pot shots in America now.

611
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,660
That's what it is because we've been on
top and we'd been exploiting their labor

612
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,210
and I guess maybe that's maybe we
deserve a little bit of that shit,

613
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:06,530
but you know what to look in the
fucking mirror Australia or a woman from

614
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,364
Australia.

615
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,793
Yeah,

616
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,550
the fuck I went there. I wasn't so like,
wow, like I was going into the future.

617
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,360
Can I have a ham and then the fucking
sandwiches right in my hand before I even

618
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,960
finish it. I didn't find them to
be overly fast over there either.

619
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,760
You wait, you fucking wait. You
think it's not coming your way?

620
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,690
Our corporations are just ahead of the
curve of where where your corporations

621
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:33,330
are.

622
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,330
Are corporations have basically every
last legal way that they can make more

623
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:41,540
fucking money over here,
so now they're just stealing.

624
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,730
They're just stealing and they're
cut and fucking staff members.

625
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,900
I actually had to wait like a half hour,
40 minutes to get my bag last night.

626
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:56,150
I think it was that Sunday thing.
Once again, it's Sunday, it's Sunday.

627
00:38:56,151 --> 00:39:00,870
So we just have like a skeleton crew.
I Dunno all I'm saying, you know,

628
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,360
it's just bugging me.
It's like,

629
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:06,180
do you think I know that that shit
isn't a little fucked up over here?

630
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,040
Do I need you to come over here?
I would never be in Australia and go like,

631
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,330
yeah, Australians to another
fucking Australian. You know,

632
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:18,750
that's the type of shit I should felt
like fucking stuffing her in a god damned

633
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:22,380
boogie board bag. Boogie board
bag. What did I pick that?

634
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:27,360
Because I saw that documentary of that
stupid fuck from Australia who put 200

635
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:30,030
pounds of fucking weed
into a boogie board bag.

636
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,510
Right alliteration for you
and then goes to like Bali,

637
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,540
you know with even have cold medication,

638
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,620
they hang you by your balls in the public
square and she gets life in prison.

639
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,660
Well that's what you get. You
dumped. Fuck. That's what you get.

640
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,870
That's one of my theknot fuck
Australia. That's how it works. You see?

641
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,060
And that's how it works right there.

642
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,550
There's a lot of people in Australia
right now, maybe listen to the shit gone.

643
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:56,820
You know, I would never say that. I
would never do that if I went. Yeah,

644
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,370
well one he did.
So there you go.

645
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,120
Do you think Germany likes to be
judged by Hitler alone? They don't.

646
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,310
I bet there's a lot of
sweethearts over in Germany.

647
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,640
Look at all those fucking fat jolly
people during October fest running around,

648
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:15,560
dressed like they're in Hansel and
Gretel, you know, shitting on each other.

649
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,610
Whatever weird fetishes
they're into over there.

650
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:32,080
[inaudible]

651
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,410
I've started their season at zero and zero

652
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,370
with the holy as amped up the kick the
shit out of them as people were amped up

653
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:19,080
to beat the fucking patriots
it by mid November. All right,

654
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,100
and I'm telling you right now, they are
going to have a mediocre fucking season.

655
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:25,020
I think it's going to start
off with the loss tonight.

656
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,460
I'm not saying that they're not going
to go nine and seven, but these guys,

657
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:32,280
I don't know what their fucking problem
is and not to mention that now they have

658
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,630
a nice little scandal cover the daily
news. They says cool. Your jets,

659
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,430
TV reporter flags team for Lewd behavior.
Um,

660
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,280
Ean is saints reporter for as a TV.

661
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,710
Where the fuck is that broadcast?
It's is at the center of a jet Brouhaha.

662
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,250
Basically, if you see this girl,
she's fucking hottie right?

663
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,270
She's got her little pass here and uh,
you know,

664
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,360
she's got some Cleveland show.
Oh my God. Are you serious?

665
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,890
They got a picture of
her at a jets practice.

666
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,940
She's got on the tightest fucking jeans
I've ever seen in my life with the most

667
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:19,780
perfect round ass you've ever seen.
And she's in high heels.

668
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,221
Okay.

669
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:24,850
And she's walking around a bunch of
football players who got that testosterone

670
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:28,150
going with a fat shit talk and coach,
let me guess.

671
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,740
Somebody said something out of
line. Oh, this is just, this is,

672
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:34,780
you know what I mean?
This right here,

673
00:42:34,781 --> 00:42:36,550
and this is one of these
things where you can't say,

674
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,510
well look how you're dressed. Cause
they go, you're blaming the victim.

675
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,290
She should have a right to have three
quarters of her tits outside of her shirt

676
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,810
with a thong going up
her fucking ass crack.

677
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:54,811
And she should be allowed to walk into
a locker room with a bunch of football

678
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:59,821
players and not have one out of fucking
whatever the fuck you're going to say.

679
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,530
Well, one fucking rude
comic. Gimme a break.

680
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,270
Nfl boss Roger Goodell was
demanding answers last night
from jets players. Well,

681
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,200
why don't you look at
the pictures, Roger. Huh?

682
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,540
What are you a fucking unique? You don't
understand what the problem was. Uh,

683
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,201
for players,

684
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:22,201
coaches accused of subjecting a female
sports reporter to sexist locker room

685
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:27,580
conduct, they should've just said for
subjecting her to locker room conduct.

686
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,170
This is basically what happened.

687
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,820
She went into a locker room and was
subjected to lock a rump conduct.

688
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,750
Can you believe it?

689
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,820
I remember last night when I went out
to a bar and I was subjected to bar rum

690
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:42,220
conduct. I couldn't
believe it. I was like,

691
00:43:42,221 --> 00:43:47,221
what am I in a bar or something as they
prepare for their season opener tonight,

692
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:52,200
gang green is dealing with a burgeoning
scandal over the treatment of Inez

693
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,160
Saints, uh, for Azteca of
Mexico. This girl is a 10.

694
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,650
She's fucking smoking gorgeous.

695
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,930
You've got to see the way she's dressed.
Okay.

696
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,520
And Fuck You lady. Fuck you. Look at the
way she's dressed. She's one of those,

697
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,460
you know what's funny about the broads
out there is this is the kind of girl,

698
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,260
all right, the kind of woman that kind
of fucking who were, who, if you know,

699
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,230
if any of these women, you know,
well listen to his podcast,

700
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:23,110
they're walking down the street with
their husband and this girl comes walking

701
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:25,150
by, they immediately, they take fucking,

702
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:28,610
you know when the eyes become like little
slits, is he looking at them? You know,

703
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,560
and then they're looking at their
husband and they're going to get mad you

704
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,290
because this other bitch goes to the gym.
You know,

705
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:40,260
like somehow it's your fucking fault
and they fucking looking at you because

706
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,350
they can't just come out and say, oh
my God, that girl is fucking gorgeous.

707
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,700
I'm so jealous of her. They, they
can't, they can't own that emotion.

708
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:51,860
So then they look at you and they're just
waiting for you to glance in that part

709
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:56,670
and that woman's direction so
they can blame you. That does.

710
00:44:56,671 --> 00:45:00,450
Fuck another girl is eating right and,
and fucking doing herself up. Right?

711
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,010
It's going to become your fucking fault.
I used to do a bit about that.

712
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,350
Next time you, you know it.
Here's one for you guys on a burn,

713
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,900
a joke right here that I never fucking
record it. So who gives a shit?

714
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,360
Next time you're walking down the
street with your girlfriend, right?

715
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,320
And this fucking unbelievably smoking
shit comes walking up the street, right?

716
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,570
And what do you got? And she
immediately just looks at you like,

717
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:19,410
go ahead and look at her.

718
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,890
So I can take out my fucking hatred of
this better looking girl and make it your

719
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,480
fucking fault, right? This is what you do.

720
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,390
Rather than trying to look away
and having blood come out of your,

721
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,171
out of your eyes,

722
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,380
you try not to look at this fucking
hot piece of it's coming up the street.

723
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:36,270
What you do is you fucking point right
at her and whatever she's wearing,

724
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,890
you tell your girl that she'd look
right in that you point right.

725
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,600
And it'd be like, you know what? You
look great in a dress like that, right?

726
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,070
And then immediately just
a p, you know it, it makes
Samran security go. Oh my God.

727
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:48,750
Really? Do you think I could
get away with wearing something?

728
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:53,310
They totally used to girls feeling good.
You're staring at the girl's ass.

729
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,010
You're talking about the cut of
the dress. You, it's bullshit.

730
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,090
You're checking around without
disrespecting your woman. See right there.

731
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:04,440
Bill Burke bringing couples together.
All right, let's continue on here. Um,

732
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,960
so this woman, 32 years old, 32 years old,

733
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,120
still in smoking fucking shape,

734
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,030
a former miss universe
contestant complained.

735
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:20,250
She was bombarded with cat calls
and boarish antics at the jets,

736
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:25,230
New Jersey training facility to the extent
she wanted to end to end quotes said

737
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:28,770
cover my ears. Um, dying oven, barest.

738
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,740
This woman,
right?

739
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,100
Former Miss Universe contestant who
would walk on stage with a fucking string

740
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:41,490
bikini and high heels with a hoo ha
hanging out talking about how to save

741
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:45,950
Greenland or whatever is
embarrassed because she walked
around. I mean, give me a,

742
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,250
you know what I mean?
This is why women stink.

743
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,200
It's like,
what are you doing there to begin with?

744
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,890
It's a bunch of guys playing football.
It's like,

745
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,770
and then we're cool enough
to let you win there.

746
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:07,070
And then everybody has to fucking adjust
their behavior because your there wake,

747
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:11,010
excuse me, excuse me.
There's a lady present.

748
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,370
You know what I mean? And you'll
wonder why you get called a cunt.

749
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,110
That's why. Right fucking there.
It's just fucking unbelievable.

750
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:27,390
I would never walk into a god damn baby
shower be, oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

751
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,560
There's a guy present.

752
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:32,580
Can we put fucking game on Ovia I wasn't.

753
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,650
I'd be standing in the corner gone. Oh
Gee Gee, when is this Shit gonna be over?

754
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,460
But I wouldn't at any point try to cock
block what anybody was fucking talking

755
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:43,800
about.
Go ahead and talk about sex in the city.

756
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,030
Talk about your favorite shoes or
whatever the fuck it is you do.

757
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,870
I wouldn't be covering my
ears dying of embarrassment.

758
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,690
If you all started talking about
my package, I'd be flattered.

759
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,790
MMM.

760
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,520
This is some of the more and more ignorant
shit that I've said on this podcast.

761
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:03,310
But I think there's a point behind this.
I'll, let's continue with the article.

762
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,043
MMM,

763
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,790
good. Hell is she said, I'm dying of
embarrassment. Saints tweeted in Spanish,

764
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,020
um,

765
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:17,020
Goodell immediately ordered
an investigation into the
troubling in air quotes,

766
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:21,860
allegations, which were addressed
in a team meeting last night. Uh,

767
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,330
this meeting is now called to order,
uh,

768
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,190
last night when that smoking hot chick
with the tight clothes came in and

769
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:31,160
everybody said, God Damn, look
at that fucking ass. Yeah,

770
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,480
you're not allowed to do that anymore.

771
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,623
Uh,

772
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,170
she excuse to coach. Uh,
yeah. Yes sir. Yeah, we'll,

773
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,390
you're talking about that
girl who came in or a Teddy's,

774
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:42,910
we're hanging out of her shirt.
Yeah. That one. Yeah. That one.

775
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,010
We a disrespected her.

776
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:53,170
See, this is, this is the deal.
All right. They come down,

777
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,940
they want the fucking attention. You
know what? Wait, what? What is she,

778
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,550
what is she doing in the fucking
locker room to begin with?

779
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,320
You know what? She even in the locker
room, did I even, they even say that,

780
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:09,760
I can't remember. Didn't you see any given
Sunday? You don't remember that movie?

781
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,370
You're gonna stand there and there's
gonna be some black dude with a dick down

782
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:14,320
to the floor. I mean,
why are you going in?

783
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,500
I wouldn't go in there if I went in there,

784
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,180
they'd start giving me cat calls like I
was at fresh fish guy in the beginning

785
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:24,280
of shot,
Shawshank redemption,

786
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:30,030
and I'd be dying of embarrassment too,
but I'd fucking take it. It'd be like, ah,

787
00:49:30,031 --> 00:49:31,960
well what the fuck did you
think was going to happen?

788
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,040
You're a fucking pansy and you
come in and do an NFL locker room.

789
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:40,840
They're all going to give you shit
and say you're a pussy, right? I mean,

790
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:43,750
what kind of a fucking
world are we living in now?

791
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,050
When a gorgeous woman wearing tight,
ridiculous clothes,

792
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,640
it's going to walk into a fucking at a
football practice and she's going to get

793
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:54,910
upset that she got unwanted attention.
Well,

794
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:59,470
why don't you come there and dress like
they did in the 18 hundreds with one of

795
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:02,080
the big hoop skirts so they
can't see you fucking thighs.

796
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:06,610
This chick is fucking ridiculous.
Look,

797
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,360
look at the New York Daily News and look
at the little inset picture that they

798
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:14,530
have of her. I'm sure they did it for
a fucking reason. It's ridiculous.

799
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,850
Look at that fucking ass. Look at
it. That's the first thing I think.

800
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,960
Look at that fucking ass. Jesus
Christ. And then she's holding a mic.

801
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,200
Looks like a dick in her hand while she
bobbing her head up and down and she

802
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,340
asked the questions.
This is like entrapment.

803
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,170
Okay.

804
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,950
Anyways, let's fucking
continue. Um, but, but proper,

805
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:37,610
we've had contact with the team multiple
times and are moving very aggressively

806
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:41,210
to establish the facts.
The NFL spokesman, Greg,

807
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,250
I Hilo said jets owner woody Johnson
woke up from his coma and said,

808
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,130
oh, wait, that guy no off.
That guy's actually young, uh,

809
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:52,480
called saints to hear or side
of the story, uh, said that,

810
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:57,110
that the team will take any appropriate
steps necessary to maintain a respectful

811
00:50:57,111 --> 00:50:58,520
environment for the media.
Basically,

812
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:03,521
this girl is now going to become a
fucking millionaire off of this lawsuit

813
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,280
because she walked to an NFL practice
with her Miss Universe body with tight

814
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:12,200
fucking clothes on. And
somebody said, God Damn,

815
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,900
look at that fucking ass right there.
Hey mark.

816
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:20,770
What the fuck would you do with dad?
I fucking bed over flubbing table.

817
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,250
Okay,

818
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,100
and then fucking rex. Ryan. I can't even
see him. I fucking my fucking stomach.

819
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:30,690
So big. Huh? Was that a good one? Players.
Do you guys like me? I talk just like you.

820
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,930
I can't wait for them
to fucking lose tonight.

821
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:39,110
[inaudible]

822
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,170
all right,
let's get on to stuff that I want to

823
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,650
bitch about this week. All
right? I know a lot of you guys,

824
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:04,120
you probably think on some level
then. I hate women. All right?

825
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,370
And I gotta be honest with you.
You fucking right.

826
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,850
I don't like hate him individually,
but as a group,

827
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:13,150
they fucking annoying me because
they're always complaining, bitch,

828
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:17,140
moaning and all this fucking crap. Unlike
me who just always brings to sunshine.

829
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:25,030
I, this is the thing, whatever it comes
down to, male, female relationships.

830
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,860
What I've noticed on television is
that if someone's going to be the dose,

831
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,550
it's always the guy. If somebody
is at fault, it's always the guy.

832
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,990
If somebody's going to pay,

833
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,090
it's always the guy except for the
occasional Britney spears. All right. Who,

834
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:44,740
if I ever see a binder, a fucking
beer for growth, that bum ass husband,

835
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,790
right?

836
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,180
Backup dancers sitting around the house
getting fat sitting in sweatpants that

837
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:50,014
she paid for.

838
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,280
You know she ever went over there
and slap the shit out of him,

839
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,540
smashed him on his head with one of her
book dazzled high heels and I was on

840
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:02,830
that jury. I would say not
guilty. I would say not guilty.

841
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:06,550
I would say she's a fucking hero that
she hasn't done it yet. Um, here's,

842
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,260
here's a story for you.
These are the stories.

843
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:10,700
I'm just going to put this out here cause
I'm really hoping that this is going

844
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:11,070
to eat.

845
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:16,070
It inspires somebody to start some sort
of [inaudible] adulation or whatever the

846
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:20,530
fuck you need to do to turn things
around. Because I really, in this country,

847
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,430
there's a major problem.

848
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:26,300
Women are organized and guys are not
when it comes to this relationship shit.

849
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,980
All right. Oh, you go right ahead and roll
your eyes. Ladies. I don't give a fuck.

850
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,530
This isn't for you.
All right?

851
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,880
Here's a nice story is I'm gonna read one
of these every fucking week to fucking

852
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:42,230
people realize what is going on. All
right? What is not, not what is going on.

853
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:45,320
What is also going on is
every fucking three minutes.

854
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:49,040
I got to watch the story about some poor
woman who got the living shit kicked

855
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,260
out of her by some asshole guy,
right?

856
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,290
And you watch enough of those stories
and you start thinking, oh my God,

857
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,080
women are always the victim.
It's not.

858
00:53:57,081 --> 00:54:01,310
So here's a nice story for you.
A little story called,

859
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:06,320
who knew I was not the father?
Do I even need to read it to you?

860
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,530
You know where this is going.
This happens all the fucking time.

861
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,650
But they don't talk about it.
You know,

862
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:14,360
it's not considered a
major fucking problem.

863
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:17,630
It's because guys are not organized
and we have to start bitch moaning and

864
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:20,570
complaining the way women do.
All right?

865
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,930
Just mentally try and imagine what
it's like to, to have a period.

866
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,070
And that's the mindset you need to get
in to, to make change in this country.

867
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:33,670
That's what I think. That's what I think
is needed. All right. Okay. Here we are,

868
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,210
boys and girls gather round. Who
Knew I was not the father. Take one.

869
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:42,810
It was July in 2007 when Mike and Mike
l s the Pennsylvania courts to declare

870
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,240
that he was no longer the father
of his daughter for four years.

871
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:50,740
Mike had known that the girl he had
rocked to sleep and dance with across the

872
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:54,160
living room floor was not as they say his,

873
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:59,610
the revelation from a DNA test was
devastating and prompted him to leave his

874
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:01,210
wife.
Uh,

875
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:05,200
but he had not renounced their child
cause he's a good shit cause he realizes

876
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,610
that the kid,
you know,

877
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:12,830
it's not the kids' fault that
her mom is a whore. You know,

878
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,600
sky's a stand up guy.
But he had not renounced their child.

879
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,660
He continued to feel that in
all the ways that mattered,

880
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:25,661
she was still his daughter
and he faithfully paid her
child support with guys a

881
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:30,860
seat. If there's a god, this guy
is going straight to heaven. Okay.

882
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,680
He could've been bitter.
He could've walked away.

883
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,100
He didn't stood in right.

884
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,770
So it was only when he learned that his
ex wife was about to marry the man who

885
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:46,220
she said actually was the
girl's biological father,

886
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,400
that Mike flipped supporting another's
man's child suddenly became unbearable.

887
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,660
Can you believe this woman?

888
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:55,340
Okay,

889
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,820
why don't they show that? Why don't they,
it's showing all these stories of guys,

890
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:02,570
bt women. What about a woman? Why don't
they show what women do? Shit like this.

891
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,320
Okay.

892
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,990
You know,
not only did she cheat on her husband.

893
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:08,620
Yeah,

894
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,640
she fucked a dude raw.
Not only did she fuck the dude raw,

895
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,840
she led a busted in them that only
did she have a fucking kid with them.

896
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:21,860
She didn't say shit to her husband.
So then make this fucking guy,

897
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,530
he has to find out. He sitting there,
you know, looking out, we looked in,

898
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:30,400
his kid doesn't look anything like
him and she doesn't say shifts.

899
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:34,600
So one day goes to Walgreens,
gifts will DNA tests does a little swab.

900
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:39,601
You Swab of her and then him sends
it off to you gotta be shitting me.

901
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:44,890
Labs in fucking Colorado comes back,
finds out it's not as kid.

902
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,650
He's absolutely fucking devastating.
His God,

903
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,080
their marriages over and
he's still a standup guy,

904
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,670
so now there's fucking whore goes back
with the guy that actually knocked her up.

905
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:57,400
Now they're living together.
Okay.

906
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,260
Wouldn't you think despite
the fact that she's a whore,

907
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,250
that maybe she wouldn't be a cunt to,
you know,

908
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,630
it's unbelievable.
Why not at that point,

909
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,020
just have the fucking real dad pay and
if for some reason the courts are making

910
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,350
this guy go through the motions of
writing the check, just take the check,

911
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,130
cashed it and give it back to the guy.
Why can't you do that?

912
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:22,631
You know why?

913
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:27,310
Because they can never have enough that
you know how guys can never have enough

914
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,770
pussy.
Women can never have enough stuff.

915
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,010
You ever noticed that even if
they have a one night stand,

916
00:57:33,011 --> 00:57:36,940
they still got to get a tee shirt. You
know, they always got to get something.

917
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,350
I don't know if I've said that before
in this podcast, but it's fucking true.

918
00:57:39,351 --> 00:57:41,510
They always got to have stuff,
you know?

919
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,940
And he still got this free fucking money
coming in. This bitch has got to be,

920
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:46,720
she's pimping these guys.
She's got two guys,

921
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:52,420
two guys working for God damn genius.
Also a con,

922
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:56,500
but she's a genius of
a cunt. Okay? I mean,

923
00:57:56,501 --> 00:58:00,730
how dumb is that guy who actually knocked
her up? How dumb is he to marry her?

924
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,230
Who the fuck marry somebody who was
who? Who Marries, who makes somebody,

925
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:10,231
their wife who was already somebody
else's wife and fucked around with you?

926
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:15,820
You saw what she did. You think
she's not going to get tired of you?

927
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,400
You think she's not going
to go somewhere else?

928
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:20,770
Get some more dick and a little more,
you know,

929
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:23,560
foreign spackle between the fucking gams.

930
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,790
Unbelievable Sago.
That's Jen.

931
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,580
That's not misogynistic that I'm
only reason reading these stories.

932
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:35,581
What I'm doing is I'm trying to balance
out the bullshit that you see it on TV,

933
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:41,050
the bullshit vibe that only
guys cheat guys are dogs,

934
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,120
guys, guys, guys do all the fucking
bullshit. It's okay. We are equal,

935
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,250
okay?
We are equal.

936
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,630
We are capable of doing wonderful things
like this guy who did the right thing

937
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:56,950
by this little girl. And we're also
capable of doing horrific things. Alright?

938
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,810
Slapping the Shit Outta fucker.

939
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,900
Women's sticking their heads in the glove
box and try and see if he can get it

940
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:06,520
all the way closed. You know, we
also do shit like that. And ladies,

941
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:06,941
right?

942
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:11,941
They can be absolute angels and they
can be a steaming pile of conflict.

943
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,540
This woman. So there you go. That's
my little fair and balanced reporting

944
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,350
for this week. Go Fuck. I've
done an, I've done two hours,

945
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,100
two and a half hours of comedy
tonight. My new special, uh,

946
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:29,820
I'm taping this Saturday night at
the Lincoln Theater in Washington DC.

947
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,940
And let me tell you something, brother.
I'm fucking bringing it on this one.

948
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:35,563
All right.

949
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:41,140
I am on a mission to outdo my
last two fucking specials. Okay?

950
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,150
And I don't care if you conch,
don't think I did it.

951
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,170
I think I'm going to deal with

952
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:51,150
[inaudible].

953
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,630
[inaudible].
