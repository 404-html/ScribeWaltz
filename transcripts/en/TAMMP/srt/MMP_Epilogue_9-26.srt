1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,440
Alcohol. Hey, what's
going on? It's bill burr.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,780
And as promised this week,

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:11,580
there's going to be a Monday morning
podcast epilogue with uh, the wonderful,

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,460
the lovely, the lovely Nia who's
a little under the weather,

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,590
a little under the weather.
But I'm here for you.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,550
I'm here for you guys to
make me laugh too much,

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,410
but I'm here. Yes, you are
here. Be in a fucking true.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,870
Yeah. Well, I'm also on my
way to the freaking airport,

9
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,871
so we got to do this one quickly
turning old friend into girlfriend or,

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,590
and I see, and I just thought that
this was a question for me, Nia,

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,440
as most of these ares,
considering this is my podcast,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,250
but you have become such an
epic personality on it. Wow.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,960
That more often than not, these
questions start this way. Hey, Bill,

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,990
love the podcast.
We'd really like your,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,460
and then in parentheses and Nias if
possible, thoughts on the subject.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,520
So you've gone up to not being mentioned
at all to saying Nia if possible,

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,570
right? Yeah. Right. And ask and
ye shall receive right. Here I am.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
So you're basically at this level,

19
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:16,410
the same level of the
professor and Maryanne on
Gilligan's island. What do you,

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,840
what do you mean the professor
and Marianne? Because they did,

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,300
they did that song two ways at the
beginning. Right. Pat, can you hear it?

22
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:24,660
Tails and they'd go
[inaudible] ran his wife,

23
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,980
they're movie star and then they'd
be like, the professor ran Mary Yang.

24
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,000
So they already said, um, last,

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,150
but then a couple of times they'd
be like the movie star and the rest.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,270
Oh Hey. Yeah. And the rest and the rest.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,650
And I want to say like that had they had
done that first and their agents had to

28
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,880
been like, listen, who's kidding?
Who Marianne is fucking hotter. Yeah,

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,260
she was definitely hotter and
hotter than ginger. I liked her,

30
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,420
but I always like brunettes better.
I'm a ginger.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm not going to put Yaba Daba do, you
can fucking the same thing. Ginger was,

32
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,470
you know, she was, oh, she was
definitely smoking. But I mean,

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,380
when Marianne was the more, you
know, she was the girl next door,

34
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:08,200
she's more accessible. And I thought
the professor is pretty hot too far.

35
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,610
We really riffing about the Sherwood
Schwartz. We are. All right,

36
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:13,440
let's get into this here.
All right.

37
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,670
There's a lady I've been friends
with for over a decade now.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,650
We met in college and for about a year
or two back then I would have considered

39
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,930
a one of my closest friends. That
means he's jerking off to her, um, to,

40
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,060
I really, I really cherish our
friendship. She walks away. How's,

41
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,000
Yup.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,210
And then he feels really bad and then
he goes to church and he gives money and

43
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,660
that money is used in a pedophile case,
you know,

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,160
so ladies really taking it
out. They're all friends. Yeah.

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,350
For the kids. Oh God. Um, during
that whole time she had a boyfriend,

46
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,030
so I never thought about making a move,

47
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:58,770
stupid and lack the confidence to do
so anyways. It's not a husband. Um,

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,621
as time went on,

49
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:04,570
we gradually lost contact until recently
I found her on Facebook like you do,

50
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,760
like you do.
And we spoke for the first time in a,

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,510
we live in the same city. So I
suggested we get together and catch up,

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,560
which she is enthusiastic
about and is going,

53
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,060
it's going to happen sometime soon.

54
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:23,590
Now for the details were both single and
30 years old. She's recently divorced.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,060
No kids clean break with little to
no drama. Nice. She is beautiful.

56
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,610
And honestly one of the
nicest people I've ever met.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,190
That's funny cause I see a red flag. Oh
yeah. Then why'd the guy just dumper, uh,

58
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,090
you know, that she didn't dump
him? Oh, come on. Oh, come on.

59
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,820
Was seriously, seriously. What do you,

60
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,450
where are you based in a stop it people
get divorced for a lot of reasons.

61
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,650
Stop it.
Um,

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,640
I had no point. I just want to annoy you,
so, all right, go ahead and finish it up.

63
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,360
Hurry back when we were close,
I was okay looking,

64
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,040
but extremely skinny and shy.

65
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:04,660
Since then I put on about 25 to 30 pounds
of fat and muscle distributed pretty

66
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,950
evenly.
This guy's an honest guy,

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,370
so I'm looking much better and
that is boosted my confidence. Um,

68
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,750
yeah cause you can use your gut
to pin them against the bar.

69
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,860
He'd going home with me.
That's disgusting.

70
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,900
My question. She has only know
me as the friend Zone Guy,

71
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,450
the classic Chris Rock Bit.
Uh,

72
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,170
but does eight years with no contact or
racist and you think I might have a shot

73
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:29,620
with her.

74
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,790
Any advice on how to go about this and
how to act and what to say on the night

75
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,570
we catch up would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

76
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,340
A PS, one thing may be an issue
here. After I suggested a ketchup,

77
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,120
I checked on her Facebook page and it
turns out that she changed her status from

78
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:51,010
married to single only a day or two
earlier. How would you find that out?

79
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,450
Cause he was watching it, watching
stalking her on Facebook. Yeah.

80
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,110
He knows every little fucking
change she makes it. Yeah.

81
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,110
But this could be as hard though.
It could be as hard, you know? Yeah.

82
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:06,040
But I think at a certain point you got
to step away from the Facebook. Yeah.

83
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,110
But without that he wouldn't, he
wouldn't have seen it. But anyways,

84
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,970
he gets his button real life.
That's true.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,980
She said she's been signal for a few
months. Yeah, so that was inadvertent,

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,540
rotten timing on my part.

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,240
Hopefully I don't come across as tankless
opportunities. Opportunistic douchebag.

88
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,430
No, no, no, no, no. Not at
all. I don't think so. No,

89
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,210
because they are probably separated
for a long time, you know,

90
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,730
but still technically married. Look,
no marriage falls apart in three weeks.

91
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,650
She was already mentally out, you know?
Yeah. They probably having problems.

92
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,870
They separate and he moved
out or she moved out,

93
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,870
but she still technically married.
She's sleeping in the bedroom.

94
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,620
He's downstairs on the couch or whatever.
Or they're in separate places.

95
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,910
They might have different bedrooms. I'm
not, no, I'm not saying it like that.

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,780
She could be paying for the house.
I didn't mean it like that.

97
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,890
I was saying like that weird,

98
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,650
like the end of the relationship where
you're in the same place and like you got

99
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,440
to pass each other in the kitchen,
you know,

100
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,040
and act like you're on
a subway and don't know

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
each other.

102
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,360
Well,

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,110
I guess that does happen if people can't
afford to go and get their own places.

104
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,160
But yeah,

105
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:07,490
you'd think in an ideal situation they
wouldn't have to still be under the same

106
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,420
roof looking at each other and thinking
about all the things that went wrong.

107
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,140
All right,
so he wants to know,

108
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,980
does the eight years I've not
contact erase the pass. Yeah.

109
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,050
Does that erase the free now? It
does not. No, no, no it doesn't.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,240
I don't know that it doesn't erase
the friend zone. How does that

111
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:25,950
work?

112
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,950
Like I can't hang out with someone who
has a vagina and not eventually wanna

113
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,080
Bang,
Bang them

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,333
with.

115
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,410
Yeah. Unless I'm just completely
not attracted to them,

116
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,550
which means they would have
to be some sort of, you know,

117
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,460
major car accident or something.
That's, that's a horrible thing to say.

118
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,830
Yeah. I'm just, I don't, it
doesn't, it doesn't. Um, no,

119
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,560
it's more like you guys have
a history of friendship,

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,040
but it can always change
because things change.

121
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,560
At what point when you, when, when
you're hanging out with somebody,

122
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:07,460
would you be like, oh, this person's like,

123
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,590
cause I would just think if,

124
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,380
if you're hitting it off and you'd
be like being in friends. Yeah.

125
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,460
Then eventually aren't you thinking
like, well hey, you know, maybe, uh,

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,700
maybe this would go to the next level.
What it does cross your mind.

127
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,100
So what exactly does a guy do?

128
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,930
How can we avoid this purgatory? Because
none of us want to be friends with you.

129
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,980
Well, really we look at bump, Bang
them with you, then a friendship. Bang.

130
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,390
If I'm begging you,

131
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,160
then I can become friends with you by
discovering who you are after the ass.

132
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,550
But you don't think that people can
be friends with each other. Right.

133
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,640
Hang out and,
and not have that energy between them.

134
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,710
Listen to you. I'm a closer, I'm hoping,
I was hoping to give you a spit take. No,

135
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,880
I don't know. Is she
drinking your I'm sick. T I a

136
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,780
hi philosophy that I'm friends
with guys and I bring it with you.

137
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,910
Yeah,
exactly.

138
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,310
You're not friends with women because
you're one of those people that doesn't

139
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:12,520
think that men and women can really be
friends because the sex thing always gets

140
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:16,660
in the way. Which I used to feel
big time. Yeah. I don't know,

141
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,800
but I don't think that's true anymore
because I'm friends with a guy, isn't it?

142
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,840
It's not like that because
it's 100% it's not really.

143
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,180
It's a maturity thing. Yeah, absolutely.

144
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,570
Mm. I Dunno. Maybe. Well, all right.
Well, you know what? It's not like I'm,

145
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,350
I'm not going to waste time on this thing
actually trying to defend that I'm a

146
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,184
mature human.
Yeah,

147
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,110
I'm not, there would be no
point now. That wouldn't be.

148
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't think I would just trash myself.
Then you piled on. Hey did. So anyway.

149
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:51,320
I don't think that the eight years
it doesn't. I had to get out of it.

150
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,230
How does this guy get out of it? You
go and you meet and you, you, you,

151
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,870
you take it up notch. Now you're both
single. You're both older and wiser.

152
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,020
Don't stop speaking in code. Is it the
take it up and watch what you throw?

153
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:05,730
Some sugar in there, like a Mario
Batali. Oh No. What's his name? Emilio.

154
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,810
Estevez. What's the name of that
fucking cook? Mri. Got some sugar, Bam.

155
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:12,990
And the crowd goes nuts. Yeah.
You just, you flirt with her.

156
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,250
He just maybe compliment her a little
bit more than you did before and all that

157
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:20,270
kind of stuff would take it slow.
Start hanging out more. All right,

158
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,690
let's break your attentions. Next role.
Play. Okay. Okay. You're the dude. Okay.

159
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,210
And I'm the chick. Oh God. In the friend
zone after eight years. Right. All right.

160
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:35,070
We're meeting. Okay. And we
see each other. Hey. Oh my God.

161
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:38,580
Look at you. You look amazing. How are
you doing? Oh, thank you. Well, you know,

162
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,900
considering, yeah, marriage just
ended. I'm sorry to hear about that.

163
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:43,621
I don't know what that was.

164
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,500
There's a lot of cards in this
restaurant that's really, oh,

165
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:51,480
we don't have to eat here. No, I got
it. Okay. I saw some things on the menu.

166
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,380
Yeah. So, well, we can go wherever you
want. It's up to you. Okay. Yeah. Um,

167
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,270
I'm sorry to hear.

168
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:01,260
I was just bringing that negativity
and that's why I was never this person.

169
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,680
I would never, this person, he
brought that in my car and I remember,

170
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,090
I remember you. Okay. And
you were the most positive
radiant person I've ever met.

171
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,340
Oh, stop. I have no doubt. No, seriously.

172
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,710
I have no doubt that it wasn't,
it wasn't your fault. Listen,

173
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,750
I know it takes two to tango to,
to end the relationship.

174
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,380
Jumping into this sign up. You already
met the host of Shit and you're just, wow.

175
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,570
I have to admit. I'm excited to see you.
Uh, can we kitsu please. That's nice.

176
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,390
You know, it's been a while since I felt
somebody was excited to see me. I am,

177
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:34,950
I'm excited for it for awhile to see. I
got to admit. Um, but anyway, tell me,

178
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,600
tell me what else is going on with you.

179
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,420
At what point are you going to throw a
joke out there? If I could just interject.

180
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,790
You've got to make a laugh at
some point. Why? I'm sorry,

181
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,250
I'm not a professional frigging comedian.
All right.

182
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,170
I'm just going to get you nowhere,

183
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,170
the ground. Alright. Okay. Alright. Okay.
Um, you want to eat in the high road?

184
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,540
Whatever you want to do. Okay. Well
you didn't inside. Okay. All right.

185
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,460
Can I get you want something to drink
or uh, oh yes. What do you want?

186
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,930
I'll have a alone and lethal bottle. Okay.
Oh, just a lot. A lot of stress. Yeah,

187
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,350
I understand. Can we get a bottle of
your house? Where though? Thank you.

188
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,640
You want some food or like a
salad or burgers? Absolutely.

189
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,780
So what have you been doing?
You look different. Well, yeah,

190
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,250
muscular and kind of fat and it all works.

191
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,040
Let

192
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,090
me try to take care of myself. I got to
to, I wanted to look nice for you tonight.

193
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,290
Fuck this. W W like I
personally, I would try one,

194
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,400
I'll throw my theories out here.

195
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:41,401
What I would do is I would come in and
immediately try to make her laugh and

196
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:46,960
it's some point I would point out how
gorgeous some other woman was that just

197
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:50,440
walked by. Like, wow, that girl's, you
know, and cause that would be like, oh,

198
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:52,780
you like her is that was,
you're fucking me into that.

199
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:56,320
But by me kind of start steering it
towards the sex thing to get out of the

200
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,990
friend zone. Wow. You've changed,
you're like really forward.

201
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:03,250
Now you're on the side of my breast.
That's not really a hug is it?

202
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,180
That's ridiculous.
Terrible idea.

203
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,700
It's the name of my next special what?
That's ridiculous. That's a terrible idea.

204
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,650
That sums up all of my theories. No,
no, no. He should go on there and be,

205
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:21,040
he should be flirtatious
with her and have it not you.

206
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,000
So you can then get the motor running.
You can then as as that, and you're right.

207
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,170
Cause it shouldn't be too much
dwelling on the past that Oh my God,

208
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:32,680
what happened and all, I'm so
sorry about that. It shouldn't be.

209
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,420
So you want to get her out of that.
He

210
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,170
wants to go in and just be like,
I'm living life. Bring in this.

211
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,540
He's got a light up there. He's got to go
magic Johnson on this one. Right, right.

212
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,260
Exactly. Not Corinne. He's gotta
be magic. Not Kareem. It's right.

213
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,440
Yeah. He wouldn't know. You should go in
there. Be flirtatious. Be Complimentary.

214
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,430
Definitely. Definitely. But don't
be in a, not in a predatory way.

215
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,950
I don't know that this guy
really understands the balance,

216
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:04,030
or maybe he does and he's just got,
he's a stalker,

217
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,320
but he doesn't want to be too far the
other side because then it's like,

218
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,220
what happened to you? You used to be so
nice and all of a sudden you're a creepo.

219
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,490
So he's got to be able to
bring back that flirtatious,

220
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:18,800
sexy energy without
being totally disgusting.

221
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,800
And Are you guys picking up on this?
This is what,

222
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,310
this is why it's so hard for guys to
get laid because it's literally like

223
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:29,290
dismantling a bomb. It's gotta be
the perfect combination of flirty,

224
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,740
but not creepy,
but not overbearing,

225
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:37,610
but not disinterested or whatever, if I'm
using that word correctly. Um, listen, I,

226
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,370
I think you've, you've, you've, you've
helped without a doubt. I'm sorry.

227
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,290
No, no, no. It's just that I have
to go to the fucking airport. Um,

228
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,980
shout out to Jacksonville.
Shout out to Jacksonville.

229
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:53,830
I'm coming to that strip mall out
there to the comedy zone with dude.

230
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,880
I called it. What did I say?
What did I say? Robinson Cano.

231
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,330
Dude Robinson could know.
Um,

232
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,170
Paul Versey as guests that your pulverize
the impression. It's really, I'm just,

233
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:07,690
I started to do Bobby and
then I tried to tone it down.

234
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,160
I thought it sounded like Bobby,
anything. That's it. Yeah, that's Bobby.

235
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,120
But that's just become a
generic sort of impression.

236
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,730
Kind of like your generic female voice.
Yeah.

237
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,360
It was kind of sounds like a stereotypical
gay man. It's a little bit different.

238
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,570
I twist it up. Oh, I see. That's
what's set up just a little bit. Yeah.

239
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,400
I never claimed to be Michael
Winslow. Okay. I'm a one
trick pony. I see something.

240
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:33,730
It makes me angry and
then I yell about it. Uh,

241
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,060
just tell this guy I,
I'm excited.

242
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm excited for this guy
as the one I want to say.

243
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,110
I'm excited for this guy
to reconnect with her

244
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,090
to possibly take it to the next level
cause I think they've got a great

245
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:49,480
foundation. Your friends.
Yeah. I don't know. It's nice.

246
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,520
It's a nice story and it's a,
he seems like a nice guy.

247
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,160
Go in there and make it happen,

248
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:59,060
but it doesn't necessarily have to
happen on the first meeting, you know,

249
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:02,270
you'd meet up, it'd be kind
of flirty, you walk away,

250
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,690
you come back to it and
then you hang out again.

251
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,890
Then you playing ping
pong and it's just like,

252
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,890
well he just got to learn not
to get into that friend zone.

253
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,430
You got to make it more about
like how she's attractive,

254
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,590
make it clear that you're interested in
her and you've always say for certain

255
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,690
just reach across. He puts your hand on a
forum and you say, listen, listen Selena,

256
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,600
I really hope this isn't too forward,
but I have always,

257
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,600
always, you know, you got to maybe
pull the move. You pulled on me.

258
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,150
What do you, what do you mean when
you were like let's share a cab.

259
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,170
When we were living in New
York and I was like, why?

260
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,400
Why do you want to share a cab? And I
said, cause I want to kiss you. Yeah.

261
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,490
And that was like the perfect thing
to say. But he got, see, it's honest.

262
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,650
It's like, you know, it
kind of sets the mood.

263
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,450
I looked at your fat
and then I looked away.

264
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,090
You can't say that in the continued
to stare it up. No, that's,

265
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,490
that is the world series of poker moment.
When you go fucking,

266
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:07,250
I'll let you go all in and then
you stand up, you walk around,

267
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,030
walk around the table. Here
comes the river. Right. Exactly.

268
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:14,260
I'll take a cab with you. I was
fucking, I was on my game that night.

269
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,380
You were then we got in
the cab and you said, uh,

270
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,880
is would riding along and that fucking
jerk off was driving like a maniac.

271
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:23,600
You said, you're going to kiss me yet. And
I said, no, I'm waiting for a red light.

272
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,100
We had a red light and then we kissed.
Right. That's true. Then what happened?

273
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:31,430
We drove again. The guy's being a maniac
and then he slowed down and you're like,

274
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,310
it's another red light.
And then that was it.

275
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,390
And I was in Bingo
Bango and then hit left.

276
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,270
Fuck. I am years later with the dog

I'm sorry to those Twitter on Conan.

287
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,400
They tweeted me.
There you go.

288
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,470
And they said that they enjoyed
my performance and I had a uh,

289
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,910
I had a great time.

290
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,540
I thought you, I thought you did an
amazing job on Conan. It was a hilarious,

291
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,040
people were really, uh, taken
aback by your Steve Jobs.

292
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,760
Yeah, but they weren't though. They
weren't, but they weren't. Come on, man.

293
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,141
You know what it is.

294
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:43,410
It's like those are a bunch
of happy people who came
out to Hollywood wanting to

295
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:47,010
go to a TV taping are all in a great
mood and all of a sudden this 44 year old

296
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:50,100
curmudgeon comes out.
It took half a then they got

297
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,280
on board. I had a good time.
No, it was funny. Yeah.

298
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,320
And Conan was was awesome as always.
He just started teeing me up.

299
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,490
The end of wars is really likes you too,
which was a fantastic Bam.

300
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,130
You guys watch the whole cone and
you should have because they have to.

301
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,330
Florence band of horses is at the
troubadour on Thursday night. Yeah.

302
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,830
So if you want to see these
guys, you should go. Yeah,

303
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:18,831
they are kick ass bad and they loved
you and they're opening up for a Willie

304
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,470
Nelson coming up. So it's, Oh my God.
Usually when they come through here,

305
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:26,070
like my buddy Solomon, like the Wiltern
theater, which is like a 300 seat or so.

306
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,560
The troubadour, you know, it's a good,

307
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,230
good venue that holds like 400 people.
That's like the coming over to your house.

308
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,400
They're probably sold out already.
I don't know why.

309
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,250
Why do we go with the
negative? No, not to happen?

310
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,520
Because they will see the horse assuming
that they're going to be sold out

311
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,880
anyway. All right, well, I'll try it.
I'll try and see if I can get you some.

312
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,500
All right. I have to go to the
lovely Nia. Everybody. Oh, the, uh,

313
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,510
the epilogue. Well, love.
I'll talk to you on Sunday.

314
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,090
Maybe I can drag Versie onto the podcast.
I'll see you.
