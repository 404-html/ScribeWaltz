1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:09,780
September 29th,
2014 how the heck are you?

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,430
Oh, that's good. You know it's
always great to hear the doing well.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,920
What are you doing right now
and your Monday morning? Hi,

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,280
you're driving through the fucking rain.
Goddamn windshield wiper.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,680
Wow. Wow. Right.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,390
Trying to clear your fucking windshield
so you can see that awful building that

8
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,640
you hate going into.
Yeah.

9
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:36,200
We get the urge to just fucking keep
driving right by it. You know what?

10
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:38,600
If you don't make that left,
what if you don't make that right?

11
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,460
What if you just keep going straight?

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,270
What would happen if you
took your cell phone?

13
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,150
You throw it out the fucking window and
he just kept going and you didn't talk

14
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:52,470
to anybody and you just kept driving.
You got a credit card on you, right?

15
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,660
You got a debit card.
You just keep fucking dry.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,090
Yeah,

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,060
right up and over the hill.
Right.

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,900
Passed at fucking solely Eaton
God damn place you work at.

19
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:07,860
You just kept fucking going.
Are you commuting right now?

20
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,220
I want somebody to do it. Throw your
cell phone out the fuck a window.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,930
Just keep driving. I want to know how
far you get and how long you can last

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,580
before you come back with your bottom lip
quivering because you realize that you

23
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:28,200
don't know how to start a fire without
a match. You ever think about that?

24
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,120
You have to think about how stuck in the
matrix you are as you drive to work on

25
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:35,240
a fucking Monday morning. Why do I
assume that all of you hate your job?

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay.

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,750
Maybe you love your job.
Maybe,

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,600
maybe you, maybe you love it. Maybe
you're like, I like a job. Let me think.

29
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,510
I'm going to take some jobs. I think that
I would actually, I would actually love,

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,790
I would love, uh, being
a veterinarian. Oh,

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,910
I dunno about that. Seeing animals in
pain, but you can get them out of pain.

32
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,380
Then you've got to deal with the weird
owners. I wouldn't mind some pet owners.

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,380
I would be like the,
the owners that like,

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,430
I dunno, they never found love,
so now they love their cat.

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,440
It could just be a really sad place.
Right.

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,000
I think the first thing I would
do if I was a vet would be, um,

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,050
why we're trying to become
some sort of specialist. Well,

38
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:26,000
I got to enter through the back of the
veterinarian place and I never had to

39
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,360
talk to the owners. You know,
like I don't want to meet him,

40
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,200
you know, Kinda how like I handle
people who advertise on this podcast.

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,050
I never talked to any of them at anytime.
They fucking complain.

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,990
I just give them the money
back and then that's it.

43
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,910
But I knew I never get
on the phone with them.

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,770
My advertising person will call me, you
know, send me an email and just be like,

45
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:50,280
all they want to talk to you
about your last read. Uh,

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,220
do you have any availabilities this
week? And I just say, no, I don't.

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,110
What about next week? I, I don't
foresee myself being available ever.

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,220
If they didn't like to read.
I understand it. I mean,

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,490
forget about what I said
derogatory about their product.

50
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,770
I bought the fact I can't
even read the God damn copy.

51
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,450
You know that alone and I just give
him a full refund. There you go.

52
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,840
One free,
awful read for you sir.

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,450
Enjoy your God damn. Whatever the
fuck it is. Just a little queasy.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,940
Whatever the hell are you trying to
self get. Just so Lilla queasy here.

55
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,690
MMM. Well if it makes you feel better.
I feel like doing that sometimes too.

56
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,230
I feel like just fucking, I don't
know what I feel like doing lately.

57
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:40,590
I've just felt like God, I don't
know, going to Wyoming, you know,

58
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,260
and talk to them. Real people that put
their pants on one leg at a fucking time,

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,730
you know, go out there and
talk to some homophobic, racist

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,980
and all that. I think their
neighbor got pro by a fucking alien.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,100
How about that for a nice change of pace.

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,510
Get out there on the open road,

63
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,720
fucking run over something and a rental
car. You don't even know what it is.

64
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:11,290
Just so far out in the Bush, you don't
even know what that fucking ammo was.

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,590
It wasn't on for fucking legs. You would
have thought you hit somebody in a,

66
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,170
in a bushy coat. I don't even know what
I'm talking about. And you know what,

67
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,050
I don't give a fuck cause I just have
to get through this thing this week.

68
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:27,850
I just got to somehow Babel for another
God damn hour so I can get on with my,

69
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:32,600
uh, I can get on with my day
now. What can I talk about here?

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,320
Uh, Oh, last week I mentioned
that I was going back to Boston,

71
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,383
right?

72
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,900
Going back to Boston
for the SPRIG tobe um,

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,360
I was gonna go back and go to
Derek Jeters last game at Fenway.

74
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,220
And what ended up happening was I ended
up getting busy out here and I, you know,

75
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,910
this business
show business,

76
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,040
it knows when you're going to go
do something fun. Oh wait a minute,

77
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,650
he's going to go do something for himself.
Alright.

78
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,130
So I didn't go back Friday and, um,
I just, I'm just too fucking busy.

79
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:11,740
So I ended up giving the tickets
to a buddy of mine. And, uh,

80
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,020
the day I sent them out, all of a
sudden Judah said he wasn't playing.

81
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,890
And I got to admit for the
first time in his entire career,

82
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:22,580
I was upset with the guy. I was like,
no, why the fuck would he do that?

83
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,770
Everybody went out and
spent all that extra money.

84
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,940
Yeah.

85
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,150
You know, they want to pay their
respects, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,080
You wait till everybody buys their
tickets. Then out of nowhere,

87
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,270
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

88
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,650
You know, I was acting
like a fan, a selfish cunt.

89
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,400
Fuck what you want to do,

90
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:51,401
Derek Jeter do what I want you to do and
your career in a way that's convenient

91
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,620
to me.
I actually was doing that.

92
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:55,830
Okay.

93
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,310
Then I kind of watched the highlight of
the Yankee game when he hit the walk off.

94
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,050
Right. And I was just like, yeah,
that's the way it should end.

95
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,210
Why was I getting mad at them? That's
exactly the way it should have ended.

96
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,940
Kinda like Jordan,
you hit that last second shot.

97
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,880
Granted it was for a championship.
That's how it should, it ended.

98
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,280
He shouldn't have come back and
played for the fucking war, is it?

99
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,260
Yeah.

100
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,770
All right. And people were saying how
Ted Williams hit that walk off home,

101
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:29,160
run for the red sox. And then he sat out
the last three games of the road trip.

102
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,370
So, uh, I guess he had a right
to do that. But you know what,

103
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:36,030
he ended up coming up anyways. I don't
even pay attention to what I've, I, uh,

104
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,460
I watched a little clip of it
on the Internet is last. Uh,

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,280
ms last hit,

106
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,140
he got an RBI Chapa over the
third baseman who was playing in.

107
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,910
So I guess there was a runner in
scoring position, the runner score.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
He got an RBI against the red sox.

109
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:55,810
I guess they gave him a nice ovation
and all that type of shit. And a I,

110
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,120
why is he so,
once I read that he was tired,

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,420
all the media and all of that type of
crap, it's just like, you know what?

112
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,110
Fuck that this guy has been in the
public eye for 20 goddamn years. Okay.

113
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,580
He doesn't know anybody,
anything.

114
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:10,360
If he wants to blow off the last
couple of games, fucking you don't.

115
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,010
So whatever.

116
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm actually oddly sad and melancholy
that that guy's career is over.

117
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:20,200
Actually looked at Wikipedia to see
if it already said Derek Jeter was a

118
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:22,570
professional football player.
Fortunately it didn't.

119
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,350
Still said is a professional baseball
player cause I guess he hasn't put it in

120
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:29,890
his retirement papers yet. Do you
file those afterwards? I have no idea.

121
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,310
But um,
I dunno.

122
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,060
But as country as I was for those like
24 hours when he said he might not play,

123
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,750
um,

124
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,790
nobody could top the neediness
of Keith Olbermann this week.

125
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,660
The way he fucking, uh,
finesse those stats.

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,810
I've never seen a guy so desperate for
fucking love and acceptance in my life.

127
00:07:55,811 --> 00:08:00,811
All I heard after like the first fucking
minute of that Keith Olbermann shit was

128
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:06,160
this was a guy he want,
he wants everybody to say about him,

129
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,920
what they're saying about Derek
Jeter. And it's just like, dude,

130
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,440
you're not that guy.
All right?

131
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,510
You had fucking ice cold parents.
They didn't hug you.

132
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,110
So now you don't even know how
to accept the love that you want.

133
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:24,040
So you push it away. That's why you
get fired every fucking six weeks.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,240
That's why you go on TV and you say
stupid things like Mr President shot your

135
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,150
mouth.

136
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,280
Okay.

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,240
Oh my God,
that guy redefines horses ass.

138
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,340
I can't believe anybody even watches that.

139
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,710
He comes off like a
fucking cartoon character.

140
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,870
He was part of his criticism of
Derek Jeter was he said he won four

141
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:54,890
championships at the, in
his first five years. Right.

142
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,730
This is part of his criticism that he
won four championships his first five

143
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:03,750
years. He goes, how many did
he win the last 14 years?

144
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,700
He only won one. Oh, what a piece of shit.

145
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,850
He only one five. And
you know what, actually,

146
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,850
that was great criticism by Keith
Olbermann because a lot of people don't

147
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:18,990
realize that not only did Derek Jeter
play shortstop for the New York Yankees,

148
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,980
he also was their GM and he,
um,

149
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,040
he made all those decisions to sign the
Kevin Brown's to sign that $200 million

150
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,380
fuck an albatross that's been hanging
around their neck. Alex Rodriguez,

151
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,190
a rod right now, although those
were all Derek's fucking decisions.

152
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,580
Give me a fucking break. That
was one of the, um, I don't,

153
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,980
I always put that it was actually,

154
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:47,820
he came off like a manager of a wrestler
and he was trying to sell a fight,

155
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:52,500
so he was just arguing the other side.
He was pulling in like a skip Bayless,

156
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,570
Bayless. I couldn't even, Steph almost
forgot his name halfway through it.

157
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,580
Do you ever do that? And you start
to forget the name, but you know,

158
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:59,220
it begins with a baby and he just
go with it. Rewind what I just said.

159
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:03,180
Listen how I said Bayless, I
could never do that again. Um,

160
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,980
male Bayless.
Um,

161
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,800
okay.

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,210
Yeah, that, that guy. Yeah. I Dunno.

163
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,470
I just completely lost my
fucking train of thought now.

164
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,380
Okay.

165
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,280
Oh yeah. He completely forgot to
bring up that the guy hit 3,400 hits.

166
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,750
Forgot to bring all of that up.
It was just a,

167
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,270
yeah.

168
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,950
Oh. And then he did that really
fucking, uh, taken out of context,

169
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,800
cheesy fucking thing where the egos,
you know,

170
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,810
Derek Jeter is not the greatest
Yankee of all time, blah,

171
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:36,501
blah, blah, blah, blah.

172
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:40,700
And then they fucking show Jorge
Posada saying that he's the best,

173
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,990
you know, it's, it's his teammate.
What do you think he's going to say?

174
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,770
You know, if they actually asked Jorge,
but do you think that he's fucking,

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,633
you know,

176
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,060
do you honestly think that he's better
than Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all

177
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:55,890
that? And he would obviously say, look,

178
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,190
okay.

179
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,990
You know,
I at least I would think he would.

180
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,991
He would just say he belongs in
the same sentences as those guys.

181
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,210
And I wouldn't argue that,
you know,

182
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,360
I used to think that Derek
Jeter was overrated. You know,

183
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,590
before I moved to New York.

184
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:14,800
And then once I went to New York and I
started watching them rooting against the

185
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,710
Yankees every night,
and I saw that other shit that he did,

186
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,100
three game losing streak,
they finally get a rally,

187
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,860
somebody gets a hit and the guy's scores.

188
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:27,970
Who's the first guy at the top of the
step and the dug out, the fucking captain,

189
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,640
all that shit that a guy like Keith
Olbermann who's not a fucking team player,

190
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,660
Maurice Star project that shot your mouth.

191
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:42,661
Who the fuck would ever have the fucking
balls to go on television and reprimand

192
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,210
the president.
You know,

193
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,600
sitting there talking like
you're in the Pentagon.

194
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,150
Yeah.

195
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,910
I swear to God. Some people, you know,
you give him a gel in their hair,

196
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,620
you give him a suit and
put a camera on him.

197
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:59,550
All of a sudden they think
they know shit. Um, so anyways,

198
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,790
he was either d the w it'd be,
it'd be me, it can't speak.

199
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,640
He was either doing that
or he was just fucking a,

200
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,540
okay.

201
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,840
He was just being a contrarian just to
get some ratings because I never watched

202
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,510
that guy show. I just don't. Yeah.

203
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,900
What happened was the most amazing thing
about Keith Overman is how big he is.

204
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,770
I mean, when he went on
Letterman, Letterman said it
like, you are ready. Large man.

205
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,790
Like he just fucking gigantic.
Like he could have played.

206
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,060
Okay.

207
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,200
He's like a fucking refrigerator,
whether with a head on it. Um,

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,950
but I haven't said all that,
you know, I gotta tell you,

209
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,550
fuck Keith Olbermann I've
got to be wondering why said
all that shit about Derek

210
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,383
Jeter.

211
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,893
MMM.

212
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, you know, it was great this week.
No, no, no, no, no. Ray Rice Shit.

213
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,170
I didn't watch any pregame,
but I didn't hear anything about it,

214
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,640
which is great that that died down just
in time for a month of that pink horse

215
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,700
shit coming up already started to see it.

216
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,830
Some fucking bottle pink lemonade.

217
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,980
Just in case you forgot
the last 11 months.

218
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,400
There's something out
there called breast cancer

219
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,090
and it's a bad thing and we need to find
a cure just in case you forgot that it

220
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:13,350
exists. We're going to paint
everything pink this month.

221
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,193
All right.

222
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,920
We're going to tell those children in
the sweatshops in El Salvador that when

223
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:24,921
they make the pink shit for the NFL may
get extra pink this year just in case

224
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,890
anybody forgets. Um, oh Jesus.

225
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,520
I thought it was going to be in a good
mood this week. I'm like extra cunty here.

226
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,410
Did you guys watch it in
the, any of the, uh, the NFL
football? I um, I did my usual,

227
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,100
I told you my new thing. I watched
the early game and I tape another one.

228
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,120
I watched the four o'clock game and I
tape another four o'clock game and then I

229
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:49,590
take the Sunday night game and then I
watched the one one o'clock one four

230
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:50,424
o'clock.

231
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,700
Then I watched the Monday night game and
then Tuesday I watched the one o'clock

232
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,770
game.
Wednesday I watch the four o'clock game.

233
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,220
Thursday I'll watch Thursday night
football Friday or watch Sunday night

234
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:03,600
football. And then Saturday I
watched the college football.

235
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,920
It's fucking brilliant.

236
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,280
I can't believe how many years I had a
fucking DV before I figured out to do

237
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,470
that.
It's perfect.

238
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,700
So this is what I watched this week.

239
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,210
I watched the jets versus the lions

240
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,550
and I taped the packers versus the bears.
And then I,

241
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,770
and I, I know what you
thinking, Bill, why the fuck?

242
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,450
Why didn't you just take the fucking
jets game and actually watched the bears

243
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:38,050
packers, one of the oldest rivalries
and the national football league.

244
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,810
Why didn't you do that?
And it's because you know,

245
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:45,250
patriots in the AFC east and I just wanted
to see how we would match up against

246
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,830
the jets. I've watched them two weeks
in a row. I think we're going to have,

247
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,950
we're gonna have trouble
with them because a, I don't,

248
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,310
we had trouble with the Raiders.

249
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,360
We lost to the dolphins.
We had trouble with the Raiders.

250
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:03,020
The dolphins pounded the fucking Raiders
nine. Oh, this is just all horse shit.

251
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,260
It's just the first month of the season.

252
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,060
But it definitely, uh, I dunno,

253
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm not feeling too confident
about the fucking team and um,

254
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,350
I dunno. Rex Ryan is one
in three now, one in three.

255
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,700
And uh,
I dunno,

256
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,670
I was talking to Versie versus picking
the eagles and the colts to be in the

257
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:33,320
Superbowl this year. And uh, I
have no idea. Everybody just Kinda,

258
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,290
Seattle blew me away the first week.

259
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,050
So did the 40 niners and now
both of them are looking kind of,

260
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,210
I'm not saying they're bad, but
they don't look unbeatable. And, um,

261
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,720
I dunno. 40 niners are fucking
terrible today as did the,

262
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:55,290
uh, one a fuck Jesus Christ to
watch somebody fucking games.

263
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,420
Who the hell would they play it?
They beat the eagles.

264
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,720
The Eagles look terrible today.
Fucking Terrell was like,

265
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:03,420
nobody wanted to win the game.
I like these are two of the elite teams

266
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,120
in, in, in the fucking league. I mean,

267
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,900
how many times the 49 is taking
all those penalties. Kaepernick.

268
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,300
Okay.

269
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,490
They've got a giant clock.
You see the play clock.

270
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:17,460
The fucking guy lets it run down like two,
three times during the game.

271
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,740
I don't know. I don't fuck ain't no
something. The Eagles are the eagles.

272
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,060
I don't believe in that. And I don't
believe in that quarterback. I just don't,

273
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,840
he just doesn't seem like a a, you know
what if he goes down, who do you got?

274
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:34,620
You got Mark Sanchez.
Alright.

275
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,290
Who used to be a jet.

276
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,230
So he's got that curse on him and
then he went to the fucking eagles.

277
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,240
Who did fucking Mark Sanchez

278
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,860
piss off that he goes to the two fucking
most curse God damn teams in the NFL.

279
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,540
Bolton Green. Lots of good thing. He
went from the jets to the fucking,

280
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,810
uh,
he goes,

281
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,420
I guess the only good thing about that
trade is he didn't have to buy some new

282
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,254
boxes.

283
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,800
I know, I know. I'm talking a lot of
shit this week and as you can tell,

284
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:12,660
I don't know any of the players' names.

285
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,360
Anytime I watched the jets all I watch
the Brecker Sha fucking Ferguson,

286
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,710
that's all the only guy I watched.

287
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,520
I just watched a man handle somebody
on the outside of the line there.

288
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,840
And other than that, I'm just, I dunno,

289
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,010
I always get a little bored with football
by the end of September because I just

290
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:36,830
absolutely fucking Oh d on it.
And uh, but then what the cure is,

291
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:40,520
is now they're going to dress him
up like a bunch of new, you know,

292
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,730
newborn baby girls for
the next month and um,

293
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,850
you know, which of course is going to
just fucking annoy the shit out of me.

294
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,990
Okay.

295
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,823
I,
you know,

296
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,130
this infiltration of the NFL with
all of this shit I'm telling you Vic,

297
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,620
they're Gunna did just gradually,

298
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,920
women are gradually going to take
over the NFL. This is my prediction.

299
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,460
We're Paul Versey predict
Superbowl winners.

300
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,530
I like to predict random shit.

301
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:15,531
Like my prediction DePaul is that Rex
Ryan is going to have an altercation with

302
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,590
a fan this year. I don't think
physical, I think he's going to eat,

303
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,330
he's going to have a fuck you.

304
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:26,160
Fuck you fight that is going to be caught
on camera either as he walks out of a

305
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:26,994
stadium,

306
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,120
his or somebody else's or it's going to
be outside like a Hooters or a waffle

307
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,780
house. All depends. Um,

308
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,690
okay.

309
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,650
Till one and three,

310
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,370
you know the heat's getting turned
up and he is uh, that guy's wired,

311
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,690
he's got a short fuse. Okay. And I can
relate to that. So I know he, he's,

312
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:52,830
people are gonna start saying shit to
him and he is going to fucking snap

313
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,970
because that's the way he's wired and
I don't wish it on the guy, but uh,

314
00:18:56,971 --> 00:19:00,810
whatever he says is going to be fucking
great and probably put on a t shirt.

315
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,420
I don't know if that's going to happen,
but I'm predicting that that's one of my,

316
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,640
that's my first prediction for this year.
If you just want,

317
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:07,200
who's going to fucking,
you know,

318
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,340
lead the league in rushing you go
listen to the verse effect. All right,

319
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:14,760
if you want to hear the fucking,
I dunno.

320
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,770
Flying saucer Illuminati Shit.
You listen to this one. All right.

321
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,320
And if something comes in,
I'll say I got lucky.

322
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,650
That's the difference
right now between me,

323
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,700
a Goddamn gentlemen and that fucking
animal from New Jersey, Paul Versey.

324
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,290
Now listen to the verse,
the effect. He actually,

325
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:38,040
he's pretty good at picking a Superbowl
guy. Super Bowl guy. Superbowl team.

326
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,790
All right, so here we go. I
guess my first prediction,

327
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,190
Rex Ryan is going to have an
altercation with the fan, uh,

328
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,070
that is going to get him find or at
the very least put on TMZ. Alright,

329
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,440
number two, my next prediction is over
the next 10 years, women will infiltrate,

330
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,540
infiltrate the NFL to the point that,
um,

331
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,010
okay,

332
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,450
they,
they're going to fucking ruin it.

333
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:04,940
Okay.

334
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,780
They're going to ruin it.

335
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,380
I don't understand why they
have to be a part of it.

336
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,290
Is this sexist? I don't
understand. I don't get it.

337
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,260
It's a men's football league.

338
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Can we just have one thing
that gradually creeping in.

339
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:26,480
They got the whole month of October.

340
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:27,910
Okay.

341
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,540
With the fucking, uh, with the
pink stuff. They got that and now,

342
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,900
now they got the lace.
They got him down on the sidelines.

343
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,840
They got to go down to him every
fucking 10 minutes. Check in on them.

344
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,440
What do you think they ethical well,
he,

345
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,160
they saying it's a high ankle
sprain and he's wincing in pain.

346
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,260
He cannot put any weight on it.

347
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,090
That's all I got down his side lie.

348
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,940
We're already watch Felicia will job.

349
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,800
Um, and then eventually
they're going to be like,

350
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,230
who work here?
We be in the booth.

351
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,300
Then they'll be in the booth.

352
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,070
Why can't there be an all
female comic take team?

353
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,190
Then there'll be two of them and
then it's done. The escape is gone.

354
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,130
The escape is gone.
What,

355
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,920
what do you know what a
healthy relationship is? Is,

356
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,630
is you got to have time away from
each other. See, you miss each other.

357
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,310
Okay?

358
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,500
You got to fuck off the ladies.
They got date lane.

359
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,600
Women have to be able to take off.

360
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Go have a fucking glass of wine with
all their girlfriends and then just talk

361
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:42,270
about how lousy and bed you are.
They need that.

362
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,920
So then they can come back
and just fucking deal with
you for the next six days.

363
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,010
They have to have that and an and and
that, you know, guys are no different.

364
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,060
Why don't women start
their own football league?

365
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,560
Okay.

366
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,850
What, why are they, why are they
going to get so much shit for this?

367
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,200
Why not? Why do they keep
fucking bellying up to our bar?

368
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,850
You know,
fuck it.

369
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,783
Beat it.

370
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,850
Look, you know, I'm fucking half
joking here. I'm only half joking. Um,

371
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,170
do you know how bad I would love to
somehow get in a room full of feminist

372
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,680
without them knowing that I was a stand
up comedy and, and go on, go on a panel.

373
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,210
Yeah.

374
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,020
All right.

375
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,930
With like those black frame glasses
and just starts saying over the top

376
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,900
ridiculous shit like I just said.
Right.

377
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,380
And just, just see how mad
I could make them. Oh God.

378
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:46,650
Those are the things I fantasize about.
Like if I had the ability,

379
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,180
like one of those fucking who,

380
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:53,850
those fucking nerds that
nobody understands and
they can make fire and ice.

381
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,760
You know, they make the, they made
like 20 movies. Halle Berry's in it.

382
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,260
She has all white hair.
The fucking the mutants there.

383
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,430
Ooh. Ooh. It's a,

384
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,300
it's a fucking metaphor for
nerds and racism. I got it.

385
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:15,980
The first 18 of them. Jesus Christ.
Just get on with the karate.

386
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,260
What the fuck are they called?
Not The impossibles.

387
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,230
Oh my God.
I have no short term memory.

388
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,840
I keep thinking the fantastic four,

389
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,750
like for some reason I keep picturing
them all in blue. What are they called?

390
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,000
The expendables, the
impossibles, the mutants.

391
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,830
I, it'll come to me, whatever.
You know what I'm talking about.

392
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,500
And then the guy from star trek is one
of the guys and he's in a wheelchair.

393
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,440
Oh my God. What the fuck are
they called? Begins with an eye,

394
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,290
doesn't it? Invincible. Whatever. I
don't fucking know. I didn't even know.

395
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:02,060
My goddamn point was,
this is,

396
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:04,450
this is, this is why I'm a comedian.
There's like this destroyed.

397
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,770
Can you imagine if I actually
had a responsible job?

398
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,720
The fuck was I talking about? I was
talking about women pissing them off.

399
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,401
Oh.

400
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:17,340
Then I said black framed glasses and then
that made me thinking of that fucking

401
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:19,980
rex reed guy who's actually
a critic on the gong show.

402
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Okay.

403
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,970
He's not the fantastic four guy, but his
last name, his name was reed, wasn't it?

404
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,730
I don't fucking know.
Speaking a reads,

405
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,450
I went to Griffith Park the other day.

406
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,330
Every once in a while I'll drive
all the way over there. And uh,

407
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,860
there was this Asian couple

408
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,070
and one had a clarinet and
another one had a saxophone.

409
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,470
Okay.

410
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,470
And the woman with the clarinet was
killing it and she was standing about 20

411
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:53,450
feet away from her husband
who was blowing fucking claps.

412
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,620
All right.
Fucking clamps.

413
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,223
And uh,

414
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,430
it was fucking hilarious to me because
I don't know if he was just out of

415
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,390
practice or whatever,

416
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:09,630
but it just cracked me up that she was
walking away from him because she was

417
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:10,710
playing so nicely.

418
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:14,460
I can only imagine how like the
fact that she's actually a musician,

419
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
how bad his playing must have sound
to her pitch perfect fucking ears.

420
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,080
But she loved the guy. This is
the, I'm just assuming all this,

421
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:28,290
but she loves the guy so she
fucking tolerates it, but she,

422
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,520
she just steps away a little bit,
you know?

423
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,230
Fuck you. I know. None of that
makes sense, but you know what?

424
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:42,170
You play a clarinet with a
read. Okay? I don't know.

425
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,130
Saxophone and he got a mouthpiece. Okay.
All I know is after you play a while,

426
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:50,000
you've got to blow out the
spit. All right, let me, uh,

427
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,750
let me do a little advertising here.

428
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,690
Okay?

429
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,280
Why don't you have a woman Ruthie
advertising while you put on a pink shirt.

430
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,740
All right. Draft kings, everybody.

431
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:05,741
Fantasy football is back and draft
kings.com is not messing around.

432
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:10,520
Draft kings.com is America's favorite
one week fantasy football site.

433
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:11,790

What the Hell is DSC? Oh,
dollar shave club. Jason's,

456
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:45,270
do they think they're that big or
that I'm that smart. All right.

457
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,150
Dollar Shave Club.
Everybody.

458
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,620
Is there anything worse
than buying razors? Yeah,

459
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,730
getting caned in Singapore.
Um,

460
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,380
you got to remember that you
need them in the first place.

461
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,720
You got to sit in traffic
to go to the store.

462
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,320
You got to find that lock plastic
fortress that they keep them in.

463
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,510
Then find the one guy with the key and
he's in the back texting his girlfriend.

464
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,810
After all that,
it's going to set you back like 25 bucks.

465
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,790
Who needs that African aggravation?

466
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,510
Wouldn't it be great if you never
had to do it again? Well you can.

467
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:19,440
You can live that life.

468
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,650

481
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,910
Look at me.
I've created an empire with this show.

482
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,580
Why are they putting
these words in my mouth?

483
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,230
Okay,

484
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,560
you know what?

485
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,870
Cause this is the copy that they actually
give to really successful podcast.

486
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,300
Look at me. I lay on my bed and
my boxes and talk to myself.

487
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,240
Um, anyways, but when it comes
to handling business calls,

488
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,830
you're stuck with the challenge.

489
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,850
Either hire a full time receptionist
or handle all of your calls yourself.

490
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,510
It's a lose lose.
That's why people love he voice.

491
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,070
It will set your business up with,

492
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,730
they will set your business up with
a toll free number or a local number.

493
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,900
When customers call,

494
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,620
they're greed professionally by a virtual
receptionist that will route you to

495
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,760
all of your, all your calls
to wherever you are. Uh,

496
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,690
there's even a dial by name directory.

497
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:02,630
You're going to sound like a fortune
500 company. And more importantly,

498
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,350
you'll never miss an important call.
All for what? Only 13 bucks a month.

a minute. Uh, I was doing great there.

508
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,360
All right, let's get back to what
the hell I wanted to talk about. Um,

509
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,860
how far into the song in
30 minutes. 30 minutes. So,

510
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:53,390
uh, what did I do this week? Nothing.
I just did more writing, more writing,

511
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:56,390
more writing, more writing.
And this weekend I have, um,

512
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,130
okay,

513
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,270
what do I got? I have a Davis
Symphony Hall, October 4th.

514
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:05,600
We added a second show.
How great is that?

515
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,570
I am excited and I'm,

516
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:08,930
yeah,

517
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,620
we're gonna well, I don't know. I'm
going to do stand up all this week.

518
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,160
I'm going to go to tighten up
everything that I want to tighten up.

519
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,640
And this is my first real gig in awhile.
And uh,

520
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,260
putting a little bit of
pressure on myself. Um,

521
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,030
San Francisco's a unbelievable
comedy town for whatever reason.

522
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,980
Who knows why they are a great
comedy town. You never know why,

523
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:32,870
why one town's going to
be better than the other,

524
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,660
but they are one of the best out there.
So I can't go up there and yeah, suck.

525
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,500
Because those Bergen stocked hippies,
no comedy there.

526
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,670
I always like going to San Francisco
because it's that weird sort of,

527
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,270
okay,

528
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,920
cross section of people,
right?

529
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:54,110
You got the hey man from fucking San
Francisco and then you got the absolute

530
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:57,540
animals coming in from fucking Oakland,
you know,

531
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,320
and then you put them all together. Yeah.
And alcohol. And it's, it's a fun show.

532
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,610
Everybody gets a chance.
Um,

533
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,620
I don't even know what I'm talking
about at this point. So anyways, yeah,

534
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:11,790
I didn't go back to Boston
and I stayed out here and, uh,

535
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,260
worked on this fucking thing. I'm trying
to get on, on the ground off the ground,

536
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:20,760
I should say. Uh, played a little
bit of drums. It's all look at,

537
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:24,540
tell you still fucking with that
double pedal. Still struggling along.

538
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,660
I'm going to stick. What the,
um, you know what? Fuck this.

539
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:30,300
Let's just get to the questions for
this weekend. Maybe this'll, this'll,

540
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,180
this'll spur something on here.
A gambling problem.

541
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,060
A dear Billy bets. I get an a. So
Billy Batts, I like it. I like it.

542
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,180
He has a gambling problem. I get
it. I have a gambling problem.

543
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,590
Not the kind you think.
I've always enjoyed a bet here and there,

544
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,000
but never made a life of it.

545
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,980
And the last few years I've developed
this anxious twitch. Oh, Gigi.

546
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,790
Um,

547
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:58,170
I think about what I would bet on and
worry about my hypothetical bet the entire

548
00:32:58,171 --> 00:32:59,250
game.
It's nuts.

549
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,690
So that I just place a small bet every
now and then to scratch this itch.

550
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,040
The thing is, I don't like gambling.
It's the thought that scares me.

551
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,013
What?

552
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,230
So the reverse might be like back in the
day when you're old man made you smoke

553
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,690
a pack to break the habit
thoughts. Oh, I see.

554
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,013
MMM,

555
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,360
no, I wouldn't gamble dude.
If you're already twitching
like Fred Flintstone, bad,

556
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:32,160
bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Anybody almost 50
and remembers that episode. Bad, bad, bad,

557
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:32,994
bad,
bad.

558
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,710
Fred Flinstone started gambling and he
had a fucking problem with gambling and

559
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,650
they didn't have gamblers anonymous yet
cause he made those episodes and like

560
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,920
the fucking early
sixties, I think. And um,

561
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,090
when Fred Fred started gets
spinning out of control, you know,

562
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,510
if anybody just said like, hey,
you want to put a bet on that?

563
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:55,840
He would just see his eyes
would start spinning and he'd
go bad, but bad, bad, bad,

564
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,850
bad, bad, like freaking
the fuck out. It was weird,

565
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:01,690
like he had this unbelievable gambling
problem for one episode and then it all

566
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:06,610
went away. It all fucking
went away. Um, and that's,

567
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,301
you know,
something.

568
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:10,900
I've given you guys more goddamn
history about the Fred Flintstone shelf.

569
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,380
You know, when you really think about it,
if you continue to listen to this, this,

570
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:20,040
this, if you go back, I should say, or if
you've been listening to it continuously,

571
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,030
I think that that's what I was trying
to say. I told you how it was based on,

572
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:26,130
I think they,
they ripped off the honeymooners.

573
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,490
Okay.

574
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,090
And then they had that one episode where
they will make it fun of the Beatles

575
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:35,770
and Elvis. Well, they were like,
bug music. I can't stand bug music.

576
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,490
And, uh, what ever happened
to that George or boy,

577
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,480
I think that was making fun of Elvis
because he had kind of fallen off and he

578
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,700
was from, he was from Mississippi. Um,

579
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,350
anyways, what am I, let's
get back to this guy here.

580
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,293
Uh,

581
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,870
dude, a few ours obviously if you already
have a nervous twitch about gambling,

582
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,640
why? Like that's like, hey, you know,

583
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,410
I fucking sit around and
fantasize about killing somebody.

584
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:06,560
Should I go out and just kill one person
just so I kind of get it out of my

585
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:09,440
system? No, I think you should. Uh,

586
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,790
okay.

587
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,350
I Dunno.
I don't know what to tell you.

588
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,230
That sounds like you need
some new age shit. You know,

589
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:20,710
you'd go get hypnotized or something.
Um, but I would not start gambling.

590
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,150
Gambling is just, it's fucking brutal. Um,

591
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,180
gamble. You know what it is
about gambling. I get it really?

592
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,113
Uh,

593
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,580
it takes his soul in a different way.

594
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,893
MMM.

595
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,080
Then say drugs and alcohol

596
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,610
do where they like physically,

597
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,500
you know, change your appearance and
all that type of stuff. You know,

598
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:44,820
you get the gym,
blossom knows,

599
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:47,330
or if he'd doing harder drugs
and stuff and get emaciated off,

600
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,710
you're doing fucking, you know, what, what
does that shit that they do out there?

601
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:51,780
And then crystal Meth,

602
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,433
you know,

603
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,370
you start looking like the petrified
version of yourself. Um, gambling.

604
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:02,340
There's just a, uh, I dunno,

605
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,100
I had a couple of friends that really
had an issue with that and there was just

606
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:10,101
a darkness that was just over them at
all times and you went into their place

607
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,830
where they lived and you just felt it.
You just felt the fucking,

608
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,480
uh,
yeah.

609
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:17,881
Yeah.

610
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:21,480
So do you consider yourself lucky that
you never do and if the worst you ever do

611
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,430
is not gamble and just
sit there twitching?

612
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,980
MMM.

613
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,730
You got off easy.
Believe me.

614
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,620
Um,
yeah,

615
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,150
let's leave it at that. All
right. Rex Ryan, I'm actually
looking it up right now.

616
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:35,984
Rex Ryan.

617
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,710
Okay.

618
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,290
I'm going to see if they're already
calling for his job in New York media.

619
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:44,340
You know, Rex Ryan, New York Post.

620
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,960
Let's see what we get. Let's see
what we get. He [inaudible] that, eh?

621
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,560
Oh God, nothing yet. I probably
looked up the wrong thing.

622
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:58,580
I'm the fucking worst when it comes
to this shit. New York Post Sports.

623
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,350
Here we go. Hey, you guys like Derek
Jeter. We'll go into a broadcasting.

624
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,910
I don't think he's going to,

625
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:08,330
I think he's going to fucking
fade away in a cool way.

626
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:13,670
Like a Oh shit. Struggling. Gino screams.

627
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:18,040
Fuck you at a fan.
After jets fall to the lions fucked.

628
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:22,880
I had the wrong guy,
dude.

629
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:27,881
I almost called it g to puts
fitting kappa on brilliant career.

630
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,830
Ready or not? Here comes a Rod.
Oh my favorite Yankee of all time.

631
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,590
Oh my God.

632
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,120
Greatest thing that ever happened was
Alex Rodriguez going to the fucking

633
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,140
Yankees. Let's see if
they got anything. Jets.

634
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,530
Okay.

635
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,460
Um, gang file. It must be bleeping.

636
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:52,690
Act Together.
Report card jets having deep problems.

637
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,410
Oh,
red sox learned from Mariano fiasco.

638
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:05,120
Give Jeter a proper tribute. Oh, did
we not give them the right sendoff?

639
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,840
I'll go, what the fuck? It's
fucking, give me a break.

640
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,640
Okay.

641
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,740
We're supposed to give
all of them is send off.

642
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,100
Are you guys going to give big PAPI?
You're fucking big time. Send off.

643
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,490
Okay.

644
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,080
Jesus Christ. Fucking wine
in New York. Media budget.

645
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,090
Goddamn broads. All right,
let's get back. Yeah. You know,

646
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,690
you learn Shakti with that bad fucking
Tupperware party that you through

647
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:34,690
Marianna Rivera. Well, you know what?

648
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,290
Thanks to Marianna Rivera,
we fucking blow in that Goddamn Gay.

649
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,160
We had the greatest comeback and fucking
baseball history down three games to

650
00:38:43,161 --> 00:38:45,660
none.
All right.

651
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,750
We gave him his tribute the next year
when we were getting our rings when we

652
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:49,950
gave him that big ovation.

653
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,430
Yeah.

654
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,660
Oh God.
You know something.

655
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:56,200
That's one thing I don't miss about
living in New York is that petty shit.

656
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,830
They always think that like Boston
has issues with New York, you know,

657
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:02,260
which we definitely do,
but they got issues with us.

658
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:04,180
So fucking that this kind of even there.

659
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,220
Okay.

660
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,960
Like when we finally won a world series,

661
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:11,961
those policies actually made a t shirt
that said 26 to six like we have 26

662
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:17,070
championships to your six. That's
how fucking childish they were. Okay.

663
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,180
I have to fucking 86 years
of rubbing our faces in it.

664
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:23,750
They were going to have one rough winter,
right.

665
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,130
Couldn't take it head immediately.
Whoa.

666
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,120
Oh, was that a disgraceful moment? And
you're fucking history. Um, all right.

667
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,530
Syria,
dear general bill need your thoughts.

668
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,420
Is Isis horseshit?

669
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,290
I mean we know we gave them
weapons but they're still,

670
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:48,040
but there's still had to had a need.

671
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,590
Jesus price guys,
I can't read and then you,

672
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:53,540
you fucking leave out
words in the sentence.

673
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,020
I mean we know we gave them weapons but
they are still had need to be stopped.

674
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,800
People please try to proof read this
shit but we're not good at stopping

675
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:10,140
anything in that region. You're president
and in command, what does the move?

676
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,660
Yeah,
the mood is we pull out,

677
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,693
okay

678
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,960
very slowly. This is what
we do. This is what we do.

679
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,160
The only reason why any of those cons
have any fucking money is because nations

680
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:27,250
like us,
it's still driving gas combustion engines.

681
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,290
So this is what I would do.

682
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,890
I would try to jumpstart
more a car companies over
here like the Tesla company,

683
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,350
try to get GM and all those other folks
to do the same thing and then we just

684
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:45,850
don't need them anymore and wean ourselves
off of oil and then they would just

685
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:48,160
slowly go bankrupt.
The entire Middle East,

686
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:53,460
their entire fucking economy is far is
my complete lack of research goes this

687
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:59,140
based on the fact that they're
sitting on top of oil. So if we just,

688
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,470
if we don't need it anymore,
what are they going to do?

689
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,720
And then they are free to solve
their problems, their selves,

690
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,100
which they should be doing.

691
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,093
MMM.

692
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,030
And as far as you saying, we're not good
at stopping anything in that region. Uh,

693
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:17,410
there's a reason for that.

694
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,590
There's a reason why Russia goes into
Afghanistan and Lou and loses as a reason

695
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:27,280
why people go into that illusion,
why we went to Vietnam and lost.

696
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,600
The only way in occupation works,
and this is brutally honest,

697
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:36,080
is if you go in there an a,
you're, you, you're not leaving.

698
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,180
Okay. And B, you commit genocide.
That's the only way it fucking works.

699
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,370
That's the only way it
has ever fucking worked.

700
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,320
And it is 100% the wrong thing to
fucking do. You can't do that. So,

701
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,000
uh, so that's it. You know,
so it's just inevitable.

702
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:57,930
They know eventually you're going
home. So all they do is go, all right,

703
00:41:57,931 --> 00:41:59,100
you beat us,
you beat us.

704
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:02,100
And then you walk around standing over
there and they just sit there picking you

705
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:05,430
off, making your life fucking miserable.
And then eventually you're like,

706
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:08,010
what the fuck are we doing? Hey, let's
get outta here. And then you leave.

707
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,200
And then they go back to doing whatever,

708
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,880
whatever it is that
they were doing anyways.

709
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:14,220
But I don't think that we're going
to solve anything over there.

710
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:18,090
And I base that on checklists
of Aki and Yugoslavia.

711
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,040
I didn't know have any idea
about any of that shit.

712
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,620
Serbs and fucking Croatians
and all of the, I had,

713
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,560
I still don't quite understand it.

714
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,700
That shit was not going
on when I was born.

715
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,940
There was already checklist Slovakia and
there was Yugoslavia and all that type

716
00:42:35,941 --> 00:42:38,460
of shit going on over there.
And uh,

717
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,440
they all had a common enemy enemy in the,

718
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,420
with the occupation of the Russians in
their country. So they were against them.

719
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,630
And when a Russia fell,

720
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,850
whatever the fuck that
was like 20 years ago,

721
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,240
all of a sudden they got their freedom
and they immediately picked up this fight

722
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,080
for that. It stopped like,
I don't know, 60, 70,

723
00:42:58,081 --> 00:43:01,740
8,100 fucking years earlier,
and they started killing each other again.

724
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:06,690
Uh, you know, so I mean,
you're not going to,

725
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,933
it's over.

726
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,710
You'd have a better chance at getting
Ohio state and the University of Michigan

727
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:17,970
to like each other. Then you will have
an all those groups over there get along.

728
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,090
They're not going to get along.
And um,

729
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,180
that's just the way it is. So that's
what I would do. I would just fucking,

730
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,340
I would do a bunch of shit that would
get me whacked way before I would ever

731
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,790
achieve it. That's what
I would do. You know?

732
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,580
It's basically, it wasn't
that funny. Jesus Christ.

733
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:45,190
This is becoming too serious
here. All right, look, maybe
the, maybe this is a, a, a,

734
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,840
they maybe this is a nicer
one. Commission. Dear Bill,

735
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,990
you're the commissioner of the
NFL. A fuck. Here we go again.

736
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:55,950
What are the top three things you're
doing to improve the league? This,

737
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,660
this can include anything from scheduling
to punishments to campaigning to

738
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:05,400
relocate a team. What would you do? Oh,

739
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:08,070
Jesus Christ.
I don't want this fucking job.

740
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,020
One of the top that he thinks I
would do to improve the league. Um,

741
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,030
I'd get Tony Serra Coosa fucking chair.

742
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,580
Did he give enough?

743
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,990
This guy's got a fucking stand up the
whole God damn game with his back to those

744
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:28,880
animals in the end zone.
That's what I would do.

745
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:33,070
I would give them a nice fucking
end zone seat and a water cannon.

746
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,620
Good. Sprayed all the animals behind
them. That's the first thing I would do.

747
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,750
Next thing I would do is I would move
the kickoffs back to where they used to

748
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:47,010
kick off or I would just eliminate
that useless exercise to begin with.

749
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,630
Yeah.

750
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,880
And uh,
number three,

751
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:53,940
I would call somebody in the MLB
and I'd get rid of the DH role.

752
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,923
That's what I would do.

753
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,540
Those are the three things that I
would do to make football better.

754
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,860
This is what I was doing. I
would, I would, I would, I guess.

755
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,553
Okay.

756
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,750
I would, I would change, um, most of them,

757
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:14,080
the new rules and passing, I would
change it back. I would, uh, I liked the,

758
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:17,980
no helmet to helmet.
I really liked that rule.

759
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,840
I saw a guy diving for a ball and it was
passed as outstretched fingers and he

760
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:24,880
couldn't catch it.
And this guy back in the day,

761
00:45:24,881 --> 00:45:28,100
it would have been helmet to helmet
would have coming in perpendicular with a

762
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,480
knock this guy out and probably
hurt himself in the process too,

763
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:36,310
a little bit down the road. 30 years
later when he was done right. Um,

764
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,820
and the guy led with his shoulder
hit the guy in his chest,

765
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,590
definitely fucking brutal hit,

766
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,400
but they both got up and we're fine and
they didn't fucking rattled their brains

767
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:48,070
too bad. You know, I'm sure
the brain's still moves around,

768
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:52,800
but I do like that rule. But, um, I dunno.

769
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,680
I Dunno what the fuck I would do. I don't
fucking know. I get Tony Serra Goose,

770
00:45:57,681 --> 00:46:01,140
they're fucking chair. And then I would
step down and just say, my work is done.

771
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,770
Would that be okay? I wouldn't, you
know what I would do? I would eliminate,

772
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,610
um, the expression, uh, get it right.

773
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,280
I would eliminate that because it makes
everybody sounds stupid. You know,

774
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:18,700
we've got to Gary, why we
didn't get it right. Good job.

775
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,900
We're going to get it right.
Get it right.

776
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,320
Okay.

777
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,000
Jesus fucking Christ.

778
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,040
Maybe that's like fucking like cavemen
could come up with a better soul.

779
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,340
Rah Rah,
go rogue.

780
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,670
Just fucking not saying anything that
drives me. I fucking hate that expression.

781
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,610
Get it right. All right, let's move
on to the next one. Jesus Christ.

782
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:49,900
This is just scatterbrained this week.
All right? Can't get laid a bill.

783
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:53,200
I'm a huge fan. I listen to
all your podcasts and stand up.

784
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,090
Now that I'm done sucking your Dick.

785
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,510
I love what you guys just can't give me
a fucking compliment and then you feel

786
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,050
all uncomfortable because you
actually enjoy the comp though.

787
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,160
The fucking podcast. Just be a man and
give me a God damn compliment. You know,

788
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,740
suck. You are uncomfortable. I'm not
uncomfortable. I enjoy the praise.

789
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,280
He says I need some advice.

790
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:15,590
So I'm starting my Sophomore
Year of college and I've
never been more depressed.

791
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,610
My high school girlfriend broke up
with me shortly after graduation and I

792
00:47:19,611 --> 00:47:23,780
haven't gotten laid sense. Uh, it's
not like I stay in my room all day.

793
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:26,240
I have friends and I go to
parties at least once a week.

794
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,790
And even though I never enjoy it,
even though I never enjoy,

795
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,720
I just can't get a girl
to be interested in me.

796
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,570
I also have no idea what I
want to do after college.

797
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:36,850
And so I have no
motivation to apply myself.

798
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,570
The only reason I haven't dropped out
is because my parents who are paying

799
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:43,480
thousands and thousands of
dollars, uh, I don't drop out,

800
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:46,810
so they won't be disappointed. I work
out every day and I try to stay busy,

801
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:48,670
but most of the time I just feel terrible.

802
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,090
I'm hoping you have some advice for me.
If not, go fuck yourself. And if you do,

803
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:54,800
thanks and go fuck
yourself. All right. Um,

804
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,370
well you obviously you
have a sense of humor. Um,

805
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,850
what would my advice
be? Ah, you know what?

806
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,000
I think you're trying too hard.
All right.

807
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:10,790
There's no reason to go to a
party and not have a good time,

808
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,010
okay?

809
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,950
Just go there and enjoy yourself.
Don't worry about talking to women.

810
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:17,680
Don't worry about trying to get laid.
Just have a good time.

811
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,890
Just enjoy yourself. Just go out in
life and just fucking enjoy yourself,

812
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,030
okay?

813
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,830
People are attractive to positive
energy and somebody having a good time,

814
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,710
it makes them want to be around you.
And next thing you know,

815
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,780
somebody's blowing you. I don't understand
why the universe works that way,

816
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:42,100
but it does. I know I am overly
simplifying this, but um,

817
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,880
you know, it's good that you
know that you're depressed.

818
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,770
I was depressed for about 20 years.

819
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:50,110
It didn't realize it cause I
was so used to feeling that way.

820
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:54,390
I thought it was just the normal,
you know,

821
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:58,890
just a normal state of things.
Um, I got to tell you this dude,

822
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,310
you are going to get a girlfriend and
you're going to find love and you're going

823
00:49:02,311 --> 00:49:04,110
to get married.
Okay?

824
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,620
But I gotta tell you there's a fucking
misery that comes to that life.

825
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,550
All right?
This is a great thing,

826
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:14,930
but there's also a misery and she feels
it fucking too, and that's a part of you.

827
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,380
You're the individual, you
dies. So right now, dude,

828
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,270
you are the 40 year old you,
it's going to look back at the fuck.

829
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:28,130
If the 40 year old you could get in a
time machine and sit down with you right

830
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:32,600
now and give you a fucking pregame
speech before you went to that party.

831
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,430
I mean that would be like scared straight.
He'd be right in your face.

832
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,230
Yeah.

833
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,640
You know you're out there.

834
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,400
Yeah.

835
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,820
Well if I have to get up at five in the
morning to change his shit it diaper,

836
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,640
you get to sleep 10 hours a fucking day.

837
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,680
You can't put a smile on your face
when you go to a fucking party single.

838
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,640
You could fuck anything that walks.

839
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,620
Okay.

840
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,240
You go down to that seven Elana luck.

841
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:02,320
I bet you go down to that seven 11 you
get yourself a box of fucking condoms.

842
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,020
You stick on.
Will you stick one in your pocket?

843
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,903
Yeah.

844
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,700
Prepare for success.

845
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,620
You are on your goddamn shirt. You get
down there. You have a good fucking time.

846
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:19,300
All right? You're only going to be this
age once you say something like that.

847
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,570
All right?
I'm telling you,

848
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,810
you're only going to be used age
once you're in college, dude,

849
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,470
you are at like your,
it's like you won the NBA draft lottery.

850
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,310
Women there are in the
prime of their fucking life.

851
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,320
Most of them are fucking single.
It's gonna happen for you.

852
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,010
But if you're walking around and you're
depressed and you're carrying that with

853
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:46,430
you, if you're moping around like that,
that makes people fucking, you know,

854
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,590
not want to be around you.

855
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,310
So I would say is probably not a good
thing because that is a depressant.

856
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,980
So scratch that. I can't remember
if I fucking told you to, to,

857
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,680
to have a couple of beers.
I wouldn't do that.

858
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,850
I would just fucking enjoy yourself.
I almost, you know what I would do?

859
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:06,200
I would go do some shit for you. Fuck.
Trying to get a girlfriend. Fuck.

860
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,940
Trying to get laid.
Fuck all of that.

861
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:11,240
Just go out and what do you want to do
if you don't know what you want to do,

862
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,700
go out and go try a bunch of
different things and have a good time.

863
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,720
[inaudible] g a single.

864
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:16,490
Okay.

865
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:21,190
Okay. You don't have to fucking do,
you don't have to fucking deal with

866
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,860
trying to figure out what's
gonna make them happy. Okay.

867
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:29,810
Cause as far as I can fucking tell,

868
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,220
there isn't anything that's
gonna make them happy for

869
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,030
a longer than maybe a day.

870
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,300
The amount of shit that you can
do for them. And as you can tell,

871
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,890
she's a couple of rooms away.

872
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,870
The amount of shit that you can fucking
do for him and all it does is by a

873
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,880
couple of days of happiness
is just fucking baffling.

874
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:52,020
And I gotta be honest with you,

875
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,660
a lot of women look at it guys and
they think that we're fucking stupid.

876
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:01,880
And I think part of it is because
they have the way their brain works,

877
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,170
that multitasking, whatever it is.
That shit talk that they always say,

878
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:09,080
you know that women can
multitask and guys can't. Well,

879
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,720
I would say that generally speaking,
this is very general.

880
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:17,590
I think men have an advantage
when it comes to just being happy.

881
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,153
You know what I mean?

882
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,250
Like you wouldn't know it from my
podcast and the way I talk and shit,

883
00:52:24,251 --> 00:52:28,090
but I'm happy. I'm happy as hell and
I've been happy for a long fucking time.

884
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,700
You know? All I need dude outlets,
all I fucking need the NFL package.

885
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,080
I got a six a fucking millers in my,

886
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,600
in my God damn refrigerator.

887
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:47,540
You know, I got a new pair of sneakers
that just some stupid bullshit like that.

888
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,120
I order a fucking pizza.
That's all I need.

889
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,260
I'm happy the whole fucking day.
You know?

890
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:58,370
I go on a hike with my dog in the
morning. That's it. I'm good. Just simple,

891
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,950
simple,
stupid shit.

892
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,280
Keeps me as a guy entertained.

893
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,950
I don't have their high level brain
that they're always talking about near

894
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,600
ability. I can do a thousand fucking
thanks. Yeah. And he'll get you.

895
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,610
You're miserable.
You're fucking miserable.

896
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:14,990
Okay.

897
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,770
So telling you, dude, you're
actually, you don't realize it,

898
00:53:19,771 --> 00:53:24,771
but where you are right now do
is you are in an absolute utopia.

899
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,100
Do you know how many fucking guys right
now would kill to be in your position?

900
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,050
They'd even take two years and not getting
laid. Who gives a fuck? Rub One out.

901
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:35,850
Get on with your God Damn Day.

902
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,260
Okay?

903
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,920
You know, get on with your
fucking day of being single,

904
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,540
not having the answer to anybody and
having the option of hitting on any

905
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,850
beautiful woman that catches your eye.

906
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,740
Take a trip anytime you fucking want.
Go wherever you want to go.

907
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:53,910
Do whatever the fuck dude,

908
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:57,060
you're never going to get from your
parents are paying for your fucking

909
00:53:57,061 --> 00:54:00,000
education. Dude, you're
never going to be freer.

910
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,820
All right? So start looking at your
life that way. And I'm telling you,

911
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,330
you're going to have a different
fucking vibe. And I, um, I, I, you know,

912
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,210
I'll tell you right now,
you start doing that good days.

913
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:15,800
You're going to happen in the national
football league. No, I'm serious dude.

914
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,070
As something good is going to happen,

915
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,500
but there will be a time
in your fucking life.

916
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,390
I'm telling you where you will be married,

917
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,220
you'll have kids and you'll
do that whole fucking thing.

918
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:27,610
And that will be its own sort
of utopia. But it's, it's,

919
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,850
I don't do it.
This is a very beautiful,

920
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,730
selfish time in your life
that you should embrace.

921
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:34,990
Okay.

922
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,250
And you should not, uh, you should not
spend it feeling bad about yourself.

923
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,180
All right? So they go.
Good luck to Ya. Okay.

924
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,380
Relationship problems. All
right, Bill, first of all,

925
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:50,950
I would like to say thank you for all
the podcasts. Now go fuck yourself.

926
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:53,770
There you go. That's how it's
done. Beautiful. All right,

927
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:55,360
well I'm in my early twenties,

928
00:54:55,361 --> 00:54:59,260
soon to be the youngest
regional manager in my company.

929
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,110
So I kind of feel that I am
moving in the right direction.

930
00:55:02,111 --> 00:55:06,520
My biggest problem right now has
to be commitment, a relationship.

931
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:09,040
My girlfriend and I have been
together for about six months now.

932
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:13,780
So we are seeing how things work. Uh, it
was all, so we're seeing how things work,

933
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:18,220
right? Let's guys must have
spoken to his phone. Um,

934
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:22,390
well lately these things, uh,
things have not been too great. She,

935
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,310
she complains about everything.

936
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,960
If I'm not home or out with the boys
or the gym or if I don't respond to one

937
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:32,920
simple text, her jealousy is
really taking its toll on me.

938
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,440
Whenever she sleeps at night,

939
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:40,650
she'll talk for hours on how much she
hates work and just fuss about how I don't

940
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:44,470
do this or how, like how come I
do that? It's fucking annoying.

941
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,780
I have not cheated on
this woman nor I have.

942
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:51,640
I put myself in any type of
physical situation with her.
So why the burden? Well,

943
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:55,660
I hate to add more, but here it
is. My biggest issue with her,

944
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:00,160
it has to be here son. Yes. Her son,
he is turning four in a few months,

945
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:02,800
but it's such a pain.
I know he is a child.

946
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,410
Blahblahblah but this child
doesn't know how to talk,

947
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,530
use the restroom and thinks screaming
for everything and throwing a fit.

948
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:13,360
We'll get what he wants.
Is this her fault? Uh, yes.

949
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,570
This is what this guy says,
Bill. I am a father as well.

950
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:21,160
My soon to be five year old son is
annoyed by this kid to during your early

951
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,650
twenties and you've got a five year old
son, Jesus Christ. Um, whenever we go out,

952
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,680
her son tries to take all my son's toys
and then chooses what he wants to watch

953
00:56:32,131 --> 00:56:36,840
and what he wants and when he wants to
leave. I suppose my question to you is,

954
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:41,340
should I simply continue to help her
out be with her slash be with her?

955
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,990
She is the breadwinner for her family,

956
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:46,950
supporting her mother who just had
a baby and is unemployed. Dude,

957
00:56:46,951 --> 00:56:51,840
is this a Jerry Springer transcript
and two younger brothers plus her son?

958
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,780
Financially, she's in a hard place
so I help her out when I can.

959
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:55,800
I feel guilty leaving.

960
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,880
I'd feel guilty if I left or right now
since I know she's very attached to this

961
00:56:59,881 --> 00:57:03,960
relationship and it may affect her and
I wouldn't want everyone else to suffer.

962
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,160
Should I say fuck it.

963
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,270
It's not worth my unhappiness and my
son's discomfort towards her son or say,

964
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:10,081
just say fuck it.

965
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:14,220
Ride it out until her mom finds a job
or she trains that little animal of a

966
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:16,350
child. Right? All right,

967
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,670
here's the deal,
dude.

968
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,740
You fucking said something about three
quarters the way through it. First of all,

969
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:28,550
you know,
with all this stress she has in her life,

970
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,880
supporting all those other people,

971
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,870
probably has a lot of the reason
why she's fucking coming at you. Uh,

972
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:37,850
she's taken out of situation on you and
a little, a little way, I guess there,

973
00:57:37,851 --> 00:57:41,780
but you said, uh, where is it?

974
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,900
I feel guilty and assets. I know
she's very attached with it, blah.

975
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:47,600
Should I say fuck it.

976
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,220
It's not worth my unhappiness and my
son's discomfort. All right, dude.

977
00:57:52,221 --> 00:57:55,910
So you're unhappy in your
own son is not comfortable.

978
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,820
All right.
I think that says something right there.

979
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,910
That's what you need to fix right there.

980
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:06,480
You need to be happy and your son needs
to be comfortable or you have to leave

981
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,840
and it's not your fault,
you know, you know,

982
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,690
she lives with carnival people
from your description. All right?

983
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,640
Um, you got to be selfish in a fucking
relationship when you're single.

984
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,310
Okay. And you're, you're going to commit
to somebody before you commit with them.

985
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:27,550
You got to be selfish. You got to
be making sure, at the very least,

986
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,260
you being with them makes you happy. Ah,
that sounds like a fucking nightmare.

987
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,690
That situation right there.

988
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:38,500
Sounds way I waited until I was
45 to get fucking married. Um,

989
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,300
so I guess what I would say is if
you feel like you could somehow,

990
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,250
I mean not leaving,

991
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,400
not breaking up with somebody because
you feel like it's a bad time.

992
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,940
It's never a good fucking time.
I'm,

993
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,120
all she's doing is getting more and more
attached to you and all you're doing is

994
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:59,690
taking more and more days away from her
where she could be going out trying to

995
00:58:59,691 --> 00:59:03,710
find somebody else. So if, uh,
that is not a reason to stay.

996
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,640
So if you feel like you
could try and work it out,

997
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,860
you didn't mention once in any
of that, that you loved her. So,

998
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:16,670
um,
I dunno,

999
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,110
that sounds about it. As miserable
as situation as I can think of.

1000
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:22,350
Yeah.

1001
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,990
So, uh, you know, but at the
end of the day, [inaudible] day,

1002
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,360
it's going to be your decision,

1003
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,200
but that relationship is definitely
not firing on all cylinders.

1004
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,300
And if you're going to
stay with this team,

1005
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,830
you need to create a new culture
in the locker room. All right.

1006
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:41,820
Prosper lending. Little
advertising here, Prosper.

1007
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:43,220
Okay.

1008
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,340
All right. This is the next one. Yeah.

1009
00:59:44,341 --> 00:59:47,550
Have you ever tried walking into a bank
for a personal loan to pay off a high

1010
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:51,210
rate credit card? Do a home
improvement project, start a business,

1011
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,130
not the easiest thing to do.
Is it a host?

1012
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:58,710
Mentioned a time if you ever tried
to get a loan and how hard it was.

1013
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,240
Yes.

1014
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,700
Uh, no. I have great credit
and I don't overextend myself.

1015
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,390
What am I supposed to make
something up there? Uh,

1016

1054
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,020
Mercifully that is the end
of the ads for this week.

1055
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,060
Um,

1056
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,350
some people gave me shit for having
that bank thing there cause I don't like

1057
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:41,250
bankers. But, uh,

1058
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:45,060
the person who does my ads used to work
on that shit and said he checked the

1059
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,390
bank out and said that they
are above board. All right.

1060
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,900
If you find out that they are not, I
will stop reading those. All right.

1061
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:56,100
If you've got any research. All
right, here we go. Summertime is over.

1062
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:01,170
Bill. The circle of seasons
is cruel and beautiful.

1063
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,880
I missed the summer already,

1064
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,120
but I'll enjoy the fall and
the apple related feelings.

1065
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:11,010
I think I had a fulfilling summer.
How are you grading this summer?

1066
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:15,690
A plus because Billy got some
sun RF because bill got some sun.

1067
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,250
How am I grading the summer?
I don't fucking know.

1068
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,270
I survived it. Kind of a
fucking question. Is that,

1069
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:29,160
that's not even a question and
answer that question. Um, all right.

1070
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,810
That's it for this week. Everybody. Um,
I want to thank everybody for the, uh,

1071
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:37,940
all the ticket sales up
there in San Francisco. Um,

1072
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:41,490
I'm really looking forward,
you know, I need it, man.

1073
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,430
I haven't done a standup
road gig in a while and uh,

1074
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:47,790
I've been doing that for 22 years.
And you do the road as long as well,

1075
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,750
I really started traveling,
um,

1076
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,650
seriously doing the road rather than
just driving around doing a hell gigs

1077
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,760
outside of Boston. Uh, probably
been doing that for like 17 years,

1078
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,610
right? Yes, 17 years. So, um, you know,

1079
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,480
it's in my blood, man. I
got to do it. So the next,

1080
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,910
the next three dates I have coming up,
uh,

1081
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:16,350
Davis Davies kept saying David's
Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco,

1082
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:19,950
two shows this Saturday night,
October 4th.

1083
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:25,050
Then I'm doing this spotlight spotlight
casino in Coachella, California,

1084
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:26,160
October 11th.

1085
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,080
And then my next date is at West
Palm Beach Improv on November 14th,

1086
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,620
because I'm going to a couple
of football games out there,

1087
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,280
going to the Thursday night game
and then I'm going to go see, uh,

1088
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,290
the Miami University of
Miami against Florida state,

1089
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,400
which is hilarious because I'm going
to have to fucking listen to them doing

1090
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:51,690
that Tomahawk Chop Shit. Oh my God. Um,

1091
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,583
but anyways,

1092
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,190
so I don't have a lot of road dates
cause I've been trying to write this show

1093
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:59,730
and then also I'm trying to put together
the new hour before it hit the road.

1094
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,510
And,
um,

1095
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:05,190
so basically if you're wondering how the
next year is shaping up as I'm finally

1096
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,660
going to do that Australian tour,

1097
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,560
then I'm going to do some club dates at
some of my favorite standup clubs around

1098
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:13,620
the country and uh,
get that act ready to go.

1099
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:16,920
And then I'm going to do a
nice theater tour and, um,

1100
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,520
I am hoping to do another European tour.
And this time actually add,

1101
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,413
um,

1102
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,980
along with the all the countries I did
before I went to try to do an eastern

1103
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:32,440
European leg this time to like,
Lithuania, Estonia, Albania,

1104
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:37,420
all of that shit. Um, I'm going to try
to just see how that goes. Why not,

1105
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:41,110
right? Why the fuck not so,
um, I'm really looking for,

1106
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:44,650
I'm already looking forward to the
new year. October is coming up, right?

1107
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,510
I gotta get my pie crust game together.
Make my fucking Pumpkin bread,

1108
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:54,700
you know, all fucking
purpose flour a. Anyways,

1109
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,130
that's the podcast for this
week. Everybody, I apologize.

1110
01:05:57,131 --> 01:06:00,820
I know it was a little rocky this week,
but um, if I didn't do it right now,

1111
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:04,240
I wouldn't be able to do it in
the morning. So, uh, anyways,

1112
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:07,030
what are we going to do here? Uh, y'all
got knocked out. I didn't get right.

1113
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,400
Next week I'm going to try. You
go right? I have no one to blame,

1114
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:13,000
but myself and I take full responsibility.
That's a podcast for this week.

1115
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:16,690
Go fuck yourselves. And,
uh, remember my predictions.

1116
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:20,680
Women are going to ruin the NFL
ticket over within 10 years.

1117
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,270
And Rex Ryan is going to have a, is going
to have an altercation with the fan.

1118
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:29,110
They're already happened with Geno Smith.
All right, there we go. I'll see you.
