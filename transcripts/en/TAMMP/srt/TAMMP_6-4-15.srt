1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,560
Hey,
what's going on is Phil Berger and uh,

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,960
just checking it on you so I can't yell
too loud. Okay. Yell too loud. The street.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,890
I thought Monday the peas and everything
will pop it on this fucking thing.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,660
So I'm gonna try to hold
it a little further away.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,390
Maybe talk a little bit louder.
Um,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,130
welcome to the Thursday afternoon.
Monday morning podcast just before Friday,

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,220
Aka the just checking in
on podcast for June 4th,

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,630
2015. Ah, fuck. I'm
missing everything. Oh No.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,530
I miss game one of the Stanley Cup finals.

10
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:43,810
I literally just woke up about an
hour ago. I'm still fucking jetlagged.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,360
So, uh, I stay up and I drink as a cafe.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,020
Wait until like,
that's how I put myself to sleep.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,670
Like Nia is always going to take a
sleeping pill. Just take one of these.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
And I'm always like, I'm not taking
that thing. She goes, why? I go,

15
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,370
cause that's like a 10 day
bender to u of t your liver.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,940
Why don't I go down to the cafe and I'll
fucking drink like Ernest Hemingway,

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,330
you know, which is really just like, yeah,

18
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,060
it's only a one day bender to your liver.
Right.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,390
I guess if you drink like
Hemingway or John Bottom,

20
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:21,170
then it's considered maybe like a
three day bender. I don't know what,

21
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:26,000
but that's how I do it. That
is how I do it. Sorry. So, um,

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,340
okay.

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,710
Yeah. Well last night neo
was more tired than I was,

24
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:33,370
so she came back to La Plata Mount and um,

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,440
she was going to go to sleep.
So I was like,

26
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:38,380
why am I gonna fucking be
down here by myself, you know,

27
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,760
like some goddamned degenerate.
Um, so I came back here.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,713
Uh,

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,720
I don't know that I've been fucking up
every sense and I was not up ever since.

30
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,520
I stayed up to like three,
four in the morning,

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,070
ended up waking me up inadvertently.
And um,

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,490
okay.

33
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,940
So we started watching this,
this video of this trial,

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,760
I guess it already happened. This, this
woman who seem really, really nice.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,890
She met this guy who was some his parents
smoked crystal meth and he got himself

36
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,740
out of it, raised themselves,
became uh, uh, um,

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,070
okay.

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,060
Are Those Byu People
Mormon became a Mormon,

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,070
you know, was trying to abstain from
sex. He got himself a little side piece.

40
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,470
Basically she was just a side piece to
him and she loved him and then he ends up

41
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,650
dumping her and then she's still kinda
came back and hooked up with them every

42
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,350
once in awhile.
And uh,

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,030
okay.

44
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,811
And uh,

45
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:44,811
and then she realized that she was getting
the old heave Ho a keyword there is

46
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,170
how,

47
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,840
that's how she felt like she was being
treated and she came back one night and

48
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:55,620
she fucking killed him, stabbed him
up, shot him, and then stabbed him,

49
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,600
fucking slit his throat,
all this crazy shit.

50
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,480
And then came up with the worst fucking
story ever was that there was two people

51
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,810
that intruded
killed him,

52
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,910
put the gun to her head, pulled the
fucking trigger and the gun didn't go off.

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,970
And then she grabbed your person or your
keys and all that ran out of the house

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,960
as the, I guess the two of them are going
like, can you believe it didn't go off?

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,510
Wait a minute,
where did that woman goes?

56
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,210
So then she gets in the
car and fucking drove away,

57
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:26,080
stunned out into the middle of the
desert and didn't call anybody or tell

58
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,980
anybody anything and actually visited
other people and never said a fucking word

59
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,220
to anybody. And, uh, five days later,

60
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,330
the dude's friends came into the
apartment and found his body and uh,

61
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,150
and she got the, she got
the death penalty. Fucking
crazy story. Isn't that nice?

62
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:47,740
Is that uplifting for Thursday,
Thursday afternoon?

63
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,281
I got to tell you,

64
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,310
I was watching an interview and she
really seemed like a nice person.

65
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,130
She seemed like a sweetheart. And I
like to think that I got a good gauge,

66
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:01,750
but it was fucking a, I
dunno, it's disturbing.

67
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,320
I don't know. You know, it was even
more disturbing than that was yesterday.

68
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,470
I went out and I got a cheeseburger.
Right. Ah, they got this place,

69
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:13,000
has cheeseburger over here in Nia
is fucking hilarious. She goes, hey,

70
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,170
there's got the best burger in Paris
is supposed to be at this place.

71
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,290
And I'm like, fuck yeah, I
like cheeseburgers, let's go.

72
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,880
And it wasn't until after I've finished
the cheeseburger and said it was fucking

73
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:28,390
delicious that she told me that she
learned about the place by watching a

74
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,670
keeping up with the Kardashians and Chloe,

75
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,050
he said that that was her favorite
fucking place to get a burger. And I go,

76
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,120
why wouldn't you tell me that?
And she goes,

77
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,480
because if I fucking told you that you
wouldn't want it to eat here or are you

78
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,060
trying to come in? Uh, hang on a second.

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,330
The lovely mia. Everybody
posts show up. Punch. Your mom
was deaf. No, I say madame,

80
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,110
I sent him a dumb cause you're married,
right? Wait, wait. All right, come on

81
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,260
Kim. On Aqua. Chloe's the big one,

82
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:03,730
right as j law had says the power forward,
power forward of the Kardashians.

83
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:06,430
Lay down here cause I don't really mind.
I would say she's the tallest.

84
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,590
Maybe not the biggest since Kim is
pregnant. Congratulations Kimi cakes.

85
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,150
All right. You have, you will have
to leave. All right. So anyways,

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,100
so here's the thing. I did the most
disgusting thing I ever did in my life.

87
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,190
Like we are a side dish
or macaroni and cheese.

88
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,250
I took the macaroni and cheese and
I put it in the bottle of Greece.

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,540
It was ag on the, on the Burger
too. So there was bake. No,

90
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:39,250
but I'm saying the puddle was the Ang
yoke in the grease from the Burger and I

91
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,920
put macaroni and cheese in it.

92
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,440
It's the most disgusting
thing I've ever done.

93
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,420
But it was absolutely fucking delicious.

94
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,580
I you can't tell me I didn't block
at least one of my, uh, what is it?

95
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:55,480
Your aorta arteries, your
ventricle, the vulva.

96
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,260
I'm very [inaudible] was amazing.
I would go back

97
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,180
before the end of this
trip to be honest with you.

98
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:03,840
I was thinking about it this morning.
I'm off Saturday.

99
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,390
I'm just thinking of friends within
our bump. Paris highly recommended. Oh,

100
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,260
you have to text for a reservation,

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,320
which you won't be able to
figure out unless you're near,

102
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,790
cause I wouldn't have been
able to figure out what,

103
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,190
I'm sick of the French with their
little tables. Oh wait. Oh really? Why?

104
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:22,950
Oh,

105
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,950
because it just like if they got these
little fucking table table table every,

106
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,430
not everything is little here.

107
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,570
Well that's because it's a fucking
rip off. You know, it's like New York.

108
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,100
It was a super small apartments,

109
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,850
but I mean New York you can sit down
and have an adult size table at those

110
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:47,050
fucking doll house tables make,
God forbid you order some food,

111
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:51,930
you got to pick your drink up. Don't
let me see. It was almost all pleased.

112
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,260
Your moves the glass. Um, so anyways,

113
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:58,990
I'm glad you're here to taper
this part. Uh, so I was,

114
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,490
I was over here and Nia showed me
the cover of what magazine was that?

115
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,980
Vanity Fair. Vanity Fair was
talking about Caitlyn Jenner. Yeah,

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,350
the Dash Kardashians just blew it.

117
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,790
I was going to fucking build the whole
thing up cause I was looking at how do I

118
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,370
know, I'm like, how do I know that chick?

119
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,140
Is that somebody we know you're a woman?

120
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,890
And I was thinking she's not good enough.

121
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,970
She's not good looking enough to be
on the cover. Is she a publicist?

122
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,110
Is She some famous publicists? And
then it was Mick, Caitlyn Jenner.

123
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,180
Caitlin with us. See,
wow. I gotta tell you man,

124
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,620
that is the most relations Katelyn
cakes. I know. I got to tell you,

125
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:41,820
that is the most,
listen,

126
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:43,860
those was hardcore thing
I've ever seen played out.

127
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,650
Okay.

128
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,780
And like,
uh,

129
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,860
all that Marilyn Manson Shit and Alice
Cooper and Ozzie biting the head off a

130
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,580
bat. Nothing compares to
the what the fuck factor.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,430
And I'm not saying I'm to like, you
know, you're comparing like, like shock,

132
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,500
shock, shock rock tactics to someone
becoming transgendered. I really don't.

133
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,370
Somebody that you knew not, can you
let me, can you let me continue up?

134
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:12,400
They're ignorant thought. Sure.
No, you shouldn't say that.

135
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,120
This is the first time
I ever experienced this.

136
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,180
I had to be able to fucking say
what I'm thinking. You see his own,

137
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,700
his own daughters that go
in like so wait a minute,

138
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,080
you're going to be
borrowing my toenail Polish.

139
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,460
They got to get their head around it.

140
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,130
I'm allowed to get my head
around I so I bless him. Okay.

141
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,470
That's what he wanted to tilt chair.

142
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,390
Well he did it now he's now he's a shape.
Is He? But he still has his Dick, right?

143
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,670
Bell does he or she wants to be called
she, she wants to be called Kaylin.

144
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,690
Okay. I'm cool. I'm all right with
that. She has not had surgery.

145
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,800
No she has not.

146
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,170
Yeah

147
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,550
I think that's an issue if you chase.
So she has a penis and she,

148
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,130
she still is she at this point?
Correct. Cause those are,

149
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,810
the reality is is you don't
have to do any of that.

150
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:58,200
You can say I want to be called Chez
and people should just respect it pretty

151
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,980
much because it's the whole idea about
gender not necessarily being rooted in

152
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:06,330
physicality or sexuality. It being more
of a state of mind. So this is like,

153
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:10,290
so this is a big debate of course.
So this is like some Ornette Coleman Shit.

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
Who is that with your
body or their Coleman?

155
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:16,080
He was one of those guys who
played so free with jazz.

156
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,610
There was really no one and even like
Charlie Parker would walk off the band

157
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:23,610
stair going, I don't know what the fuck
these guys are playing. Okay. So right.

158
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,370
I think this is a groundbreaking thing
that he's the first and he will be like,

159
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:39,990
he's like the uh, I don't
know what though. Well,

160
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,900
I'm not going to wade into that
fucking sinkhole. God knows.

161
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:45,500
I'll say the wrong fucking thing first.

162
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,190
The chance gendered person on the
cover of Time magazine last year,

163
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,110
which was actually the first, no, no,

164
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,020
but I mean as far as Cox
from orange is the new black.

165
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,710
And what was her name before
that? Larry? I don't know.

166
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:02,850
And it doesn't fucking matter. I think
you should, you should keep your like,

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,500
like I, I would, I would be, I go
Trump bill. I would be Beth. Beth,

168
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,750
can we talk about that?

169
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,260
Decided to transition was you
really go bad, bad? No, I think,

170
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,650
I think I'd be Janet and
I would be such a cunt.

171
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,360
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

172
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,130
But you don't mean now as a
male I'm awarded for being
an asshole. You know, that,

173
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:32,810
that ridiculous feminist theory that
if a woman does it, she's a con.

174
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:35,790
But if a guy does a Doula,
you want to be president.

175
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,620
Moron's um, I feel like, man,

176
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:43,260
I did not hear the microphone
assholes when they're assholes,

177
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:48,261
but I don't think they're morons for
saying that men get to get to do what it

178
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,530
get to act, especially in
business. And the more, um,

179
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,080
let's say cut cutthroat like a mark Cuban.
Mark Cuban is a fucking deck,

180
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,980
but Mark Cuban is also brilliant
and a really successful businessman.

181
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,580
But I feel like more often than not,
he gets called brilliant and amazing.

182
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,660
Even think it's called a jackass.

183
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,640
All the tests all the time when he runs
out on the court and it does all that

184
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,990
stuff hit off the court. You Jackass
for always saying like, you know,

185
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:20,700
Mark Cuban is a business
genius and you know, no, yes,

186
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,240
but he is. He's undeniably is. But
he does, he doesn't get good reviews.

187
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:27,780
That guy gets trashed on the time in
order to answer is you guys have bad

188
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:31,830
experiences with men while you're dating
and they get to be dicks and bang you

189
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:35,040
and then leave and you never
quite are able to wash that off.

190
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,190
So I think that you guys then
look at us in a certain way.

191
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm able to separate my experiences from
dating Dick's to dealing with Dixon day

192
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:47,250
to day life. I am not so simple
minded and like one dimensional that

193
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,230
me one time and now they're all
deck like you fucking kidding me.

194
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,790
But there was a period in your life,

195
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:59,340
you can't tell me that you didn't get a
little petty. I did. I actually never did.

196
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,060
I did all those guys that dumped me.
No,

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,370
I did not necessarily have
the track record with men,

198
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:12,900
but I didn't write you all off because
of that. I still was looking for love.

199
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,880
So what I'm saying is as far as like the
most hardcore fucking thing I've ever

200
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:25,451
seen as far as just spinning in your head
around like Holy Shit is the fact that

201
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:28,850
Bruce Jenner, unlike that other woman,
why don't even know who the fuck that is.

202
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,210
Who's on Time magazine is that this
guy you're going to send my whole life.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,870
I've known this guy from like second
grade on, he wanted the catalog.

204
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,690
He was on the Wheaties box.
He was on chips.

205
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,420
He got a nose job and then he
disappeared and then he came back on the

206
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:50,810
Kardashians and he was walking
around in the background.

207
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,460
I remember law had had this great fucking
bit. Yes. It's been like, what the,

208
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,640
why are you sitting there getting bitch
said you got to fucking gold medal for

209
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:02,000
the catalog. They got you walking
around in the background. You know,

210
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,120
like you know,

211
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,600
I used to be walking around with that
medal around your neck or something.

212
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,890
Right to then,

213
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,570
I remember when when Tmz was chasing
around saying that he was having a sex sex

214
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,960
change, I was like, oh my God,
leave the guy alone. You know,

215
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,430
he doesn't like his face
and out and I dunno he's,

216
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,790
he's doing whatever the fuck he's doing
it and then it turned out they were

217
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,540
right and now when he comes out,
call me Caitlyn.

218
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,640
I mean this is the thing like,
because what, I don't know,

219
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,020
I said this is going to be a lot of people
that get in trouble as they're trying

220
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,020
to fucking process this
for the first time.

221
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,190
This is their first time experience and
I think you want to allow people to have

222
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,443
that,

223
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,750
that first dumb thing that comes out of
their mouth not understanding and being

224
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,620
like, what? But everybody's
going to jump on him and someone,

225
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,360
someone will lose their career to sit
down and watch this guy like you wanted to

226
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:56,520
be this guy,
you wanted to be Bruce Jenner.

227
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,160
I wanted my hair parted down the
middle and fed it to the side.

228
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,910
I wanted to be a motorcycle cop.
I wanted to do all of that shit.

229
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,830
And then all of a sudden I remember
reading articles about him,

230
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:09,420
like his fucking life, you
know, he's in between, you know,

231
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,800
girlfriends or whatever.
And uh,

232
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,020
they went to his house and
he had some Porsche target.

233
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,270
I still remember this in Sports Cilia,

234
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,950
porch target in the garage that he
walked by and he ran his fingers along.

235
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,420
He had a little bit of dust on
it. I'm like, this guy, he's so,

236
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:25,510
this shit that he just has
a leftover Porsche. I mean,

237
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,510
who was like a guy's guy that
then boom, go the other, that 180,

238
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:32,100
the other other fucking way.

239
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,140
I think people should be
allowed to be honest with it.

240
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,960
I just feel like the cruelty is, is what's
unnecessary. No, no, no. Not Cruelty.

241
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:43,410
But you want to be able to say like,
Bruce, what the, sorry, Kate lucked up.

242
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,860
Wow. Wait a minute. Leyla
and I sit down for a Sunday.

243
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,310
We're talking governments in one of
his sons from his other marriages,

244
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:57,020
like Brandon or something. And
she lifted up her dress. So,

245
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,880
uh, his other new boobs and he
goes, Whoa, I'm still your son.

246
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,320
Cause it's like, Whoa,
wait, just give me a second.

247
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,060
And then another one of his foot,
he was snow show his balls of course.

248
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,790
What you came from John?
Of course. No, of course.

249
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,510
It was definitely I that would
be very uh, uh, weird. No,

250
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:21,500
but that's always been my theory,
but, and the girls who get fake boobs,

251
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,950
we'll show them to you like they got
their nails done cause it's an insecurity

252
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:26,400
thing.
So it'd be like saying

253
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,330
I have two friends was amazing boob jobs.
I never would have known there.

254
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,810
So the Soca, you gotta he gotta pay
for it. You know what I'm saying?

255
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,120
He can't go out in there
and get discount plastic.

256
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,000
Danny's when you're getting a boob job,
like whatever,

257
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:44,570
the facial reconstruction that
Caitlin has had is a fucking amazing.

258
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,460
Now of course she's still is a handsome
woman, but like it really, it looks good.

259
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:53,630
And those, those, those times,
she's still a handsome woman.

260
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:57,170
Did you mean that she started
off as a handsome guy? No,

261
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,370
there were some women
that are like handsome.

262
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,530
This whole thing that I'm saying right
now, this whole thing that I just said,

263
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,940
what do you mean like that?

264
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,660
The assist the handsome guy or like the
woman right now, you know what this,

265
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:08,000
this is,

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
this whole fucking scenario is why I
never watched lost what is why I never

267
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,060
watched lost.
How did you come the dream state?

268
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,610
Is there a fucking monster down here?
What's going on?

269
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,190
And then now you're jumping
back and forth on either side.

270
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,050
It's like he's playing tennis
against himself right now.

271
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,610
It's kind of like your add
brain actually. Oh, is it?

272
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,910
It's kind of like bringing around, look,
I'm on vacation in front of a good size.

273
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,700
Um, but you know what else?
Um, uh, one of his kids,

274
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
her kids to see even I'm slipping
with the Pronoun. You homophobe,

275
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:49,280
transgendered, hater, what's
your career? We need to, and it,

276
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,860
uh, my career is lagging
around with you and France

277
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,610
on Twitter gave me shit.

278
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,770
Anybody who starts at tweet with the word,
maybe I'm done with,

279
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,810
maybe don't, blah, blah, blah. Oh No.

280
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:13,460
I was saying one of Caitlin's. Dot.
I son said I'm, I'm, I'm hoping,

281
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,420
I think or something like that. Katelyn
will be a better parent than Bruce was.

282
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,050
No, I mean he's been, I mean
she's been pretty open and add it.

283
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,040
And then if Katelyn Stone's
crying and be like, Kayla,

284
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:29,450
I wasn't talking to you
talking about no by, uh,

285
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,330
by all accounts, especially his, his first
set of kids, he wasn't there. They were,

286
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,200
Bruce wasn't there for them cause
he was a fucking man. And now that,

287
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,500
now that now that Bruce
has become Caitlyn,

288
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,820
you think feminine and
he won the gold medal,

289
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,650
Caitlin still has to prove
herself. She hasn't won shit. Yes,

290
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,790
she's won all of our
hearts. Um, all right,

291
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,470
well but you know something else then
there's also the then falling all over

292
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,950
yourself. There's, there's the
ignorant being mean about it.

293
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,950
Then also the going the other way
where you fall all over yourself and if

294
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:11,980
Caitlyn's being a cunt, you can't
call her. Cause she used to be Bruce,

295
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,990
which is bullshit.
Well,

296
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,430
I guess Bruce was an asshole because
Bruce really wanted to be Kaitlin and it

297
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:23,431
was struggling and was taking it out on
other people and was literally running

298
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,710
away. I think Katelyn, who's
going to be the biggest gossipy,

299
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,170
he's going to go to brunch and just talk
shit about everybody in her immediate

300
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:39,420
circle. I'm pretty excited to see
how this unfolds. Actually, it's,

301
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:44,050
it's pretty a major. Are you
going to watch the her show? No,

302
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:48,010
I never watched the Kardashians.
Oh, that's true. I hate
those fucking shows. Yeah,

303
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,190
that makes sense. And to be
honest with you, I would have,

304
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,660
I'll just sort of walk by the
TV and occasionally glance over.

305
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,330
I need to ease my way into,

306
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,580
you are my soul there and I am done.

307
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,290
I have the fucking right to
do that. Yes you do. Yeah.

308
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,100
When you make that big of a fucking
change, Jesus Christ, I shaved my head.

309
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:09,934
People like,
what the,

310
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,040
yeah, you've got to give people, you
gotta have you gotta be courteous.

311
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,030
It let people like fucking
guy. Let me, uh, okay. Okay.

312
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,220
You should have like five minute visits
and then they increased the 10 and you

313
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:30,350
just got to gradually like,
I mean,

314
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,750
you literally get like you
killed off the other person.

315
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,570
Yeah.

316
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,540
You know what I mean? Pretty much.
Yeah. Yeah. Like where are they?

317
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,170
Yup.
Nolan.

318
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,680
Yeah. So then it, and then
it's weird. It's like, well,

319
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,150
I technically should be liking you.
Right. But you're not the other person,

320
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:46,984
but you still,
you.

321
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,743
Hmm.

322
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,210
Do you think he did something like
he sold his soul to the devil.

323
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:54,770
He's like trying to beat the
devil at his own game and that,

324
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,090
that'll be just becoming like a woman
at the end of his life so he could save

325
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:03,230
his soul. And the devil's
it, it's like, I don't know,

326
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,850
like angel hot. Are you talking
about a movie with Lisa Monet?

327
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,810
Yeah, Mickey Rourke. We cipher.

328
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,820
Um, anyways, I don't fucking know

329
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,960
bill burns. Caitlyn Jenner.
No, I didn't. I fucking,

330
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:28,790
I'm getting my head around it because I'm,
I should allow it to be allowed to do,

331
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,200
um,
anyway.

332
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,353
Anyways.

333
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,743
MMM.

334
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,620
A lot of shit to say. Oh, you don't
want to miss last night was the, uh,

335
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,300
cause I couldn't find my fucking password.
God knows I was awake.

336
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,450
Was the first of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

337
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,170
And um, is it that time of
the year again? All right.

338
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,950
That time of day when you could say so.

339
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm sure we can find some errors.
French pub,

340
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,870
Irish French pub. They're going to have
soccer or they're going to have rugby.

341
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,940
Oh Zero Roland Garros highlights.
Oh well listen.

342
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,890
So I saw Tampa was up one to nothing
when I fell asleep and I was like, wow,

343
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:18,800
wouldn't that be really amazing
if they won game one? Um,

344
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,910
well wait, is it in Tampa?
I think it's in Tampa.

345
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,930
I'm trying to think of the highlights.

346
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:29,700
I think Chicago had on
their white jerseys. I can't
remember. They won game one.

347
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,420
Like what that would do to this series.

348
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:37,680
Like immediately you got to think
it's going to six or seven. Um,

349
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,410
so anyway,
so the rough one and nothing.

350
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,120
Okay.

351
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,800
And then am I excited that, you
know, Chicago score too late.

352
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:48,340
Goals to win the game.
So I got all excited.

353
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,990
I want to put on the
highlights of Seiu scored.

354
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,150
So I put on the highlights and it ended
up depressing the hell out of me when I

355
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:58,420
watched it because, uh, you know,

356
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:02,080
to Tampa Bay lightning fans who have been,
uh, just let you know as a Bruins Fan,

357
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:05,560
I've been there against Chicago.
It was the deciding game.

358
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,920
Like we were trying to force a game
seven and we were up by a goal.

359
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:13,921
It's like a a minute nine left and they
scored two goals in the final minute to

360
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:19,120
not only beat us to win the Stanley
Cup and celebrate on our ice and our

361
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:23,320
building. So kind of took me back
to that, but uh, what, uh, I don't,

362
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:28,150
I can't remember who did what,
but that first goal they had, um,

363
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,450
that guy who stole the puck just
poke checked it away. It just,

364
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,020
that just gives you the idea how fucking
good those guys are at that level.

365
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,410
You just poke checked away in two seconds
later. It's in the back of the neck.

366
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,430
And uh, just amazing. I
hope Tampa wins game too,

367
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:45,280
cause I really want to see a series
and I'm hoping it's still going to go.

368
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,720
Both the NBA and the NHL Finals will
be for games and when we get back,

369
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,020
and I'm obviously open for serious.

370
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,850
Would you like out of
Cleveland in Sacramento?

371
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:59,851
Near Cleveland has Lebron
James Sacramento's got a
Steph curry who's forever

372
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:04,900
chewing his mouthpiece.
Um,

373
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,530
okay. Thank you. You don't
watch. All right. Let me, uh,
let me wrap this thing up.

374
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:12,364
All right.

375
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,730
You want me to get up because we're done
talking about reality TV and Shimizu

376
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,520
CBU play
[inaudible] see,

377
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,220
we'll play. Um, anyway. Uh,

378
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,340
so I'm psyched to see that.
I gotta get my password and uh,

379
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,420
I think this is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to fucking hang out here.

380
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,570
I'm going to booze it up and then at
night I'm going to come back and watch the

381
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:41,170
NBA and the Stanley Cup finals.
That wouldn't suck. Right.

382
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,070
Um,
so what else did I want to talk about?

383
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,310
Oh fuck. I forgot to
bring this up since, uh,

384
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,890
two weeks ago when I was
telling you guys to watch,

385
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,860
I watched that Bollywood movie, that
Res Return of Singham or single returns.

386
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,570
I gotta tell you something.

387
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,750
I saw the most bootleg fucking NBA tee
shirt I've ever seen in my life is in

388
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:10,140
that, in that movie. And uh,

389
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,110
the bad guys wearing it.
Anybody from India,

390
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:16,680
if you could please explain
to me the context of this.

391
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:18,990
It was a Chicago Bulls tee shirt,

392
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,290
red tee shirt with the,
uh,

393
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,180
with the red bull mascot and above
where it should have said bowls.

394
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,770
It said chef,

395
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,810
like c h e s like someone's
going to cook you a meal.

396
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,270
And I remember looking at that code.
How to the chef, is that like a

397
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,070
Hindu for fucking bull? I have
no fucking idea. You know,

398
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,720
and then I'm thinking of bowls.
A male cow.

399
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:48,600
And they don't eat cows over there
or they're not supposed to with,

400
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:50,970
some of them are,
you know,

401
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,560
so why would they say that?
Is that like some punk rock shit?

402
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:59,580
Like this guy is such a bad guy. He's
saying he's going to eat the fucking bull.

403
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,070
No, right. Fuck you. I can hear you
laughing in India from here. All right.

404
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:09,300
Just let me know what the hell that
means if you don't mind. So, um,

405
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,830
anyways, uh, I'm sorry guys.

406
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,980
We don't have a fucking TV here.
I don't know what's going on in the world.

407
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:20,130
So I would have to just rip something
here to give you your fucking half hour

408
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:20,964
for the week.

409
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,010
Yeah.

410
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,180
I've never been more home sector when I
watched fucking those nhls highlights.

411
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,623
Okay.

412
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,840
All right. Google news. God
knows this is reputable, right?

413
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,360
Where do we go here? Where
do we go? Google news. Bam.

414
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,880
All right. So you think six things
to know about Rick Perry? I Dunno.

415
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,390
One thing about it with a fucking see.

416
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,940
So you think Texas got former Texas
governor Rick Perry who launched this 2016

417
00:25:56,941 --> 00:26:00,330
campaign on Thursday.
Six things you may know about him.

418
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,280
Oh, he's from Texas. That
means he's tough on crime.

419
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,270
He doesn't like gay people and he thinks
she ought to be able to smoke in public.

420
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,531
That's what I'm guessing.

421
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:15,531
There's three things I'm going to guess
about a son of paint creek Perry's life

422
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:16,920
until he attended college,

423
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:19,980
revolved around the small hand
scrabble community of pain.

424
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,290
I don't give a fuck about that.
He's a former Democrat pilot wings.

425
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,310
He joined the famous corp of cadets at
Texas a and m university to earn an Air

426

Force commission upon his graduation.
All right. I like them creating jobs,

427
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,950
felony charges. You also skipped by the
good stuff. Let's get to the juice here.

428
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,060
Perry's attorneys, I've asked the
Texas appeals court to dismiss charges,

429
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,020
discharge, felony charges against
him, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

430
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,870
What the fuck did he do sentence
for drunk drive enough? I did that.

431
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,260
A union member.

432
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,480
He's a Republican who was a card carrying
union member. All right, awesome.

433
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,730
That's a good mix. Hey, I remember what
I have. Somebody sent me to talk about.

434
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,070
Did you guys see that article on the
Red Cross raising all of that money,

435
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,950
like $1 billion or something for,
for aid and Haiti and they only,

436
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,220
they said they were going to build all
these houses and roads and get people

437
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,240
electricity and all they've been able
to accomplish is get make six houses and

438
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:28,230
um,
some people are blaming the uh,

439
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,430
the lack of infrastructure
and on Haiti or whatever.

440
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:36,090
But I'm telling you right now,
more and more of these ds.

441
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,120
Yeah.

442
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,470
These, uh, I guess charities are,

443
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,930
are getting exposed for, I mean,
I can't say that they're all,

444
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,030
they're all bad. Um, sorry,

445
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:52,370
I'm looking at this fucking thing up.
But

446
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,910
Yeah,

447
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,390
Red Cross Haiti scandal. Let me
look this up so maybe I can read it.

448
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:01,200
So it's somewhat intelligent
here. Where is it? Where is it?

449
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,910
Red Cross misuse of funds for Haiti.
Sparks protest.

450
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,370
Sorry. All right, here we go.

451
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:13,970
Yeah.

452
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,970
354 million raised 1.6
million spent and allocated.

453
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,713
MMM.

454
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,460
Haitian American organizer
issued organizers issued
a series of complaints and

455
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:33,461
called for strict accountability early
last week over the misuse of over one

456
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,860
11.6 billion in donated funds.

457
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:41,090
Promise for post earthquake
relief in Haiti. 11.6 billion.

458
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:43,760
You could rebuild the whole
fucking country, couldn't
you? It's a little island.

459
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:45,801
What does he hate?

460
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:50,801
He shares a Dominican Republic is with
Cuba and then Haiti's their own little

461
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:55,030
island. Right? I Dunno Macy. I don't
know anything about the covenant meal.

462
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,110
Uh, whatever. So classic fucking thing.
Hang on one second. Hang on, hang on him.

463
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay.

464
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,250
Alright, I'm back. Sorry
about that. This dummy.

465
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,430
Can somebody tell me like a
charity that you just know?

466
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,910
It seems like Saint Jude is the
only one that I, Jimmy Fund.

467
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,030
The Cam Nealy House. Oh, the only

468
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,970
ones that I've seen that really just
like the lion's share of the money.

469
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,490
Yeah. For obvious expenses. You know,

470
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:27,440
you've got to rent out a
venue and that type of shit.

471
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:31,640
All the Patrice O'Neal benefit.
I can tell you without a doubt.

472
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,460
What'd you guys do with Sunday?
You found out?

473
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:36,830
I was actually keeping all the fucking
man, that would just be the end.

474
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,480
It'd be end of everything.

475
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,440
Me Stepping out of my
Prius have a no comment.

476
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,610
By the way, we're looking at the first
Tuesday in March for the next one. Um,

477
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,410
so anyways,
one of the,

478
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:54,590
somebody said all of the money
the Red Cross has collected,

479
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,840
uh,

480
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,460
yeah,

481
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,320
I know of only one location where they
gave out plastic bottles of water while

482
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:06,890
providing no shelter or any
significant amount of food.

483
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,140
I mean, these guys, they getting them
and they're getting trashed here.

484
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,440
Now please tell me,
is this making national news?

485
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:18,100
Is this anywhere on the
news or are they not there?

486
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,840
Because what ends up happening
is the Red Cross, you know,

487
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,500
they advertise on television so they
don't get to advertise for free.

488
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,180
So those networks are making money off
of the Red Cross and that sound networks

489
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:34,460
make their money is through advertising.

490
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,540
So there's an immediate conflict
of interest where it's like,

491
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:40,940
should we do this report?
You know,

492
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,380
these guys give us $1 million
a year up to advertise.

493
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
We're throwing $1 million
out the fuck window.

494
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,430
If we say that these fucking guys
aren't doing the right thing. Um,

495
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,720
so I dunno,
I'm not in the state so I'm going to,

496
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:56,390
if they're actually show
him the same anyways,

497
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:59,810
this whole fucking thing's just
petering out. Um, all right,

498
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:01,250
so four days end of this trip.

499
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,410
I'm not going to lie to you
already miss being home. Um,

500
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,420
but I got that a sporting event coming
up and going to the tennis game.

501
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:12,950
So that's my, my big thing. Other than
that, I'm just over here sitting in cafes,

502
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:16,130
boozing it up. Oh by no fucking
way. If you ever come over here,

503
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:17,810
which you should include,

504
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:21,410
that negative content got mad at me for
fucking bringing it up that I was over

505
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:21,770
here.

506
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,770
Like I'm supposed to lie when I'm supposed
to be and if you're listening you're

507
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,580
a Douche bag.

508
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,150
Your tweet really depressed the hell
out of me for like five seconds.

509
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,240
Cause not because I give
a fuck what you think.

510
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,380
It's because when I was
young and was not confident,

511
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,490
it was an introvert.

512
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:44,450
Someone like you could have fucked me
out of becoming a comedian. All right?

513
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,970
You need to work on yourself.
And you know,

514
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,310
it doesn't cost that much
fucking money to come over here.

515
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,650
He kept college kids come
over here and backpack,

516
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:54,620
just sleep in a fucking hostile. You want
to come over, you can make it happen.

517
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:59,810
Lay off the booze, you know,
make some sacrifices, you know,

518
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,190
fucking asshole,

519
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,920
making it seem like I bought Paris
over here on his fucking seven day

520
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,840
bender. So anyways, um,

521
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,200
and if you have somebody like debt your
life, you've got to get rid of them.

522
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,110
Don't ever be afraid to literally just
fire a friend, you know what I mean?

523
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:24,080
Call them into your office and just
say, listen, this isn't working out.

524
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,860
And they'll be like, why? What
are you talking about this?

525
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,780
Because anytime I want to do anything
with my life that's going to take me into

526
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,960
a direction they want to go.

527
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,140
You fucking pull it back the
reins because you're a client.

528
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,550
So you're right in my life. So anyways,
so when you do come over here, everybody,

529
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,080
if you choose to,
um,

530
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,390
you got to watch out for the
fucking Gypsies bad. These guys,

531
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,480
these men and women are,

532
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,170
they're so good at pickpocket
and you can't even get mad at it.

533
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm a cab driver gave us
the whole fucking breakdown.

534
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,790
They actually there to the point
now because everybody's on to them.

535
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,310
Like don't Fret French police are run to,
they actually,

536
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:06,870
they show up dressed like tourists.
They have cameras around their neck,

537
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,110
socks pulled up too high,
you know,

538
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,900
just walking around like a
bunch of fucking nerds like me.

539
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,210
And they will literally walk up to you
one bumps into the others in your fucking

540
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:20,610
pockets before he,
before you even know what's going on.

541
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,840
And I know what you're saying, like, oh,
that old trick, that old trick. You wait,

542
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,070
you wait, you'll come over here
and you'll be like, uh, you know,

543
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,930
finish in a fucking meal.
And UBS using while at the TCO,

544
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,360
TCO, TCO, TCO. See, we'll
play music check, right?

545
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,690
Then I'll bring it over to you and you
go to gold for your fucking wallet.

546
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:46,470
And it's God. You're
like, well, I, I didn't,

547
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,490
I didn't walk near anybody.
I just fucking glided over here.

548
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,410
I think I said hello to one press.

549
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:55,410
I got you say a load on them and
they got your fucking wallet.

550
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:57,570
So you got to watch out.
So I know a lot of you guys are thinking,

551
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,770
where are they from?
Where are these Gypsies from?

552
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:06,210
That's the question I asked. We just
travel around and not from anywhere.

553
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,870
Um,
should,

554
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:11,940
I probably shouldn't say where they're
from cause I'm sure there's plenty of

555
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:14,300
decent people there.
Uh,

556
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,460
but it rhymes with Romania.

557
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:27,770
So anyways, that's the Thursday
afternoon. Just before Monday morning.

558
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,150
Thursday.
What is fine Thursday afternoon,

559
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,870

before Friday. And other
words, nobody's. Yeah. Yeah.

560
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:38,060
Um, it was a classic kit from fucking
back in the data and what they're going to

561
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,410
play. Uh, anyways, I'm going
to try to watch the, uh,

gay more than the NBA finals tonight
and that's it. Have a wonderful day. Uh,

563
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,170

564
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,310
Yeah.

565
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,930
Oh,

566
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,630

567
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,510
camera two. Hey Bill, uh, maybe you
can help me out with this um, thing.

568
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,050
Now I haven't read any of these things
people. So, uh, bear with me here. Uh,

569
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:15,610
this sounds ridiculous but hear me out.

570
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:19,240
I met this girl a couple of weeks ago
and I've been talking to her and hanging

571
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:20,680
out with her nonstop.

572
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,890
Okay.

573
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,090
We is pretty

574
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,923
what?

575
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,560
I guess it's, she is
pretty, she's pretty funny,

576
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:31,550
intelligent and one of the most upfront
and upfront and honest people I've ever

577
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:34,580
met in my life. In fact,
maybe a little too honest,

578
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:38,020
cause she tells me every day how great,
cute and

579
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,740
honest I am. And it's a little
much sometimes. Anyways,

580
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,240
we've been hitting it off like crazy.

581
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,530
And on Saturday she spent the night and
we hung out all day Sunday about nine,

582
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,530
around 9:00 PM,
we got on the topic of old jobs.

583
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,140
Fuck is she a dancer?

584
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,940
And she told me that a few years
ago she worked in a pet store. Okay.

585
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:58,774
I guess wrong.

586
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,020
There was a hamster there that would bite
her every day drawing blood and would

587
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:07,240
attack coworkers and customers.
Generally,

588
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:10,470
the hamster was a crazy douche.
One day her,

589
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,510
her and a coworker decided they had to
do something about this thing to put the

590
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:20,650
hamster in a bag and
smashed it against the wall.

591
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,840
Whoa.

592
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,410
Okay.

593
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,120
What?
Jesus Christ,

594
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,090
what a fucking left turn that was.

595
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,830
They put it in a bag and
smashed it against the wall.

596
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,100
Needless to say, I was shocked.
The first thing I said was,

597
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,060
holy shit lay.
That's Kinda crazy.

598
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,880
That makes
wait.

599
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:56,330
That's the kind of crazy that makes
a wife cut her husband's Dick off.

600
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,660
I'm sorry dude.
That was a hilarious line and I blew it.

601
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,820
The first thing I said was,
Holy Shit Lady.

602
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:05,360
That's the kind of crazy that makes
it wife cut her husband's Dick off.

603
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,660
She said she still feels horrible about
it and that she killed it that way

604
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,680
because she couldn't think of any
other way to make it quick, but Jeez,

605
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,840
I mean, I never been in that situation,
but it seems kind of crazy. Lol.

606
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,740
This seems like something straight
out of a Seinfeld episode,

607
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,600
but I just keep thinking about it.

608
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:29,780
Every time me and this chick's
are are getting together.

609
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Should I just accept this is a crazy
story or is this a sign that she has

610
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:38,000
serious issues?
Remember,

611
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:42,080
this happened years ago and
she seems absolutely sane.

612
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,010
Otherwise,

613
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,670
please help potential murder
victim question mark through.

614
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:52,280
Some of you guys are really fucking funny
man. The way you guys write this shit.

615
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,760
I, I you, but you've got to met.
I haven't proved with my reading.

616
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:59,570
I feel so bad that I butchered
that God damn line. Um,

617
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,350
yeah.

618
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,260
Okay. Jesus Christ. What
do you do with this one?

619
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,850
This is fucked up on like so
many different levels. Okay.

620
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:12,000
Let's start with the first thing.
The cruelty to animals.

621
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:13,780
Okay.

622
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,613
Okay.

623
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,880
Not only cruelty to animals
like I could what she did,

624
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:22,000
I could do that to an aunt.
I won't even do it to a spider.

625
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,160
I could do it to a fucking mosquito.

626
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,830
Yeah.

627
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,790
That's what she basically treated
a hamster like a fucking mosquito.

628
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,220
Yeah.

629
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,720
Now granted a hamster. Okay, let, let's
try to be a little empathetic here.

630
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,830
Empathetic.
Let me try to put myself in her situation.

631
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,210
If I was younger,

632
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:46,810
20 years younger and a hamster bit me
every day at work and I met working at a

633
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:50,320
fucking pet store, uh, what?

634
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:54,250
I smashed it against the wall and
a bag. No, I wouldn't. However,

635
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,630
yeah,

636
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,810
I love do something

637
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,733
to it.

638
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,640
I would do something. You know what
I would do? I would take a ruler

639
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,190
and if I would wait,

640
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,670
I would wait till it was a fallen asleep
and I would just write on it's fucking

641
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:21,660
hamster ass and it woke up
whenever the fuck it did.

642
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,350
I would just take the ruler and I
would pin it against the fucking cage.

643
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,760
They just watch. You get all
upset. I just, I would bully it.

644
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:32,310
That's what basically what I would do.
And I you liked that?

645
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:35,940
You liked that you little fucking
hamster, Huh? I wouldn't hurt it.

646
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,250
I just keep it pinned there.
I'm a frustrated,

647
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,310
I would frustrate the living shit
out of it. That's what I would do.

648
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,670
I would do something like that,
I that I think I would do that,

649
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:49,230
but I would not smash it against the
fucking wall. They put it in a bag.

650
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,020
Now did,
was it repeated strikes?

651
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,850
Jesus Christ, you know, some of this
shit kids used to do in my neighborhood.

652
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,220
You know,
I had a friend of mine,

653
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:04,630
he's take his house cat and he'd put
it in an empty Pellis Kelo case and he

654
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:07,900
would fucking spin it over his head like
someone, like it was at a Steelers game,

655
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,940
you know,
that's what the fuck he would do.

656
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,270
And then sometimes he'd
put it in the dryer.

657
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,070
They used to tell me these stories and
I used to laugh my fucking ass off for

658
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:29,700
some reason. I found it funny back
then. Now I find it absolutely horrific.

659
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,680
And uh, I would never do it, but if I
had to do it to either a dog or a cat,

660
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:38,970
I would definitely do it to a cat. But
it'd have to be a real douche of a cat.

661
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,980
All right,
so we're getting off the subject here.

662
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,770
So it's cruelty to animals
and she works at a pet store.

663
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:47,130
So that's bizarre because he
figured if you work at a pet store,

664
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,140
that means you either
you love animals or you,

665
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,190
you like I had a low level deal pot.
You,

666
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,570
you've, you're dealing weed
on a low level, you know
what I mean? You're that guy.

667
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,590
You like the burnout, Matthew mcconaughey.
At least that's how they used to be.

668
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,170
But then there's the other option
that serial killers, you know,

669
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:12,390
they start off with small animals.
You know,

670
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,600
they watch a ton of porn and they start
torturing small animals and then they

671
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:19,230
gradually work their way up, uh, you know,

672
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,560
to a fucking human being.
So yeah, you could possibly,

673
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,190
you could possibly be dealing with
that right now. Then also, you know,

674
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:30,650
you're looking at it like this is,
that's the mother. Your children

675
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,280
put a hamster

676
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,113
in a fucking,

677
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:40,150
I could see if it was fucking
1911 rather than 2011.

678
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,940
Yeah.

679
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,790
People back then, they kill
an animal. They didn't give
a fuck. They just walk out.

680
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,620
What do you guys want for dinner?
Good.

681
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,140
It's has some goose in the
fucking mom would walk out.

682
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,130
They grabbed the goose by the neck and
then they fucking act like they were

683
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:59,260
trying to start up a model t ah,
fucking body Susan.

684
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,870
They've just break its
neck nice and quick. Um,

685
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,840
and then they pluck it, Nick Cook
it and that was it. And that was,

686
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:13,130
that was dinner 1911. Did
you like that little piece,
piece of history? Uh, I don't,

687
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,770
dude, I don't know what to
tell you. This is like, um,

688
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,840
that's really fucking insane
and at the very least,

689
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,880
um, if you get into a fight with
her, she's at the very least,

690
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:31,360
I think she's going to throw something
at you. She may be one of those.

691
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,570
I have no idea. Dude. How
hot is this girl? I think I,

692
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,740
some of these people I need like a
picture to see if it's like worth it.

693
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
You guys seem to be connecting
on like a personality level,

694
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:43,630
but I really got to tell you,

695
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,353
you know,

696
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,900
that's just like something
Roger Clemens would do.

697
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,440
I could picture him doing
that. You know, he is at posy,

698
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,440
posy from the fucking dirty
dozen sort of vibe about them.

699
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,780
Hugs forward
to the

700
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,140
please come back to

701
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,380
come to me last be sweethearts.

702
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,560
Did you want, shall we? Um, so anyways,

703
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,600
this is why I've been cooped up in
Cincinnati the entire fucking weekend is

704
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:31,950
because, uh, this is what
I've learned about Cincinnati.

705
00:43:31,951 --> 00:43:36,600
Evidently they have what's known
as good downtown and bad downtown.

706
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,060
But as far as I can tell,

707
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:42,480
it's all fucked up because I'm
supposed to be in good downtown.

708
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,780
And um, I've been walking
around this, you know, I've,

709
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,690
I've lived in cities and I
performed in cities enough for,

710
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:56,370
I know what the fucking red
flags are when it means,

711
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,510
hey bill, why don't you go back to
your hotel room or at the very least,

712
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,310
take your watch off. Put it
in your pocket. I love that.

713
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,770
That's the classic White
Guy, suburban Wolf. I know.

714
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,300
I'll take it off and put it in my pocket.

715
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,740
What exactly does that do?
You know,

716
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,080
other than maybe save you
from getting a broken arm,

717
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,730
you know that somebody is just
ripping your pocket off your jeans.

718
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,910
So this is the deal. I walk out.
This is, these are the red flags.

719
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:29,960
I walk out of my hotel the first block,

720
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,440
I see a check cashing place. All right?
This is for tourists. The people,

721
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:38,310
if you see a check cashing place a
hail a cab and get the fuck out of that

722
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:38,791
neighborhood,

723
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:42,930
or at the very least stop the direction
you're walking in and going the other

724
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:46,470
direction. All right. Which is what
I did. I was like, well, you know,

725
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:48,990
I don't think I want to get food down
this way. Let me go this other way.

726
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,070
So I start walking up the street a
little bit more and what do I see on the

727
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:55,800
right hand side of the street?
I see a hat store,

728
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,900
a store that sells nothing but
hats and I don't mean like Lids,

729
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,950
baseball hats. Oh, those Brian
Johnson, I'm a fan of ACDC,

730
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,590
had some talking like Venus
fly trap fucking bitch.

731
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:11,700
Where's my money hats?

732
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,710
And right next to it they had a store
that sold the suits that went with those

733
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:21,110
bitch, where's my money hats? So I'm
like, all right, I'm in a pimp, Allie.

734
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,940
All right. I am not a fucking
pimp. I don't have any bitches.

735
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,170
Let me get the fuck out of there. But
then I see an oasis. I see Walgreens.

736
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,190
I'm like, okay, that's a chain.
All right, it's a corporate chain.

737
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,330
I will walk in there and I will regroup
and I'll ask somebody in there with the

738
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:38,340
fid Rutgers's you know,

739
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,310
so I walk in there and I go in there
and once again I see another red flag.

740
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,480
The lotion,

741
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,700
lotion people was locked
in a glass cabinet.

742
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,840
All right. 18 years on the road.
I have never fucking seen that.

743
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,240
How much does lotion cost
people? It doesn't cost that
fucking munch. All right.

744
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,990
You have to lock it up like
it's fucking razor blades,

745
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,810
which I still don't think that they should
cost that fucking much. Razor blades,

746
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,720
they lock up because they just,
they make them seem like these,

747
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,600
they're these diamonds
and they're very rare.

748
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:20,220
So for some reason they are 40 bucks for
eight of them and everybody knows it's

749
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:22,440
bullshit. So they're going to
steal them. But this is lotion.

750
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,300
Every fucking drug still you go into,
you know the shampoos out in the ocean,

751
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,440
out in the ocean, out in the
open. The lotion is my brain,

752
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:35,760
always three words ahead of where the
fuck I'm going to say you'd like to add

753
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,870
open and lotion, you get ocean. Um,

754
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,240
yeah. So I was like, all right, what the
fuck? And then I walked out and I saw, uh,

755
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,020
I saw a black dude under the age of
35 with a Jheri curl. And right there,

756
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:52,440
that was it. I was like, I'm done. I'm
going back to my fucking hotel because,

757
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:56,310
oh no. And then the last thing
was all decent, respectable.

758
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,350
A Brady bunch looking white people
and Huxtable look and black people all

759
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:06,351
vacated the city at five Oh one leaving
depression era looking white people,

760
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,150
you know,

761
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,370
do you guys ever see peewee's
big adventure and he's on
that train with that Guy

762
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,200
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care.

763
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,210
That's what all the fucking
white guys look like.

764
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,300
And the black guys all
look like Pac man Jones.

765
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,690
Actually they didn't know it was
just one guy. One of my shows he did,

766
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:26,220
he had the Paul Wall Grill in his
mouth. And uh, you know, I dunno.

767
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,640
So I've just been sitting here ordering
room service my entire fucking weekend

768
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:31,840
reading about Cincinnati

769
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,360
anyways, so I was so bored this
week and I was just like, ah,

770
00:47:56,361 --> 00:48:01,100
I'm going into a negative funk here.
I have got to do something positive.

771
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:03,090
So I actually went up and I go,
you know,

772
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:06,020
after I started reading about Cincinnati,
I was like, maybe I'll go to a museum.

773
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,700
So the closest museum was this museum
about the underground railroad,

774
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,380
the underground, not like that.
That's what the, uh, Swedes called.

775
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:17,570
They're a call the subway,

776
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:23,060
the underground in England,
they call it the tube. You know,

777
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:24,440
look at make fucking world traveler.

778
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:28,910
I know how to say grilled cheese in
five different languages. Um, uh, God,

779
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:32,450
my brain's so fucking tired. Come on
belts. You can make it, you can make it.

780
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,600
Here we go. What am I talking
about here? So I go, all right,

781
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:35,840
go to the underground railroad and I use,

782
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,750
usually I don't like going
to shit like that. Okay.

783
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:41,330
I understand how evil
white people are. And, uh,

784
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:44,270
I've seen enough shit in my lifetime
that I really don't want to be reminded.

785
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,190
I go on Youtube, I see all the shit that
people, right, it's fucking, you know,

786
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,840
it's depressing, but I'm figuring
this is the underground railroad.

787
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,990
There's a happy ending after this shit,
right? It starts off with the slavery,

788
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:56,960
but then there's freedom, right? And
there's going to be a big, you know,

789
00:48:56,961 --> 00:49:00,080
we are the world thing at the end,
you know.

790
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:05,270
So I walk in there and they gave me
this little radio and I go, all right,

791
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:06,890
and I go,
it's one of these museums.

792
00:49:06,891 --> 00:49:09,860
We start at the top and then you
wind your way all the way down.

793
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:15,490
And I walked in there and
it was fucking horrific.

794
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,530
It was horrific.
Just see,

795
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:24,780
and they stacked them up like
fucking wood in these God damn ships.

796
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,770
Now people's families getting separated.

797
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:31,220
And it was just in every fucking picture.
Just had some black dude,

798
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:34,670
a woman just getting the shit kicked out
of him and then some evil looking white

799
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:39,110
guy. And, uh, I quickly realized that was
one of the only white people in there.

800
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:42,260
So now I'm looking at black people and I'm
feeling like an asshole. Like Ah, yeah.

801
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:46,940
Hey, uh, yeah, sorry about that. I
kinda got a little out of control.

802
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,961
It wasn't only me,

803
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:52,780
it was my ancestors and I just want to
get the fuck out of there. Right. So, oh,

804
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,250
it was, it was brutal. I can only, I
can only be in there for like half,

805
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,210
like half hour, 40 minutes. And I
was like, I already know this shit.

806
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,920
I know this shit. I already know
this shit's fucking, it was horrible.

807
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,240
It was fucking horrible.

808
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:10,241
And I just basically fast walked down
like five flights of stairs to get,

809
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,690
it wasn't even stairs. It was
like a round thing, you know,

810
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,020
I should have just been gone, I'm
sorry. All the way down. Right.

811
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:21,500
And then when I fucking went to leave,
this is the best part.

812
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,530
I handed my radio and I'm so full of
white guilt at that point then I'm to be

813
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:30,050
friendly as possible.
Then when I hand it to the lady,

814
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,400
the lady behind the counter, this
black woman, she goes, she goes,

815
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:38,030
how did you enjoy the museum? And I was
so trying to say something positive.

816
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:39,890
I went to big, I went, it was great.

817
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,350
I felt like an asshole.

818
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,730
I sounded like I enjoyed it too much
and I want to be like, great, like,

819
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,730
like informative. Great. You
know, not great. Like, you know,

820
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:55,070
woo slavery,

821
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,540
slavery on two on two,
ready break. Um, AH, yeah.

822
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,750
Fuck. It was brutal. It
was brutal. So I dunno,

823
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,623
that's it.

824
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,873
Yeah,

825
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,310
no.
