1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,560
Hey, what's going on is bill burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:07,510
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:12,511
And I am just checking in on you will,

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,350
oh, sorry. I didn't bring my
fucking microphone like an asshole.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,390
Um, all right. How you
doing? I'm out in New Jersey.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,600
Oh Gee.
To this fucking room is nasty.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,800
You know what the first fucking thing
I found here was a goddamned raising on

8
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:34,850
the floor. Then there was some
sort of stain on the dead. God,

9
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:39,170
the fucking New Jersey man. I
swear to God, swear there was just,

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,690
you know what they'll do?

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,810
They'll never be able to vacuum and
scrub the fucking hair metal out of this

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,380
state.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,380
It's just what went on out in this
God damn part of the world in the 80s.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,050
I swear to God,
fucking played like the A,

15
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:58,730
I had one of these great travel
days and then it sucked. You know,

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,910
I uh, found a cheap
ticket, got an exit row.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,950
There was nobody in the middle
seat. Right? The person on
the aisle was courteous.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,690
We had a fucking tailwind.
One point I was watching us,

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,610
we go on 603 miles an hour.
I'm like, what are we on?

20
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:19,900
The fucking Kong could always,
um,

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,810
it was great. So then we land, you know,

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,830
I'm no longer with budget rental car.
Fuck those guys.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
I don't know what happened with them.

24
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:36,110
I've been meaning to like leave
them for six years. There was a,

25
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,480
there was something
happened over the last five,

26
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:41,460
six years and I have lose meaning
to walk out on a typical of me.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
And when I'm in a bad relationship,

28
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:47,570
it takes a good half a decade
for me to get out of it. So, um,

29
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,660
yeah,

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,420
yeah. After that, that last
fucking conversation I had,

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,183
mmm.

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,340
You know, with them where they were like,
oh, you, you didn't close your account.

33
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,880
And I had to get back on the phone and
talk to those fucking assholes. It's like,

34
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:03,870
just close the fucking thing so you
have to be on the phone. I got it, dude.

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,580
I don't have time for this. He
said, sir, the more you talk,

36
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,250
and I just hung up on him. I was just, I
could lead to the fucking leave it open.

37
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,150
I don't give a shit.

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,370
Okay.

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,620
Why you acting like I still have the car.

40
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,440
Okay.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,970
Sorry. Um, when am I gonna like
react to things in a mature way?

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,080
I just don't, I, every time I
take the fucking bag, I freak out.

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,980
I got into it with the Sklar brothers.
I did their fucking podcast. Right.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,720
And both of them, you know,
talk in sports, both of them
agreeing with each other.

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,400
And then one was in the, it was like, it
was just like, it was like arguing with,

46
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,080
with one person and Stereo.

47
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,260
Okay.
And one of them,

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,290
Randy adjacent,
they never reintroduced themselves either.

49
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,560
They'll like fucking identical twins.
They're always changing their facial hair.

50
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,790
I literally, I've called each one of them
buddy for fucking 15 years. Hey Buddy,

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,560
what's going on? I used to know Randy
because Randy had the facial hair. So my,

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,610
my thing in my head was like rugged Randy.
He's got the facial hair.

53
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,620
Then they started fucking switching
off with the goatees and, and I,

54
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:09,100
and the fucking, uh, Don
Mattingly Baseball fucking, uh,

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,000
mustaches. I don't know
who's who anymore. Right.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,580
Okay.

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,820
So you know, we're having a nice
podcast. Everything's going good,

58
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:21,710
and we'd brings up Tom Brady and he has
to bring up fucking deflate gate and I

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,350
fucking lost it.
I fucking lost it.

60
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:28,270
I just hate the gym or say like,
he like one.

61
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,490
Yeah,

62
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,310
he successfully ran a fucking bullshit
smear campaign that will follow that guy.

63
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,270
Okay.

64
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,630
An innocent man for the
rest of his fucking career.

65
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,550
Okay.

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,900
You know what he should've done?

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,670
He should've had performance enhancing
drugs sent to his house in his wife name

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,380
because evidently benches fitches
flies away. That's no big deal.

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,490
Unreal on fucking real.
And then it was funny though,

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,420
they're that cool though because
afterwards I was so fucking annoyed.

71
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,370
Okay.

72
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,840
By him just seeing it that way and like
blaming Tom Brady for not getting out in

73
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:08,130
front of this stupid witch hunt.
Right. That I actually called him up.

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,160
This is how much time I wasted my life
being upset and caring about sports for

75
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:17,550
whatever fucking reason.
You know,

76
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,870
I'd call him up and I start talking to
them and it finds out like he didn't even

77
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:23,250
know half the facts of the story.

78
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:24,920
Okay.

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,491
So I was like,
dude,

80
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:28,730
that's like reprehensible few be going
on in their trash and this guy and you

81
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,660
don't even know that the fucking
better say paid for that fucking dope.

82
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:34,580
It wasn't all at that.
Should I know this is all right.

83
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,750
But he brought it back up again,

84
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,810
you know,

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,690
and uh,
I got to give it up to him.

86
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,020
He fucking manned up and went back on his
podcast and actually apologize for not

87
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,360
knowing a couple of those fucking things,
but I just all you fucking,

88
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm telling you right now,

89
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,230
yeah.

90
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,960
It's just a bunch of fucking
patriots haters at this point.

91
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,080
If you're going to ignore
fucking hearing aids and helmets,

92
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,670
performance enhancing drugs,

93
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,000
centi wife for you out in
all of that just goes away.

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,220
But this fucking deflated fucking cunt
hair with the air out of a ball doesn't,

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,470
then I eat. You are, you are in
my world. You are just, you just,

96
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,130
you just hate on the Patriots. All right.
Now if you give everybody shit, okay.

97
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,940
And every time they bring up these other
guys' names, you go, oh, wait a minute.

98
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,480
You mean the guy who's offensive
line head, the hearing aids.

99
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,240
You mean that guy,
you're going to do that,

100
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,760
then they're not going to fucking do that.
You're not going to do it.

101
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,440
And it happened in Indianapolis.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,040
Yeah.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,210
That doesn't matter.
Those are simple people out there.

104
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,500
They put their pants on one leg at
a time. Hey Guy, I get it. It, yeah,

105
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,790
fucking give a shit bag. Um, so
anyways, my travels going great.

106
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,863
And um,

107
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,500
so I was actually upset at
myself for getting that worked up

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,330
okay.

109
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,690
About something that I really thought
I was over. You know what I mean?

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,210
It was like seeing a chick he broke
up with, he was like, you know,

111
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm finally ready to fucking move on.
And then, you know, you run into in a,

112
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,580
and she just says that one thing and you
go right back to the fucking end of the

113
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:06,440
relationship,
fucking talking yourself in the bathroom.

114
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,350
And she'd taken a shower,
you know,

115
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,910
just completely losing your shit while
kind of watching yourself going like,

116
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:15,430
dude, she's winning. Just shut
up. She's winning. And you just,

117
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,720
but you got to get it out of you.

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,633
MMM.

119
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,210
So anyways, I was sitting on the plane,
right? We get off the fucking plane

120
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,043
and,
uh,

121
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,720
I drive out here to fucking Red
Bank, New Jersey, and I show up

122
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,310
and I got my bags and it's like seven,
I think it was seven 48 in the morning.

123
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,570
I took a red eye,
right?

124
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,550
And I come walking in and the second I
saw the lady behind the desk looks at me.

125
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,120
I know my room's not going to be ready.
And I come walking in and I'm like, Yay,

126
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,720
I got a reservation. And she's
already shaking your head. She's like,

127
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:52,940
we don't have, it's seven 48 in
the morning. I go, no, no, no. Uh,

128
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,610
but I paid for the room overnight so I
could come in early and she sits like,

129
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,690
yeah, no you didn't.
Yeah, we don't have that.

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
And then my blood starts going
up so I start going like,

131
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:07,650
you mean to tell me that I have to and
I almost fell asleep on the ride over

132
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:08,940
here cause I couldn't
really sleep on the plane.

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,513
MMM.

134
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,150
I blood starts going up and
I'm sitting there going like,

135
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,180
are you mean to tell me I have to
drive around red bank until like two,

136
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:22,630
three o'clock in the afternoon?
She's like, I can try to expedite.

137
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
But I was able to calm myself
down. I was like, you know what?

138
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,110
I already got into it
with the Sklar brothers.

139
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,710
Why do I want to get involved with this
fucking person? This nice person here,

140
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,210
you know, she had, see she,
she has nothing to do with
these decisions. I fucked up.

141
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,410
Somebody fucked up, but she didn't.
Right. So I just said, I find, she goes,

142
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:45,700
you want to drop off your bags? I say yes.
I vaguely remember driving to a diner.

143
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,830
Okay.

144
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,850
And getting some eggs benedict
looking at this guy,

145
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,330
you know, who do you ever see those
guys? They just slept. I Dunno.

146
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,460
They just have bandaids all over him.
Like just, they had like 20 tests.

147
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:02,620
Just take my second. I saw the guy
was like, this guy is not good.

148
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,320
This guy's not gonna be around for
a long time. You know what I mean?

149
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,250
I was in like one of these Tony
Soprano fucking, uh, you know,

150
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,160
looked like that one. You know what?
You don't let one where, uh, Jimmy,

151
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:14,430
the gent comes walking
out and he knocks on the,

152
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:17,800
the guy's falling up their window.
Let's go fuck hoes.

153
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,000
They kicked me up all night.

154
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,170
They look like one of those places
and I just looking at this guy,

155
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,030
why this guy is not going to be,
he's not gonna be around for awhile.

156
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,470
Um,
you know,

157
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,380
man, he was like, fuck it. And he was
eating eggs and bacon. It's just like, oh,

158
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:35,160
there you go. Go out the way
you want to go out. Right.

159
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,090
So I get back in the car and like,
I don't know what did,

160
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,690
what am I going to fuck do you do? So I
just drove back to the hotel parking lot,

161
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,850
reclined the seat,
crack the whip and just slept in the car.

162
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,220
It was funny was every 40 minutes I wake
up and I'd be sweating because the sun

163
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,800
was coming up more and more in the
car was getting hotter and hotter.

164
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,330
So I'd have to turn the car on,

165
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,000
roll the windows down a little more
and then go back to sleep. And uh,

166
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,510
I did that for about like from,
I dunno,

167
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,130
30 in the morning to
about a quarter to 12.

168
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,890
I'm 25 years into my career and this,
the road is always going to be the road.

169
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,120
This is well, he's going to happen
and uh, I got to tell you though,

170
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,080
I feel great.

171
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,750
I got a fucking really
good three hours came in,

172
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,010
checked in, grabbed my
bags, hit the hotel gym,

173
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,210
knocking out the podcast.
Um,

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,020
anyways. Yeah, you guys
got to listen to that,

175
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,720
that Sklar one cause it's really good.
Those guys fucking know that shit man.

176
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,700
They really know their shit when it comes
to a fucking, uh, sports and everything.

177
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:53,670
And I kept teasing them that they
did not look athletic at all.

178
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,220
You know when they would like trash
and Michael Jordan saying he petty,

179
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,170
he's petty and it's just like, you guys
aren't going to be those guys are you?

180
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,260
The last guy picked it,

181
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:05,550
did gym class and then when there's
somebody as great as Michael Jordan,

182
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:06,810
okay,

183
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,850
you, you, you just can't accept
it. He's great. You still have to,

184
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,350
who the fuck says Michael? Jordan's
petty. Like you hung out with them.

185
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,130
You Watch one speech,
he brings up the guy,

186
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,560
okay.

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,470
That he beat out in high school to
introduce him. That makes him petty.

188
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:25,310
You don't know him.

189
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,450
What it really is is you see yourself
in that guy given the intro to Mike.

190
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,750
So now you got to look at him like he's
like, he's an asshole or something.

191
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:37,070
Give me a fucking break and then
we'll do bug you guy who gave the,

192
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:40,690
gave you oh really? Heavier.
Hung out with them then shut up.

193
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,560
And also all of them, they've, Jordan
never walked into their studio,

194
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,940
they would never call him petty.
Their voices would go up nine octaves.

195
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,740
They'd ask him to sign this form,

196
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,740
there's a fucking forehead draw the
Air Jordan thing right on there.

197
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:57,490
They go down to a tattoo parlor and have
it tattooed. So, uh, enough already.

198
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,380
Um, so anyways, sorry, I'm,

199
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,670
I'm literally gonna get worked up about
that thing. Oh, so anyways, it bugged,

200
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,020
it bugged him. A one of them, I don't know
what if it was Randy adjacent. Alright.

201
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,050
It Bud, one of them that I was
saying, they weren't athletic,

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,320
so he sends me a video of him and his
culdesac shooting a basketball in slow

203
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:22,600
motion from really far
away and it goes in.

204
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,300
And that was some sort of
demonstration that he was athletic.

205
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,770
I still haven't trashed him for it yet.

206
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,940
Okay.

207
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,930
It's just like, dude, there was nobody
garden you, it wasn't a game. You know,

208
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,520
he's like,
that was the second attempt.

209
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,790
I hate those stupid fucking videos.

210
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,790
There was one the other night where a
guy's in a helicopter is in the Robinson

211
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,870
44 and he throws him fucking basketball
out and it goes through the hoop.

212
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,460
It's like if you, if he
could do it consistently, if
he did it on the first try.

213
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,790
Yeah. That's impressive. That
poor guy flying the helicopter.

214
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,880
You point me to keep landing cause they
kept collecting the basketballs and they

215
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,960
fucking go back up. Then it
finally goes through. Yeah.

216
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:06,780
You know you do it enough times.
Yeah. It's going to go in. Um,

217
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,280
anyways, uh, so I'm going
to try to eat like an angel.

218
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:15,190
I've been doing really good. I
The ball, Billy knows booze bag.

219
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,000
You know when I went out Tuesday night
cause it was Joe to Rose's birthday and

220
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:23,440
I'll tell you right now, I'm on my liver
is so happy. Joe's only turn 40 once.

221
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,140
Oh Oh let me tell you,

222
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,100
I was so hung over the next day I woke
up like laughing. It was like, it was,

223
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,830
it was so pathetic. I felt so bad
it wasn't, it wasn't even like,

224
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,720
it would be redundant to actually
feel bad at that point. And, uh,

225
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,570
I actually got up,

226
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,280
forced down half a glass of water
and I went out and I worked out,

227
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,080
hung over as shit,
you know,

228
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,250
stretching out the hammies my big dumb
fucking head down towards my ankles,

229
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,950
you know, stretching out my hands and my
head was just going to Gush, Gush, Gush,

230
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,160
you know. But I gotta tell you that's
where it be in German. Irish comes in,

231
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,010
cause you will plow fucking
through anything. You know
what I mean? Is that was,

232
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,140
that was Versie with
this Mediterranean blood,

233
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:23,420
knowing how to live life and, you
know, smell the roses. Eh, this,

234
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,840
he would've called in sick to work

235
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,930
if he got up a second before 2:00
AM I'm telling you, Paul Versey,

236
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:37,110
he would have been moaning. You know what
I mean? Like he just shattered his leg.

237
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,060
Uh Oh did, we had a great time. We
had a great time. We went to two.

238
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:45,240
We went to this old school when
the oldest restaurants in, um,

239
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,010
and a Hollywood on Hollywood boulevard.

240
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
Got It. I got a great steak, uh,

241
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,380
split it with Nia and Joe got this
fucking prime rib that I'm telling you,

242
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,310
dude was like, I know that people
always say the Flintstones.

243
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,890
It was fucking gigantic. And I
looked at it and he goes, dude,

244
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,600
you gotta try it man. This
is amazing. I was like, wow.

245
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,670
And I looked down and I swear to God,

246
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:13,000
it felt like six minutes later and I
looked up and he was like down to the last

247
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:15,280
two bites.
I mean,

248
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:19,750
did they take the kids and animal 40
years old is no slowing them down.

249
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,460
And then we ended up at
the American Legion and um,

250
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,310
yeah. And I don't remember much after
that. I remember I, I got him a cake,

251
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,670
you know, that's said a bunch of
horrible things about them on it.

252
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,700
And next thing you know,

253
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,280
I was sitting in something that sort
of resembled a tree fort or like a band

254
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,620
stand kind of thing outside in the parking
lot with like nine other people that

255
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:46,880
I don't even know where they came from.

256
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:50,270
And we were all smoking cigars
and then I did the Irish goodbye.

257
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,670
Um, somebody called me an Uber and
that was it. But you know what?

258
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:58,520
I'm right back on it though. You know,
every once in a while you know, you don't,

259
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,930
you gotta, you gotta fucking slap you
liver ramp, let it know who's boss. Okay.

260
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,690
Then other than that, you know, you
take, you take care of it. You know,

261
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,890
I have an abusive relationship with
my, with my liver, but, uh, anyways,

262
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:14,350
I'm out here, uh, doing red

to eat out here. If you guys know, um,

264

265
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,370

Yeah. This everything, but those,

286
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,330
what does those fucking creepy things the
girls used to hold and they would skip

287
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:47,330
around a little girls and the playground.
Okay, here we go. Round the fucking day.

288
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
The fuck could they wonder, was it called
the Mayberry at the Mayberry Bush? No,

289
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,790
they just, you know, that's back when
they didn't let women do anything.

290
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,260
So like that was their idea of playing.

291
00:16:56,261 --> 00:17:00,710
You just grab on this string and you guys
skip around. Yeah. You know what I mean?

292
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,480
Why we're fucking guys are playing sports.

293
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,840
Trying to figure out each other's
weaknesses. I guess women were doing that,

294
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,980
but on a different level. Right.
I bet she doesn't like her nose.

295
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:13,550
I'm going to say something
about that. Um, I'm sorry.

296
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,240
I'm still, uh, I'm still fucking
shit. What do you want from me?

297
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,980
I slept on a fucking, I mean,
you know what I, by the way,

298
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:20,390
I don't even know what
the fuck I slept in.

299
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,860
He's got Damn Carson and they all
looked the same and then I don't,

300
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,610
their logos are so
fucking like jazzy. I can,

301
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,660
you know the Honda used to just
be a fucking age. Yeah, isn't it?

302
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:38,210
So the fucking shit that I get upset about
it. It's just so stupid. Really value.

303
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,330
Well, why don't you just fucking go
on the Internet and look them up?

304
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,720
What are they supposed to have the
same logo for the rest of the law? I,

305
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:47,290
fair enough. Hey, fair
enough. Fair enough.

306
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,210
They've got freckles. Needs
fucking meditate here. Um, anyways,

307
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,890
how about those five of those red socks,
Huh?

308
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,190
Yeah.

309
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,640
Just tearing through the bottom
part of the fucking league.

310
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,560
The real test comes this weekend when
they play the ag right where we were with

311
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,200
you. She'll be again. Now it isn't,

312
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,160
it all ended in 2004 but it's still fun,
right?

313
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,270
The baby bombers first to
fucking $200 million Red Sox,

314
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,160
all the dealer that,
you know what?

315
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,340
I Bet America would be rooting
for the Yankees. You know,

316
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:23,730
they created all of this shit.
You know,

317
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,420
you know what the Yankees are? They're
like, dude, fucking the bad influence.

318
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:32,530
Older brother, you know who did
well and like, you know, uh,

319
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,410
preschool,
elementary,

320
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,750
right through middle school and then
somewhere in high school just start,

321
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,130
just went off the fucking rails.

322
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,150
And then the red socks.

323
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,650
I like the next brother who had
the fucking try to outdo him.

324
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,810
That's what we're doing.
We went right over the cliff.

325
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:52,360
Now spend it too and fucking
million dollars. 200 million.

326
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:57,250
God Damn Doll was the middle child,
the fucking middle child.

327
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,930
Um,
but anyways,

328
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,920
we went nine and one in the last 10 games
were up for games on the Yankees over

329
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:05,200
there.
Thank you to the Tampa Bay devil rays.

330
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm still calling you the
devil race instead of the race.

331
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,620
Ray's Pizza,

332
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,760
Ray Romano. Come on, right.

333
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,540
What are you, you're the devil race. Um,

334
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,350
that's gotta be one of the,
like,

335
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,190
that's one of another thing goes back
to that Colin Kaepernick thing. Like,

336
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:27,690
it's a fucking,
it's just,

337
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,290
it's a corporation is everybody
tries to put race on it.

338
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,560
At the end of the day it's a fucking
corporation and that's what it is.

339
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,990
All they have to do is look
at the Tampa Bay devil rays.

340
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,310
There was probably nine Jesus freaks
that weren't going to buy a fucking devil

341
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:46,311
rays tee shirt and God forbid they lose
that fucking hundred and 60 bucks or

342
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:50,070
whatever, whatever, whatever, 180
bucks or 20 bucks a whack, right?

343
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,310
God forbid that that goes out the door.

344
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,730
They take the fuck they
took the devil right off it.

345
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,480
We're losing our a Jesus Freak,
a fan base.

346
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,770
You know, and I think that's what the
NFL is doing with Colin Kaepernick.

347
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,900
God forbid they lose the racist dollar.
That's what it is.

348
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,130
They are catering to the racist by not
putting this guy on cause they don't want

349
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:22,131
to lose cause a racist dollars are also
green and that's all they give a shit

350
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:26,940
about. Right. They don't give a fuck.
Look at the fucking Goddamn Tigers.

351
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,450
They're gonna fingerprint
their own fucking fence.

352
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,370
What do you think those
tigers front office is going
to do with that information?

353
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:36,930
Where do you think they're
going to sell that?

354
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,150
Do you know what? This is the
thing, most people, I swear to God,

355
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:47,040
I hate to be this cynical,
but they just,

356
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,070
they just fucking go into life and they're
looking for like someone else to fill

357
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,090
the role of their parents. And that's
why the micro chipping the fingerprints,

358
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:59,170
all of that will be inevitable because
there's so many people who should be

359
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:03,640
walking around wearing a fucking diaper.
I hate to say, but they do, you know,

360
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,830
oh, he's crying. Life fucked
me over there. You know what?

361
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,770
I'm going to start to sell it. I'm going
to start selling adult size rattles

362
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,970
as I sit here whining and crying about
sports, I got a lot of fucking nerve.

363
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,900
You know, that's one of the great things
about me. I'm a God damn hypocrite. Hey,

364
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:23,700
guess what? I got to, I got a, uh,

365
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,730
I've got a Gopro for my birthday last
year and I finally had Andrew come over

366
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:31,680
and show me how to fucking
get the thing going.

367
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:34,440
I just saw the wires and the
small printing. I just like,

368
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:37,710
I'm never going to figure that out.
I can't get it out of the case.

369
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,260
I actually got this thing to film
when I was flying, uh, you know,

370
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,500
the helicopter and uh, I got all
the shit that I needed and I just,

371
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,570
I don't know. Oh, I know.

372
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:52,470
I fucked up my back last year
so I couldn't fly because
my feet were going numb

373
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:53,400
there.
Yeah.

374
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,343
MMM.

375
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,440
So anyways, I, let me, let me
read a little bit of advertising.

376
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,590
Can we try to gracefully get out of this?
Um,

377
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,590
I feel bad about that Sklar podcast
cause I think they thought I really got

378
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:06,010
upset. It's just, I don't think they
know me well enough to be like, no,

379
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:09,310
that's just kinda how the fuck I get
when I talk about sports to somebody's

380
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,810
bugging me in two seconds later,

381
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,880
you know, it's, it's gone. You know,

382
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,210
it will come back, but I mean,
it's gone. It's over. All

400
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,660
I went to one of those Lord of the
Rings, I swear to God, I thought it,

401
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,200
I thought the movie was over like 19
times. It kept fading down. I'm like, oh,

402
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,600

mega crate. There must be a mega
church. Come on down to a mega church.

415
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,270
I was listening to Joel Olsteen
on the way over here, you know,

416
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,850
and he's like the Pied
Piper of fucking losers.

417
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,450
He's always talking about people
losing in life. You know what I mean?

418
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:32,290
It's like they'll do any winners.
Go to your church. He's always like,

419
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:36,790
I know you fucking, I know. Uh, I know
your plumbing doesn't work. I know this.

420
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:41,200
Does he? He know, but God wants you. God
wants you to have working water. Blink,

421
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:44,110
blink, blink, blink, blink, blink,
blink. All right, lift everybody.

422
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Lyft knows that their drivers are
what keeps them moving on Jesus.

423
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,550
And why weren't they had a
meeting to figure that out.

424
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,540
So they do everything they can to make
sure that drivers are happy on every trip.

425
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,160
Lyft was the first to order in APP
tipping. When you drive for lip,

426
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:01,930
you keep 100% of the tips.

427
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,100
Drivers had been paid over $200 million
in tips since the feature was introduced.

428
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:09,670
That's really great though. You know,
that's like that Guy Papa John's pizza.

429
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:14,090
I was watching that. Jay Leno, Jay
Jay's garage, and that guy, uh,

430
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,960
the guy who does the Papa John's pizzas,
you know,

431
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,300
he had to sell his car to
keep his dad's bar going.

432
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:23,140
He was making the pizza in
the back in 1971 Camaro.

433
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:27,160
Z 28 gold with the black
stripes and he fucked 20 years,

434
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,190
was looking for the car track
down the exact fucking car.

435
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,770
But he's talking about it like
30% of the profits he brings.

436
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:35,440
He puts back into the business
as far as like, you know,

437
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,240
given bonuses to all of us employees.

438
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,460
I don't know why more
corporations don't do that.

439
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,893
You know,

440
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,750
why don't you do that? They then
people are happy to work for you.

441
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,120
And then when I walk
into but order a pizza,

442
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:50,670
I don't get some grumpy ass
holes getting fucked over.

443
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,240
Yeah.

444
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,930
Who knows? I don't know why
the same reason why they
won't sign Colin Kaepernick.

445
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,501
Uh,

446
00:25:56,501 --> 00:26:01,360
express pay lets drivers get paid almost
instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

447
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,940
Lyft has even taken the
guesswork out of pickups.

448
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,290
The new amp device uses color coding
to help passengers find their drivers.

449
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,010
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week
plus tips what are and more money drive

450
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:15,820
more. It's never been easier to give
yourself a raise. It's a simple formula.

451
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:17,530
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

452
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:21,360
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft
rides get a perfect five star ratings.

453
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:24,610
So join the ride sharing company that

when was coming up as a comedian,

459
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:45,630
there's no fucking way I
wouldn't have done that.

460
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,620
I absolutely would have done that
during the fucking day. I do it now.

461
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:53,910
I do it at night. We funny

the back seat of your car.

463
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,133
Uh,

464
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,230
I don't know. I would actually get into
that job. Play some good tunes, you know,

completely done online.

00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:22,810
Like these usually
retails for $1,200 really?

485
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,950
But at the be black Tux
they started just 95 bucks.

486
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,500
You're telling me you can do some.

487
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,490

for 90 it starts at 95

488
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,350

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,610
I got a cramp in my foot. Ah, Jesus.

521
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,220
Okay.

522
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,280
Fucking Christ. All right, it's gone away.

523
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,440
It's gone away. It's part of being
old right there. You know, by the way,

524
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:48,200
anytime you get a cramping, like if you
ever bring your toes back towards you,

525
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:50,780
you know, you stretch in the morning, she
started pointing your toes, your face,

526
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:54,590
and you've legs cramp up immediately.
Just point your toes the other way.

527
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,424
It goes right away.

528
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,970
All right?

529
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:02,620
You don't have to sit there
going, fuck, fuck. You know,

530
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,040

534
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,760
That's dollar shave club.com/bar.
Now,

535
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:21,870
from what I've been told, the reason
why that is getting back to the, uh,

536
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:26,440
the cramping in your legs. All
right? If you go the other way is, is

537
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,650
it's sorta like a ying and a Yang.
You know what I mean?

538
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:33,640
The muscles on the front of your body
versus the back of your body. Like I,

539
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,170
my shoulders got fucked up
cause I was doing pushups,

540
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,030
I was doing curls out doing and all that,

541
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,650
but I wasn't doing enough back exercises.

542
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:43,310
So my shoulders started rolling
forward. All right, there's a balance.

543
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,870
So whatever the fuck you do, I don't
know medically what happens, but if you,

544
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,000
you do the exact opposite motion,
when you get that cramp,

545
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:54,710
it fucking whatever is tightening
up, then release this. Now you go.

546
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,570
And you know what,
after I tried to explain it,

547
00:31:56,571 --> 00:32:00,260
you're no closer to understanding
it. Okay? I'm all, by the way,

548
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:04,490
I did the gym Jeffrey show this week. Uh,
I'll put, I'll tweet out a link for that.

549
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,640
Um, I had a great time on that. What
a great interviewer he is. You know,

550
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:11,720
I didn't know how that was going to
go to fucking Comedians, you know,

551
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,530
was shit that they want to say. I was, uh,

552
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,240
I felt like I do when I'm on Conan.

553
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,160
Conan is like an old school Johnny Carson
guy where it's like if you're killing,

554
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,820
he lets you go. He laughs at your
jokes. He makes you look great.

555
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,210
If you start struggling,
he comes to the rescue,

556
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,590
right.
And um,

557
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,740
Jim Jefferies was the exact same way.
Old School fucking guy.

558
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:40,820
So a highly recommend that show.
Um,

559
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,790
dude, he was killing,
he was killing so hard,

560
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,610
like even just doing like some stuff
where he was just doing like a, hey,

561
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,430
Seattle watched the show, blah, blah,
blah, whatever you call those things.

562
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,260
He was killing so hard when
he was just messing those up.

563
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,860
Like just constantly was killing that.

564
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:01,760
I was standing backstage like laughing,
thinking like, this guy doesn't need me,

565
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,950
really doesn't need me as a guy.
You appreciate him having a yard.

566
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,800
But he really could have just done
this by himself. He really is. Um,

567
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,540
you know, when you go see Jim
Jeffries, I mean, I'm, I'm not,

568
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,350
I don't think I'm bullshitting when
I would say that guy's probably cause

569
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:22,700
everybody's top five, top three, you
know, that's always arguable. You know,

570
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,270
you can argue you to whoever you think
is the best. He's without a doubt.

571
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,130
I would say top three
in the fucking world.

572
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,320
He's like one of the best comedians
in the fucking world. It's,

573
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,700
that's the real deal. So a
checkout his show, please come out.

574
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:37,690
There's still a few tickets
left for a Paul [inaudible],

575
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,250
a special and Gera. But
bubba, Bubba, Bubba,

576
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,190
bubba above the 33 minutes. Okay,
please enjoy this music here. Um,

577
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,230
I'm going to try out my GoPro.

578
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,270
I'm very excited to try this thing
out to see what comes about this.

579
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,380
And um,

580
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,820
I've been threatening to do a show
of me driving around freaking out.

581
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:02,091
I don't need,

582
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:04,640
don't know if I need to put that out there
anymore with me fucking freaking out.

583
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:08,180
I do it enough on podcasts and shit, but
uh, we'll see. We'll see where it goes.

584
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:13,181
So enjoy this music as we transition
into a Thursday afternoon podcasts from a

585
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:19,460
Thursday from, I don't know
when a joy it and uh, hey,

586
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,980
shout out to Darren King and,

587
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,030
and the unbelievable drumming that he
did when he was with mute math and good

588
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:30,710
luck to him and all of his future
projects and good luck to mute math,

589
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,090
um, on their upcoming tour. Um,

590
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,240
I forget the drama is named Dave
Hutchinson or something like that.

591
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,210
They got to replace Darren King,
uh,

592
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,960
mute mass new album is coming out in
September. I've already preordered it.

593
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:48,140
Very excited,
very excited to see them on this tour.

594
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:52,170
And very excited to see what
Darren's going to be doing, um,

595
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,380
with whatever his next project
is. A, that's it. Okay.
Thank you guys for listening.

596
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,300
Have a great weekend. You concern,
I'll, uh, I'll talk to you on Monday.

597
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,433
I Dunno.

598
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,850
All over the map. That's why like, you
know, certain ways of looking at shit,

599
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,190
like when people

600
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,080
talk about guns,
like let's just make them what,

601
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:44,430
let's just make them illegal as
a no, we all have them. You know,

602
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,310
like that's sort of like
thought process is your,

603
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,340
you're acting as though the world is a
utopia and that there's not morons and

604
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:57,480
that there's not, uh, people who say,
I don't give a fuck what the rules are.

605
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:02,481
You're totally not even
taking into consideration
sociopath's which is why that

606
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,770
new fucking thing that Obama signed,

607
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:09,490
that whole defense package where now they
can just arrest people without a trial

608
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,030
and put you in jail forever with,

609
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,910
without a trial because they just
think you're a fucking terrorist.

610
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,970
You can't give people that level of power.

611
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,380
I'm a fucking moron. And I know
you can't do that. Historically,

612
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,320
no one has ever handled
that level of power. Well,

613
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,950
anybody here want to go live in China
and now we out there practicing your nun

614
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:33,270
chucks wearing your wooden slippers and
all of a sudden the van pulls up and you

615
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,630
disappear and that's it. Forever. You
want to live there? Of course you don't.

616
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,330
You want to live here where they can't
fucking do it. Well, they can do it now.

617
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,190
You know? They just put in a fucking
order for a bunch of black fans.

618
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,420
That's what I heard. According to Holy
shit.com that's what's going down.

619
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,780
I don't understand why stuff at that
level that affects citizens to that level.

620
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,630
Why we don't get to vote on it.

621
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,450
Do you think it's because we'd
say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that.

622
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,870
Do you want me to stand like
that is just a jump off point.

623
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:08,430
Do you think like that's
just how it's going to stall?

624
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,340
As long as you're not a terrorist
in there, you ain't got to fuck bro.

625
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,770
You think it's just
going to stop with that.

626
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,110
That's not how you take away freedom.

627
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,380
You don't just fucking do it all in
one fell swoop. It's incremental.

628
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,530
It's just like when you're dating some
fucking woman and you're not paying

629
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,860
attention and she just gradually, every
day it takes another foot of real estate.

630
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,900
Next thing you know you're
in goal line d going,

631
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:32,580
how the fuck did I end up in
this situation? We started
at the 50 a little push,

632
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:35,510
a little poll, right? Everything was
fine. Seen all Europe against the Golan.

633
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,130
The you think that they're just going
to keep it with the terrorist thing,

634
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,660
you know?

635
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,410
You know they'll wait for a whole nother
generation of babies to be born and

636
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:46,740
they always grew up with government having
that level of power and then they had

637
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:49,860
something else to it. Then they
had something else. Then that's it.

638
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,040
You can't have it.
Okay.

639
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,110
If Tiger Woods can't handle the
level of free pussy on a golf tour,

640
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,560
how the fuck is our government going
to handle a new defense package?

641
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:09,840
Which basically gave them a mute
button when you love to, hey,

642
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,290
how would you handle that if
you had that power, do you,

643
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,350
how long before you just
started abusing that?

644
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:21,030
If you could just hit mute on anybody
who ever disagreed with you and it just,

645
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,920
and you could have them whisked away.

646
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,540
I mean that is the sociopath's wet dream.

647
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,030
That's what that is. That is a
fucking mute button, Mr Style and

648
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,780
don't you think that's it?

649
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,530
He hit mute. You're done.
You're gone. See Ya. I think,

650
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,790
I think it's fucking insane and I'm,

651
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:52,130
the only thing that I get out of it is
that I feel like I was proven correct

652
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,040
that I don't think it
matters at that level.

653
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:59,600
Whether you vote Democrat or Republican
Obama, the first black president ever,

654
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:04,601
you would think this would be the most
liberal a politician in the history of

655
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:06,284
this country.

656
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,660
Okay.

657
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,750
Because of his background. You would
think that he signed off on that shit.

658
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,510
All right. I'm telling you, I don't know
what happens when you become president,

659
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:20,890
but I think they let you peek just
enough behind the curtain and you there,

660
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,680
there is

661
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,800
fucking agenda that we are
moving towards because it does,

662
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,440
I don't think it fucking matters.
I really don't,

663
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:32,750
which is why I always
vote for the Ralph Nader,

664
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,830
the fuck and Ron Paul, all those guys
that all those fucking idiots go.

665
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,630
Oh do cause you did that. You've
ruined the election. Really?

666
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,063
Did I?

667
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,280
Okay.

668
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,980
I feel like those guys wouldn't
have signed shit like that.

669
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,430
I feel like their track record shows
that they would not sign shit like that.

670
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,970
Um, I, I don't know.

671
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,960
I have no, I imagine I'm going to get
a ton of fucking emails I'm on with.

672
00:39:57,961 --> 00:40:01,410
Somebody was yelling at me one time saying
that because I voted for Ralph Nader

673
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,260
in 2000.
That's why George W.

674
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,790
Bush won and they just going on and on
and on about it. And I was like, dude,

675
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:13,650
I live in New York. Al
Gore won my state. Okay.

676
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,210
Do you understand that? So
your whole fucking theory
right now is out the window.

677
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,680
I voted for Ralph Nader in New York
and Al Gore still won the state.

678
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,030
So go fuck yourself. What
I'm trying to do, uh,

679
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,940
missed a fucking red and blue tie here.

680
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm trying to fucking encourage
more people like that devote.

681
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:37,590
So mission accomplished. That's what I'm
trying to fuck and have to vote to run,

682
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,833
you know.

683
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,460
Uncorruptible how far can you get if
you're uncorruptible I would say that you

684
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,140
can get to the uh,

685
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,780
or whatever level politics is when you
decide whether or not they should put a

686
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:59,770
gazebo in the center of town.
I think beat, once you get
beyond that, you got it.

687
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:01,080
You got to be a little dirty.
Right.

688
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:06,240
I love talking about this shit cause
it just stirs people up, you know?

689
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,530
Um,
you know,

690
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,550
maybe you should all read a little more
before the next time you took an ohm.

691
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,220
Really? What are you reading? What
are you reading? What they give you?

692
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,780
Is that what you're reading?
Fuck head.

693
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,960
Why you acting like you have clearance
to the bottom floors of the fucking

694
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:26,490
Pentagon? You're guessing? Just
like I am. All right, Mr. Informed,

695
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:31,140
I read the pamphlet,
I don't buy a fucking word of it.

696
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,423
You know,

697
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,850
you can use coca cola to take rust
off of metal. You can use it for that.

698
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,713
You know,

699
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,090
you understand that yet they're
still able to sell it to us.

700
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:46,050
Like it's refreshing.

701
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,120
I don't know what that point meant either.

702
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,323
Okay.

703
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,523
Okay.

704
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:04,910
Hey,
what's going on?

705
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:08,340
It's bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

706
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,930
August the 10th 2009 that I'm
actually doing on Tuesday,

707
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,670
August the 11th,

708
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,230
because a DHS wasn't
enough hours in the day.

709
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,280
Oh my God, I got south swamps. No,
I did. I don't know what happened.

710
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,950
I know what happened.
I had a big audition for something and uh,

711
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,230
I had to just keep doing the
audition over and over again.

712
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,990
And when I wasn't doing that,
I was curled up in the fetal position.

713
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:37,530
Go and please bill, don't fuck
this up. This is a big opportunity.

714
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,880
And fortunately I did not,

715
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,220
whether they pick me a knot
is out of my hands, but, um,

716
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,750
and then I just said
a bunch of other shit.

717
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:49,950
Why does it sound like it's
echoing in here? I Dunno.

718
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,820
I'm trying a new recording level,
uh, this week by the way, people,

719
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:56,250
I don't know if the quality's
going to suffer, but, um,

720
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:02,010
I had a number of people and by
a number, I mean like six, um,

721
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,650
which I think is about one third of
my listeners. So it was big to me. Uh,

722
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,590
we're saying that a, I needed to get more
bandwidth or I needed to do something.

723
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:14,730
Basically they couldn't download my,
uh,

724
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,310
my podcast off of iTunes or whatever.

725
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:22,200
And somebody finally called it to my
attention that I was recording at music

726
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,190
level quality.

727
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:28,220
So my files were huge and considering
that I wasn't recording musical

728
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:33,030
instruments that I could actually record
at a lower and they would be smaller

729
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:37,620
files thus easier to download. So I
said, I know what I'm going to do.

730
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,270
Okay.

731
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,870
I'm going to fucking go find the owner's
manual and I'm going to figure out how

732
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:46,790
to do that. And, uh, even
though I have a little file,

733
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:50,900
it'll little fucking a big piece of
Tupperware. Whatever the fuck you call it,

734
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,630
big plastic bin that's going to
be here 9,000 years from now.

735
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,000
Um,

736
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,520
I have all my owner's
manuals for everything I ever
bought except for my Olympus

737
00:45:00,521 --> 00:45:02,300
ls 10.
I don't know where the fuck it is.

738
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:07,301
So I just went into menu and I put it
on MP three and I'm recording at 128

739
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,080
fucking killer. What's a, what's a
white's? Whatever the fuck you call him.

740
00:45:12,081 --> 00:45:14,510
I don't know what the, I don't know what
it is. So I'm going to try it this week.

741
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,780
So you guys give me a feedback,
let me know how the quality sounds.

742
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,170
Was it easier to download?
Was it harder to download?

743
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,120
Was it the same?
Was it just a futile fucking attempt?

744
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,020
Um, anyways, he almost hit a
bad bit, right? They're like,

745
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,220
why is it that you can find everything
move of who you're looking for?

746
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:40,200
Um, all right. I got a lot of stories for
you. Why this week? Let's start off with,

747
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,550
I had a, uh, you know,

748
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:46,380
I had a nice district cremant this
morning was somebody in particular and I

749
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:51,381
realized in that fight that the
secret to success is basically,

750
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:55,530
I mean, I'm sure somebody
is already written a book
about this, but I don't read.

751
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,310
So I'm feeling like I'm
breaking new ground here.

752
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:04,311
The secret to success in life
is the word yes and the word no.

753
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,380
That is it. If you want to be a
happy person, if somebody says,

754
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:15,060
do you want to do this shit
and you want to do it? Say yes,

755
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,670
yes I do. And then if they're like,
but do you want to do this shit?

756
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,760
And you don't say, no, I don't.

757
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,680
Now I know that sounds simple,
but it's afterwards.

758
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,120
That is the hard part.

759
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,240
And I feel as the reason
why so many people say yes
when they mean no and vice a

760
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:40,250
versa is because basically the
fucking reaction of the other person,

761
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,330
you have to just completely
block out their reaction.

762
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,810
You know? Do you want
to do this? No, I don't.

763
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,150
Usually when you say no negative,
don't want to do it,

764
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:58,070
the other person is just like,
why? Why don't you want to do it?

765
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,210
I thought it'd be fun.
I thought we could do it together.

766
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:05,270
I thought it would be a choice of,
well, why don't you want to do it?

767
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,450
Because you asked me and the
first fucking thing in me,

768
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:16,340
wherever that voice in me said,
no, I don't want to do it.

769
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:20,990
So then I said no, right. I
heard what you said, Glen,

770
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,980
and I am going to fucking speak
it out loud. So this other person,

771
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:27,490
because they can't hear my inner
voice. No, the answer is no.

772
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,930
And then they always go,
you're ridiculous. You
just, you just being a jerk.

773
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,430
You're being crazy. Really? Is
that what my inner voice is a jerk?

774
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,480
You know how many French I want to ask
you guys is how many friendships in your

775
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:44,500
life do you have right now where,
uh, you can actually say, no,

776
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:47,860
I don't want to do that shit. And the
other person's cool with it. You know,

777
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,260
people will give you a little bit of
grief but you gotta be careful because a

778
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:53,720
lot of times there's a lot
of concern out there and uh,

779
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,660
how they deem somebody,

780
00:47:55,661 --> 00:48:00,400
a friend is basically that they do
everything that they want them to do.

781
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,820
You know, and then the second
you start going, hey, you know,

782
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:06,040
I really don't feel like doing that stuff,
dude.

783
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:09,640
You changed what the fucks with you.
God, go fuck yourself. You're a cunt.

784
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,540
All right.
What do you,

785
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:14,350
what do you think you're perfect
and you always have the best idea.

786
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:17,560
Go Fuck Yourself. I don't want to do
what you want to do right now. You know,

787
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,090
I just got a big God
damn argument because uh,

788
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,751
I want to flip to find,

789
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,800
I went the fuck it was about as
far as I was trying to tell me.

790
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,860
I never want to fucking do anything.
I mean I've worn a door.

791
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:34,570
Anything I want to do my Monday morning
podcast you saying that's nothing. Okay.

792
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,480
Cause if you are, I'll tell you,
I got 18 listeners. You have to,

793
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,980
you have to fucking talk to buddy.
What was, that's all I'm saying.

794
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,430
All right? Somebody asked you if you want
to do something, if you want to do it,

795
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:49,150
say yes. If you don't want to do with
say now, okay and fuck their reaction,

796
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,140
unless they can kick the shit out of
you, at which point you say, yeah,

797
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,680
I'd love to. And then you sort of mutter
to yourself the rest of the evening,

798
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,780
and then what you do is on the side,
you start taking some martial art classes,

799
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,580
either that or you call a moving company
that can pack up all your shit and move

800
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:13,960
it to another state while other person
who can kick the shit out of you.

801
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,930
Is it work? That's how you do it. Okay?

802
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,170
There's nothing wrong. I think
the word coward is overused. Um,

803
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,790
you know,

804
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,640
and I think it's used by the person
who wanted to kick the shit out of you,

805
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:31,570
but you were smart enough not to be
in the vicinity of them, to let them,

806
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,150
you're know how you work,

807
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:38,020
how you didn't let me fucking smash your
face into your fucking ear. You Coward.

808
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,780
Well, you know, Dude, uh, I
listened to my inner voice.

809
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,530
Men or voice did not want my nose over
by my ear, so I decided to avoid it.

810
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,810
Yes. You know, you are stronger than me.
You can kick the shit out of me. Okay.

811
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,390
But you know, that doesn't mean I'm
not better at checkers. You know,

812
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,253
there's something,

813
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:01,210
this is a subject you can pick then
I'm better at it than you, but it may,

814
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,330
maybe fighting's not one
of them. Why does it? Oh,

815
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:06,790
that's what it always comes
down to with guys. You know,

816
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:11,770
in the end I can beat the fuck out of you.
So therefore I'm right.

817
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,760
You know. Oh Jesus, I'm getting deep
here. Isn't that how the world works?

818
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,410
Mine is right. Isn't that what? Oh,

819
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,610
is not how everybody's
foreign policy works.

820
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,270
You fucking seeing other country and
they have some shit that you want.

821
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:28,940
So what do you do? Do you say,
hey, how's it going? How are you?

822
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,940
Maybe do that beginning just so that
you can get within fucking striking

823
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:35,210
distance and then you grab him by the
front of the a button down. You know,

824
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:36,740
when you sort of lift
them up off the ground,

825
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,840
so part of their shirt
is obscuring their view.

826
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,310
So they don't see the overhand right
coming. Isn't that what we do? Isn't it?

827
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,640
I don't fucking know. You
know, I was watching our,

828
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:50,000
the bill Maher show the other day and
he was, uh, yesterday actually, and um,

829
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,690
at the end of the show he was giving
out these statistics and he was saying

830
00:50:55,971 --> 00:51:00,920
stuff like, uh, he's basically talking
about how fucking stupid Americans are,

831
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,980
which I'm really getting tired of that,
you know,

832
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,670
I'm not saying we're not fucking stupid,
I'm just like, as compared to who,

833
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,990
you know, I've, you know, I haven't
traveled to a lot of places,

834
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:16,470
but I've been to some places that were
not flying the American flag and there's

835
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:21,230
just as many fucking morons,
you know, if everybody's smart,

836
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:25,160
then there's no smart guys. You're
just regular, you know what I mean?

837
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,500
Jesus. Wow. Bill, that was fucking
deep. Fuck you. Fuck you want from me?

838
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,290
I'm just saying, you know what I mean?
So anyways, here he's doing this poll.

839
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,880
Actually,
I actually really liked his show.

840
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,640
One of the things I love
about Bill Maher is, uh,

841
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:42,200
he's not really likable and he doesn't
seem to give a fuck. And you know,

842
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,600
I mean,
yeah,

843
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,940
I mean does that the kind of person
you want to have over for dinner?

844
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:51,770
Probably not, but, uh, that's
a good recipe for getting
a lot of pussy in life. Um,

845
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:56,000
well we'll discuss that
later. Um, plowing ahead here.

846
00:51:56,001 --> 00:52:00,620
So he starts doing all these polls and
he's sitting there going, you know,

847
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:05,621
18% only 18% of Americans
could name a new,

848
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:11,671
Oh knew that there was two senators for
every state and a only 11% could name

849
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:15,590
who are,
you know,

850
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,520
so immediately that's supposed to
make it seem like everybody's dumb.

851
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,150
And my first thought was, okay, 18%

852
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,160
can know that you get two senators
per state, but I bet you know,

853
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:32,600
a good 28% could explain the
cover two defense. You know,

854
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,670
it just depends on what
the fuck you're into.

855
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:38,090
I like when people are really into
something and you're not into it.

856
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,650
And then they consider you stupid.

857
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:44,480
Make granted we are talking about the
people who determine how we live our

858
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:47,990
lives. Actually they don't.
That's the illusion. You know,

859
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,970
it's the fucking bankers. Okay. They
run everything, man. I'm telling,

860
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,980
I'm not going to do that again this week
and embarrass myself with my incredible

861
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,490
lack of knowledge, but you know, whatever.

862
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,810
I just don't think people are
as fucking dumb as they're lazy,

863
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,560
you know? But the way that they
really just depict people out there,

864
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,190
like people are just walking around
with their fucking mouths hanging open,

865
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,460
not realizing that they're drooling.
All of the,

866
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,900
all over the front of their Kenny Chesney
shirt. And I, you know, Kenny Chesney is,

867
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:22,280
I mean,
I know he's a country singer.

868
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,370
Who was that the one who was married to
that chick who's fucking face squints up

869
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:29,130
whenever she smiles.
Yeah.

870
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,480
And they were married for like three days
ball dude. Is that who the fuck it is?

871
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:38,280
Huh? I don't know. I can't stand
country music. It's just depressing.

872
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,860
It's depressing and it's Geeky

873
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:46,630
and everybody sings like they, they're
in puberty. There you go. That was nice.

874
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:47,620
Generalizations.
Huh?

875
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,800
Ooh,

876
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,510
that shit.
I can't fucking stay on that.

877
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,110
And I don't like rednecks blind
pride in being an American,

878
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,873
you know,

879
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,400
cause it always involves sticking a boot
up somebody's ass or whatever the fuck.

880
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,950
It's just like, why can't you be
here and just be happy, you know,

881
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,660
and watch to a fucking farming equipments.

882
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:19,670
Try to pull in opposite directions as
you fucking rare your head back and

883
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:24,180
fucking scream at the moon.
There's nothing wrong with that.

884
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,840
Fucking nothing wrong with that.
Why do you gotta be so God damn it?

885
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:32,100
Why you gotta be like me and be
angry? Huh? You Straw hat. It can't.

886
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,040
All right. Uh, moving on.
Um, so my dog, uh, is,

887
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:43,020
she's in heat right now cause she
hasn't been fixed and uh, yeah,

888
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,830
it looks like a fucking crime scene here
around here because she's a female and

889
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:49,410
I'm going to leave it at that.
And uh,

890
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:53,160
she scheduled to be a
mutilated later on this month.

891
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,620
That's really what it is. Mutilated.
I'm gonna have my dog mutilated.

892
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,540
I'm against it, but I, I got
tired of arguing about it and,

893
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:10,260
uh, you know, I don't,

894
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:13,860
I don't understand why
you have to have your dog.

895
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:18,300
I just don't fucking get it. You
know, I get it. But you know,

896
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,820
if everybody did what Bob Barker said,

897
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,660
there'd be no more dogs and cats within
15 years because they'd all be spayed or

898
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:27,060
neutered, you know? And since,

899
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:32,061
when does a leathery 90 year old know
anything about fucking animals when his

900
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:37,560
main Gig is to host a fucking game show?
You know,

901
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:41,540
I love how that fat fuck with
the itchy beard, you know,

902
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,850
he gets all shit for his,
oh,

903
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,380
this document I can never met Michael
Moore can never remember people's fucking

904
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:49,740
names. Is that the same guy who, who

905
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:51,691
doesn't?

906
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:56,691
Michael Moore looked like the son of
that other fat dude with the itchy beard,

907
00:55:56,821 --> 00:56:00,310
but it, it's all white.
You know, he sorta,

908
00:56:00,311 --> 00:56:04,180
it looks like in a feminine Santa Claus
and he wears those red glasses and he

909
00:56:04,181 --> 00:56:08,530
writes like Oscar jokes for, uh, uh,

910
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,890
Billy crystal. God, I suck at
names. Billy Crystal. You know,

911
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:13,420
the guy I'm talking about doesn't,

912
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,300
Michael Moore looked like the
son of that fucking guy. Hey,

913
00:56:16,301 --> 00:56:20,080
doesn't this guy who I can't remember
his fucking name look like the other guy

914
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:22,810
who I can't remember his name. That was
really brutal. I apologize for that.

915
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,110
Let's get back to clear off. So clean.
I was doing fucking great, but the only,

916
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,750
I only have one problem with her.
Um,

917
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,440
the main problem with her
is she does not like men.

918
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,760
She doesn't like guys.
Um, unless they come over,

919
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,040
they come over to the house,
you know,

920
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:41,680
we bring them in and they sit down
and she can kind of sniff them out.

921
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:45,430
Then shit is cool.
But when she walks down the street,

922
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,800
um, you know, when guys, second
secondary is based in somebody's voice,

923
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:54,850
she's such freaking out and a,

924
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:58,400
I don't know how to stop her from doing
it. I keep disciplining her, but she,

925
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:02,440
she really blows me off. She blows
me off with that. And squirrels,

926
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,590
you know, she starts dragging
me down the fucking street.

927
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:10,210
I could literally water ski behind this
Goddamn Dog. It's so strong. And, uh,

928
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,170
I know went out to this breakfast
place the other day and you know,

929
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,500
this fucking old lady shows up with
her husband who has osteoporosis.

930
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,700
You know,
if you don't know what that is,

931
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:24,520
you have a see old people who look like
they're fascinated with their feet.

932
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:29,590
You know, that's fucking osteoporosis. So
anyways, he's fucking comes walking in.

933
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:35,010
So he looks at my dog who's totally
chill and he just keeps staring at her in

934
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,330
the eyes and then she
rah Rah Rah Rah Rah Rah.

935
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,470
And then she fucking jumped up at
him. A fucking 90 year old man. Cleo,

936
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:42,400
what's wrong with you

937
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,660
cleo?
Come over here for a second.

938
00:57:45,661 --> 00:57:48,690
Did you could make your debut here on
the Monday morning pocket. Come here.

939
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,400
Come on, get off here. Is there a
fucking reason? Come on, get up here.

940
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,100
Come on.
Is there a reason?

941
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:02,120
Is there a reason why you fucking tried
to kill a 90 year old man the other day?

942
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,730
Huh? That's all you got
to say. Fucking jackass.

943
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,000
She was seen. He jumped right on
off one after the God damn dude.

944
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,550
Just sorta lunged.
Just sorta lunch.

945
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:20,020
This guy is probably a veteran
of world war two. Right. And uh,

946
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,880
then I brought it down and then the
old Eddie goes is ad Pitbull Bay.

947
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,560
They shouldn't be allowed around paper,
you know, and I fucking let it go.

948
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,790
Believe it or not. I did let
it go. I didn't really say
really yield fucking bat.

949
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,760
How did you get here?
How'd you drive down the street?

950
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:38,820
When did you get your fucking
driver's license? Huh?

951
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,670
Do they even have driver's license
when you fucking cranked your first

952
00:58:41,671 --> 00:58:46,110
automobile? Huh? You're wrinkled
up. Pruny little fucking Twat.

953
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,290
I didn't say that. I just sat there. I had
respect. I have respect for all people.

954
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,680
I mean, I think that shit, I just
don't say it. I just sat there.

955
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,790
You know when you do that shit,

956
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,710
when someone's yelling at you
and you can't yell back at them,

957
00:58:55,711 --> 00:58:58,920
you don't look at them and you do
that shit where your lips disappear.

958
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:02,490
When you make that thing,
you'll lips mouth is a straight line.

959
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:06,600
You just sit there nodding, Hey Chad and
bail out of our paper by at night. Right.

960
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,120
Or I'd get around a goddamn
right parking the car.

961
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,060
And I just sat there nodding as
everyone else was looking at her.

962
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:16,590
And then it was funny as hell because
my dog was totally chill until that evil

963
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:20,460
old couple showed up, like on blaming
them now. Right. So I have to,

964
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:24,140
she tells me basically my dog
should not be allowed around people,

965
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:25,820
which is fucking true in a lot of ways.

966
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,030
She walks around the corner and
then there's just some cute little,

967
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:32,360
I want to play Frisbee dog. And the
second they came around the corner,

968
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,130
that dog started freaking out.

969
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:35,830
Okay.

970
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,190
So you know,
maybe it wasn't my dog.

971
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:45,490
Cleo, can you do me a favor? Can you just
not, if you're going to bite somebody,

972
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,820
I'm going to have to go to court.
Okay.

973
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:52,780
And they're probably going to use
this podcast as evidence. You know,

974
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,030
God help me if they abuse his podcast,

975
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,270
he knew what was going to happen
and he called her an old cut.

976
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,680
Now if you could do me a
favor, hey, look at me Cleo.

977
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:09,010
No, fuck you. So just don't make
it somebody old. Give me a chance,

978
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,030
just give me a chance to
maybe win the court case.

979
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,793
Okay.

980
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,790
You liked that? That's what she does.
Want to give her a good scratch.

981
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,110
She starts fucking moment.

982
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,273
Ah,

983
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:26,790
what the fuck am I going to deal with you?

984
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:29,340
How the hell did you show up in my life?
You know what I like about you though?

985
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,650
You don't ask me to do shit
that I don't want to fucking do.

986
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:34,500
And then when I say I don't want to do it,
you don't act all fucking weird.

987
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,170
Like I got a problem. So anyways,
that was my week. That was my weekend.

988
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,900
You know what? I went 20 days
without drinking. And then I,

989
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,730
last night I finally just said,
you know,

990
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:50,580
I actually got scared that eventually
I was, I was gonna have a drink and,

991
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,350
but I, I would have gone like 80 days and
then I, I could never go on a run again.

992
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:59,400
I've tried to be sober because I know I
would never break if I ever went 80 days

993
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:01,620
being sober, there's no fuck
that would be like, you know,

994
01:01:01,621 --> 01:01:04,410
trying to beat Joe Dimaggio's hitting
streak. There's no fucking, it's like,

995
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,850
why even try, you know? So I,

996
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:12,720
I called it quits at 20, and I am
ashamed at what I called it quits with.

997
01:01:12,721 --> 01:01:14,310
I went to this fucking bar and I ordered,

998
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:18,840
went to order a blue moon because I'm
a, I'm a, I'm a snobby cont, you know,

999
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,510
give me a blue moon with little slice of
orange in it and I'll sit here with my

1000
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,930
legs crossed, like I'm selling art.
Right. That's what I wanted to do.

1001
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,630
And uh, they are like, oh
wait, I have, when I have it
here, we're all out all out.

1002
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:36,340
And I was like a corona. Yeah,
we, yeah. No, now you don't,

1003
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:39,870
we don't, we don't have karate. We
don't, not trying to here. All right,

1004
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:40,830
let me get you a list of bears.

1005
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:44,470
And they had their list of beers and then
I ordered a Miller lite. She's like, oh,

1006
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,480
hey Kai. Yeah, you're going to kill me.

1007
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,410
We just ran out of mail at
high and I was like, bitch,

1008
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,020
what the fuck do you have
here? I'm going to say, bitch.

1009
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:58,080
I looked down at the bar and I did sort
of a fucking stupid smile and I was

1010
01:01:59,051 --> 01:01:59,884
like,

1011
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,690
what beers do you have with your
fucking content was underneath it.

1012
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,900
Which is ridiculous because I don't
think she was in charge of ordering it.

1013
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:09,340
She's just in charge of,
you know,

1014
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,300
selling it or whatever it serving it.

1015
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:16,240
That's the worst about having a
public job where you get a job.

1016
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:20,220
Will you deal with the public is most
of the Times it's not your fault.

1017
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:22,110
So not only do you have your job,

1018
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,620
the other part of your job is to get
yelled at for shit that people above you

1019
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,380
did, you know? So anyway,

1020
01:02:29,381 --> 01:02:34,381
so I ordered a fucking Amstel light
and it tasted like ass in out.

1021
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,730
It tasted like somebody rubbed
their armpit on somebody's
ass. That's what a time

1022
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,630
that didn't even fuck it. Make
sense? It just, it didn't taste good.

1023
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,540
And I had one of those and then
I went right back to fucking,

1024
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,710
I went back to coax. I know,
I like it. I like being,

1025
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:56,580
I like going to bars and not
fucking drinking. I cannot.
I'm starting to enjoy it.

1026
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:00,090
And then watching everybody else get
hammered and say dumb shit that they're

1027
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:02,610
going to have to apologize for.
I think I've done that enough in life.

1028
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,680
I've apologized enough times. Have
an eye. All right. And with that,

1029
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:09,240
I'm going to get onto
some hyping some shit.

1030
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:13,290
This has been a damn good podcasts so
far. I feel good. I'm well rested, Huh?

1031
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,620
Isn't that right? Cleo? You liked that?

1032
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,980
Yeah. She fucking love set,
Huh? Right on the rib cage.

1033
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,470
Um, put my dog in a headlock.
You know I do that shit. Come in.

1034
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,590
It's almost like the rear naked choke.
Just like doing it.

1035
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:34,800
Look at that Jesus Christ.
Fucking size of your nipples.

1036
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,560
What kind of message are you
trying to send out there? Huh?

1037
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:41,070
You little whore walking around
trying to get some doggy Dick.

1038
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,730
I've seen you sniffing every
fucking blade of grass.

1039
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:48,360
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
That's not how we raised you. Then again,

1040
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:52,650
you were down by the river for Awhile,
Huh? And Yeah, you were definitely hungry,

1041
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:57,120
but you were reading, Huh? How
did you get all those meals? Cleo?

1042
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,580
How many Douggie Dick's. Did you have
a new man? Right? That's fucking weird.

1043
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,260
All right. Ah, you don't,

1044
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:09,630
I didn't notice about dogs is um,
their,

1045
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:11,400
their front legs,

1046
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:16,450
which are my world are the
arms and the back legs. Uh,

1047
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:19,830
they bend the exact opposite as a humans.
I've never noticed that before.

1048
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,300
You know? Well, I guess down towards
the bottom they do. Now wait a minute.

1049
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:27,420
The front ones do. I'm an idiot. They've
been the same way at the front. Ones do,

1050
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:30,360
but in the same way. All
right, you got me on that one.

1051
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,110
So that's sorta like its wrist and elbow,
but the back legs, that's what it is.

1052
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,380
They're fucking dare a,
their knee,

1053
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:42,140
their knee joint goes the opposite way.
In fact, your fucking look at that. Your,

1054
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:46,640
your Patella is behind your leg.
You see this.

1055
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:49,050
This is why you can't get a
job in the real world. Cleo,

1056
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,200
your fucking knees are on
the wrong side of your legs.

1057
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,370
You know that. Other than that,
you don't have a shirt on.

1058
01:04:56,371 --> 01:05:00,570
You're fucking nipples showing to the
world and you get a job at the circus.

1059
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,910
You know,
I'm not trying to be a dick here,

1060
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:05,310
but why don't you fucking kick him
for some rent? Every once in a while.

1061
01:05:05,311 --> 01:05:08,980
I've got to buy another big
bag of fucking dog food. Look,

1062
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,700
you're just laying there like he can't
hear me. You know what I'm talking about?

1063
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:16,080
Leave your fancy new collar.
G last owners do that.

1064
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:20,020
I don't think so. This is an abusive
relationship here. All right,

1065
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:20,980
let's move on here.
Let's,

1066
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:24,310
let's talk about some shit that
I have that I have going on.

1067
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,400
I don't know why I had to say that
twice that I hit up, that I have. Oh,

1068
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,290
look at that. I'm learning
how to play. Shoot the thrill.

1069
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:33,850
Shoot to thrill the video tutorial.
Anybody out there play a guitar?

1070
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,410
You want to a good youtube,
uh, this, this Guy Solo Dallas.

1071
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,720
He's got all these fucking uh,
ACDC songs.

1072
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:45,970
He shows you how to play
a man. It's a, I dunno.

1073
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,590
And then you can be the hit at your next
party. Such a fucking loser. All right,

1074
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,600
let's get back to what the
hell I was talking about here.

1075
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,310
This is what I got coming up.

1076
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:58,480
You notice how it was a great podcast
until I said it was a great podcast and

1077
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:02,590
now I'm not living up to it. Um, anyways,
this is what I got coming up this week,

1078
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,180
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

1079
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:09,181
I'm going to be at the punchline in
Atlanta and I'm coming up in September.

1080
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:14,300
I'm going to be at the helium comedy
club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Uh,

1081
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,270
September 10th through the 12th.
And I added a date.

1082
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:24,130
I added two dates.
One is for all you California people.

1083
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:25,721
All right.

1084
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:30,310
And I really need you to show up for
this one because the [inaudible] are

1085
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:35,311
basically paying me like fucking $5 in
a new pair of shoe laces because they

1086
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:40,750
don't feel that I can draw out
here in California because,

1087
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:45,010
uh, because I'm a light guy, I think, you
know, not a lot of white guys out here.

1088
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,970
You know, that was my big mistake. I
should've gone out laid in the sun.

1089
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,360
I just would've been all red. It would
have thought it was a native American.

1090
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:54,910
They would've booked me in a fucking
casino. Anyways, I'm gonna be at the, uh,

1091
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:59,770
the Improv in Ontario,
California for four fucking days.

1092
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:02,800
September 17th, 18th, 19th,

1093
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:07,980
and 20th for the love of God could you
and 48 of your closest fucking white,

1094
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:16,000
black, Mexican, Asian,
whatever you can grab,

1095
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:20,080
please bring them out to those
shows because it sucks, man.

1096
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,580
I live out here in la. There's three
clubs that I could be playing, you know,

1097
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:27,340
where I could actually not have
to fucking jump in an airplane.

1098
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:30,580
I want to play Los Angeles area.
I really would like to,

1099
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,650
but I really need you motherfuckers to
show up because if you don't show up,

1100
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,690
I can't play out here any more because
they offer me $5 in a new pair of shoe

1101
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:45,550
laces. Okay. And uh, I said, fuck it.

1102
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,450
I'll do it for that Gig and I'm going
to show that I can draw out here so they

1103
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:53,230
can come out here, you know, and not to
have to get on a plane every fucking week.

1104
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,640
All right.
So I added that date.

1105
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,940
And then the other date that I added
was I added a date and Seattle,

1106
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:02,710
Washington at one of my favorite
clubs, giggles comedy club, uh,

1107
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,620
for December 10th, 11th, and the 12th.

1108
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,720
And I scheduled that around a Seattle
Seahawks home game mother fuckers.

1109
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,920
And when I go to that,

1110
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:17,070
that is going to be my 100th franchise
that I've seen actually not won't be

1111
01:08:17,981 --> 01:08:19,370
because I'm doing the champion problems,

1112
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:24,050
see the Phoenix Suns and I'm going to
come in a day early for Seattle so I can

1113
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:27,440
go to Portland trails trailblazer's
game because I have OCD.

1114
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:32,090
I have to go to all of them. Why do I have
to go to all of them? I don't know why.

1115
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,520
I don't know why.
That's why I do on the plane.

1116
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,930
I sat there and I check them off like
the fucking rain, man. I'm a Weirdo.

1117
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,240
So anyways,
when I go to all of those,

1118
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:45,650
I'll basically have Ben to everything
out here, west of Denver, everything,

1119
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,770
all the way up Edmonton, all of
that shit. I've been to all of them.

1120
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:53,300
And you know what? It hasn't filled
me up a bit. I'm still fucking empty.

1121
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:57,890
All right, that was sad. That was just
sad. Let's get back to, uh, you know what?

1122
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:00,970
I gave you guys some homework last week.
Uh,

1123
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,420
I told you to go out and go see the movie,

1124
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:04,730
the orphan because I wanted
to make fun of that movie,

1125
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:07,610
but I didn't want to ruin it for you.
So if you didn't go and see it,

1126
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,590
that's your own God damn fault.

1127
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,320
And you probably want to fast forward
through the next four minutes of this

1128
01:09:12,321 --> 01:09:14,210
podcast because I want
to talk about this movie.

1129
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:19,150
It's a horror movie that
I, uh, I actually loved.

1130
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:24,440
I loved it even though it kind of stunk.
It was,

1131
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:29,360
it reminded me of a horror
movies from the 1980s.

1132
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,760
And, uh, one of the things that,

1133
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:34,520
there was always the requirement
of is that you had to have,

1134
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,030
oh,
do you hear that alarm?

1135
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:41,580
If I told you what kind of car that was,

1136
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:45,540
it's like a fucking
1988 now it's not that,

1137
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:49,080
and it's probably like a
1991 Honda accord, a site,
you know, it's the classic,

1138
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:50,430
nobody's going to steal that car.

1139
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:55,290
And every time a truck drives by or
somebody says, I don't want to do it.

1140
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,090
And they punch the top of their bureau.

1141
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:01,830
It's sets the fucking alarm often
that God damn car. And uh, I dunno.

1142
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,980
I think it's funny because it's far
enough away where it's not annoying to me.

1143
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:09,450
But I know it's fucking driving somebody
up. The wall is now, right Cleo.

1144
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,940
Huh? As you go to look at me
and she puts her head back down,

1145
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:18,150
she doesn't give a fuck. All
right, so that movie, the orphan,

1146
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,780
if you haven't seen it, if he driven
by any sort of bus stop or anything,

1147
01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:23,910
it's that one that has
that really cycle look,

1148
01:10:23,911 --> 01:10:26,820
an eight year old on it and it says,
uh,

1149
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,290
there's something wrong with the, what
the fuck is her name? It's not ama.

1150
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:35,490
It's one of those old person named Emma,
not Elvira.

1151
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:40,050
Ah, Shit. See that's how my
brain works. Now I'm fucked.

1152
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,270
What the fuck is that little twats name?
There is something wrong.

1153
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,440
Yeah. Christ, whatever it says there's
something wrong with this fucking chick.

1154
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,020
Eight year old girl with an old
person's name. Alright. So you go,

1155
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:58,860
you watch the fucking movie. Basically,
she's an orphan. This couple comes down,

1156
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:02,700
they want to, you know, they want to
adopt a kid for some fucking reason.

1157
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,470
So they picked this girl who is dressed
like she's from the 18 hundreds,

1158
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:12,930
and she has like a piece of thread around
her throat that she won't take off and

1159
01:11:12,931 --> 01:11:17,010
on wrists have few times people try
to remove it at the orphanage and she

1160
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:21,030
completely freaks out, sell the whole
time she's been a fucking psycho.

1161
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,170
She's trying to kill their natural kids.
And um,

1162
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:26,131
you know,

1163
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:29,100
their life was basically fine and
then they get this kid and everything,

1164
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:31,860
you know, the fucking house catches
on fire, all this fucked up stuff.

1165
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:36,330
But one of the requirements of
old school horror movies is,

1166
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:40,810
is you have to have unbelievably
stupid people in it. And um,

1167
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:45,180
I actually, the, the white people
in this movie were so fucking dumb.

1168
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:47,790
I almost got offended.
I almost like wrote a letter.

1169
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,200
It's like they got this giant
tree fort and the dude looks,

1170
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:57,910
he looks out the window and the fucking
thing is engulfed in flames as his

1171
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:02,400
natural son is hanging from
the tree trying not to fall,

1172
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:06,450
which he does and ends up
in intensive fucking care.

1173
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,760
And the fucking wife is
sitting there going like,

1174
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,170
I think there's something wrong with
this fucking chick with the old person

1175
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:16,500
named that dresses like she's in
the 18 hundreds and the kicker,

1176
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:18,630
she has a Transylvanian accent

1177
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:24,030
Ivonne to play the piano. What? I
can't even fucking do it. She's just,

1178
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,600
it's like you're a psycho. Get
the fuck out of my life. Right?

1179
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,580
Then she starts killing people.

1180
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,390
People start disappearing right and
fucking left and they're sitting there,

1181
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:37,730
the cub, Whoa, what's
going on? She's big. So we,

1182
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:43,080
all right. So basically in
the end, what you find out,

1183
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:48,081
what's wrong with the girl is
that she's not eight years old.

1184
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:52,500
She's actually 33 she has,

1185
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:58,800
she has some sort of disease that makes
her look like she's eight and she used

1186
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:03,801
to be in an insane asylum because she
murdered her family and she escaped

1187
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:09,090
somehow from Germany.
She somehow escaped the insane asylum,

1188
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:14,880
got herself in an orphanage with no
fucking passport, no paperwork whatsoever,

1189
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:20,390
got herself into an orphanage in America
and the kicker is she somehow went to a

1190
01:13:21,301 --> 01:13:26,301
dentist who agreed to make her a full
upper and a full lower denture of

1191
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:27,660
children's teeth,

1192
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:35,460
which she pulls out in the end as you're
discovering that she's 33 years old and

1193
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:40,461
then there's little fucking
dwarf middle-age psycho
cunt comes in and somehow is

1194
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:46,090
able to stab to death and adult I,

1195
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,940
it was just the stupidest fucking thing
I was. It was great. It's just a fucking,

1196
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,670
and even though I told you
everything basically that happens,

1197
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,760
it's still a fucking hilarious movie.
It was where it's,

1198
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:58,680
somebody wrote this great email to me.

1199
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:02,370
They were so pissed that I told
him to go see the movie. They said,

1200
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:07,371
I've never been absolutely terrified while
laughing my ass off for 90 minutes in

1201
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:11,920
my entire life.
And that is the experience of the orphan.

1202
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,480
It's just a fucking great stupid movie.
I don't know,

1203
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:19,660
it just reminded me how it
had all the cheesy lines.

1204
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:24,580
She's crawling out of the pond, Mami
Save, you save me. And then she's like,

1205
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:29,160
for the last time I'm
not your fucking mother.

1206
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,140
And then she kicks her right
in her fucking 33 year old,

1207
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:36,580
eight 58 year old face and she goes
back down to the bottom of the pond.

1208
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,220
And I guess that was supposed
to be the applause break,

1209
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,930
which it would have got if it
was still 1984 but whatever,

1210
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:48,460
it's, I know as much as I just
trashed it, it still a good movie.

1211
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,200
I felt bad for the actor playing the
dad in the movie because I just pictured

1212
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:57,580
him in between takes trying to figure
out how he could be that guy and just

1213
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:01,750
looking at the director going sell
basically. My character's a fucking moron,

1214
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,700
right?
So in this seed,

1215
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:08,350
I'm still a moron who can't put
one and one together and get,

1216
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,830
um, maybe, you know,

1217
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:17,170
cause nothing caught on fire and no woman
was murdered in my house before we got

1218
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:20,800
the fucking chick who sounds like
she's doing a Dracula impression.

1219
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,660
Maybe I could put those two fucking
numbers together and guests that it's,

1220
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:29,380
it's Ama or Ezra or whatever
the fuck her fucking name.

1221
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:33,730
Is this something wrong with her?
The fuck is it? I have to look it up.

1222
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:37,870
I got to get this orphan.
Let me type this in. Clear.

1223
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:41,980
What the fuck was that psycho
chick's name. Huh? Orphan.

1224
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:46,960
Showtimes. Uh, you
motherfucker plot words.

1225
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:48,010
Keys.

1226
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:50,020
Yeah.

1227
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,720
Full cast and crew.
Here we go. Here we go.

1228
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,230
Anyway, reason there's
something wrong with Esther.

1229
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,800
Had a fuck that I forget that Esther
to cause a little white girl Esther.

1230
01:16:03,801 --> 01:16:06,470
That's it. That's an old black
woman name, isn't it Esther?

1231
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,443
Was that the name of it?

1232
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,510
Was that the name of Florida Evan's
character or was that the name of the,

1233
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:16,460
of the ugly girl on a Sanford and
son? It was aunt Esther. That was,

1234
01:16:16,461 --> 01:16:17,294
yeah.

1235
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:21,800
And therefore because I saw one person
who was black who had that name,

1236
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:23,840
therefore everybody see how I do that?

1237
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:27,410
I like to generalize everybody
cause I'm a moron. All right,

1238
01:16:27,411 --> 01:16:30,170
let's get back to the
fucking podcast here. Um,

1239
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:32,940
here we go.
Here's some youtube videos.

1240
01:16:32,941 --> 01:16:37,380
Did you guys can watch this weekend your
cubicles instead of working? All right.

1241
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:41,850
Um, let me see here. What
do we got here? All right,

1242
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:45,930
so I noticed a lot of them because the
first one that I nominated was really

1243
01:16:45,931 --> 01:16:46,764
violent.

1244
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:51,770
Most of these youtube videos that people
are nominating involve somebody getting

1245
01:16:53,431 --> 01:16:58,170
punched in the face. Like, here's one
British director slammed into a table.

1246
01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:59,760
This is,
um,

1247
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:04,790
Twat on Twat crime just to let you
know it's female versus female and um,

1248
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,520
it has a WWF quality to it.
When the lady gets slammed,

1249
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:14,750
she puts her arms out like the way they
do when wrestlers pretend to slam their

1250
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:18,950
heads off a table. Um, but for all
of you who don't like violence,

1251
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,060
I have a couple of Nice ones. Here's
one for you. Cute puppy whistle.

1252
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:28,490
Look up that one and tell me that won't
melt your fucking cheerios if they're

1253
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:31,640
meltable. Um, and there's
another great one. This one,

1254
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:36,230
Jerry needs no help playing with his ball.
I know that sounds like a porno,

1255
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,380
but I swear to God it's an adorable video.

1256
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:43,670
Jerry needs no help playing with his ball.
Just write this down on a little post.

1257
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:47,940
It act like you're taking notes
and looking at a spreadsheet. Um,

1258
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:52,850
here's one for the guys, a
fat kid on a bicycle. Um,

1259
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,690
I challenge you to watch this and
not fucking laugh your balls off.

1260
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:00,830
And it's great if he just, you know
what's great is after the kid falls off,

1261
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:05,000
if you look really closely it,
what happens is,

1262
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:09,470
is when he goes flying over the handlebars
in his fucking meatball body lands,

1263
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,900
you haven't seen anybody's played.
Sports has done this.

1264
01:18:11,901 --> 01:18:16,040
She ever get tackled in football and
your arms underneath you and your fucking

1265
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:18,680
elbow basically goes into your spleen,

1266
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:23,900
up under your liver and then fucking,
you know, smashes into your heart.

1267
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,540
That's basically what happens to this kid.
And he makes,

1268
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,780
he makes the greatest.
He made you want to hear the noise?

1269
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,050
Tell you what I'll play.

1270
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,690
They'll play the audio and I'm going
to test your willpower that if you can

1271
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:43,310
actually hear the fucking
audio to this and not watch it,

1272
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:47,690
you're definitely, you get you have,
you have some serious fucking willpower.

1273
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:51,980
Let me type this in real quick. Fat,
there's a lot of audio on this one.

1274
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:56,840
I had my dog. Fuck Kid. Wait a minute.
What the fuck? I just messed that up.

1275
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:00,170
Fair kid on a bicycle.
I'm sorry I can't type with one hand.

1276
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,530
Just bear with me children.
Just bear with me.

1277
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:05,930
Just talk amongst yourselves.

1278
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:10,220
Do you ever have that when you teach her
was going through a divorce and she'd

1279
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:13,880
start breaking down.
Just talk amongst yourselves.

1280
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Fat Kid on a sic code.

1281
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:25,560
Bam. Come on. Where the fuck is it?

1282
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,600
Oh, that's great. Bill,
you gave me the wrong.

1283
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,380
Maybe it's fat kid falls.
Ah,

1284
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,790
you fucking asshole bill fat.

1285
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:41,040
I wrote fat on a bicycle. That'd be
disgusting ones. There's a bag of fat.

1286
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,920
All right. Fat Kid on a bicycle
and I get the same videos.

1287
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:51,820
Fat Kid fall on a jumping on a bike.

1288
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,060
Where is his mother fucker?

1289
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,350
I'm the worst. I swear to God. It's funny.

1290
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,900
You're not gonna be able to find
now I have to fuck. Oh, there it is.

1291
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,950
Kid on a bicycle. I got it. Here
we go. Listen to this audio.

1292
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:12,853
All right,

1293
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,610
here he comes. Here he
comes. Here he comes.

1294
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,023
Hello.

1295
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,650
Ah,

1296
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,140
oh. That's the funniest fucking thing
ever. And he's got big fat thighs.

1297
01:20:38,141 --> 01:20:39,520
He's got these little booty shorts.

1298
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:43,963
Ah

1299
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:48,860
God. That's a fucking great one.
There's nothing better that way is,

1300
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:52,310
it's so funny to watch somebody get
hurt. I don't know why. Anyways,

1301
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,620
here's another one,
and I know this,

1302
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:56,720
this one has a couple
of your kid's ears here,

1303
01:20:56,721 --> 01:21:01,160
but this one is called current
smasher. C U. N. T. A. Smasher.

1304
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,110
And I know that sounds like,

1305
01:21:03,111 --> 01:21:06,020
you know somebody just give somebody
an uppercut to the baby maker.

1306
01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:09,560
That's not what happens. Believe
it or not, this is actually,

1307
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:14,620
it's a male stripper and I swear to God,
I think it's Bobby blots,

1308
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:19,130
sir from rat. That's what
it looks like. Um, it's,

1309
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,250
you might want to fast forward through
some of it, but it's just fucking,

1310
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,750
it's hilarious.
Um,

1311
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:29,760
it's gotta be from like 1988 just judging
by the guy's fucking hair metal hair

1312
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:36,370
and he's spinning these knives around
and it's just a classic why guys are not

1313
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:41,471
sexy and women or guys I think turn
women on if they're like doing shit,

1314
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:44,600
you know, you come over, you know,

1315
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:48,440
you're fucking the of the cable guy
and you're installing cable, you know,

1316
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:53,390
and you bend over and you'd Dickies.
I don't fucking know.

1317
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,433
You know what I mean?

1318
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:58,490
That's how women get turned on and they
see some guy with a little yellow hard

1319
01:21:58,491 --> 01:22:02,690
hat and he's up a telephone pole. Oh my
God. He can fix stuff. I want to blow him.

1320
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,360
Right.
I Dunno how they find a sexy,

1321
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:09,950
but I know it's not wearing a fucking
leather jumpsuit spinning around kitchen

1322
01:22:09,951 --> 01:22:12,640
knives. That really, I dunno, but
you got to watch it. That's what,

1323
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:16,850
that's a great one. Um, and these are
all recommended by people, by the way,

1324
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:19,950
other than fat kid on a bike.
That's one of my favorite ones. Um,

1325
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:24,830
gay weatherman is a grace w great
one. Uh, there's another one,

1326
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:29,500
worst blooper ever.
And uh,

1327
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:32,180
then there's another good one,
a British punch.

1328
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,200
Just look that up at some British
dude who gets punched in the face.

1329
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:38,500
And his reaction is,
um,

1330
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:42,170
stereotypical British where
it's just really polite.

1331
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:46,550
Where'd you go and do something like that?
I came out to fuck he did.

1332
01:22:46,551 --> 01:22:49,340
The guy gets punched in the face
and he doesn't attack the other kid.

1333
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:53,940
He doesn't laugh. Hey, why
did you go? I came with the F.

1334
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,120
I can't do fucking accents.
I don't even know why.

1335
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:00,110
Check those out instead of working. That's
what you can do this week. All right.

1336
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:04,610
Um, or if he gets sick of working. What
are we up to here? 40 minutes. All right.

1337
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:08,860
I gotta wrap up. I have some, I have
a computer question for you people.

1338
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:13,060
All right. I have a, I have the Mac book
now. All the nerds are listening up.

1339
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:17,950
Alright. Perk in their ears up. I have a
brand new Mac book brand. By brand new,

1340
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,590
I mean nonetheless,
like fucking four months or whatever.

1341
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,280
And I got that thing where,
you know,

1342
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:27,340
if I put my hand on the little square
thing down there that I don't know what

1343
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:30,910
it's called. You know the
mousy area. I know if I,

1344
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,050
if I flick the cursor to the upper
right hand, all the windows disappear.

1345
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:39,430
If I go down to the lower right, they
separate, upper left makes it go black,

1346
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,610
lower left,
uh,

1347
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:47,200
makes the four windows and you know,
we can have something in all four windows.

1348
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,290
Um, but my question is, is what?
I don't know how I do this,

1349
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:55,291
but every once in a while I do something
on the mouse area accidentally.

1350
01:23:55,481 --> 01:23:56,590
And what happens is,

1351
01:23:56,830 --> 01:24:00,610
is I'll have two windows open and
when I click on one of the windows,

1352
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:04,180
the other window goes exit
stage right off of my thing.

1353
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,270
And then if I click the other one,
then the,

1354
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:10,750
then it comes back while the
other one goes exit stage left.

1355
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,630
And sometimes I want to look
at both fucking windows.

1356
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:15,490
How do I make it stop doing that?

1357
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,330
So I guess I want to know how do I make
it do that and then how do I make it

1358
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:23,890
stop doing that because I want to stop
yelling at my computer like it's a person.

1359
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:27,640
I hope I explained that correctly.
And with that,

1360
01:24:27,641 --> 01:24:31,450
let's move on to a revenge story. Remember
that topic? All those great stories.

1361
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:34,960
Remember how like everybody had
his story, uh, how they, you know,

1362
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:37,930
how you got revenge was basically
you didn't confront the person.

1363
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:42,610
You basically fucked up some of their
personal property and a lot of people sort

1364
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:46,780
of came to the conclusion that that really
wasn't revenge as much as it was sort

1365
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:51,460
of a bitchy little move where here's
a great revenge story done by a guy.

1366
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:55,030
This is a fucking great story. I wish I
lived this story. All right, here we go.

1367
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:58,840
I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Uh, many
years ago when I was in the sixth grade,

1368
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:03,160
I was 11 years old. There was a guy
named PJ used to torment me all the time.

1369
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:07,450
He bullied me, bully me, and robbed
me of my money. Every time he saw me.

1370
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:12,190
This lasted for about four years.
As I became a teenager,

1371
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,990
he stopped trying to rob me,
but he was,

1372
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,600
he still tried to intimidate
me every chance he got.

1373
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:21,400
So one day in the summer we were playing
five on five basketball and there was

1374
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:24,490
about 40 guys standing all around
the court watching the game.

1375
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,690
I got the ball on a steel and the
only guy back on defense was PJ.

1376
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,190
As I drove to the hoop,

1377
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,030
he jumped to block my shot and
I dunked right in his face.

1378
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,890
The whole park exploded.

1379
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:40,120
Guys were running to the court
yelling and laughing at PJ's. Pj,

1380
01:25:40,121 --> 01:25:41,830
the screams were so loud.

1381
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:46,360
My friends who lived a block away heard
the noise and came running to the park

1382
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:49,960
to see what happened.
The look on PJ's face was priceless.

1383
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:55,030
He was humiliated in front of just about
everybody we mutually knew at that time.

1384
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,780
Um, I went on to play Division
One college ball and had success,

1385
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:00,820
but nothing ever compared to that day.

1386
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:04,370
I remember like it was yesterday
and it happened over 20 years ago.

1387
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:09,060
He never spoke or bothered me ever
again after that day either though.

1388
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:12,380
That story is the shit,
you know.

1389
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,080
Can you imagine Dunkin on some
asshole is treating me like shit.

1390
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:19,010
You know what I thought it was and I'm
going to go out on a limb here and get,

1391
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,990
you know at the risk of
being called a racist again.

1392
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,760
I'm going to guess that
that was a black guy.

1393
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:28,250
Not too many white guys have
a story of Holly got revenge,

1394
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,320
was they fucking stole a ball.

1395
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:34,340
Somebody jumped up to block their shot
and they basically jumped over him and

1396
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:39,020
dunked on him. You know, I dunno.
Maybe, I dunno. I'm just saying right.

1397
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:41,510
I mean I,
I was in my white brain,

1398
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,380
what I was thinking was everyone was
there at the basketball game and you're

1399
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:48,590
going to do the meatballs thing
and pulled down his shorts. See

1400
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:54,320
that's what you have to do when you can't
jump when you don't have that fucking

1401
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:57,710
option. Cause I don't care how
many fucking, how many whatever,

1402
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:01,910
jump shots you throw him in
somebody's face. It's not
the same. It's not the same.

1403
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:04,160
That's like you just fucking attacked.

1404
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:05,830
Okay.

1405
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:08,220
I mean, I dunno. Getting
dunked on, I mean that's,

1406
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,530
that's right up there with just sleep.

1407
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:11,500
She minds was just slapped
his mother right in his face.

1408
01:27:11,501 --> 01:27:14,470
I think that's fantastic. That's
what I want to nominate. That is,

1409
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:18,760
that's the one of the best revenge
stories ever because it wasn't sneaky.

1410
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:24,340
It wasn't bitchy.
It was right in the dude's face and a,

1411
01:27:24,341 --> 01:27:27,130
and it had the desired effect.
The guy never fucked with them again.

1412
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,520
And I'm going to go out on a limb and
say that this dude had the last laugh.

1413
01:27:30,521 --> 01:27:32,980
So congratulations.
Jesus Christ.

1414
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,470
That should be like one of those
afterschool special movies.

1415
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:38,950
It really had a feel good ending
to it and nobody really got hurt.

1416
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,690
So he just got put in their place.

1417
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:45,430
They should fucking film that story and
play it around the holidays just to make

1418
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:49,180
people feel better. All right,
let's get with questions here. Um,

1419
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:54,250
hey bill, I am, I'm a big fan of
your comedy. We bitty, bitty, bitty.

1420
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:59,180
Thank you very much. Uh, I was
looking for a, what the fuck?

1421
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,460
I was looking to get some tickets
to the DC improv show on October.

1422
01:28:02,461 --> 01:28:04,760
Is curious about your thoughts.
Oh,

1423
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:08,040
I was curious about your thoughts on
the difference between the early and the

1424
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,960
late shows. I know when you're a pro
you can kill whether it's the first,

1425
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:14,330
second or second show on any given night,

1426
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,300
but I was just wondering which
performance do you prefer and why?

1427
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:20,630
And is the law the single show on Sunday,

1428
01:28:20,631 --> 01:28:25,100
the most depressing Gig of the rung
of the run. All right. You know, you,

1429
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:28,640
believe it or not, I get asked this
question a lot of times when people go,

1430
01:28:28,641 --> 01:28:31,670
hey man, I'm buying tickets to
your show. I'm coming Friday.

1431
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:34,340
Which one do you think I should go to?
The early one of the late one.

1432
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:40,090
And the reality is, um, you never know.

1433
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:41,741
You never know.

1434
01:28:41,741 --> 01:28:44,800
Like this past weekend I was working the
comedy connection in Providence and I

1435
01:28:44,801 --> 01:28:45,790
had great shows,

1436
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:51,370
but that one went the standard way where
the early crowd was more sober and more

1437
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:55,990
receptive and the lay crowd was,
uh,

1438
01:28:56,140 --> 01:29:00,150
sort of drunk and not paying attention.
Well,

1439
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,340
one of the nights it on the Friday night,

1440
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:06,660
it was like the red sox and Yankees
were playing and I guess they went 13

1441
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:08,820
innings or something like that.
It was into extra innings.

1442
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:13,560
So half of the crowd they're face
is glowing by half the crowd.

1443
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,930
I mean five fucking people,
but that feels like half to crop.

1444
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:19,920
Their face is glowing because
they're watching the pitch by pitch.

1445
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:24,990
Um, I mean who the fuck is into sports
to that level? You know what I mean?

1446
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:29,760
Breaking ball outside till it,
but you know,

1447
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:32,940
you're gonna fucking end and you
don't even have that guy saying that.

1448
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,430
But what happened? They were watching
that shit but then you know what the fuck,

1449
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,010
but whatever.
So they weren't paying attention.

1450
01:29:38,011 --> 01:29:42,060
So the second show kind of
sucked on that one. But um,

1451
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,010
when I was in Denver,

1452
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:47,790
I had a show where the early show they
would drunk maniacs yelling out shit.

1453
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:51,390
It was still fun. Um, so yeah, dude,

1454
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,100
it's a crap shoot just like you.

1455
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,910
I have no idea either and I
just sort of play off. Well,

1456
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,190
however people are doing it.
But I got to admit, I ever,

1457
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:01,020
I have a really good crowd
of people that comes out.

1458
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:04,290
And even when people yell shit out at me,
like I'm,

1459
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:07,140
I don't like if someone's just trying
to be a dick. But if I say something,

1460
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:09,870
someone has an opinion on it
and they yell it out, you know,

1461
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:13,230
as long as it isn't every five seconds,
like that really doesn't bother me.

1462
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:18,380
I actually think it's one of the things
that makes stand up a cool art that uh,

1463
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:22,680
you know, it's one of the few like
public speaking things where like you,

1464
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:27,990
it's kind of accepted in a way that you
can just yell, hey, you fucking suck.

1465
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,460
You know? I mean it happens to
bands and that type of shit,

1466
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:37,370
but she can drown them out with your
instruments. I Dunno. I Dunno. Fuck.

1467
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,990
I mean, you know, I'm basically, this
is the only thing I've done in public,

1468
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:43,260
so I really don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about. Um,

1469
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,630
let's move off to fucking listen.

1470
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:47,070
I want to say there was something
about provenance. I wanted her to say,

1471
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:49,740
well that's out of my head now. Um, okay.

1472
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:54,150
This is how we've been ending a lot of
these podcasts lately where all of a

1473
01:30:54,151 --> 01:30:57,150
sudden people are sending me these really,
uh,

1474
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,170
heavier questions. This
is sort of the, uh,

1475
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:05,070
the doctor bill section I think is what
I'm going to call it because I'm not

1476
01:31:05,071 --> 01:31:09,840
qualified no, that I'm not qualified
to answer any of this shit.

1477
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:14,490
But, uh, this is another one of
these death of a relative thing. So,

1478
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:17,420
uh, after we had the feel
good story, God dammit,

1479
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,890
I should've read the revenge
one after this one. But, uh,

1480
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:23,040
this one is sort of
depressing, but not, not,

1481
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,370
I'm just going to shut up and
read it. Okay. Bill, my bill,

1482
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,420
my mom's oldest sister died from
cancer three weeks ago and wow.

1483
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:34,980
What an opening sentence and
has one surviving sister, um,

1484
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:38,880
during the process of going
through her things. All right,

1485
01:31:38,881 --> 01:31:40,830
so let's slow down here
because this gets confusing.

1486
01:31:40,831 --> 01:31:45,831
So you have a mom and she had a sister
die and she has one other surviving

1487
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:46,840
sisters.

1488
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:51,000
So it's your mom and your aunt who's
alive at this point and your other aunt

1489
01:31:51,001 --> 01:31:53,840
died or aunt, whatever
the fuck you from. Um,

1490
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,780
during the process or going through
her things and settling her affairs.

1491
01:31:57,781 --> 01:32:01,510
Quite a few interesting
secrets have popped up for one.

1492
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:03,550
We thought my aunt never owned a car,

1493
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:07,420
but have since found out that she
owned several over the last 20 years.

1494
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,870
Sounds like the beginning of one
of those a and e murder things.

1495
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:15,640
They thought she was quiet. It didn't
have any carers. Um, for second,

1496
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,500
um, we always thought after two
divorces that she had sworn off men.

1497
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,240
Turns out,
um,

1498
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:25,900
this gave her license to
sample both sides of the fence.

1499
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,150
Any race we're fucking above.
We were about chest deep
and, and this one already,

1500
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:32,260
four sentences in,

1501
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,980
have I forgotten to mention that
she was an avid collector of books.

1502
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:39,580
Some might call it a obsessive compulsive.
Needless to say,

1503
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:44,950
I have cited with OCD because she has
five over 5,000 books in a one bedroom

1504
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:48,040
condo on the lake front here in Chicago.

1505
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:53,900
We have found college era photos of her
half naked with a cigarette in one hand

1506
01:32:55,001 --> 01:33:00,001
in various background items that
would suggest early seventies era.

1507
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:01,180
Uh,

1508
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:06,180
mostly because the gigantic stereos
with turntables and eight track slot.

1509
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:10,900
So, okay. Um, through this
process, my mom's middle sister,

1510
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:15,370
I guess this is the surviving one and
her two kids and families have distanced

1511
01:33:15,371 --> 01:33:18,520
themselves from the,
this estate settling process.

1512
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:23,170
While my mom and I have spent 80 plus
man hours going through the Condo,

1513
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,580
my middle aunt and her family
have consistently talked
about how busy they are.

1514
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,510
Uh,

1515
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:34,470
um, and that they have all but said,
we don't care how much you've done.

1516
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:38,820
And I, dude, you were a little vague here.
Are they getting stuff from the will?

1517
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:43,320
I was a little confused with that.
Um, but anyways, I realize, um,

1518
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,570
there was a very complex set
of emotions going on here.

1519
01:33:47,571 --> 01:33:51,230
Perhaps their show of indifference is
because they feel guilty about not seeing

1520
01:33:51,231 --> 01:33:52,910
my dead aunt when she was alive.

1521
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:57,080
Perhaps they live in a nearly perfect
world and don't want to be bothered.

1522
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:00,800
Perhaps they are unfeeling jackasses
and don't care. It's hard to judge.

1523
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,620
I really want to tell them to
go fuck themselves. And several,

1524
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,940
several contact with them once and for
all, once the will is paid out. Okay.

1525
01:34:07,941 --> 01:34:09,200
So evidently I get it.

1526
01:34:09,201 --> 01:34:13,010
So they're entitled to some Shit
and they're not helping out. Uh,

1527
01:34:13,011 --> 01:34:17,090
but they are family and I was brought
to respect family while they apparently

1528
01:34:17,091 --> 01:34:17,924
were not,

1529
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,800
it pains me to know that they are blood
relatives and that their mindset is

1530
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:25,160
indicative of my middle
Anse upbringing of them.

1531
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:26,920
MMM.

1532
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,160
I guess that's just surviving aunt.
Um,

1533
01:34:29,161 --> 01:34:32,610
I feel loss and sorrow for
losing my aunt to cat cancer,

1534
01:34:32,611 --> 01:34:36,840
but I also feel loss and sorrow about
losing my other aunt and her kids and

1535
01:34:36,841 --> 01:34:39,900
families because they are
not who I thought they were.

1536
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:43,740
Any advice you could give would be great.
Add Dude, I don't know what to tell you.

1537
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:45,760
MMM.

1538
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:45,971
Yeah.

1539
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:48,610
It's fucked up that they're going to get
some money out of this shit and they're

1540
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:50,560
not helping you go through her stuff.

1541
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,603
MMM.

1542
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:56,870
But, uh, I dunno dude. How
often do you see these?

1543
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:59,030
Yeah.

1544
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:01,070
You know,
I dunno,

1545
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:04,610
I kind of draw the line
at your immediate family.

1546
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,060
If he's talking about aunts and
cousins and that type of shit,

1547
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:11,330
if they're assholes,
they're really, you know,

1548
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:17,430
like you ever think of how barely your
cousins are part of your family tree?

1549
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:22,170
I mean, you basically have to go up
the tree and then back down the tree,

1550
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:26,460
two limbs to get to him. So fuck
them. They're out right now.

1551
01:35:26,461 --> 01:35:28,260
Really held my cousins
don't listen to this podcast

1552
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,980
and then your aunt. I mean, I dunno.
I Dunno. It's, it's your aunt.

1553
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,300
Fuck them. Fuck them. Go
with you got fuck them.

1554
01:35:39,301 --> 01:35:44,230
Clear out the mortgage and then uh,
yeah, fuck them. I mean they sound,

1555
01:35:44,231 --> 01:35:47,110
I mean, the way you've talked about on
the kind of sound like assholes. I mean,

1556
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:50,440
what do you want to debate their house
smells to the way you've described them.

1557
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:54,700
You want to go over into
this smelly house, you know,

1558
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,480
to watch the Billy Bass that they bought
with your dead ants. Money. Fuck them.

1559
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:03,490
Go with your gut. Fuck them. You know,
at some point you, you, you could,

1560
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:07,570
I don't know. Do you want to
have that confrontation? Yeah,

1561
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:10,240
I think the only weird thing of
the cousins is not a weird thing.

1562
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:12,670
I don't think the fact that
they're not involved is,

1563
01:36:12,671 --> 01:36:15,370
is a weird thing because a lot of times,
you know,

1564
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:16,750
people could be really separated.

1565
01:36:16,751 --> 01:36:21,751
But like the weird thing is your aunt
not giving a shit that your other aunt

1566
01:36:22,331 --> 01:36:27,010
died because their sisters, that's
just fucking bizarre to me. But, uh,

1567
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,440
who knows?
Maybe a dead ant did something to her.

1568
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:31,840
He didn't know that she
had 20 fucking cars.

1569
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:35,020
Maybe you should keep sifting
through the pictures and uh,

1570
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,960
maybe you'll discover something. I
don't know what, I don't know what,

1571
01:36:37,961 --> 01:36:42,190
but I dunno what do that advice sucked.
Okay.

1572
01:36:42,191 --> 01:36:44,070
I'm not qualified for a

1573
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:45,820
yeah.

1574
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:48,310
You know,
I don't know that level of stuff,

1575
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:52,540
but feel free to keep sending me stuff
like that cause it must be fun to listen

1576
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:56,530
to me a squirm. Speaking of that. Um,

1577
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:59,910
here's some shit about,
uh, you know, something,

1578
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:04,450
somebody sent me something great about
banks trying to help me explain what the

1579
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:06,100
fuck I was trying to say last week,

1580
01:37:06,101 --> 01:37:10,150
but really couldn't explain
it in an intelligent way.

1581
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:12,700
And I lost the email because I,

1582
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:16,590
I didn't have any internet over the
weekend and I had it on my blackberry.

1583
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,471
I got rid of it.

1584
01:37:17,471 --> 01:37:21,100
But basically this guy was touching
on some shit that I had heard before.

1585
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,630
That basically when you,

1586
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:26,260
if you take a thousand of your own
dollars and you put it in a bank,

1587
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,240
believe it or not,

1588
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:32,530
the bank can legally loan that thousand
dollars out to like nine different

1589
01:37:32,531 --> 01:37:33,364
people.

1590
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,920
I don't mean nine people get a
portion that totals up to a thousand.

1591
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:44,580
I mean nine people can get $1,000 loan
off of the thousand dollars that you put

1592
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:50,170
in. So if you're sitting there going,

1593
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:53,810
well then didn't they just invent,
um,

1594
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:58,200
$8,000 they just created out of thin air?

1595
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,320
Yeah.

1596
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,850
And um, I don't know if that's
why our money really has no value.

1597
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,590
They just created out of thin air.

1598
01:38:05,591 --> 01:38:10,591
And this guy was basically explaining
that one of the reasons our money has

1599
01:38:11,921 --> 01:38:16,270
value is basically the
person who takes the loan,

1600
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:21,550
them promising to pay it
back, gives it value. But uh,

1601
01:38:21,551 --> 01:38:24,250
I dunno,
I have no idea.

1602
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:27,280
I wish that there was some sort of uh,

1603
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,400
yeah,

1604
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:33,330
like home kit where you could make
your own bank. You know what I mean?

1605
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:37,650
The same way people make their own
fucking beer in the bathtub or they make

1606
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:41,640
lemonade this, you know, that'd be a
great fight. Billy Mays was still alive.

1607
01:38:41,641 --> 01:38:44,070
He could sell that shit.
You know, I'm Billy Mays.

1608
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:47,700
Are you sick of putting your money in
the banks and having a loan out to a

1609
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:52,160
budget? Can't you don't even pay it
back. So then you fucking lose Hedrick.

1610
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,530
Dozy your own personal baggage.

1611
01:38:53,531 --> 01:38:56,430
He basically showed you how to convert
your garage into a brick. Fucking,

1612
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:00,400
I dunno what have some homeless
guy that would be your security.

1613
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:04,020
You just have some homeless guy that
smells so fucking bad. You know,

1614
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,690
granted all your money would smell,
but like no one would go near.

1615
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:09,810
I don't know what. I don't
know what to tell you, but I,

1616
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:14,811
I feel like an idiot every week taking
my money and then putting it into a bank,

1617
01:39:15,211 --> 01:39:17,070
but there's no other fucking options,

1618
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:19,123
you know,

1619
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,600
short of sticking it in my mattress,
you know,

1620
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:28,070
and then you make yourself
a target, you know, hey,

1621
01:39:28,071 --> 01:39:30,810
you see that skinny red at over there.
It doesn't know how to fight a,

1622
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:34,490
he's got a fucking thousand dollars
in his pillowcase. Hey guys. Hey,

1623
01:39:34,491 --> 01:39:35,480
you want to play Frisbee?

1624
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:39,260
Let's get blasted in the face
and not only am I out 1000 bucks,

1625
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:43,520
I ought to buy a new pillow because I
noticed that's one thing about when people

1626
01:39:43,521 --> 01:39:47,360
steal, they have to ruin your
place too. They have to ransack it.

1627
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:52,220
They can't just reach into your pillow.
It's wide open. Just reach in and take it.

1628
01:39:52,221 --> 01:39:54,830
Not how I got to rip it
off and fucking stab it up.

1629
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,823
You know

1630
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:00,080
something about putting on a cat suit
that makes people extra destructive.

1631
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:03,260
All right. Anyways, that's
the podcast for this week.

1632
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,770
I hope to see you guys out at my show.
I am getting geared up for my special,

1633
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,220
I'm not drinking, I'm not boozing, so
please don't tempt me when I'm out there,

1634
01:40:10,221 --> 01:40:13,370
but if you want to show me your tits,
that is fine and I will happily sign them.

1635
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,870
See, there's a balance to my
life also. Um, please try to cut.

1636
01:40:17,871 --> 01:40:21,590
If you're anywhere near
Ontario, California, please
come out to my show out there.

1637
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:24,860
I would really love to sell a bunch
of tickets out there because, um,

1638
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:29,330
I don't have much of a presence
here in the lower California area.

1639
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,400
I don't have anything in San Diego.

1640
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:35,690
I got nothing going on in the greater
la area and I usually don't plead with

1641
01:40:35,691 --> 01:40:39,830
people to this level to come to my
shows, but I am right now. All right.

1642
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:45,500
I'm like fucking what's his face and that,
that fucking Miller's crossing.

1643
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:49,610
Look into your heart.
Look into you

1644
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,890
John. Turturro. What a
great fucking movie that is.

1645
01:40:53,891 --> 01:40:56,530
I finally saw that one the other day.
Wasn't that a great,

1646
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:00,710
you guys want to hear cleo
getting scratched one more
time to hear what fucking

1647
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,280
ecstasy sounds like. No, I
she won't do it. Here we go.

1648
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:04,453
Yeah,

1649
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:16,250
there you go. That wasn't as good as
yellow ones. Whatever. Go Fuck Yourself.

1650
01:41:16,251 --> 01:41:19,400
This is life. That's how it goes. All
right. Now let me know how this works out.

1651
01:41:19,401 --> 01:41:23,410
Is it a smaller file and all that type
of shit? You guys have a good week and a,

1652
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:25,790
I will talk to you next Monday,

1653
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:28,220
although it will be a little bit
later cause I am flying back from,

1654
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:33,380
from Atlanta on, uh, on
Monday. So there you go.

1655
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,140
All right, so don't be like, dude,
where the fuck is it? It's common.

1656
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:40,490
It's always calming. All right. Might be
a little fucking late, but it is coming.

1657
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:42,070
All right,
you guys have a good week.

1658
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,130
Okay.
