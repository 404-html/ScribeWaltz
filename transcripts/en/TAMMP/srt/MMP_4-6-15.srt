1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,430
And free.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,780
Oh,
can I do,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,350
hey,
what's going on?

4
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:10,310
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:15,110
April 6th,

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,230
2014 and won. Some of you
are probably wondering, hey
bill, you're a, you're a fear,

7
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:22,640
a full blooded fucking
American, right? What are you,

8
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:26,360
what are you're coming in with this week's
podcast singing the Canadian national

9
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:27,120
anthem.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,580
Oh, can a duck we, oh uh,

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,783
four.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,361
You know why?

13
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,530
Because my stupid fucking recorder for
some reason I got to talk for 30 seconds

14
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:41,910
for it to get the proper, the proper
levels. So what am I going to do?

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,960
Huh? You sing the national
anthem is what you do.

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,600
I was singing about the walls in my house.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,250
Why do people put Shit?
Yeah.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,710
Oh no walls.
All it

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,810
does is crack the fuck
and plaster there bod.

20
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:02,990
If you don't have pictures on the wall,

21
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:07,860
people think you have
bodies in the basement. Um,

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,430
speaking of all Canada,
how about those Boston Bruins?

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,820
Turn it on when they needed to turn it on.

24
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:18,821
All you fucking fans up there and Otto
was skating down the river on your way to

25
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:22,100
work.
What'd you think was gonna Happen?

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,040
Did you think that you are going
to catch the big bad Bruins? Huh?

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,690
One in the original six.
How dare you Ottawa?

28
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,520
You stand down,

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,480
you stand down and you
watch that river melt.

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,400
You watched the water run like the tears
going down your fucking frostbitten

31
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:45,320
cheeks cause you ain't making the
playoffs. Playoffs, the fucking playoffs.

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,470
The Bruins are,
and I'm calling it right now.

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,420
We're going to play the Montreal Canadians
in the first round and we're game

34
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:53,661
one.

35
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:58,661
We're getting our first win against
those fucking silly shock French Fox.

36
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,710
Oh French people love their silly socks
and their little pocket squares going

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,730
into the game with their blue blazer
thinking that they know more than the

38
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:11,390
fucking coach. Those cuts. Right.
What beaten him in game on?

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,190
That's what we're doing. What's going
to happen in game two? I don't know.

40
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:21,140
I didn't take that far,
but if you would like a prediction,

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,380
I just heard the door slam.
I think my wife just woke up.

42
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,880
She's pissed at me already. Um, if
you would like a prediction, uh,

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,420
I say that we come out there
and we, we win again. Yup.

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,750
Then we'd go down to Boston,
right? Oh, shared. Well,
don't you take eight to nine?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,670
Is Your fucking a killer?
We're going to sweep them up.

46
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,860
We're not going to sweep her money.
No.

47
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,150
If we're going to fucking
get out of the first round,

48
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:47,830
but I can tell you right now, if
we, if we actually, if I'm fucking,

49
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,661
I'll tell you right now,

50
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,780
if I'm a Montreal Canadian
fair and I got to be thinking,

51
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,900
if I'm playing the fucking Bruins,
if we loo,

52
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,910
if you guys fucking lose to us after the
season we had after the domination that

53
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,410
you guys fucking it. You got
to, you can't tell you this.

54
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:05,250
Not Creeping in the back of your little
French fucking brain. There is, you know,

55
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,950
your little want to be French braid.
You're not French. You're Canadian.

56
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,820
That's right. You're part of North
America. You're part of, you're,

57
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,520
you're attached to us. This
obesity, it goes right up over.

58
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:20,130
The fucking board is right up to your,
Timmy.

59
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:23,760
Ho's with you guys sitting there eating
your fucking donuts. What do you think?

60
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,620
You're better than us because you get
you Canadian GG fucking donuts with you.

61
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,150
A little pinky sticking out.
Ah, with your loafers. No socks.

62
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,350
You little fucking pocket squares,
Huh? Is that what you think?

63
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,330
I'll tell you right now the playoffs
to, I'm going to go total cliche here.

64
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,490
Prostart who to Hulu? Susan. Oof.

65
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,580
[inaudible] though.
They're play their play desperate.

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,950
We'll tell you a little desperate tables.
Dangerous.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,770
Did you guys watch any
sports this weekend?

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,540
Can somebody explained to me how
it was constant beat Kentucky.

69
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,680
Somebody explained to me how a team
playing the game of basketball,

70
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,740
a team that is wider than my thighs
somehow beat the Kentucky wildcats.

71
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,320
C. Dot. That's why you
can never be prejudice.

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,260
You can't be racist because it is
always going to prove you wrong.

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,740
I don't know shit about hoop. I don't
know shit about college basketball.

74
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,780
I don't know shit about a lot of things
and I sat down to watch that game and

75
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:27,470
I'm looking at that number 44 in
Wisconsin. I'm like, this guy is a mess.

76
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,870
Look at him.
He looks like he's in a jam band.

77
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,770
This guy does not look like a fucking
basketball player and all of a sudden he's

78
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:34,604
doing all this Kevin.
Yeah.

79
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,330
Cale stretching around. I don't know. It
was, it was a hell of a game. And, um,

80
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,160
I actually, uh, I become a
Wisconsin fan just because of,

81
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:47,550
uh, uh, I told you guys this, a
couple of guy developed the show with,

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,940
and I want to talk to Nick Craig.
It was a big Wisconsin guy. And uh,

83
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,140
so I like those guys. So I
root for the team, but however,

84
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,550
I'm also a big Kentucky Fan.
So it was this weird thing I didn't know.

85
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:02,910
I love John Calipari and,
uh,

86
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,420
a John can of Perry over the cold.

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's go to [inaudible] cal pair.
We will be all flooding.

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,450
We're gleaning a little clear, I'm
sure. So, yeah. Um, yeah, you know,

89
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,600
I fucking love Italians and I love
Italian food. So he has this guy.

90
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,480
And then I also like how Calla Perry's
a little shady, you know what I mean?

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,060
How did he turn that
program around a Memphis?

92
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,510
Somebody explained to me how I never
even knew that Memphis even had a school.

93
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,700
Forget about a fucking basketball
team and next thing you know,

94
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,610
he brings him to the final four.
Maybe didn't, I don't know.

95
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:35,550
I'm just repeating shit. I heard other
people say, I'm just repeating shit.

96
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:40,200
I heard Bobby Knight Pitch About, Huh?
That fucking drunk with power maniac.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Good Lord.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,160
You ever see anybody needs a bit more
of a swift kick in the ass and that guy,

99
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,130
Jesus Christ, right? His fucking Khakis.

100
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,850
Uh,
my hope when they bury with me,

101
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:58,390
they bury it may face down Joe Critiques,
Kid Kiss

102
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,930
my ass. Hey Bob, whatever
you want us to dope.

103
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,300
That's when he fucking went off the rails.

104
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,690
There was some rails and
he went off on people.

105
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,530
I'm speaking of going off the
rails. Uh, I would like to,

106
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,130
I'd like to commend of for a certain
channel out there right now that's a,

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,870
is not responding to a bunch of
horse shit that's coming their way.

108
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,320
That's the exact way you handle
this.

109
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:31,880
This new era of,
of offended over nothing.

110
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,150
This guy tweeted something in 1840.

111
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:40,210
I don't know about this and you've got
to go back six fucking years to find

112
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:45,130
something bad that somebody tweeted about
Jesus fucking Christ.

113
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,200
What do you break out? A
boat, an old borscht belt
joke. I'm sure I'll find fell.

114
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,500
You know what I mean?
Fucking people.

115
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,500
Jesus Christ and other comedians
getting involved. Well what the fuck?

116
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,460
What is going on? Everybody acting
like a bunch of goddamn babies.

117
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,960
Fucking grow up. There you
go. Pill birth. Speaking out.

118
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,240
Vaguely. Vaguely at best. Um, so I
didn't do shit last night. Oh I know,

119
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:14,570
I know. I did last night. I got
absolutely fucking Hamad. Um,

120
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,270
got hammered when I get drunk.

121
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:21,130
I called the people I love and I leave
long rambling messages about how great I

122
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,780
think they are that I'm that guy.

123
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,720
So you get mad at me cause I
call you at three in the morning,

124
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,190
then you wake up in his lab. I was nice.
That was nice. He was speaking of me.

125
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,770
Um,
I actually,

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,720
I have one thing in my office that is
hanging on the wall and uh, it's a,

127
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,580
it, it's a pit bull
calendar. I don't know why.

128
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:47,020
I forget where I got it. I think, isn't
it called for the love of Pit Bulls?

129
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,650
Isn't that what it's called?
I think that's what my
calendar is called is great.

130
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,980
You just look at this adorable
pit bull for a whole month. Right?

131
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,810
And then all of a sudden the month change,
it's like,

132
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:59,620
I just changed it this morning for,
for March to April.

133
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,320
And I literally turn the thing and I
just went, no, I'll look at me. No bold.

134
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,030
And I just laughed at myself.
How pathetic I am. You know,

135
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,450
even my dog right now, my dog's laying
on the, on the floor, it's beds,

136
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,070
got his back to me. It's embarrassed,
embarrassed by its fucking master. Um,

137
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,290
master fucking magic. Give me a
fucking break and not as things master.

138
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,150
It's run the Goddamn House. Um,
Shit's wherever it wants to.

139
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,340
And then I pick it up. I'm
the master. I don't think so.

140
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,480
Does the master walk
around? Huh? Then again,

141
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,610
the dog is on a leash.
I Dunno.

142
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,410
It sounds like a bad 80 standup Dick.
Why?

143
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,990
That's a good fucking character.
How filthy Seinfeld. Um,

144
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,430
a bad impression of Seinfeld wellbeing.
Completely filthy. I'll work on that. Um,

145
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,410
well when you put your Dick in her eyes,
don't she always cry?

146
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,810
Ooh,
Ooh,

147
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,950
sorry. I'll go fuck yourself.
You fill an hour every week. Um,

148
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,840
anyway, so the Bruins and
making the playoffs, I don't
even know if they in yet.

149
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:17,510
I think that rent, I have no idea. Um,

150
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,130
we got to play the capital's tonight.
Nobody gives a shit, so whatever. So,

151
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,350
so Wisconsin,
the fucking white.

152
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:30,630
His team since the Washington
generals is playing Duke.

153
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,810
All right. The Duke, the Duke,

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm sorry they're playing Duke tonight
and I don't know shit about either team.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,120
All I know is that coach k always
seems to fucking win these games.

156
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:43,560
So what do you think's going to happen?
Huh?

157
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,890
Do you think these cheesy eaten
yogurt making ice cream sandwich,

158
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:53,100
scarfing down fat fuck of a
state is going to go down.

159
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,690
Where are they playing? Are they
playing the Lucas oil? If you know,

160
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,880
they actually annoyed me that they will,

161
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,170
that they sold it out there at Lucas oil
field and I was thinking about a gym or

162
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,890
say making all that fucking money,
you know, and it's just like, what,

163
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:11,910
what is he going to do now to try to
attack the Patriots because that fucking

164
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,380
jackass can't beat us.

165
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,000
Hm.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,580
Oh fuck

167
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,530
you fucking cunt. You such a, you know,

168
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,440
you stole our offense then you won a
super bowl. Isn't that enough? Leah?

169
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,160
Jimmy, Jimmy. Um, so ridiculous.

170
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,800
It's the only owners name
that I know him well.

171
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,310
We have an old Bobby Craft who made
all that money with the cheese, Denise,

172
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,870
which brings us back to
Wisconsin. Um, so anyways,

173
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:50,010
I'm going to watch that game tonight
and uh, and I think that's it.

174
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:53,240
I think that's all I got. I don't know
what else I'm going to do. I went to F,

175
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,490
I drank, I guess stopped drinking. Dude,
I drank way too much this fucking week.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,540
You know, I have nobody, you know
what is, I have nobody to answer to.

177
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,790
All right. You can sit there
and say that you know you're,

178
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,010
you're one of these people, right? Oh,
I'm one of these people. I just, you know,

179
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,690
everything in moderation.
Fuck you. Shut your face.

180
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,040
All right? You're wearing too much
makeup, first of all and shut your face.

181
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,423
Okay?

182
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,020
First of all, the reason why you don't
drink it cause you have a fucking boss,

183
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,960
which is like having a parent, all right?
So I don't want to fucking hear it.

184
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,910
You have somebody to answer to.

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,490
Anybody can be fucking responsible
and not drink when they have a child,

186
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,890
okay?

187
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,970
When they have a boss, when they have
somewhere, they have to be the next day,

188
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,453
all right?

189
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,780
When you really find your willpower and
what you're made of is when you have

190
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:48,510
none of those things. When you
have no children, you have no boss.

191
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:52,410
You have nobody to answer to. Your
wife's cool. You know, you snore.

192
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,330
She just sends into the guest room,
right?

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
That's when you find whether or
not you're an alcoholic or not.

194
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,880
That's when you see if you're really
going to pass the fucking test.

195
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,590
And I'll tell you right now, oh, freckles,
all freckles is failing miserably.

196
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,790
Oh my God. I was drinking. A buddy of
mine was fucking leaving town. So I,

197
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,010
we go out and we fucking drink and he's
got a buddy of his and at one point the

198
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,430
guy comes over with like, I don't know
what it was. It was some sort of fuck,

199
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:25,740
it was like red bull
with a Jaeger shot in it.

200
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,630
And I have to commend myself for
the, for everybody. Fucking drank it,

201
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:35,620
but me as like, I'm drinking scotch,
I'm a fucking drink in that. She says,

202
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,310
Christ fucking mouthwash and monster
drink the fuck is wrong with you,

203
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,630
but you're homeless.

204
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,750
I could literally go out to the dumpster
and find something better to get drunk

205
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,050
off of. What the fuck? What the four red
bull at a gate, whatever the fuck it was.

206
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,100
Okay.

207
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,430
Was given all of them shit. Like why
don't you just fucking, you know,

208
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:59,320
do a shot of shampoo and some fucking
licorice. Um, is that what you said bill?

209
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,640
Well, you know, I don't really remember.
I don't really remember. I just remember,

210
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,820
uh,
being smart enough not to drive.

211
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,360
I don't do Uber though. I'm old school
man. I got a taxi, but everybody can hug.

212
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,210
I'll do it. I'll fuck it over.
Yeah. It's just weird to me, man.

213
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't like just getting
in a stranger's fucking car.

214
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,010
Okay.

215
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,281
You know,

216
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:24,330
without that fucking partition there some
sort of writing on the side of the car.

217
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:24,571
You know,

218
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,610
a phone number of somebody you can
call off when the guy takes out an ax.

219
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,940
Okay.

220
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,331
I just,

221
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:33,950
I don't understand like
how lazy are serial killers
that they can't even fucking

222
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:34,790
muster up.

223
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,510
Okay.

224
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,420
Well I guess that makes them more,
I,

225
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,640
they can't even muster up
to fucking wear with all,

226
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:45,120
just to become an Uber driver.
Why don't you make your life easier?

227
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,870
Quit fucking pulling over and
dragging people in the car.

228
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,600
Why didn't you just become an Uber driver?
Just let him get in the fucking car.

229
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,210
Why don't you just do that?
Is there any checks and balances on it?

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,080
You just fucking show up and there's
a guy, hey, how you doing? Hey person,

231
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:05,760
I don't know what the company that,
I don't even know what it is.

232
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,910
Does it even exist? Is it in the
air? Is it a digital company?

233
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,230
I don't understand any of this shit works.
Speaking of that,

234
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:16,230
you know what's the dumbest fucking
thing I've seen in a while is the fucking

235
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,850
Iwatch.
I really hope that that thing bobs,

236
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,160
you really got to sit
there watching video.

237
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,430
Like you're fucking g can't figure out
what time it is and you just staring at

238
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:30,030
your wrist. Is that what you got
to do? All those stupid features.

239
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,020
I think they're out of ideas over
there. That's what happened. I'll,

240
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:35,220
Steve jobs died,
right?

241
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,710
He's not cracking the whip and
those scientists over there, they,

242
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,180
they getting lazy. What are
you gonna make next? Huh?

243
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,700
Earrings that you can watch
youtube videos on. It's, it's over.

244
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,800
Everything that needs to be invented
is invented and that's why all these

245
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,090
scientists are, that's
real reason. All these

246
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,570
scientists, they're dying.
You seen all this shit.

247
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,120
You had another dead scientist,
right?

248
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Alberto Har was a robotics
expert for NASA at the JPL.

249
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,710
And everybody in science knows
that that stands for, uh, the, uh,

250
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,950
jerk plain longitude.
Whether the fuck is,

251
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:19,320
he died instantly when a single
engine plane, nose dives,

252
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,700
fucking scientist. God, you have
scientists right nosedive shortly.

253
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,560
Have to take off Friday
morning from Van Nuys Airport.

254
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,970
He worked on two Mars missions and spent
years researching how robots work in

255
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,450
harsh environments like
volcanoes and underwater. Well,

256
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:35,830
I can tell you they work in volcanoes.

257
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:40,240
They'd fucking melt you to
do research on that. Um,

258
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,300
as part of NASA's team exploring
Mars with the curiosity rover,

259
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,030
ugh.
Maybe that's why he killed himself.

260
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,430
He had to keep what
project you're working on.

261
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,040
Just mumbling curiosity for over the y,

262
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,730
the curiosity rover.

263
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,650
Awkward silence at the dinner table
and then somebody with a GED started

264
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:07,640
snickering. Curiosity rover, let me get,

265
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,410
cause it's curious fucking eggheads.
It's the best she can come up with.

266
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,710
Bay was responsible for a device that
detected hydrogen on the planet's surface.

267
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,310
As the rover moved curiously
over the surf over the surface,

268
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:25,070
47 year old nasty that I'll fuck it all.
That sounds to me.

269
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:29,370
47 I'm going to be 47 in June.
Does that mean I'm good at Psi?

270
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,500
Um,

271
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
47 year old NASA scientist help Berto
Bihar helped to prove that there had once

272
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:40,610
been water on Mars according to
the sad daily mail. Oh well shit.

273
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:42,620
Daily Mail is a credible source.

274
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,310
Published two announced his recent
death in a plane crash that happened on

275
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,780
Friday in Los Angeles,

276
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:51,290
California while playing crashes do as
it is where you go into conspiracy theory

277
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,070
right here.

278
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,070
While plane crashes do
happen and scientists do die.

279
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,650
Uh,

280
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,650
Bay whores name has now been added to
a very long lists of scientists and

281
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:09,860
astronomers who've met their
untimely ends prematurely leading,

282
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,270
leading us to ask,
did bay hard know something that they,

283
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,740
that they in quotes don't want
the rest of society to find out

284
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,260
what the fuck could this guy is

285
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,290
possibly not. I don't understand what
people are saying. Was global warming,

286
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,990
so overwhelming to him and he knows
that the seas, we're going to rise.

287
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:32,660
So he just pushed the fucking
yoke forward. And that was it.

288
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,494
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

289
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,010
Okay.

290
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,280
This guy worked on robots.

291
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,560
They designed a device that discovered
fucking hydrogen a existed on Mars.

292
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,170
Okay.

293
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,290
How could that hurt it? I, I, you know, I
remember I used to be a conspiracy theory.

294
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,580
I still think that there are conspiracies
and I do think that, you know, I mean,

295
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:49,940
I'd done,

296
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,840
I'm conspiring right now to try to
somehow do some fucking hour and act like

297
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,940
this is entertaining.
So you guys will listen to this shit.

298
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,050
So you'll come out to my shows.

299
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:00,530
This whole fucking thing doesn't even
exist and here you are listening to it.

300
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,190
They can get here in some sort
of truth. Right? All right there.

301
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm going to debunk all of these six.
Why he

302
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,250
die. Um, because scientists are
underpaid and he didn't have a,

303
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,770
so he couldn't afford a twin
engine. So when this first one, uh,

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,100
the first one cut out, uh, you know,
he was kind of a, it's kind of fucked.

305
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,060
Sorry. I Dunno. John Rogers
Tropica disease expert.

306
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:30,690
Well maybe you got too close to the
disease and if you see the size of his

307
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:33,830
glasses, I think this is why,
you know what these fucking
scientists problems are,

308
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,710
is they read too much and they
ruined their eyes and then they get,

309
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,380
then they start flying planes and
they drive cars and they hit shit.

310
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,950
You know what I mean? It's got
a shock, you know what I mean?

311
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:47,790
Is your life is flashing before you and
that split second and then you know the

312
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,540
exact way you're gonna fucking die.
Cause you're a,

313
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,900
you're an egg hedge scientists.

314
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,440
So rather than me just flying towards
a tree doing the macgruber knew no,

315
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,110
they're actually going to,
the library does go to us

316
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,860
sliding against the front of the cradle
vortex and fuck. It can, they can just,

317
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,470
they can do all of that.

318
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,873
Yeah.

319
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,990
Wonder if they're going to be brain
dead, a male. This is just fucking more,

320
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:15,820
but all right, Glen. Thomas ades
and a bullet expert. Dan, we,

321
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:20,010
why don't you just work with poisonous
snakes while you're at it guys sitting

322
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:23,630
there juggling plagues while he's eating
a subway sandwich. No wonder riff.

323
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,170
Let me guess. Did he die of a bowler? Um,

324
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,960
and a spokesperson for the
World Health Organization. Well,

325
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,160
this isn't that the trifecta.

326
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,160
This guy just shuts everybody
down at the dinner table.

327
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,570
Maybe people were sick of him
dominating the conversation. Right?

328
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,690
This is my husband Glen Thomas.
He's an a Bulla and aids expert.

329
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,680
And what he's not doing that.

330
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:47,430
He's a spokesperson for the World
Health Organization. What do you do?

331
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,950
I tell shit jokes in a strip
mall. Um, a bola expert,

332
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,030
Glen Thomas,

333
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,480
who looks surprisingly like Chris
Elliot was among the 298 people who were

334
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,710
killed when a Malaysian airlines flight.

335
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,900
Mh 17 was shot down and cracked in
the UK. Well, what the fuck? Yeah.

336
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,560
Okay.

337
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,550
He got he. Yeah, I mean, what about all
the other people that, yeah, well that

338
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,390
died on there, but there was some
plumbers, couple of teachers.

339
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,740
How come everybody's paying attention
to the scientists? You know what,

340
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:23,280
this all this shit comes from.
It's the fact that everybody knows,

341
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,270
everybody knows everybody's got, yeah,
everybody's got some secrets. Right?

342
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,660
And you know there's people up there.
Just the excitement. They must have,

343
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,290
you know,
having the cures for diseases or whatever.

344
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,980
The just the shit that they
know, like say they, you know,

345
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:41,550
they're talking about this giant
fucking iceberg that's going to melt in

346
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:45,300
Antarctica, that's going to raise
the entire fucking ocean eight feet,

347
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:47,630
which I don't get.
It's like how big,

348
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,913
okay.

349
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,910
At what point is it
stopped being a glacier?

350
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,220
It's just all of Antarctica is melting.
You know what I mean?

351
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,030
And I don't understand how
Antartica right. It's just
all fucking ice. Basically.

352
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,630
You sitting there floating in the
fucking drink, you know, if you put,

353
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,830
if you put ice cubes in you, and this
is what I'm really going to sound dumb.

354
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,950
If you put ice cubes in a glass of water,
the water goes up.

355
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,560
So isn't that ice already in the fucking
water? I don't know what's going on.

356
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,540
No Bill. It's on land. Is it?
Is Their land underneath there?

357
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,420
I don't know what it is. I just
thought it was a bunch of frozen water.

358
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,640
And the reason for this is
the sun is hitting the top.

359
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,380
I used everything I want for my whole
life. Everybody told me the reason why.

360
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:35,700
Okay,

361
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll ask you guys this.

362
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:39,840
Do you know why it's hotter at the
equator than it is at the pulse?

363
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,440
Do you know why?
From my whole life everybody said,

364
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:48,270
well it's because you know it's
closer to the sun, you know,

365
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:52,370
because it kind of puffs out, right? Like
when you had too many donuts, it's gotta,

366
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,580
you know, or it's got a
little muffin top, you know,

367
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,340
it's got a lot of water weight down there.

368
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
Like so all of a sudden you're whatever,

369
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,640
you're like this club much close to the
sun it. That's actually not the case.

370
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,370
Just waiting for you guys
to fucking yell at me.

371
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,510
What's basically is is it's getting direct
sunlight and as the curvature of the

372
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:19,980
earth goes up, that sunlight angle,
it becomes more angled. And again,

373
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:23,090
you're not taking a, it's basically,
let's just put it in terms,

374
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,830
everybody can understand the equator
is getting a facial from the sun.

375
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,460
Okay. It's not wearing glasses
either. Okay. It's just,

376
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,970
it's just taking it right in the face.
All right.

377
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:39,520
The polls are kind of looking
away and fallen out of the
way. Right? That's basic.

378
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:43,010
What does it, so it's a
glancing blow. They still got
a little jizz in their hair,

379
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:48,011
but it's a lot easier to wash off and
that's why it's a hotter at the equator

380
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,000
than it is in the North Pole. You
see that everybody? I'm smart.

381
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,050
I know. Thanks. Now, like
everybody says. So anyways,

382
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,740
let's get on it. So how did this, how
and Glen Thomas Dye is understood?

383
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:04,460
He was one of them,

384
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,120
one of more than a hundred researchers
who were aboard the flight on their

385
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:12,800
weight or an international aids
conference in Australia. Oh,

386
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:13,880
Jesus Christ.

387
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,940
Yeah.

388
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,361
Wasn't it?

389
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,590
Because there was some more on on the
ground who couldn't tell the difference

390
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:22,930
between an f 16 in a seven 47

391
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:24,840
okay.

392
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,240
Maybe he had a quote, you
know, like those meter maids.

393
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,860
It just got to start writing tickets and
it was getting towards the end of the

394
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,290
month. The edge shut anything
down yet. And he was just
like, fuck it. I get fucked.

395
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,210
Fuck it up. They're moving.
I don't give a shit.

396
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,320
It's a fucking drone
or a Goddamn parakeet.

397
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,190
I'm shooting that fucker down and all
of a sudden they come flying over.

398
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,470
Yeah.

399
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,250
All right.
Mark Fairy.

400
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,070
Oh Jesus. Yeah. Grow Up.
Hey, you're fucking fairy.

401
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,790
You had to deal with that. His whole
life is poor bastard. 59 years old.

402
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,690
Nuclear engineer,

403
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,980
a renowned American engineer was found
dead in his hotel room in Salford after

404
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:04,900
his heart suddenly stopped working.
Isn't that mysterious? Isn't that weird?

405
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,670
But somebody could have a
heart attack at 50 died.

406
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,290
This is the dumbest conspiracy ever.

407
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,790
Mark Ferry 59 from Tennessee.
Well there you go.

408
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,190
Sort of Tennessee grew up on fried food.
Jesus Christ,

409
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,870
they barely even have books in that state.

410
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,560
The fact that this guy became a
nuclear engineer grown up, you know,

411
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,800
we didn't have shoes, right?
And he just sat there.

412
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:30,670
He was just this fun going anomaly
on his crickety front porch,

413
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:35,671
watching his whole fucking family
playing instruments they made out of the

414
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,770
fucking junk they had in their front
yard and he's just sitting there going,

415
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:42,940
I'm better than this. God dammit,
I'm going to start reading.

416
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,460
And he did. He started reading like Johnny
Appleseed, except instead of walking,

417
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,100
he was fucking letting his eyes walk.
Walking all over those books.

418
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,760
Yeah.

419
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,410
Turning them into apple sauce.

420
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,880
That's what mark ferry did.
I'm going to eulogize this guy.

421
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,640
Okay.

422
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,970
Mark Fairy wasn't dumb luck
the rest of us in this state.

423
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,550
Okay.

424
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,860
That mother fucker. I know
I'm in charge. I'm sorry.

425
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:15,270
Or I'm speaking from the heart here.
Okay. Is understands that mother fucker.

426
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:20,140
He said, I'm getting out of this state.
All right, I'm gonna. I'm going to read.

427
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:21,850
I'm a find me a book.
First of all,

428
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:26,851
you know he had to go to lease to Georgia
to discover he was walking the wrong

429
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:29,800
fuck and why you thought I was going
to say something good about Georgia.

430
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:33,790
Danielle. Fuck Damn. Fuck Damn. Bull
dogs, right? Go balls, golf balls.

431
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,330
So this fucker said, wait a
minute, I need to go up north.

432
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,910
That's where they keep all the books,
right?

433
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,520
Cause we lost one fucking war and they
got to take away all the books. I get it,

434
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,490
I get it.
So he walks up to Ohio

435
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,410
and he found himself a fucking book
and next thing you know he became him.

436
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:59,230
So he became a nuclear nuclear engineer.

437
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:04,060
I don't really know what that means
and I don't know what that does,

438
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:04,900
but he did it.

439
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,830
Okay,

440
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,480
you're not going to believe
what the fuck just happened.

441
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,800
My stupid recorder got full.

442
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,650
I fucking eulogize that guy
for like another five minutes.

443
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,790
God dammit say it's a conspiracy.

444
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,760
They shut off your little recording thing.
Let me finish this.

445
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,160
I got to go back to this guy mark ferry.

446
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,980
So he walks up to fucking Ohio,

447
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,630
get themselves a God damn book and
he becomes a new player engineer.

448
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,150
And as I mentioned before,

449
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:36,590
before the fucking Illuminati
shut off my fucking recorder.

450
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,530
I don't really know what
a nuclear engineer is.

451
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,990
I just know it takes a long time
to say it. So that's some shit,

452
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,060
but I'll tell you there's mark.
Very. All right. And I beat him up.

453
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:51,880
I call him a fairy. I did all that.
I never really even locked the guy.

454
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,570
Who the fuck's kitten. Who? Oh,
I'm sorry Martha. I had to say it.

455
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,770
I'm in God's house. Go tell
true. Come here number seven.

456
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,670
I want to ever, it is fucking bitch. She,

457
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,330
she deserves that won't see me outside.
Anyways,

458
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,880
this mark ferry.
All right.

459
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,740
Despite him leaving Tennessee,
he never forgot who the fuck he was.

460
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,690
I'll tell you right now,

461
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,270
ain't nobody up north dies of a heart
attack if 59 medicine southern shit.

462
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,140
All right. You know why that is? You know
why that is? Cause I don't give a fuck.

463
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:33,270
How far are you leave Tennessee.
You ain't leaving that died. Yea.

464
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Leaving had died and British gets
them ham hock and piggers sandwiches.

465
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:42,370
He probably had he probably a barbecue
grease all over their lab coat.

466
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,690
That's right man. A real
southern man. Y'All.

467
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:50,620
You've met southern man
that makes it to 60.

468
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,370
If you make it to 60 is to sell the man.
I hate you.

469
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:58,760
You're laying down with another man. I'm
sorry. Putting the whole phobia into it.

470
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,540
Well that's true.
According to the Bible.

471
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,340
Um, so there you go. Let it go.

472
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,990
Evidently mark ferry was not
a fairy cause he died at 59.

473
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,640
I blew somebody once to the truck stop,
but I didn't do it in this day,

474
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,520
so don't make a gay. Anyways, mark ferry,

475
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,360
he dead now and I'll tell you right now,

476
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:31,440
I don't think you're ever going to see
another nuclear engineer coming from the

477
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:34,410
state. You ain't going to see
another one like that guy in a long,

478
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,670
long fucking time. All right,
so everybody raise up your jars.

479
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,810
Okay.

480
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:45,180
It was shot at shine from our
fair. Um, recorder's still going.

481
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,960
It is still going. So basically what you
guys missed is, as I continued to read

482
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,080
these fucking like any conspiracy theory,
it's like the more you start reading,

483
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:59,730
you start believing professional Carol
amp. Bruster. Okay. She's 69 years old.

484
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,620
69 you think? Ah, she had a good run. She
was found by a roommate and a kitchen,

485
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,330
all right. With a knife in her neck and
she'd already been stabbed in the chest.

486
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,130
So it's just like, that's
usually not what's Ha, you know?

487
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:15,940
Okay.

488
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,360
It's the other one had been hogtied
and burn to death. It's like, what?

489
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:23,190
What are you scientists fucking gang
bang. And now, you know what I mean?

490
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,820
I'm starting to bleed the
shit. Here's what, here's one.

491
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,650
I actually believe Shane taught 31

492
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,910
phd in electrical engineering
with an expertise with gals,

493
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,970
gallium nitride, nitride, Shane, Todd,

494
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:42,040
the man with two first names.
All

495
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,700
right,
here's the mystery.

496
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,690
Dr. Todd felt increasingly uncomfortable
with the work he was doing with the

497
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:52,580
Chinese company. Who, who are we?
Who, who are we? Who the fuck are,

498
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,290
you know, so I can't, I'm
sorry. I can't do that.

499
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,190
Maybe if I did an a bad Chinese accent,
it will work. Oh wait, hold on. Fuck.

500
00:29:58,191 --> 00:30:02,990
Are y'all, um, to the point Shane told
his family sweaty. Got, who are we?

501
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,460
H U a Weei
man.

502
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:12,340
They must be cheesy commercials.
Any ways to the point.

503
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,700
Shane told his family that he was being
asked to compromise US security and he

504
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:19,210
feared for his life. Now this guy
got whacked. Of course he did.

505
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:21,130
What the fuck are you doing,
dude? You'll be over your fucking,

506
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,840
you're wearing the wrong
fucking lab coat here. Melissa.

507
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,030
Can nudie scientists have weird names?

508
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,280
She was hogtied and Bernard. I'm
starting to believe this shit. This guy,

509
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:41,260
58 died of a heart attack.
Zachary died of fucking boating accident.

510
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,610
That happens, right? Potomac.

511
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,280
Everybody's hammered on the fucking
botanic nother part. Attacks.

512
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:49,330
Heart attacks a dismissed.
Here's a weird one. Fan.

513
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:54,331
John Mang and Chung Yang
Sang [inaudible] Chung exam

514
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,900
table for two Zang,

515
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,230
a drown in a branch and
hotel swimming pool.

516
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,480
Both were in China. Both up were
from China and we're working, dude.

517
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,590
How the fuck does to people drop?

518
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,340
Two adults drown in a
fucking hotel swimming pool.

519
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,860
They don't even have deep ends anymore,
right? All you gotta do is stand up.

520
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,930
I mean, I'm going to go
up. Maybe they got drunk.

521
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,730
It's like fucking too
bouncy steps into the side.

522
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:33,840
You've got something to
hang onto. Oh, Jesus Christ.

523
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm starting to believe this shit.

524
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,560
Gregory Stone 54 from an unknown illness.
While that happens,

525
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,240
Bradley 56 died in a car crash. What?
You know, they're reading, they're,

526
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:46,320
they don't have good eyes.

527
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,093
Okay.

528
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,280
Dr Masud Alley.

529
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:55,281
Mohammed d 50 was assassinated January
11th when a remote control bomb inside of

530
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:58,740
his motorcycle near his car was detonated.
I mean,

531
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:02,250
that happens an avenue.
A buddy of mine the other day,

532
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,170
the professor of nuclear physics at Terra
in university was politically active.

533
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,040
Oh yeah. Yeah. He, this guy got
whacked. You should see his picture too.

534
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:16,041
It's like he knows it's coming and got
a couple more days left for this shit.

535
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,900
Jack P.
Wheeler,

536
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,400
the third 66 last seen December
30th found dead in Delaware.

537
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:27,840
A Delaware landfill. Yeah. He got whacked
anytime. He ended up in a landfill,

538
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:32,160
fought to get the Vietnam memorial built
and was served and served in two Bush

539
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:35,010
administrations. His death has been
ruled a homicide. Yeah, of course.

540
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:39,360
It has its price. That guy's a fucking
hero. That's a terrible one, is

541
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,740
it was a horrible website. It
can't stop reading it. Mark A.

542
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,740
Smith 45 do this guy looks like he's
90 that's 45 I'm a year older than that

543
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:50,154
guy.

544
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:55,050
Renowned Alzheimer's disease research
or has died after being hit by a car at

545
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:55,884
Ohio.

546
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,833
Yeah.

547
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,190
Is that suspicious? I don't know how many
of you can try to say this woman, Zane.

548
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,370
She was dead.
I'm an apparent suicide by cyanide.

549
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay.

550
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,170
At a temple terrace hotel,

551
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,580
she left a suicide note saying she used
cyanide Hazmat team officials said the

552
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:19,610
cyanide was found only in a granular form,

553
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,570
meaning it was not considered
dangerous outside of the room.

554
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:27,710
It was founded and chemical is considered
more dangerous in a liquid or gas form.

555
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,060
Potassium cyanide,
the apparent causes potassium cyanide,

556
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:35,750
the apparent cause of deaths as a
Kimberly come and use it. But I, I,

557
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,440
I don't understand what the fuck that
is. I mean, she said she, you sign,

558
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:41,640
I just fucking right there.

559
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,083
Okay.

560
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,580
Now the woman died at the hands of Amy
Bishop. Her background was in Jason's.

561
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,520
Who would've thought, it's so fucked
this, these guys are dying like a,

562
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,530
okay.

563
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,280
Bloods and crips here. Anyways, let's
get to the, uh, enough of that shit.

564
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,850
I don't even know what to believe anymore.
I don't even know what to say anymore.

565
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,660
What's going on? Um, all right,
let's get to some of the, uh,

566
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,200
some of the questions here for the
week. No, no, no. What am I doing?

567
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:12,580
I want to get to some of the advertising
trunk club. Everybody Trunk Club.

568
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,570
The first rule about trunk club is
you don't buy any more fucking shirts.

569
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,740
Trunk Club, guys, you might hate shopping,

570
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,990
but you still want to look good, right?
Do you want to look good for the ladies?

571
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:30,940
All right, well maybe you want to look

get back to the bullshit here.

660
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,090
Do you guys have a Nice Easter?
I had an awesome Easter.

661
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,820
My mother in law came over right? And
uh, she actually wanted to go to brunch.

662
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,090
Okay. And I was just like, oh. I was like,

663
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,680
oh,

664
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,600
GG age.
Oh my God,

665
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,370
I thought this was a day of celebration.

666
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,880
Why would you drag us into the
hell of Brunch on fucking Easter?

667
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,770
A yard of your mind, right? This how
cool my wife is. I just say to, I said,

668
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,750
she goes, do you want to go to Brunch
with me and my mother on Easter?

669
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,690
I was like, no, I don't.
I don't want to do that.

670
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:22,180
Why don't we go drinking on
St Patrick's Day? Why don't,

671
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,670
why don't we go out on new
years and go to Times Square?

672
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,470
The fuck are we doing here? She's
like, I know. That's right. I go,

673
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:32,200
why don't we just have brunch at home?
I'll make some eggs.

674
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,940
I'll throw in some fucking waffles
whenever you want. I'll cook it right?

675
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,440
She goes,
I got one better for you.

676
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:41,020
Why don't we just sort of some fucking
Chinese food? That's what we did.

677
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,690
Chinese food on Easter.

678
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,300
Don't Jewish people eat Chinese food
on a Christmas. I got to tell you,

679
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,860
I loved it on Easter. Why stop on
Christmas, those Jews, I'm telling you,

680
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:58,780
they're on to something. This fucking
Chinese food on on Christian holidays.

681
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:01,990
I'm all about it, dude.
It was awesome. We had a,

682
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,850
what do we have there? We
have, we had, uh, we had,

683
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,050
I don't know what the fuck
we had crab ran Google,

684
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,000
all that deep fried shit that's fucking
sloshing around in my belly right now is

685
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:13,834
tremendous.

686
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,230
And then she showed up with a lemon
meringue pie and that was my Easter.

687
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,700
No bunny, right? No fucking
going down to church.

688
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:25,930
And you've got to listen to the Jesus
story over and fucking over again.

689
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,320
You know what I mean?
It's such an amazing story.

690
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,930
You think that they could make a good
movie about it? You know what I mean?

691
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,070
I mean, technically it should
better than all of those

692
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,580
born identities, but it
isn't, I don't know what they
need. They should make just,

693
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,780
you know, if I look the Catholic
churches, who's kidding, who,

694
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:46,010
it's sliding down a grease
pole. You know, nobody's buying.

695
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,390
Nobody's going anymore. All
right? It's like it did.

696
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,130
It's like the Jacksonville Jaguars of the,

697
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,830
of fucking religions as far as you
know, old stadium. Nobody's showing up.

698
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,280
Plenty of seats. What do you want to
sit down in front? Get you got it.

699
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,760
It's all you. All right. You can hang
out with the fucking players afterwards.

700
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,640
So when I would do is I would,

701
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,530
I would invent like the eye
Catholic church, you know,

702
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,900
just rip off apple to get these kids.
You get flat screens in there, right?

703
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,060
You do. You get Tupac, whatever they
did to him where he became the, the,

704
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,740
the homogenized version. Where the
fuck is it? The the Holyoke graph.

705
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,430
What the hell has it? Because
it was an h, a holograph,

706
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,450
a little cube, whatever the
fuck it is. You do that,

707
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,650
but you just do it with the priest.

708
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,130
You have some of the best priests
of all time. The two parks,

709
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,210
the fucking biggie smalls of priests and
you bring them back to life just like

710
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:48,200
Jeeva. Fuck it. You just bring
Jesus back. That's what you do.

711
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,090
Yeah.
If I'm up there right,

712
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:53,420
he comes down from the fucking all
pixelated coming down from the ceiling.

713
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,310
You know what I mean?

714
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,780
People don't believe it's him
at first day. Oh, what are you,

715
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:02,270
did you fucking make dad?
You shoot that with a potato?

716
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:07,160
Laughing my ass off on the floor over
here, shaking my head. That guy, you know,

717
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:10,040
you got to take a little shit
from the Twitter Razzi right?

718
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,370
And then all of a sudden you
just, you just keep saying
no, that's actually Jesus.

719
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,840
Right. And if you watch that
thing on Scientology like I did,

720
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,550
you know what I mean?
What did you learn?

721
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,780
Other than the fact that it just takes
2,600 lawsuits at the same time and the

722
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:28,030
IRS will cave. Uh, that's the only
thing I learned other than that is,

723
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,700
is that, you know, is that they all,
they dress like they're in buck Rogers,

724
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,140
which is, you know, it's kind
of cool, right? I'm going to
space movies. No, I ain't,

725
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,520
what the fuck? I'm saying
you get some flat screens,
right. Get some Chinese food,

726
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,260
you go easy with the guilt and
you bring them back, you know,

727
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,620
and you try as hard as you can
to not fuck any more children.

728
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,410
And I think he could turn this
business around. This is like,

729
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:53,210
that's what does that,
what does that show with?

730
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:57,980
A guy comes in and he's tries to to fix
your bar. What's it called? Bar Fixer.

731
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,830
Huh? Dive doctor. Whenever the fuck
they is, some stupid name, right?

732
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,680
It comes in your fucking beer. Tap
smell whacked. My wife's but Jen. Oh,

733
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,360
July. When she gets off and
elliptical. All right. Just

734
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,720
even at people about their dumb ass bars.

735
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,780
Do you just got to do that
with the Catholic Church?

736
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:26,130
You just go in there screaming. He
why's that guy? Fucking a child.

737
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,050
All right. Can you turn the whole
fucking thing around? What would it be?

738
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,100
Gotta be alleged literation like Christ
fixer, but it's gotta be with another c.

739
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,530
Cry.
Christ crier.

740
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,690
Jesus. Jammin I don't know
what the fuck you call it.

741
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,760
Christian mingle.
How bad is that Christian mingle.

742
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,370
How fucking creepy is mingle
that's going on here and mingle.

743
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,710
I really want to see your tits.

744
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,750
It's just seems like you'd just
be mumbling a bunch of shit.

745
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,100
I don't want to see it. There's no
fucker. No three way. Oh, I'm sorry.

746
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,800
All right, here we go. Let's,
let's, let's read some of the, uh,

747
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,360
that's really some of the
fucking questions here for
this week, shall we? Well,

748
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:09,900
I don't give a shit. I'm
running shit. Okay. By the
way, if you'd like to email me,

749
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,870
if you'd like to hear me read out loud
something that you wrote and butcher it,

750
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,090
uh, emails can be sent
to bill@thempodcast.com.

751
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,370
If you would like to follow us on Twitter,

752
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,220
you can go to at the m m
podcast. All right, here we go.

753
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,370
Here we are a hug if somebody were
rough on here. Okay. All right.

754
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,640
It is my husband to cheat.
Dear Bill,

755
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:38,230
and I'm a 34 year old fucking lady
and had been married for six years.

756
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,660
I'm hoping you can help me with some
advice on my marriage. For the most part,

757
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,370
my husband and I are pretty similar,

758
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,580
but we have completely different
outlooks on finances already already.

759
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:57,190
I'm already thinking sexist shit
here, so I got to stop. All right.

760
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,440
I'm picturing you just buying a bunch
of dumb shit that any of fucking you're,

761
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:05,130
you're driving them to an early
grave. But let's see. Maybe, maybe,

762
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,600
maybe this guy is a cunt. That'd
be openminded here. All right,

763
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,860
open mind. My husband works full time
and I work part time myself and I'm,

764
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,900
and am a

765
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:23,160
startup with my husband works full time
and I work part time myself and am a

766
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:26,940
housewife. I swear to God that's how
she wrote the sentence. Should be.

767
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:30,210
And I am a housewife and am a housewife.

768
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:34,800
You'd never have fucking three short words
that begin with a in a row myself and

769
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:38,280
am a housewife and Ama and am a housewife.

770
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,120
That's awesome.

771
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,020
My husband works full time and I worked
part time I thought and I, my house,

772
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,040
like I get it. You fucking spoke
this into a speaker, right?

773
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,330
That little magic device on your
phone. Um, early in our marriage,

774
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,760
we both work full time,

775
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,600
but it became difficult for me when I
would clean the house on days off and he

776
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,680
would not be helpful in sharing
those duties. Oh, this guy,

777
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:05,280
he's old school lifting his feet up
as you come by with the fucking swift.

778
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,210
Um,
he would Paul's,

779
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:12,540
he would just play video games and
I'm not a clean freak or anything.

780
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,750
I just don't like living in a
shit show of a house. Oh my God.

781
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,920
I fucking love this woman. You're right
up my alley. Uh, before we were married,

782
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,240
he would let dirty laundry pile up for
weeks before he washed it. Jesus Christ.

783
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,810
This guy's an animal. I probably
should've spoke to him about it,

784
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,140
spoke to him about that before we
got married or live together first.

785
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,070
But I did not see it as a huge
issue at a time. Uh, you were young.

786
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,010
What did you know? Anyways,
after a year of marriage,

787
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:43,510
we decided that the best way would be
for me to do the housework and work part

788
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:48,040
time and make dinners while he worked
full time. Jesus Christ, this fucking guy,

789
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:52,720
he's crushing it. You know, he's,
he's got an old school wife here.

790
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,880
Listen, listen. You quit your dream.
I'll live mine when I come home.

791
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:00,970
You better have this place tidy
with the fucking steak on the table.

792
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,500
Um, all right, here's the issue.

793
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,640
Here's the issue with our marriage
and I would love your opinion.

794
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,230
This is where if I was her girlfriend,
we'd be clasping both hands,

795
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,320
both of our hands across the table.
This is what I need. You. Okay? Oh,

796
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:21,510
I'm here for you, Karen here
for you. Just get it out. Uh,

797
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,570
my husband is very, um, it's
very conservative with our money.

798
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,430
This guy doesn't have one redeeming
fucking thing. He's a slob.

799
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:33,320
He's a fucking tightwad.
I hate this guy. Um,

800
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,810
he will save and keep our 20
grand in our finances for any,

801
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,030
well that's smart though. I
don't know. He's kind of smart.

802
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:44,950
He will save and keep our $20,000 in our
finances for anything that could happen.

803
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:48,010
I admire it and think it's very smart.
However,

804
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,390
he loses sleep over it and we were rarely
will go out and do anything together

805
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:56,690
as a couple. Yeah, his guys, he's, oh,
he's taking it too far. All right. Um,

806
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:01,300
we make enough money between the two of
us to pay our bills and save. Mind you,

807
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,410
you don't get a fucking reprimand. Me. Um,

808
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,040
he gives me a sum amount allowance
every month to buy groceries and other

809
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:13,090
personal items.
If I use another card,

810
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,450
he will confront me and tell me
not to use the other debit card.

811
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,510
And if I am low on funds for groceries,

812
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,240
we need to buy ramen for
the rest of the month.

813
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,010
All of our arguments are about money,
I believe in saving money.

814
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,450
But at the same time,

815
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:32,560
I think it's great to live a little and
buy items for enjoyment from time to

816
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:37,240
time. I love to go out somewhere fun. I'd
love to go out somewhere fun on a date.

817
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,230
Oh my God,
dude,

818
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:42,820
this is sad with my husband without him
worrying about money the whole time.

819
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,240
I can't buy concert tickets without
asking him first to surprise him.

820
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,690
Like he's kind of,
he's fucking likewise.

821
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:55,060
He never surprises me
with anything either.

822
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,950
If this thing ends with you
on your fucking hands and
knees scrubbing the floor

823
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:02,860
boards cause he wouldn't even
buy you a fucking swifty. Um,

824
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,790
what should I do? I've confronted him
about how I think his fear is unhealthy.

825
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:11,380
Am I wrong? I'm telling you. She goes,
I'm telling you it's a rough one. Okay.

826
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,930
I love it. I love that you threw that in
there. She's got a sense of humor. This,

827
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,820
I think this woman's cool.
Thanks.

828
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:21,730
I love your comedy and listened to your
podcast every week. Uh, go fuck yourself.

829
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,140
All right. Yeah. This, this
woman's a fucking champ.

830
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,920
The amount of shit putting up with

831
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:33,300
all right. She's got a sense of humor.
She's listened to the podcast. I Aye. Aye.

832
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,790
Aye. Oh, maybe she snow me, I think. I
think, I think you're totally cool. Yeah.

833
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,070
This guy needs to fuck
and he needs to relax.

834
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,203
MMM.

835
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,620
I don't know. What would
you do here? Just say, look,

836
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,600
something's got to change here.
All right.

837
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:51,590
Cause I haven't been to a fucking
cheesecake factory and like nine years.

838
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,830
Right? You gotta take me this guy.
He this guy. You know what it is.

839
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:59,710
He doesn't understand. He
doesn't understand women.
He doesn't, he doesn't eat.

840
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,150
He doesn't get it. You guys
like to go out, all right,

841
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,120
and I think you're cool enough that you
don't like what the fuck doesn't like to

842
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:06,820
go out. That's such a
dumb thing. I just said,

843
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,400
okay.

844
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,960
I, I, you know, I'm too stupid to explain
it, but I totally get what you're right.

845
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,910
This guy needs to take you out.
All right?

846
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,150
It needs to remind you why you guys
fell in love. He needs to, you know,

847
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,190
just go every once in a while,
just say, you know what? Fuck it.

848
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:22,510
Okay,

849
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:26,740
let's go out and just blow fucking a
couple hundred bucks on a meal, right?

850
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,480
That's it. And then we just, Jesus
Christ, if you spent too much money,

851
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:34,690
it's ramen noodles. I mean this guy,
it's like this. This guy sounds like a,

852
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,610
he grew up during the,
during the depression.

853
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:41,080
I am you in your nice enough to admire
that he thinks about fucking money.

854
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,780
You got 20 grand saved up,
which is better than most people.

855
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,360
He could just loosen the purse strings.

856
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:51,850
Let a couple of nuggets fall out once
every six weeks for Christ's sake. Um,

857
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,440
what do you do there? Uh,
how do you go about that?

858
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,170
I don't know. A tightwad that's a tough
one, man. It's cheap. Guy Is just a,

859
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,440
just a cheap person.
They just fucking cheap.

860
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,490
Yeah.

861
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,190
That's like, you're not even going
to enjoy life for Christ sake.

862
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:12,903
MMM.

863
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,390
I think you got to start roofing in
them. I hate to say it, but you know,

864
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,020
every once in a while the date
rape drug is a, it's called full.

865
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:26,900
I think you need to fucking, this is
what I would do. No, you can't do that,

866
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:30,080
so you can't do that. That's fucking,
I'd say I would just fucking,

867
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,640
okay.

868
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,180
Give him the date rape drug.
Let them pass out at the table.

869
00:52:35,181 --> 00:52:38,870
Then I would just go out and booze it up
and then I'd come home and it'd be like,

870
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:42,620
and he'd just be like, did I, did I
fall asleep? I the kitchen table. Okay.

871
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:45,110
Last night. Yeah. Yeah,
you did. It was weird.

872
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,480
It was like you were
eating the ramen noodles.

873
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:54,620
It just, you went facedown
in it. I'll tell you.

874
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,430
Thank God you're too cheap to boil
water and that water was at fucking room

875
00:52:58,431 --> 00:53:00,290
temperature.
You might've burned your face.

876
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,623
MMM,

877
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:09,500
I you, you either got a roofie
them is in Goa are, are you good?

878
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,830
Are you got to just say,
listen, I need to go out.

879
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:13,970
Okay.

880
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:14,803
Okay.

881
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,080
I can't keep living like some fucking
broadened a fucking miserable fairy tale

882
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,100
that's waiting for is for,
for fucking prince charming.
Didn't show up. All right,

883
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,340
here's the deal.

884
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,660
Fuck. Oh, once a month you're
taken me out. All right.

885
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,440
You're making me feel like a fucking lady.
You're making me feel attractive.

886
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,160
All right, around, I'm going
to start fucking working again.

887
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,040
I'm sitting here watching
your sweaty balls,

888
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:45,540
fucking underwear and you can't even
take me to a Goddamn Chuckie cheese.

889
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,910
Huh? You cheap content. I
Dunno how to do you know what?

890
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:54,690
Maybe he's listening to this. Don't take
her out for Christ's sake. All right.

891
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,170
Listen, the dollar's going
to collapse anyway. See,

892
00:53:58,171 --> 00:53:59,790
a 20 grand is going to be worth shit.

893
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:03,690
So why don't you go out and fucking buy
a pork chop with it while you still can.

894
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,540
There you go. All right, here
we go. Fear of damnation.

895
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,500
Dare Bill.
Growing up Catholic.

896
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,040
Hello

897
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,760
Gj age.
My parents instilled me,

898
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,950
I'm still me with a, a healthy fear
of damnation. Like so many others.

899
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,620
As I got older,
I grew away from the church,

900
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,950
but the fear of going to hell
was never far from my mind.

901
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,940
This is why it's funny that everybody
made fun of the fucking Scientology movie.

902
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,160
Just San us a cult.

903
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,490
Those people are fucking crazy as
opposed to what the shit we're doing.

904
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,710
I love Scientology for the simple fact
that they sued the fucking IRS and they

905
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,780
went, all right. All right.
All right. Jesus Christ.

906
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:47,640
These people are crazy and they beat
the IRS. That goes a long fucking way.

907
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,830
All right. A couple of kids die
every year due to the common cold,

908
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:56,820
but other than that, I think it's a good
religion. Um, over the course of my life,

909
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,660
I've had many opportunities to wrong
others somewhere out of necessity and some

910
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:06,510
due to my own greed or poor judgement.
Jesus, this took a fucking left turn.

911
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,500
Did I miss a paragraph?
Um,

912
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,450
I lie awake at night with the details
of each sin running through my mind,

913
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:16,500
how it affected those people I hurt and
what their lives would be like had I

914
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:19,110
never altered it with my
own destructive presence.

915
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,730
What the fuck did you do to these people?

916
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,400
This guy sounds like a
worse person than me.

917
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:27,700
This sins weigh on me as they should and
I wondered if I'm going to burn in hell

918
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:30,600
for the things I've done or if I
could possibly turn it all around.

919
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:34,470
The Bible provides some
details about the afterlife,

920
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,350
but doesn't get too specific
about how each person is,

921
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,300
but it doesn't get too specific about
how each person is tormented when they

922
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:47,250
reach hell. Well, don't ever read Dante's
inferno. You don't want to read that.

923
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,400
My biggest fear is that after I die,
I would arrive.

924
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:53,130
And while burning in the internal fire,

925
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,920
your plot chess would
be playing on a loop.

926
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,333
Ah,

927
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:07,290
fucking hilarious. Please
help me. I'll do anything.

928
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,510
Give to charity, save a
puppy. Whatever it takes.

929
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:14,500
I have to redeem myself somehow so I
won't have to hear your voice yammering on

930
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:17,620
about the NFL and cackling
at your own jokes forever.

931
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,473
Yeah.

932
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:26,670
Ah, you got me. You of a bitch.
That's fucking hilarious. Um, alright.

933
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,350
Icebreaker.
Bill.

934
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,430
I'm terrible at starting a
conversation with the girl.

935
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,100
I'm good in an actual conference I'm on.
And why that guy?

936
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:39,610
Why don't you just not listening to
the podcast? You know what I mean?

937
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,370
Maybe he listened to one and
I was so fucking annoying.

938
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,080
Or you know what's even better?

939
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:48,640
Maybe he works with somebody and they
played in like the warehouse. Uh, do what?

940
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:52,240
I'm sorry. I know I'm annoying. I
can't argue with anything you said.

941
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,370
Ice Greg icebreaker.
Bill.

942
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,990
I'm terrible at starting a
conversation with the girl. I'm good.

943
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:02,980
In an actual conversation.
What does that mean?

944
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,350
Oh, okay. So you can just like if somebody
says, uh, Hey, welcome to fucking daddy's.

945
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,700
Can I help you? You're like, yeah, I
like texted a placket dude. I'm crushing,

946
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:16,150
crushing that Shit. Um, anyways,

947
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:19,720
but I rarely get anyways.
I'm good in actual conversation,

948
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:23,620
but I rarely get there because it starts
off bad. What advice can you offer?

949
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:27,070
Do you have any lines or topics that
would work? Thanks and go fuck yourself,

950
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:30,520
dude. You just going to have to learn
to have a sense of humor about yourself.

951
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:32,500
You're going to have to fucking bomb.

952
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,120
Okay.

953
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,300
You just kind of have to go up and bought
me this. There's no fucking, hey baby.

954
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:41,440
What's she assigned line that
works? You've got to just
come up. Here's the thing.

955
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:46,270
Don't, if you're not good at hitting on
women, don't go to a fucking meat market.

956
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,433
All right?

957
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,430
Okay.

958
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:53,160
What you gotta do is you got to chat
him up while you're just doing a,

959
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,540
just do it. It's been so long
since I've been fucking singing.

960
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,070
I was never good in the meat market bars.
I was always better.

961
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:04,120
Like I met women on the train. I met
him in like the fucking gym. Okay.

962
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:04,870
Yeah,

963
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,100
I met him like,
uh,

964
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,600
like when we were doing like we're
both riding on a fucking trade,

965
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,730
you know what I mean? And there's no, they
don't, they, I, they have their guard up.

966
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:15,280
I guess you're not going to be
a mugger the fuck would I do,

967
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,690
how would I talk to them on a train?

968
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:21,260
I would just wait for someone if I saw
someone that I liked on a train. Uh,

969
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,820
the only way I could start up a fucking
conversation is if some crazy homeless

970
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:28,160
guy got on the fucking,
you know,

971
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:30,800
some crazy person gone on the subway
and everybody's got that Oh shit.

972
00:58:30,801 --> 00:58:32,210
And then you make eye contact with them.

973
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:34,820
And then I always had a joke about the
fucking homeless guy. That's right.

974
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,790
I took the piss out of somebody who didn't
have a house and that would break the

975
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,830
ice and then maybe,
you know,

976
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,240
okay,

977
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,900
no, you're on the subway.
It's like speed dating.

978
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:46,430
You got to try and get the fucking
number before they get off. Um,

979
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:47,270
okay.

980
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,990
But if you're not good at conversation,
you've got it. You got to get good at it.

981
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:56,090
And, um, I would say the
Jim, Jim's kind of creepy,

982
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,280
hey, what are your working on? You know,

983
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:01,250
she's fucking bent over doing bent
over rows. Whatever the fuck it is,

984
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,740
the only advice I have for you,
it's just like doing stand up.

985
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:07,550
You just have to get on stage and you
just see you have to figure it out. Um,

986
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,510
so that's what I would do.

987
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,310
I would get over your fear of bombing by
getting out there and just bombing and

988
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,280
have a sense of humor about
how fucking bad it's going.

989
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,340
Laugh at yourself and it
just keeps swinging away.

990
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,030
Just keeps swinging away. I don't
know, just uh, go go Ron Burgundy.

991
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,560
Just be like overly arrogant about
yourself. How fucking awesome you are.

992
00:59:29,561 --> 00:59:30,460
And just say the,
the,

993
00:59:30,461 --> 00:59:33,730
you know that she's thinking all this
awesome shit about you. You know,

994
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,900
if you're an average looking guy,

995
00:59:34,901 --> 00:59:38,230
she'll think it's fucking hilarious
and you kind of taken the piss out of

996
00:59:38,231 --> 00:59:42,620
yourself is that angle, you
know what I mean? I mean I
don't, I don't fucking know.

997
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,220
You got, can I ask a married guy?
I have no fucking idea anymore.

998
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,500
Somebody helped us. You know
what? Why don't you guys,

999
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,560
why don't you guys send me in your best.

1000
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,160
Okay.

1001
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,330
Icebreaker lines.

1002
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,550
Okay.

1003
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,100
The only one I think I ever had a good
opening fucking line was when I wanted to

1004
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:00,380
hit on this woman who was,
I already told you this.

1005
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:02,810
I wanted to hit on this woman who
was with this woman who was a redhead

1006
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,290
and I walked out my, what did
I say? I said, Oh, I go, oh
hey, another redhead. I go,

1007
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:10,280
you go into the meeting,

1008
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,940
and then a friend left and then the red
had thought I was into her and I had to

1009
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:14,390
do like,

1010
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,180
you know that swim moved that rushers
do when they get trying to get to the

1011
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:21,740
quarterback. I had to fucking push her
out of the way and talk to the Brunette.

1012
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,400
And then she was like fucking
annoyed that I was hitting on her.

1013
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,640
And then her friend I think
caved to the pressure of,

1014
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:30,860
or conti friend or maybe she
just looked at me like a,

1015
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:35,480
I don't want to fucking talk to you. I
made her laugh though. I got one laugh.

1016
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,590
I think I got one laugh.

1017
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:42,100
And in all my years in those meat
market bars, oh, that fucking horrible.

1018
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,050
Fucking horrible. You
know what dude? I Dunno.

1019
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,410
You're asking another person that's
stuck at it. I can't help you.

1020
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:49,150
So how bout uh,

1021
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:55,290
how bout a listener's gimme your best
and your worst fucking opening lines,

1022
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,170
your best and your worst results.
And I'll read those next week or whatever.

1023
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,450
And with any luck,
that guy who hates me,

1024
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,200
someone will be playing it in the
fucking background. Neighborhood bully.

1025
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:09,130
Hey Billy, bag of donuts. Hey Bill,

1026
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,180
I am 15 years old and I want to know how
to deal with the kid who was bullying

1027
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:14,410
my six year old brother.

1028
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,450
Okay,

1029
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:20,500
well you go fuck them
up. Step on his head. Uh,

1030
01:01:20,501 --> 01:01:23,800
we live in a cul de sac and all the
neighborhood kids know each other.

1031
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:26,740
They often play at the end of the
cul de sac in somebody's backyard.

1032
01:01:26,741 --> 01:01:30,310
I just recently learned that my friend's
brothers sometimes brings over a friend

1033
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:34,030
who's seven years old and this kid goes
over to the backyard at the end of the

1034
01:01:34,031 --> 01:01:38,500
culdesac without the person who brought
him and starts playing with the kids who

1035
01:01:38,501 --> 01:01:41,440
belong to the neighborhood.
Jesus Christ.

1036
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:45,380
Isn't that just called kids playing with
each other? Now it's all supervised.

1037
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:48,500
The problem is that the kid is an asshole.
He calls my brother's names,

1038
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,330
cause my brother names for no reason.

1039
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,630
I know my younger brother isn't
lying based on his body language.

1040
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:56,600
Now I need your advice
on what I should do.

1041
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,460
I told my brother to come get me so
I could come over and talk to him.

1042
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:05,360
I was going to be as intimidating
as possible without yelling or being

1043
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:09,060
threatening by completely
keeping my calm and emotional

1044
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,940
and emotionless as he tried.
Wait a minute.

1045
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,500
What the fuck just
happened to the sentence?

1046
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,920
I was going to be as intimidating
as possible without yelling or being

1047
01:02:17,921 --> 01:02:22,921
threatening by keeping completely calm
and emotionless as he tried to bust my

1048
01:02:23,121 --> 01:02:27,690
balls. Wait, what the fuck happens?

1049
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:29,850
Would that sentence that was in
the past and in the presence,

1050
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,710
you tried to do that and
then he bust your balls.

1051
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,203
I don't know what's going on here.

1052
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,510
I don't necessarily know if this is a
good idea. I was looking for advice.

1053
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:38,170
Should I tell my friends moms,
so this sheet,

1054
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,600
this little shit can never come back.
Thanks and go fuck yourself. Ps,

1055
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,710
if you are reading this on Friday,
April 3rd it's my birthday.

1056
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,660
I'm not reading it Friday, April 3rd
but happy belated birthday. All right,

1057
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:52,723
that's okay.

1058
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:53,380
Okay.

1059
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,500
That fucking email was in
like 12 different times zones.

1060
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,520
So what should you do? I don't
know. Just walk up to him.

1061
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:05,430
You're 15 he's seven.
Hey Yo.

1062
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,040
You know what's great about
that age? If he, if he,

1063
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,030
if you catch him off guard with a hey,
they might piss themselves a little bit.

1064
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,380
You just walk up right behind him.
He just go high like that.

1065
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:19,170
Like fucking ps himself and can
I talk to you? They'd be, Hey,

1066
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,860
can I talk to you for a
second there again, that's
my little brother over there.

1067
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:27,180
He's, he's telling me you keep
calling them bad names. What's,

1068
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:30,900
what's going on with that? Me just
let them sit in the awkward silence

1069
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,250
and then when he tells you why
he's doing it, just say, look,

1070
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,720
if you keep doing that to my
brother, I don't know. I, I'm just,

1071
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,250
I don't know what I'm going to do,

1072
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:45,690
but I just keep picturing my entire hand
covering your face and then me throwing

1073
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:48,630
your whole body like a baseball
over that fucking fence.

1074
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,250
You don't want me to do that because
you weigh enough while you might land on

1075
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:58,110
top of the fence and that could, uh,
that could poke into your entrance there.

1076
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,370
Do you want me to do that? Because
I don't want to do that. All right,

1077
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,010
well then stop fucking with my brother.

1133
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:18,690
oh, the last one. 20 year
old blonde female request.

1134
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,640
All right. That's already annoying
because you feel like what? Why?

1135
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,440
Why do I need to know?
You're a blonde female and how old you are

1136
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:30,360
you trying to get preferential
treatment here ladies? No. Okay. Bill,

1137
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:34,920
my boyfriend and I absolutely love your
podcast. You're a favorite comedian, Yada,

1138
01:07:34,921 --> 01:07:37,080
Yada, Yada. Could you ask,

1139
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,150
yeah,

1140
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,570
I'm not going to say the name and your
next podcast to marry me and I'm not

1141
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:45,240
saying your name. Go Fuck
Yourself. Love this person. Ps,

1142
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:46,760
when are you coming to Portland,
Oregon.

1143
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:49,250
I'm going to be coming
to Portland in June.

1144
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:54,530
I'm putting together another
little bus run that will include,

1145
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,870
it's going to be Portland,
Oregon. Uh, Eugene. No, you Rica.

1146
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:04,010
Sorry. Oh, sorry. Sorry.
The people in Oregon. I just
fucked up. Portland, Oregon.

1147
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,840
You Rica,
California.

1148
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,410
MMM.

1149
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,250
Where else?
Fresno.

1150
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,910
Why don't I just fucking look it up here.

1151
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,080
It's all going to tie into that
Vegas tour. And then I think I,

1152
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,410
we ended up somewhere in Tucson.
It's going to be great.

1153
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,240
It's going to be me and
Joe Barton, Dick, and, uh,

1154
01:08:25,241 --> 01:08:27,730
I think I'm going to get law and
in a couple of those fuckers too.

1155
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,880
It's going to be a great time.
So anyways, as far as me, well,

1156
01:08:30,881 --> 01:08:34,240
I ask your boyfriend to marry you.
No.

1157
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,600
Why would I ever do that to another man?
First of all, you're only 20 years old.

1158
01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:41,010
You're too young to get married.
All right? And as a guide,

1159
01:08:41,011 --> 01:08:42,220
like the amount of Guy Code,

1160
01:08:42,221 --> 01:08:44,890
I would be breaking to put this
guy in that fucking position.

1161
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:49,210
There's no fucking way I would
ever do that. You know what I mean?

1162
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,350
And since I've been married,

1163
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:53,950
I've never been that person that said to
a couple that isn't married. You know,

1164
01:08:53,951 --> 01:08:57,440
when they did Holly, you
guys, man, I ain't got nine.

1165
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,230
We have kids. When are you having
kids? When you shut the fuck up?

1166
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:07,420
That's when we haven't kids. Um, all
right, that is the podcast for this week.

1167
01:09:07,421 --> 01:09:08,950
Everybody.
Uh,

1168
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:13,660
congratulations to the Wisconsin
Badgers and the Duke Blue Devils.

1169
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,090
I'm hoping for a great
game tonight and uh,

1170
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:21,120
my condolences to the fence of
a Kentucky and a Michigan State.

1171
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,460
Um, I watched both of those
games. You know me, I'm a
fucking, I love college hoop,

1172
01:09:27,461 --> 01:09:28,690
but I'm a fair weather fan man.

1173
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:32,110
I watch a lot of hockey and then this
time of year I always jump in and I'd jump

1174
01:09:32,111 --> 01:09:36,790
in. Um, I just watched
the final four games and,

1175
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,860
and watch the, the final,
that's all I do. So I don't,

1176
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:43,850
I don't know what to tell you. All
right. I'm a bandwagon guy. I am.

1177
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,360
I'm showing up with a brand new funnel
for fucking hat tonight. No, I'm kidding.

1178
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,191
I'm going to watch it over.

1179
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:51,130
A buddy of mine's house was
actually a Duke blue devils fan,

1180
01:09:51,131 --> 01:09:53,350
so I don't know who I
want to win this one.

1181
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:58,580
I like coach k one and another one just
so we can become more of a legend, but a,

1182
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:00,760
I'm trying. Hey, well, let me look
this up. When's the last time?

1183
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:02,530
Wisconsin when a fucking championship.

1184
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:04,933
Yeah,

1185
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,970
Wisconsin. How do you spell it? Wisconsin.

1186
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:13,620
How do you smell it? Wisconsin.
Stop eating fucking cheese.

1187
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,200
Okay.

1188
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,390
Uh,
Bass last basketball.

1189
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:21,130
Why don't I put the fucking microphone
down so I can type faster. Last basket

1190
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,860
ball.

1191
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,760
You guys can get on with your day
at this point. This is just for me.

1192
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,230
Champion ship.

1193
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:33,060
There's some fat guy driving a Chevy Luv
somewhere in fucking Rhinelander right

1194
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:37,400
now with a big red
jacket on. Screaming. Um,

1195
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:41,030
college basketball badges.
Men's basketball. All right,
here we go. Here it is.

1196
01:10:41,031 --> 01:10:44,480
Every Wikipedia.
We're going to go on Wikipedia.

1197
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:47,000
I'm going to guess that
they want it in the 1950s.

1198
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,490
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. All
right. All right. What do we got here?

1199
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,670
NCA tournament champions.

1200
01:10:55,790 --> 01:11:00,790

final four in 1941 2000 2014 and 2015 the

1201
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:06,500

They haven't worn it since.

1205
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:21,530
Fuck Hitler was still alive the last time
these guys won. I got to root for them.

1206
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,780
I've got a roof for the underdogs
were [inaudible]. All right,

1207
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:28,190
so I'm going to root for the badges
tonight. Uh, although I liked both teams,

1208
01:11:28,191 --> 01:11:31,850
I don't give a fuck. I have
weird allegiance, you know,
I'm one of those people.

1209
01:11:31,851 --> 01:11:34,550
I like Ohio State and Michigan all
at the same time cause you know,

1210
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:36,350
Adam on from either state,

1211
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:39,560
I just want to see a good game
and I'm really happy that, um,

1212
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,960
that that fucking guy with Bill Clinton,
the hips is now coaching fucking

1213
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:49,580
Michigan. The fuck's his
name. Gavin come back there.

1214
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,610
John Wesley Harding.
I can't remember anybody's name.

1215
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,680
His brother coaches the ravens and thinks
there's not enough air in the balls.

1216
01:11:57,681 --> 01:12:02,360
And that's why he fucking

Oh, freckles is coming to Florida.

1220
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:18,980
Don't ever forget that.

Texas. The South is the south.

Holy Shit.
The fuck song is that?

1236

I didn't know what the hell it

1237
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,890
If you want it, you know something.
I, I actually feel bad for that guy.

1238
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:37,521
That doesn't like that.

1239
01:13:37,521 --> 01:13:41,240
I laugh at my jokes because he's that
rapper who laughs at his shit and he

1240
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:45,490
drives me up the fucking wall to
who's that guy where he's like,

1241
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:47,120
I agree.

1242
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:52,390
Fucking idiot. He does that too,
but I'm still looking at it.

1243
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,390
It's like, okay dude,
look at her. Teddies like,

1244
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:01,480
I don't know what your snickering
about Mobile Alabama, man.

1245
01:14:01,481 --> 01:14:03,820
They built all those fucking
ships in World War II.

1246
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,980
I learned that watching that
Ken Burns documentary. Wow.

1247
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:13,910
Mobile Alabama. That's fucking,
then we're driving up to Lexington,

1248
01:14:13,911 --> 01:14:18,420
Kentucky. Oh my God. This is going
to be the sickest fucking tour ever.

1249
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,190
And then we go to Evansville,
Indiana,

1250
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,660

1252
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,090
you know what I'll do, I'll do a little,
uh, I'll do a little preview here,

1253
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,250
a little preview on my other tour in June.
You guys don't have to listen to,

1254
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,500
to podcasts. It's over, man.

1255
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:41,100
You just listen to me fucking talking
to myself in my apartment at this point.

1256
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,313
Um,

1257
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:43,580
yeah.

1258
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,460
All right.
None of these are confirmed.

1259
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:46,990
Okay.

1260
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:51,910
Except for the Vegas date. All right. But
rumor has it all right. I heard a rumor

1261
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,320
that that bill is going to be Portland,
Oregon.

1262
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:57,830
Okay.

1263
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:01,730
I'm going to be an a Eureka,
California. I got to reno date,

1264
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:06,380
possibly Santa Rosa, San Jose,
Fresno biker, feel Highland.

1265
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,203
And uh,

1266
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:13,230
then I'm definitely doing two nights
in Vegas at the Mirage casino and then

1267
01:15:13,671 --> 01:15:17,090
Tucson, Arizona. This
is, this is the idea.

1268
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,430
Okay.

1269
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,850
That we're trying to put this
fucking thing together and uh,

1270
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,200
I'd go on there with Joe Barden,
nick,
