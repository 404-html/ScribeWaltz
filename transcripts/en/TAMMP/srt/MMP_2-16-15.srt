1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,200
Okay.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,190
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:06,700
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,660
February 6th, eighth, and
I'm back in the USA baby.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,130
Finally I should say I'm back home,
back home.

6
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:22,320
And home is where the hardest. Don't you
think? I actually, I have a new recorder.

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,090
I don't know if the levels are too
high here. I have no fucking idea.

8
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:30,040
I can't really hear myself. Um, the old
girl finally died. I mentioned last week,

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,460
the Olympus Ellis 10 is what I had.
And uh,

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,180
they're all the way up to the
14th. And I got the 14, which I'm,

11
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,070
I seem to be enjoying so far,

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,970
although I can't stand
the fucking lady voice.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,840
Every button that you hit,
it goes like recording

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,900
back to main menu and it's this
fucking English lady. It's like,

15
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,850
what the fuck are you doing? Why, why?

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,140
When the fuck did an American accent
just become like, you can't have that.

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,560
You can't have it on like you're,
uh, like all these fucking,

18
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:05,650
one of those things that I advertise on,
on this podcast.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,480
It's like they try to give you like a,
for your voicemail,

20
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:12,310
you have some sort of international,

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,810
just not from America voice and all of a
sudden it makes it sound like you. Okay.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,250
Wow. I like this company. They must
be fucking people over globally,

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,680
all over the world. They fucking
did you. Did you hear this?

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,250
Okay?

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,990
Did you hear the outgoing message?
Oh, hello. Welcome to pink Barry.

26
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,800
All of a sudden I think I'm getting
a higher class fucking yogurt

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,970
because what?
Because it's got an English accent.

28
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:43,930
What the fuck is it with the goddamn
English that everybody thinks it's so

29
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,940
fucking,
you know what it is?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,290
It has to do with the fact that we're
over here on our own God damn island.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,260
All right. And if it actually
had some sort of French accent,

32
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:59,710
all it does is remind you that you can't
fucking speak the language, but what?

33
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,980
Like English, all of a sudden it
starts to sound a little hoity. Toity.

34
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,300
You know who I blame for all of this?
I blame Madonna.

35
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
All right,

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,450
let me tell you something
about that fucking lady there.

37
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,970
All right.
She's from fucking Detroit.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,720
She grew up side outside
of that fucking hell hole.

39
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,520
Okay.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,270
A, by the way, you know something? Oh,

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,260
let's complete the thought bill for
the love of God. See it through. Okay.

42
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,950
She grew up outside of
their fucking hell house.

43
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:33,240
She does a couple of fucking woopty dudes
around the world singing her dumb ass

44
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,600
song in our mustard colored pumps and
all of a sudden she's got a fucking

45
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,310
English accent.
It's annoying.

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,213
All right.

47
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,300
I've lived out here for fucking
coming up on eight. All right.

48
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,440
I still like, I still sound
like a go down the tarp pike.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,940
You know I was just over
in Asia that it come back.

50
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:57,890
Sounded like I was from fucking India.

51
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,403
Yeah,
know.

52
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,470
I mean Madonna,
how much he is searching.

53
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:04,650
Okay.

54
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,570
How bad was your fucking childhood?

55
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:10,600
How bad was this country that
you felt you had that you had it,

56
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,530
you move to another one and then
you took on their goddamn accent.

57
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:14,670
Like they wouldn't notice.

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,370
Yeah.

59
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,600
Why am I jumping all over her?
All right. Favorite Madonna Song?

60
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,501
What would you like?

61
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:25,380
Would you like the guilty pleasure or
would you like the one that I actually

62
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,550
liked the musicianship.

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,480
What's the guilty pleasure one? Oh
God. It was one of earlier ones,

64
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,653
you know,

65
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,590
before she got into all of that.
I don't know what the fuck she was doing,

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,700
you know, before the sex book, you
know? Or it's just like, you know,

67
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,420
I'll fuck anything her those
years. It's like we get it,
we get it. All right. Yeah.

68
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:54,260
Like you like Dick, you like women
too. You like Dick and women.

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,770
You know you liked that
fucking fat guy in a,

70
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,460
in the Monty python,
get a better get it buck.

71
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:05,390
I'm going to sell APP except
it's with Dicks. You know?

72
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,630
It's like this new thing I've
noticed with comedy with women,

73
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,150
like that's like this fucking,
it's considered edgy.

74
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,640
If they talk about the clamps and it's
just like, you know, with all due respect,

75
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,890
you just sort of a bar hack at that point,
aren't you?

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,600
Aren't you just doing Dick Jokes? Because
it's a vagina. All of a sudden, you know,

77
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,450
they're taking good shoulder,
their bodies. It's like,

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,930
I don't give a fuck what you doing?
You're doing a dick joke.

79
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:31,970
My acidic with the pussy.

80
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,590
It's the same fucking shits like Sam
Smith with the Tom Petty Song. Right?

81
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,880
It's the same fucking thing.

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,510
Okay.

83
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,640
No, ah, stay with me. Um,

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,310
it's just a fucking Dick joke.
We could,

85
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:51,120
everybody stopped losing their fucking
minds over a dick joke because now it's a

86
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,760
pussy joke.
It's the same fucking joke.

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,370
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So
let me get this straight.

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,020
If you're shooting a loaded somebodies
face, you're just a fucking, you know,

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,950
a blue comic.
But if you're taking the load to the face,

90
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,240
you're groundbreaking. Is that how it work
with you? God Damn kids today. Well, Hey,

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,640
more power to you.
And by the way,

92
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:16,790
I'm just fucking with Sam Smith because
that song doesn't sound anything like

93
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:21,050
the other song. I guess when you speed up
and slow down the other then yeah. Yeah.

94
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:24,590
Then I guess it is the same
sound is the same song.

95
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,370
But like at no point that I ever listened
to it and think of that Tom Petty Song

96
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,120
and not to mention Sam Smith
Song was way fucking better.

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,220
And you know, there's people
out there that actually say, um,

98
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,370
what kind of going like,
what the fuck? When uh,

99
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,070
when he said he had never heard that Tom
petty song and like everybody was like

100
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:50,010
flipping out mostly older people don't.
What do you mean you didn't hear that?

101
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,130
That big hit? That was a hit when I was
a kid. This is the thing that you got to,

102
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,250
you got to know about, about
these to the kids. Dot. Right.

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,440
They don't even know who
the fuck Paul Mccartney was.

104
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,100
Paul Mccartney came out and sang with
Kanye west and like kids in their twenties

105
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,590
they don't know who Paul Mccartney is.

106
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,110
Some of them don't even know
who the fucking Beatles are.

107
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,350
And then those kids who
know who the Beatles are,

108
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,770
they listened to the Beatles and they go,
what's the big deal?

109
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,780
These guys are overrated because
they're fucking songs are 50 years old.

110
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,900
At least the early ones.
She loves you. Okay. Okay.

111
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,120
Yeah,
all that Shit,

112
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,400
all that shit in right then their,
their, uh, their end shit there and shit,

113
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:41,960
the shit that they did right before
they broke up is as old as me. 46, 44,

114
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,100
45, 46 years old. They don't
know where the fuck they are.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,210
So if you don't know the god damn
beetles are, if they come out, you know,

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,960
with Kanye West.
Okay.

117
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,900
And he sings a fucking song with them,
they're not going to know who the fuck he.

118
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,480
Yes. He, she looks like a, he looks
like he should be like a civil war.

119
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,480
Reenactor now he's actually
more revolutionary war.

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,880
When I think of a Sir Paul Mccartney,
I fucking hate that shit.

121
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:15,340
I hate how over in England they
date night people dumb it set.

122
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,870
Then what do you have a
little fucking pretense?

123
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:21,260
Sword fight really is Paul Mccartney
of fucking, he's knighted now.

124
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,011
What's he gonna do?

125
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,810
Go storm a castle in a far away land or
is he just going to put on a big silly

126
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,950
necklace and get down on one fucking DEA?
How the whole fucking stupid.

127
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Um, but anyways, yeah,
I, for the life of me,

128
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,741
I didn't notice it.

129
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:40,160
That was the same song and I don't
get how that guy gets sued, but lady,

130
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,290
a lady Gaga, it doesn't.
With that Madonna Song,

131
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,910
which was the exact same fucking temple

132
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,360
and I guess the same chord progression
and all of that shit where I would go in

133
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,420
into like clubs or whatever and just
regular people with singing the Madonna

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,280
Song along to the Lady Gaga Song.

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,080
I didn't fucking ever think of the Tom
Petty Song with the Sam Smith Song and

136
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,320
what I love is the second the
lawsuit comes around, then everybody,

137
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,590
all of a sudden everybody's Phil Spector.
Now everybody fucking heard it, right?

138
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,340
Everybody's got a gun in some fucking
horse mouth going admitted, admitted.

139
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,120
It's a Tom Petty Song, right?
Isn't that what he did?

140
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,760
Can you imagine being in a studio with
that fucking weasel who's walking around

141
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:29,270
with a goddamn gun coke dial
up or whatever the hell he is?

142
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,410
I just don't understand how people
get into a situation like that. Like,

143
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,260
how bad do you want to make
it that you stay in a studio?

144
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
The first time that guy waves the
gun around, it's like, Hey Phil,

145
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,190
I'm going to burger king.
Do you want anything? Yeah,

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,090
you pull an amps absentee father.
Thank he just abandoned the whole thing.

147
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,450
What's he going to do, do you
think? A guy that fucking crazy,

148
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:56,010
he still drives,
probably has some old fucking Limo,

149
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,360
you know, really high roof so
he can hold his fucking wig.

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,560
Um, anyway, she'll listen it
to the Monday morning podcast.

151
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,850
I hope this thing is recording.

152
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,940
I really hope it is because I
can't hear myself right now.

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,240
I have a bit of a cold.
All right.

154
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,140
I just flew around the world
and the last fucking thing,

155
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:19,980
I still can't believe I just
did that Shit, man. Um, hey.

156
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:24,981
You know what seems like a really hacky
fucking city to go to is a Dubai and

157
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,240
that's just from landing there and
then seeing all their advertising,

158
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,700
you know?
Do you remember that?

159
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:36,660
What was that fucking commercial they
had where they fed those dumb whores?

160
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,070
Uh, oh, you know what,

161
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,870
I'm trying to get better
with the add here.

162
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,230
Borderline is my guilty Madonna pleasure.

163
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,980
And then my favorite,
uh,

164
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
fucking actual song is bad girl cause of
all Mar Omar Hakim is that he said his

165
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,740
fucking drumming on, that's the shit. Uh,

166
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,110
and actually when they played it live,

167
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,310
live on Saturday night live a
long time ago. I remember, uh,

168
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,380
just watching him playing the drums on
that and thought he was fucking awesome.

169
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,190
Um, but it's a classic
radio hit. You know,

170
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,410
you listen to it three times in a
row and you're like, you know what?

171
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,090
I don't think I have,
want to hear that song again.

172
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,080
And then you've got to wait like three,

173
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,310
four years and then you listen to it
again. Like oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah,

174
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,690
shut it off, shut it off. And that's
what, you know, you have a head.

175
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,010
Um,
so Sam Smith gets fucking sued.

176
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,770
What about that new song that
Bruno Mars is singing on?

177
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,560
Cause that dam funk gonna give it to you.
I mean,

178
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:42,420
how many fucking times it's that
Song Ben Written. Don't believe me.

179
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,930
Just watch how many times is
that line been written? Doh,

180
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,460
Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh to this.

181
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:53,880
Here's that same song that save
song comes out of his summer.

182
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,460
Oh Jesus. Hey. Don't
believe me. Just watch.

183
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,450
Um, but whatever the fuck
you saying, I have no idea.

184
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,590
Uh, what was I talking
about now? I just all Dubai,

185
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,310
that lecture seems like a,

186
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,990
if Jersey shore was given out just to
open fucking checkbook to make a Goddamn

187
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,040
city,
that just,

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,990
that's what it seems like that with the
little bit of a fucking car Dashi and

189
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:35,820
Calabasas vibe to it. Like it
seems like when people go to Dubai,

190
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,330
they come back and I imagined
they would say shit like,

191
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,600
like Dude Day had a Lamborghini store
next to a Ferrari store next to a water

192
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:51,150
slide where you slitted of champagne,
you know,

193
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,030
all this fucking horse shit.
And then outside the city they got like

194
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,030
a fucking tent city of all these fucking
basically modern day slaves that had to

195
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,480
build the whole fucking thing just
by sitting on the airplane because we

196
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:08,160
connected and do by. Um, after we
left Mumbai, that used to be Bombay.

197
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,980
Bombay is now suing Mumbai,
just like Tom Petty suits.

198
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,300
Sam Smith to same fucking city.

199
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,130
There's too many of the same letters
in Mumbai that was in Bombay. Right?

200
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,680
Would that be just the A,

201
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,400
there's no fucking way I'm trying to do
this in my head anyway. Spec to Dubai.

202
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:29,580
So we,
we connected in Dubai by the way,

203
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,610
to then depart flyover.

204
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,450
I ran and then over Russian,
I'm fucking as an American,

205
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:39,120
I am nervous flying over Iran.

206
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,360
But then when I looked at the stewardesses
and they kind of had those little

207
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,110
fancy little head dress things
on, I'm like, oh, okay, wait,
I think we're all right.

208
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,160
I think I'm on the right team here.
I think I should be all right. So,

209
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:55,161
but they had all these advertisings
advertising's advertisements for Dubai for

210
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,830
all this stupid hotels over
there. And that's, it just,

211
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,300
it reminded me of that commercial a long
time ago where they had like, uh, uh,

212
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,090
do you remember was just
some shitty restaurants

213
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,210
like olive garden or it was
like a Domino's, you know,

214
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,020
dominoes is fucking hilarious too with
their whole ad campaign where they just

215
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:20,470
admit that their product sucks, you know?
Well, you know what, you guys, you know,

216
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:24,850
you're right. I mean, we
ate it tastes like shit.

217
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,240
Okay.

218
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,500
We couldn't believe how bad it was
either. We agree. We're joining it.

219
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,880
We're joining it like, like during
civil rights. She can't stop it. See,

220
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,710
you join it and then
you take control of it.

221
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,160
I had some of that page site and Ah,
I thought it tastes like shit.

222
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,090
Ask not what your paycheck
Joe for. Yep. Yep. Nope.

223
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,590
Right.
They just joined the fucking thing.

224
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,080
They come to our side of the fence.
We're yelling at Deb gold.

225
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,830
Your pizza sucks. And then they just join
our cry. Yeah. Yeah. It fucking sucks.

226
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:03,611
And then we'll yelling at,

227
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:07,660
nobody in the whole thing goes away and
then they come back with their fucking

228
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:11,740
pizza. It's the exact same God damn
price. The lovely Nia said it the best.

229
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:15,100
She goes, why don't you charge more
than five 99 for a fucking large?

230
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,200
Maybe you could put a
little more into the product

231
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,680
and when you really think about it,

232
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,270
that's should have been the
ally when people said that
pizza sucks, but okay. Hey,

233
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,440
it's five 99 for a large. All
right, you broke son of a bitch.

234
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:33,490
I'm just trying to fill that hole
in your belly. Okay? Yes. Sucks.

235
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,690
But I have a couple of beers and starts
to taste better, doesn't it? All right.

236
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:41,680
Then who else is going to bring in this
much fucking food for that little of a

237
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:46,090
price at two o'clock in the
fucking morning, Huh? Nobody.

238
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,920
Nobody. We all know what
you do. This is what you do,

239
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,630
you or okay, you put in an order, right?

240
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,700
For one large pizza. Okay. Providing,

241
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,420
and then you pick another address out of
the fucking phone book and your order.

242
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:05,350
Fucking three of them,

243
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,930
but it's close enough to the other house
so they know that you're coming to your

244
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:08,501
house first.

245
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:11,530
You would have four largest
for that fucking place and
then you have one of your

246
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:15,130
friends hide in the fucking bushes across
the street. That Domino's guy pulls up.

247
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,220
All right? He jumps out of the car
and he's going to leave it unlocked.

248
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:21,670
He brings your pizza up to the car while
you're paying for that PC of friends go

249
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,560
and they steal the other fucking pies.

250
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,760
Then you run around the fucking house
and he got four pies for five 99 okay.

251
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,860
That's how it was done

252
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,010
anyways,

253
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,320
we should just go out and just grab them
and then just eat whatever the other

254
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,020
people fucking ordered and then you know,

255
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,630
a lot of times it was something he
didn't want like a vegetable pizza,

256
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,660
which is so fucking stupid. It's like you,
they have vegetables. Eat something bad.

257
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,930
Okay. Stop with the yard and you already
have the guilt is you're eating this

258
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,693
all right,

259
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,820
it's cheese topping or Salami, Salami,
Pepperoni, mushroom, something like that.

260
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay enough with the fucking
peppers and all of that shit.

261
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,980
You know how much heartburn
and you're trying to get here.

262
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,460
So then what we would do is we then
eventually we'd start to order pizzas.

263
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,051
You know,

264
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,980
that we want it a little further down
the street knowing that that come to our

265
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:09,814
place first.

266
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,150
Occasionally it didn't work out and then
they just went to somebody's fucking

267
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:16,450
house and they were like, we didn't order
that shit. Oh, are you serious? Yeah,

268
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:18,580
I'm serious. And then they come to our
house and then we'd still steal it.

269
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,500
And that's how you did it.
That was how it was done. Um,

270
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,760
but it wasn't Domino's. What, what was
that? I'm trying to talk about Dubai here.

271
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,310
That fucking commercial,
I think it was all of garden

272
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,080
where they had these people sit down and
they had cloth Napkins and they had all

273
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:39,410
this fucking pomp and circumstance.
Right. If that's how you say, um,

274
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,650
just pump and circumstantial evidence.
Right.

275
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,170
And then they're eating this
pasta and they go, oh my
God, it's so decadent. Right.

276
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,340
You know what I loved was they had
a bunch of animals eating the shit.

277
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,390
So of course they think it's great.
The second you throw a cloth Napkin.

278
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,200
Okay.
It's somebody that goes to a tanning bed.

279
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,350
I mean they automatically think that
they're eating a five star fucking meal.

280
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:03,790
You've already,
you've already mind fucked him.

281
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,990
It's like those psychological tests where
they give them a pill that doesn't do

282
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:08,381
anything,

283
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:11,350
but you tell him it's going to make
him feel better and then they convinced

284
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:12,640
themselves that they feel better.

285
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,303
Right.

286
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,310
To me is like what Dubai
is. Dubai is like, you know,

287
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,830
if you took olive garden's Pasta,

288
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,620
however they're trying to make it steady,
you know all the bread you want.

289
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,580
Like that's, that's Dubai. That's what
it seems like to me. Having said that,

290
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:36,180
I'll still fucking go there
if I get a Gig, you know,

291
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,480
so I'm just trying to sell the shit that
I would say if it was more of a free

292
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:44,400
fucking area, cause God knows how
go there, you know Jesus Christ.

293
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:49,150
I'm going to go over there just to
see what I have to wrap Nia in. Oh,

294
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,630
oh, I'm going to have a good
time at one of those countries.

295
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,660
I'm going to talk all kinds of shit.

296
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,910
I'm going to make me a walk
like five feet behind me.

297
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,720
Okay.

298
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,750
Nia looked down at the floor
when you walk behind me.

299
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,090
Oh, that's great. They got it down over
there. Huh? You just wrap them all up?

300
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,980
Yeah. That's, you know what
they are actually doing?

301
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:14,710
They're actually admitting how
much smarter women are that men,

302
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,140
the fact that they have to have them
on that level of control. You know,

303
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,730
what were they doing before then?

304
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,270
They must have just been running shit
and they're just like, we can't fuck it.

305
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,290
You know? Why don't you
put your foot down? Okay,

306
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,380
fucker. Right. We'll wrap them up.

307
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,630
We can't see what they look like then
they can't use their but Japanese to, to,

308
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,230
to mess with my,
our minds.

309
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,860
I just don't understand
why you would do that.

310
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,643
Yeah.

311
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,260
She's gotta be crazy.
Like when you're fucking,

312
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,270
I guess you're definitely gonna marry
somebody that you love because you can't

313
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:56,390
see what they look like. You know?
Because guys will put up with a lot,

314
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,500
okay.

315
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,680
If the woman is beautiful the same
way I'll, I'll lady, we'll put up,

316
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,170
if you've got money and you're
making money and you can provide,

317
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,680
they're going to put up with way
more shit than they should. You know?

318
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,260
And it's true.
As much as nobody wants to admit it,

319
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,380
we all want to sit there and act like
where that fucking Badass that has a line

320
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,950
in the sand that you won't cross.
But give me a fucking break.

321
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:18,470
If she's a 10 that there's no line.

322
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,000
Sure you got it down there and
she's stepping over oil all over it.

323
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,570
And what are you going to do? You're
going to walk. You want to walk.

324
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,780
You know you should walk when you get
in your car and you drive away fucking

325
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:30,614
bitch.

326
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,010
You know what? You treat me like, dude,

327
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,183
you fucker.

328
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,430
All right, I'll let shit you say
in your car. And then what happens?

329
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,950
That fear voice in the back of your head.

330
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,350
What if this is the best fucking person
I'm ever with it and I never find

331
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:54,220
anybody else. I grow it. Dick, you're
feeling you're flipping back and forth,

332
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:56,980
but you're not going to do it, right.
The same thing with the broads.

333
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,210
They do the same thing. Okay? You walk
around, you got yourself an ATM card,

334
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:04,120
you buy them a couple of trinkets down
on a mall and all of a sudden they start

335
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,880
feeling comfortable,
right? Next thing you know,

336
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,700
you take a little bit of
your frozen yogurt and you
flip it right in their face.

337
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:14,530
And what do they do? You know, do they
leave yet? No. Do they pouch share?

338
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,930
They do. You know, but
they're not going anywhere.

339
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,860
You just bought him a couple of fucking
tee shirts over at the hot topic. Oh,

340
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,540
what the fuck are they going? Huh? Sorry.

341
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,850
That was really negative.
All right, let's uh,

342
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,990
pursue a little bit of advertising here.
Um,

343
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,820

All right, here we go.

344

Everybody dollar shave club doe.

345
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,340
Can someone tell me when
racers got so damn expensive,

346
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,650
could someone tell me when
they're going to change the copy?

347
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,820
Okay.

348
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,390
Especially cause they're trying to
rate fund is the same jokes every week.

349
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,610
Have I been asleep for 20 years.

350
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,720
I was in the store the other day and
one pack of razors just now. 20 bucks,

351
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,490
one pack. That's crazy.
Exclamation point, but hey,

352
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,760
hey. Sometimes they give you a free
gift when you buy, they're overpriced.

353
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:08,340
Rage at raises, which is actually a punch
in the Dick. That's such a great joke.

354
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:12,420
Once A, don't get beat up by
ridiculous razor prices. Look, dude,

355
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,340
I don't need to read all of this.
You know what the deal is?

356
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:18,030
You go to a fucking cvs, they're going
to charge you out the ass for this stuff,

357
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,050
all right? It never should have been that
high and it's been that high forever,

358
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,830
but for whatever reason they've been
able to get away with it. For finally,

359
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:30,600
the geniuses at dollar shave club, they
filled the goddamn void, all right?

360
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,831

send your handle for free, and every
month you get replacement blades.

365

384
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,480
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't,

385
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,480
and it makes me feel like it makes me
think about old people wearing underwear,

386
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:10,040
which is really gross. You need another
feeling of great fitting young underwear,

387
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,820
nice and tight under your chin.
You changed your ball bag there.

388
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,100

Alice's restaurant for doing this?

392
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,560
I guess I'm not making any money.

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,130
Me undies is the most
comfortable underwear you will

and they literally pull
moisture rows away from your

00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:51,180
skin. See a steak stay cool. I

400
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,930
I had to check because that's
how comfortable they feel.

401
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,510
They have cool styles for both men and
women and all. They all look great.

402
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,160
Check out the photos for yourself.

You can get fatties and turn
their lives around, right?

429
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,800
How many times you've seen an absolutely
beautiful woman who needs to lose a

430
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,270
little bit away,
right?

431
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,250
You could sit there and you can help her
big find that beautiful woman inside of

432
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:48,521
it,
right?

433
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:52,690
And then you're right there and you
know the weight in your head when you're

434
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:57,580
going to ask her out. Right? Cause
she just a piece of meat to you. Uh,

435
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,930
the National Academy of Sports Medicine
even offers specialization courses like

436
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:11,470
MMA conditioning. Oh, that's the shit.
You know what's so funny about that?

437
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,870
How many that's going to be like
the new fed, the MMA workout,

438
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:16,420
and everyone's gonna have a sledge
hammer and tipping over tires,

439
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,790
doing the rope thing. You're
fighting anybody. Yeah,

440
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:21,750
go do some Chin ups.

449
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,820
So many one of those ad companies figured
out that if you say it three times,

450
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,170
they're going to remember
it. You know? Wait,

451
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,130
what should I say here?
What should I say three times?

452
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,120
That'll make you fucking do it.
Uh,

453
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,130
okay.

454
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know what I'm thinking.

455
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,000
I feel like you've got a hyper
Joe to Rosa date here for best.

456
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,660
It's taking a bunch of heat
out there and let's see,

457
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,680
it was Joe to Rosa going to be yet
Joe to Rosa de Rosa due to do to,

458
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,820
to, to, to, where is he?
Where is he? Where is he?

459
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,690
Ah, Christ. He'll come
up here in a second.

460
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,550
My fucking computer and
just love on your computers.

461
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:38,010
Just the shit for like three
weeks after you buy it. Yeah.

462
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,380
It's the fastest thing out there
and then it just sucks after that.

463
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,430
Such a fucking rip off. Anyways, what
did I want to talk about this week?

464
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,040
Um, American sports.
Let's talk about that.

465
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,170
I have no fucking idea who's doing what.

466
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,250
I know the Bruins were playing really
well right up to the all star break and

467
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:59,850
then we, uh, I don't know if we can have
an a it bit having a rough one, you know?

468
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,220
Um, I think we lost a van. It's
the beginning of a big west coast,

469
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:07,370
a trip here.
And I got,

470
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,810
I got to get back into a
watching that type of stuff. Um,

471
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,490
I do have to tell you, I fucking,
sports are awesome over here. You know,

472
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,080
we have at least three really
exciting sports, football,

473
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,910
hockey, basketball or fucking
exciting goddamn sports. All right.

474
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:31,380
They have basketball over in Australia
but it's called Netball and women play it

475
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:35,760
in. There's no back board. I can watch
that little bit, but the rules are,

476
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,410
I can't remember if they
can't dribble or some shit.

477
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,810
Like they get it then they just have to
stop and I'll see any dunking or any of

478
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,120
that type of stuff.
But um,

479
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,680
I'm looking forward to
getting back into it. But um,

480
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,630
I have no idea what's going on.

481
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,170
One of my buddies up in Canada to gave
me shit cause I guess we got swept by the

482
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:58,350
Canadians, um, for this season.

483
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,280
It's so sad to listen to the Canadian
fence gloat about that seasoned sweep is

484
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,560
complete, you know? Yeah.
There's just Stanley Cup.

485
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,280
What do you guys done in the
last 20 years? Lose the expos

486
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,400
you think? I give up. Fuck
that. We lost a Montreal again.

487
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,260
We just won another championship. We won
a super bowl. All right. In a real league.

488
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Montreal's not that poor shit
CFL thing. Yeah, I've up there.

489
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:27,541
All right.

490
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:31,110
We're bubby Barista can go up there
and it's fucking throw for 500 yards or

491
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:35,040
meters, whatever the fuck you call
them up there. Every God damn game

492
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,860
me a fucking break.

493
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,960
Did I already did I already
break new city's balls.

494
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,720
Do you realize that the fucking city
of Boston with four teams has one,

495
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:49,520
one more championship then the,

496
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,850
then the fucking city of New
York has professional teams.

497
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,530
We would have enough rigs to give each
fucking sad ass New York fucking team of

498
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,631
fucking ring and still have one leftover
for ourselves with just four tapes.

499
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,960
That's why I don't respect New
York sports in their championships.

500
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:13,400
It's like you doubled down in every
fucking sport. Gee, did you win one?

501
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,990
How many at bats do you need to baseball
to football to basketball and if you

502
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:23,970
include the island is they got to fucking
hockey. It's fucking pathetic. Oh,

503
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,720
I love Robin and into those constant,
you'd probably go on like bill,

504
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,610
why are you rubbing it in on the ads?

505
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:32,240
Because they've been dicks to me
my entire fucking sports life.

506
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:37,241
Cause we now we never won anything and
they and all of them fucking just run and

507
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:40,760
hide. Anytime Boston wins
something or they tried to, no, no,

508
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:43,730
I'm happy for you guys. You
have, I'm really happy for
you guys. Go Fuck Yourself.

509
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,650
Go Fuck Yourself. All
right. I swear to God,

510
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:51,080
it's what that city is,
is it's the Yankees,

511
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,540
the Yankees prop that entire
fucking city up. If, if the, if,

512
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,520
if it wasn't for the fucking Yankees,

513
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,580
New York City would be exposed as being
basically one of the saddest places to,

514
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,560
to ever be as a sports fan.

515
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,873
You know,

516
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,520
wait, but the giants are good. What
am I talking about? The giant ticket,

517
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:17,550
but rather than that, all right. The
jets. Horrific. 1969 the next, you know,

518
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,280
you have to get, it's
1973 the rangers have one,

519
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,400
one cup and like fucking
90 years. 80 years, right?

520
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,110
Well, yes. Nets have never
won anything. The island is,

521
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,580
they had their run,

522
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:37,581
but at that point it's like 30 fucking
years a Gulf that plant better though.

523
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:40,470
Right? I don't know. Just a sad,

524
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,470
sad fuck you got the Yankees.

525
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,280
Thank God for the fucking
Yankees have won like 99%.

526
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:51,360
I guess he probably wouldn't
99% for everybody, but I dunno,

527
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,530
I dunno. I'm quoting here a little bit.
It's been a hell of a fucking decade,

528
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:59,010
everybody. And if you think, I think that
this is going to last. I know it isn't.

529
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,930
I know that right now I am at the tail
end of the greatest run Boston sports is

530
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:07,490
going to have in my lifetime. I know.
I don't know when it's going to Ed,

531
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,860
but, uh, I'll take it.

532
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,770
If it just becomes like,
you know,

533
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,900
like the Bruins don't seem
like they have it this year.

534
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,330
It seems like they're going to have
to fucking shake it up. A Celtics.

535
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:22,950
It goes without saying, um, the red
sox, you never know what today's game,

536
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:26,550
we kind of seem like we, uh,
when it, then we shit the bed,

537
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,180
then we win it. So we'll see
what happens. Maybe we'll, uh,

538
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,910
we'll come back around and try to stay.
Uh,

539
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,960
we'll try to keep up with the giants.
We've won three,

540
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:39,090
they've won three in this century.

541
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,050
Oh, we will be like one ahead. If
we end up winning it this year,

542
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:46,200
who the who the fuck knows
and the Patriots, I don't
know what happens with them,

543
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,830
but at some point Bella checks going to
have to retire and Brady's going to have

544
00:32:49,831 --> 00:32:54,690
to retire and then we're going to go back
to be in the team that I watched when

545
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,940
I was growing up.
And uh,

546
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,860
yeah,

547
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,720
you watch how that stadium empties out,

548
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,680
it's going to go right.
But you know,

549
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,840
it'd be funny as if you
actually had a camera, right?

550
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,480
Like doing like this still photography
and you had people who were there,

551
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,173
um,

552
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,960
basically before Bob Craft and he got
them in this seats and then you just sort

553
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:26,610
of fast forward through all the years.
Robert Kraft, Bill Parcells, Pete Carroll,

554
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:29,670
Bill Belicheck, he just see the stadium,
fill it up, filling up, filling up,

555
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,420
and then they gradually retire and then
all the seats around start getting empty

556
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:33,691
again.

557
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:38,070
And then you just see that same person
you saw before Robert Kraft bought the

558
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:41,880
team and he's just fucking much older
at, fuck, am I going to sneeze here?

559
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,330
God dammit. I hope I didn't
catch a fucking cold. Um,

560
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,090
so anyways,
um,

561
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,990
somebody was telling me that they read
a story that Pete Carroll said that,

562
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,750
I don't know if it was like
three nights in a row, whatever,

563
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:59,890
but he was laying in bed crying
that he lost the super bowl.

564
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,840
And that's why I love Pete Carroll.
I can't,

565
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:07,360
I mean I hate that Wu
and I hate the dockers,

566
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:11,880
but that fucking guy is so fucking driven.

567
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,200
He wants to win it.

568
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,910
Do you realize like the pain that guy,

569
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,680
that guy was going to do something that,

570
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:26,510
I'm trying to think how many people did
it. If he went back to back Superbowls,

571
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,990
that guy joins fence,
Lombardi Don Shula,

572
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,850
Chuck Noll,
uh,

573
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,770
Jim at Johnson
and bill Bellacheck.

574
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,450
That's it,
right?

575
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:48,140
It would become one of six people
to ever do it. Any be in the same,

576
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,080
the same fucking categories.
Lombardi, Shula, chuck Noll,

577
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,410
Jimmy Johnson and bill Bellacheck.
Bill Bell check. By the way,

578
00:34:56,411 --> 00:35:00,280
I would actually say it's the greatest
coach of all fucking time of all fucking

579
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:02,180
time.
How long he's one.

580
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,010
Yeah.

581
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,840
Doing it now on the salary cap era,

582
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,370
the amount of fucking players
switching and switching out,

583
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,350
even when he doesn't win it, we still
win like 12, 13 fucking games a year. Um,

584
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,300
I think he's,

585
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,710
I think he's the greatest of all time
and I really hope that we keep pushing to

586
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:25,700
get the fucking cult to make some sort
of public apology for their absolute

587
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:30,110
fucking, there's such fucking
babies, man. I love Andrew Luck.

588
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,170
This is nothing against the colts. The
team. It's their fucking owner, man.

589
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:35,240
That guy,
such a goddamn baby.

590
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,510
The amount of times that they've lost
and then of course they can't just lose.

591
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:44,290
It has to be like a fucking rule change.
He's got to send a video to the,

592
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,440
to the League office.
It's like, dude, you lost

593
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,990
Aaron.
It go fuck yourself.

594
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,410
What a fucking baby man.
Anyways,

595
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,030
so,

596
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,370
but you know, they throw it out there.
It was great. They throw it out there.

597
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,410
So forever. Bill Bellacheck, you know,

598
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:07,870
by all the fucking people out
there who just hate the guy,

599
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,650
are forever going to quit. I
love our Jerry Rice to Sarah
and goes, yeah, you know,

600
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:14,140
they should have an
asterisk next to their, uh,

601
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,720
their championship and then
admits to using stick them.

602
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,080
Okay.

603
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,660
Give me a fucking break. So now what
Jerry? Now you're not, he's now,

604
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,450
you're no longer the greatest receiver
of all. Tag me a fucking break.

605
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:24,284
You still are.

606
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:29,260
Grow Up. Um, so anyways,
that was on the, uh,

607
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:33,410
I was on the plane coming
back from a Dubai and um,

608
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,980
I blew,
I blew basically all any,

609
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,740
any gig money that I
made going through Asia.

610
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,660
I blew on plane tickets because I'm too
fucking old to fly in the back of the

611
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,900
plane. I just can't do it. Okay.
I can't, I'm too fucking old.

612
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,390
So I actually lost money.

613
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,110
You went to Asia and probably lost a good
month of my life breathing in some of

614
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,000
that air over there.
Uh,

615
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,910
but I'm still going back cause I
absolutely loved it and I fucking love the

616
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:02,541
people over there.

617
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:07,541
So a nia was giving me shit because
she saw the money that I spent.

618
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,660
She saw what I was going to gross and
then what I spent on plane tickets.

619
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:14,120
She's like, what the fuck are you
doing? And I was just like, listen,

620
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,830
I know you can't put a price on it.
Okay, this is like a fucking vacation.

621
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:19,700
Just look at it that way.

622
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:23,210
And we're actually going to maybe make
a little money on this thing. All right.

623
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,240
But I am not going to fucking
fly to Australia with my
fucking pasty knees up to

624
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:33,980
my chest. I'm not doing it. All right?

625
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,630
So enjoy it. So like the entire time
we were, we just flew business class.

626
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,730
All right.
And uh,

627
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,290
every time we'd go on and get a nice seat
and I always just kept looking over it

628
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:48,740
and he had just go and you can't put a
price on it, you know, you can't put,

629
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,570
just kept saying that and she just kept
shaking her head and you get off the

630
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,690
plane and then they give you a little
pass. So when you went through customs,

631
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,780
just letting you guys know this.
So if you want to use your fucking miles,

632
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:03,440
I'm telling you, look, if you're flying
within the United States, I mean,

633
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,700
you don't need to do that, I guess
do you have to la as a motherfucker,

634
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,920
but you can handle that. But when
you start talking about a 14, 10,

635
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:14,360
14 hour fucking flight, take out your
miles, take out your credit card.

636
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:19,250
Just I'm telling you,
I'm telling you you won't regret it.

637
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:21,740
So we'll fly it back air Emirates.

638
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:26,390
And it was one of those double decker
planes and we were upstairs in the

639
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:30,350
business class. So like
fucking ridiculously excited,
totally exposing ourselves.

640
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,950
Um, and so I got, went up
to get to the, you know,

641
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,030
we sit down and uh,
you know,

642
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:45,210
nice big ass fucking chairs and I look
and I look over it and Nia and she laughs

643
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:49,150
and goes, you can't put a price on
it. I'm like, that's right. So, uh,

644
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,480
I get up like about an hour into the
flight and I go in the bath to go to the

645
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:54,340
bathroom.
When I go in the back and they have a,

646
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,610
they have a bar in the back of the plane,

647
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,700
like not giant bar but
just like a little fucking,

648
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,980
but a bartender sitting there with a
bunch of fucking booze behind, you know,

649
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,800
bottles and all that shit.
And then on either side of the plane,

650
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,400
like the get these s shaped benches with
like four seats with four seat belts

651
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,300
and you can just sit down and put
on a seatbelt. I can have a bar.

652
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,110
So I like my fucking heart.
I can't believe I didn't faint.

653
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,240
My heart rate went through the fucking
ceiling. So I go back and I go,

654
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,920
Nia did come on the back of the
plane. She's like, Wah, Wah. You know,

655
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,410
she's watching some fucking TV
thing. And I go like, come on,

656
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,130
I want to get you a drink. She goes,
what do you mean get me a drink?

657
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:40,210
She thinks I'm just
going to go back there.

658
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,580
It's gonna be like three stewardesses,
like huddled in the back.

659
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,420
We go in the back and she saw it. She
just starts laughing. We sat down,

660
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,300
put seatbelts on an order,
the fucking drinks,

661
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,500
they're like olives and shit
back there was ridiculous.

662
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,180
And they looked at it and she
finally sent us. She goes,

663
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:55,330
you can't put a price on it.
There's all of the great fucker moments.

664
00:39:55,331 --> 00:40:00,331
And I sat with her drinking a
goddamn drink flying over Iraq going,

665
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,600
if I'm going to get hit by a fucking RPG,
I'm going to be doing it like this.

666
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,620
This is the way to do it. Right? So, uh,

667
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,280
that is the one thing that I've learned
to all of my fucking travel is that, uh,

668
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,530
you have to have a line.
And once you go and beyond,

669
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,100
I mean, granted, I haven't gotten the
bill yet. When I get that bill, oh, Jesus.

670
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:28,570
When I get that bill, um,
and I don't give a fuck,

671
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,050
fuck that. I don't give a shit. All
right. I need you to be comfortable.

672
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,100
If I'm going into a goddamn country where
I could get caned are hung, you know,

673
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,840
you want to ride there in a
comfy chair. So, um, all right,

674
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,730
well I'm already 40 minutes in here. I
gotta a fucking move along here, but um,

675
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:50,780
I can't even remember what I talked
about last week as far as India. Um,

676
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,950
I can't help.
It was such a good time.

677
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,070
Maybe I'll tell the story again if
I've already told it. But after,

678
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:59,560
after the Gig in India,
um,

679
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,510
I hung out with a bunch of comics all
went out and got dinner and just sat down

680
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:08,560
and talk comedy for uh,
for like a good hour.

681
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,620
And it was probably one of the highlights
of my career just as far as just one

682
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:14,620
of the coolest things ever.

683
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:19,621
You are on the other side of the globe
hanging out and you met people that do

684
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:22,310
what you do then have the
same passion and love for.

685
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,490
And what was killing me was the questions
with the exact same questions that I

686
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:29,620
would hear from American
comics are comics.

687
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,010
I meant in the UK or Ireland or
Scandinavia. It's just, it's,

688
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,050
it's the same art form. And, um,

689
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,980
my favorite thing was in the end when it
started getting petty where they would

690
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:42,350
go in like, all right, Bill,

691
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,910
who's a comic that you
think just fucking stinks,

692
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,020
but for some unexplained reason
is selling a bunch of tickets.

693
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,540
I just started laughing. I was just like,
Jesus, even over here it's like that,

694
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:01,220
you know. But, uh, I don't know if that's
one of the really cool things about,

695
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:05,000
uh, about traveling or whatever. So, um,

696
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,260
I'm definitely going to go
back, definitely going to go
back. And what's funny is,

697
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,440
um,
Jerry Seinfeld actually has,

698
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,110
is doing four shows over there.

699
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,393
MMM.

700
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,160
And,
uh,

701
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,150
I was just back in New York next month
he's going to be over there and I was

702
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:27,420
just in New York was doing the
Patrice O'Neal benefit and uh,

703
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,980
I just happened to run into Seinfeld.
He comes down the cellar, you know,

704
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,810
which is always fucking
unreal when he shows up.

705
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,850
And I mentioned to him that he was,
you know, him going over there.

706
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:40,160
So it was just kind of comparing
trading notes with them or whatever.

707
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:44,390
So I can't wait to hear how those
shows go cause he was, you know,

708
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:47,540
he's asking all the questions like, you
know, can they understand like, yes,

709
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,780
I was like, dude, they get
everything. They get everything,

710
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:54,550
all the slang and all that
shit. But uh, anyways, I that,

711
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,440
I don't know, I wish I could actually go
to those shows. That'd be pretty cool.

712
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:03,280
Honestly, and Seinfeld
and fucking Mumbai. Um,

713
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,640
anyways, uh, sell the Patrice O'neal
Benefit Ladies and gentlemen, uh,

714
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,150
thank you to everybody
that came out to the, uh,

715
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,260
to the benefit this year I actually
think was one of the best shows because,

716
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:22,450
um, we only had eight comics this
year in the past. The thing is,

717
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:27,451
is so many people love Patrice and so
when people want to be a part of it that

718
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:31,690
we've been having like 12 to 13 comics
and it really gets like jammed up towards

719
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:35,770
the end and it's a union house. And if we
go over like, you know, unions, they've,

720
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,550
they're fine sit through the roof and
we're defeating the purpose of why we're

721
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:41,920
doing this thing. So it becomes
really stressful. This year,

722
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:46,900
there was only eight moved
along quick. And um, you know,

723
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:48,790
everybody crushed it. And, uh,

724
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,380
this year was great because I felt like
by having Hannibal Burress and Michael

725
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,240
Che on it, we actually had guys that were
influenced by Patrice has comedy. Um,

726
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,580
this is the first time we
didn't just have like his peers,

727
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:04,060
the guys who came up with that
started the same time he did,

728
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:06,610
or maybe a little bit before this is
when we actually had the generation of

729
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:09,220
comic set as they were
deciding to become comedians,

730
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:13,540
could actually have watched Patrice on
TV and been influenced by him. And, uh,

731
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,340
those two guys killed it. Uh,
Jim Florentine, Ben Bailey,

732
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,540
David Tell Jim Norton, Collin Quinn, uh,

733
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,550
rich foss hosting it as always.

734
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,690
MMM.

735
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,250
It was just an awesome,
awesome time.

736
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:33,190
I know I always forget somebody and
they're going to get pissed at me, but um,

737
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:34,850
yeah,

738
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:38,750
I dunno. Thanks again to everybody
who, who, uh, came out to that thing.

739
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:41,840
We're going to of course
do it again next year.

740
00:44:41,841 --> 00:44:45,520
Thank you to the opium Chimi
show for helped me promote
it, but blah, blah, blah,

741
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:49,310
blah, Blah and all that type
of stuff. And um, I dunno.

742
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,600
It's definitely a, it's, I
don't know. It's been, it's fun.

743
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,340
It's my favorite thing to
do of the year because, uh,

744
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:01,250
it is such a great cause we obviously
love Patrice and getting to see his mom,

745
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:04,970
his stepdaughter and his,
uh, his girlfriend and uh,

746
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,090
becomes like, uh, like the standup,

747
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:12,500
like high school reunion and it's really
fucking cool. So, all right, here we go.

748
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,290
I got to wrap this up because guess what
I'm doing the second this podcast is

749
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:19,160
over, other than uploading it
is a, I get to go see my dog.

750
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,580
I'm see my dog and like three weeks and
I know what you're thinking. Like bill,

751
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,460
wait, wait. Did you put your
dog? Where did your board
your dog? And it's like, no,

752
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,960
I just kept her in the garage, you
know, Shit and piss all over the place.

753
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:33,600
But I had plenty of food for and
uh, you know, I had a tie. Paul.

754
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,600
Um,
we actually bought at our,

755
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,460
our veterinarian and my dog is one of the
few dogs that absolutely loves the vet

756
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,800
because she, you know, she's a pit bull.

757
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:50,210
She's got herself heard a couple of
times cause she's a maniac and um,

758
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,850
you know, my dog's got this
thing that he looks at you,

759
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,040
she looks at you sideways.
Like who the fuck are you?

760
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:03,050
The second you take care of
her, that's it. You, you're,
you're, you're a made man.

761
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,290
So they took care of her a
couple of times. You know,

762
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,460
she broke one of her teeth one time
and a couple other things she's done to

763
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:16,880
herself, Bang yourself
up. And um, you know,

764
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:19,460
they took care of her down there and when
she sees that someone's going to take

765
00:46:19,461 --> 00:46:21,140
care of, she's like, she's
like a little fucking

766
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,450
goddamn baby when she's down there.
So whenever I take her to the vet,

767
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,690
all these other dogs are like wine and
going in there and I'm like water skiing

768
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:31,820
behind my dog.
She's like dragging me in there.

769
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:34,280
And what kills me was whenever
I drop her off to border,

770
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:37,370
she's so excited to be there. She
doesn't even turn around and look at me.

771
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,180
She tails wagging and she just
fucking runs away with somebody else.

772
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:46,480
Kind of hurts my feelings a little bit.
But um, anyways, let's get to the, uh,

773
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,890
let's get to the, uh,
the, the, the fucking, um,

774
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,890
what am I saying here though? The
letters for this week. All right.

775
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,730
Sam Smith and Tom Petty. I actually
kind of already answered this one. Uh,

776
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:05,380
when is this one? All right. I've been
a big fan of the podcast for years.

777
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,120
I've got to say hello and correct.

778
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:11,740
Congrats to you and lovely Nia when
you played Dublin Ireland a while back.

779
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,920
Oh, I got to say congrats to you.
Okay. This is a trivial point,

780
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:18,670
but I'd like to throw in my 2
cents on Tom Petty Suing Sam Smith.

781
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,050
Tom Petty is almost famous for looking
the other way when people happen to sound

782
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:23,680
like him.

783
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,280
He's been quoted as laughing it off when
last night by the strokes appeared to

784
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:30,130
rip off American girl saying

785
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,963
his early stuff.

786
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,540
And then he just said that his early
stuff sat and like Chuck Berry even gave

787
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,310
the strokes credit for owning up to it.

788
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,190
There's a similar story about
the red hot chili peppers,

789
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,210
Danny California sounding like
last dance with Mary Jane. However,

790
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:44,770
in this case with Sam Smith,

791
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,960
Smith's response to the story
was that he never heard,

792
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:49,170
I won't back down if we believe that.

793
00:47:49,171 --> 00:47:51,370
Are we supposed to believe
that every musician, producer,

794
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,140
and other asshole heard that
song before it was released,

795
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:58,700
had never heard Tom Petty's.
I won't back down. Uh,

796
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,270
maybe.
So for what?

797
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:04,750
My dumb ass opinion's worth petty either
sued because he didn't believe that

798
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:09,250
denial or who was offended because Sam
Smith didn't know him and not because the

799
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:12,610
songs sounded alike, but what the hell
do I know? That's actually interesting.

800
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,000
Go back to Ireland sometime soon.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

801
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,060
That's a really interesting take.
I never even thought about that.

802
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,290
If he just owned up to it,

803
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,780
like you have to get pulled over
by a cop and you just, you know,

804
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:26,500
you know why I pulled you over.
Yup. Yup. I made that illegal.

805
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:27,940
Uturn why'd you make it?

806
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:31,420
Because I was impatient and I
didn't want to do it the right way.

807
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,600
Do you know I could give you
a ticket? Yeah, yeah, I do,

808
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:40,570
but I'm not going to lie to you. That's
an actual conversation I had with a cop.

809
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:41,800
Okay.

810
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,230
And he goes, all right, I'm going to
let you go. And then I laughed and said,

811
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,570
you're awesome.
And then he laughed like,

812
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:48,520
yeah.

813
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,280
Not laughing like, yeah, this is
great. He was laughing just like,

814
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,470
it was just a weird conversation for him,
I think.

815
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,070
Okay.

816
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,640
I always tell the truth whenever they pull
you over, you know, I pulled you over.

817
00:48:57,641 --> 00:49:01,010
Yeah, absolutely. Stealing,
doing like fucking, you know,
fast. You're going, yeah,

818
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,520
like 85 soap and I wasn't
going to run into you.

819
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,910
Most of the Times.
They still give you the ticket,

820
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,180
but sometimes if you just fucking honest,
Ya know,

821
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,090
it's towards the end of their shift
electorally. Fucking let you go.

822
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,840
Um, yeah, of course.

823
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:25,130
Being old fucking freckled faced howdy
duty looking white guy probably doesn't

824
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:26,500
hurt me either.
I'm already hearing envy.

825
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,090
Anybody not white listening
to this going? Oh yeah, yeah.

826
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,810
Now if I go take the shit out of it, I
know. I know. What do you want me to do?

827
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:38,120
You know, one of my, I mean,
I, I don't make the rules.

828
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,250
I'm happy it works out that way for me.
Um, I'm sorry it doesn't for you, uh,

829
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,390
moving across the country. Uh, dear bill,

830
00:49:47,391 --> 00:49:50,780
birth bill, I'd think you podcast.
Thank you. Okay. Okay. I just, I,

831
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:54,890
I just turned 23 years old a few months
ago and I realized I have lived in the,

832
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:59,780
in the West Michigan town. I've officially
lived in the western Michigan town.

833
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,780
I live in for more than half my life.
Can you guys please?

834
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,360
Yeah,

835
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,240
please try to proof read your
shit. This is a sentence. Okay.

836
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:12,040
So I turned 23 a few months ago and I
realize I have lived in the West Michigan

837
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:15,010
town. I've officially lived
in the western Michigan town.

838
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,890
I live in for more than half of my life.
All right.

839
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,920
So it was definitely editing as he wrote
this and just kind of fucked that up.

840
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,150
This crushed me.

841
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:24,570
Okay.

842
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,970
Why cause you're living in western
Michigan. I like it out there.

843
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,100
Well, you got to move to the
big city. Uh, this crushed me.

844
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:38,050
So I began saving up as I wanted to
live in Portland, Oregon. Good choice.

845
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:43,660
I've always been musical and I
want to go do the band thing,

846
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:47,560
but I've never, but I have an
associate's of science degree,

847
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,230
so if that doesn't work out,
I can go back to school.

848
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:54,160
But in Portland after
establishing reds, but I'll, I'll,

849
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:56,920
I'll go back to school in Portland
after establishing residency. All right,

850
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,650
so you've got a plan here.
My question to you is this,

851
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,420
how much do you think I should save up
with the plan to live minimally and just

852
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:06,610
work a job slash play music?

853
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,050
I've never felt I could express myself
here as I am isolated and since the town

854
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:15,820
is small, high school follows
you everywhere in which I
was a total weirdo. Slash.

855
00:51:15,821 --> 00:51:20,020
Loser. Uh, thanks and go. Love Yourself.

856
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,470
Um, all right. I totally
relate. I totally relate. Like,

857
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,810
you know,
I was a loser too in high school.

858
00:51:28,811 --> 00:51:33,190
So there was an element of like going
to Boston to try stand up comedy.

859
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,390
And I remember whenever I would get
a gig anywhere near where I was from,

860
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,890
that'd be so nervous that my entire
high school class would show up and they

861
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,920
wouldn't laugh and be like,
dude, you're that jackass.

862
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:48,010
And went to school with who are you to
think that you could make this dream come

863
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:50,740
true? Go Fuck Yourself. Right. So
I totally understand all of that.

864
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,570
And I also worked a day job and I saved
up money before I moved to New York.

865
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:59,080
I paid off all of my debts.
I just paid it down.

866
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:01,660
I paid down everything and I saved up.

867
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:07,240
I saved up some money and then
I moved to New York. And uh,

868
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,300
I went there thinking I
got to get a day job and a,

869
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:16,630
but I had enough money where that wasn't,
you know,

870
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,420
wasn't dire. Like I gotta get a job right
now. I could actually go a few months.

871
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:25,840
So I started getting some standup gigs.
So,

872
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:28,600
even though it was negative cash flow,

873
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,790
it wasn't 100% negative. Like say my
nut, I think my rent, I swear to God,

874
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,100
I had to walk two bedroom.
My rent was uh,

875
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,780
it was for 25 a month.
This is 20 years ago.

876
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,790
And, um, but I mean I had no spots.

877
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:46,750
I had no gigs.

878
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:52,380
So I think I did a couple of road
gigs when probably back to Boston,

879
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:57,240
maybe did addict already gig or something.
And I probably made Jesus,

880
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,970
I don't even know. I probably made like
300 bucks, three 75 for the weekend.

881
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,390
But I also had to travel up there
and I took the bus and I had to eat.

882
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,490
So it was probably in pay taxes
on it eventually. So I mean,

883
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:11,490
I was probably walking away with 125
bucks. So I probably had, you know,

884
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:14,440
and plus all the other eating, living,
every time you walked outside in New York,

885
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,500
it's like you blew 20 bucks. So, um,

886
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,150
I watched my nest egg start to dwindle,

887
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:26,820
but after a couple months I
stopped thinking about a day job.

888
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:28,860
I just started thinking,
um,

889
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,590
I got to get more gigs and
I got to get more gigs.

890
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:38,591
And then what happened was I was able
to kind of slowly stopped the nosedive,

891
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,550
a cash to level it off a little bit.
And um,

892
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,850
then I booked some acting gig or something
way I was able to make enough money

893
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:49,870
and I just stashed it.

894
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,560
And at that point then I got to college
age and it just all starts to happen.

895
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:56,890
You know what? I'm a guy
brought up on this, um,

896
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,940
podcasts before Mike Johnston,
Mike lessons.com.

897
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,220
I'll try to find the video for you,

898
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:09,110
but he's got this great video
that he does where he talks about,

899
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,100
you know, or maybe I was, when
I went and I saw him live,

900
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,950
I think it was when I saw him live.
So I'll paraphrase what he said,

901
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,970
but when he wanted to
make money as a musician,

902
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,850
you know,
he just,

903
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:30,140
he just totally like his day, even his day
job, he just stayed in the music arena.

904
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,950
I'm really going to butcher this story,
but he started giving drum lessons.

905
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,760
All right. So that was money
he was earning as a drummer.

906
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:41,930
He started working at a
music studio, tuning up the
drums and that type of thing.

907
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,530
So that was two way. And then
then he got into, you know,

908
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:49,580
a couple of bands and he had a couple of
gigs on the weekends. So that was three,

909
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:52,010
four different ways that he
was making money as a drummer.

910
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:55,880
And he just keep doing that. So when
you're out there, I would just make,

911
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,490
make it all about music.
You know,

912
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,520
if you get a job at fucking guitar
center or something like that,

913
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,520
you can get a discount on some of your,

914
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,580
your equipment and then you can also get
to know guys and you can start talking

915
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:12,020
to people. Like I want to get into a
band, join a couple of fucking bands.

916
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:14,930
I mean that's,
I would do all of that shit.

917
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:17,720
And then also you can get a discount on
all the recording stuff that you need.

918
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:19,130
If you're going to start writing songs.

919
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:24,580
I would just keep getting jobs in the
music industry because it seems to me like

920
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:26,090
that's what you want to do.

921
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,190
And then your backup is to do this
associates of the sciences degree.

922
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,950
Like that's your backup plan. Um,
just by reading your, your letter,

923
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,701
it seems like,
you know,

924
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,490
you want to be in the music business
that's going to make you happy.

925
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,880
So that's what I would do.
And uh,

926
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:49,160
he just kind of have to try to shake
off that whole idea that, you know,

927
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,000
you have to fall back on this college
degree and this whole idea that you can't

928
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:53,990
have a fun job.

929
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,780
You could totally have a fun job and it's
going to be a job and it's going to be

930
00:55:56,781 --> 00:56:00,860
working all that shit, but you
could totally have a fun job. Um,

931
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,120
you just keep applying for jobs that
have fun and you will have a fun job and

932
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:10,520
just stay there and then
that's it. And then, you know,

933
00:56:10,521 --> 00:56:12,890
you know how to do it though.
Do you eat your ramen noodles?

934
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,590
If you wake up in the morning,

935
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:20,240
you just have a fucking apple that'll
fill you up and you'll be in great shape.

936
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,090
You just pound some waters.
Um,

937
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,240
you know, you know the deal.
Everybody fucking does this shit.

938
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,760
I use each spaghetti. That
was my thing. Spaghetti and,

939
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,010
and a couple pieces of bread. And that
was my dinner that would fill me up.

940
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,550
And uh, I remember I didn't
have any of, have a table.

941
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:44,551
I had a fucking chair that I turn around
and I use that as the table and I just

942
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:49,330
would fucking get the prego and I'd
throw fucking spaghetti in there.

943
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,490
I could make the fucking meal in my sleep.

944
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,560
And you have to measure
the water or anything.

945
00:56:53,561 --> 00:56:54,910
I just knew where to pour it in the pot.

946
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:59,470
I've just had it every fucking night
and I was so fucking sick of it.

947
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,650
I remember like every once in a
while I would either take a taxi cab.

948
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,140
I just be so tired after
doing gigs and just fucking,

949
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:08,950
every once in a while I treat myself
to a cab ride. All right. Treat myself.

950
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,790
I'd actually order out.
And when I say order Ron,

951
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:17,620
I'm talking like ordering
Chinese food. Um, cause you know,

952
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:19,690
when you first moved to a city,
you know, I'm from a small,

953
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:23,440
tiny moved to a big city,
you're on your own and it's really on you.

954
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,600
Uh, you're terrified to spend money.
This is creeping thing, you know,

955
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:33,370
you got to get your footing once,
you know, you've survived for seven,

956
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:36,680
eight months. One day it just kinda hits
you like, Hey, I'm on my own here and I'm,

957
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:39,460
I'm making it. It's a
great failing, you know,

958
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:43,150
even though you've got fucking spaghetti
coming out of your goddamn ears. Um,

959
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:47,950
so good luck to you, sir.
All right, so a workout,

960
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,580
a William B, do you still work
out? If yes, what is your routine?

961
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:54,640
Do you do any running or biking?
Love the podcast man. Uh,

962
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,840
I actually did quite a bit of working
out when I was on the road because I was,

963
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:02,950
you know, eating airplane food, airport
food and that type of stuff and Gig food.

964
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:07,660
Uh, and I only think I put on like
five pounds, which is pretty good,

965
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:08,950
you know,

966
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,920
for the amount of time that was away for
three weeks to only put on five pounds.

967
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,160
And really what fucked me over
was when I went to New York.

968
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,140
I was there for a few days and uh,
oh, the booze was flowing anyways.

969
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,850
Um,
do I do any running nine oh two running,

970
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:27,790
running kills my fuck. You know, you
can't do that to myself at my age.

971
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,710
You can't keep running like that. It
fucking, you need your feet, your knees,

972
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,350
your hips, you need all of that
shit for the rest of your life.

973
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:38,350
What you really have to do at my age
is actually finally sit down and learn

974
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:41,860
about nutrition. So you're not
eating your way into the gym.

975
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:44,410
You're actually eating your way out
of it so you don't have to do as much.

976
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,380
I do a lot. Like I take my dog. Um,

977
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,030
there's a lot of hiking trails out here
in la, the fucking greatest city ever.

978
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,000
I love it, man. I'd have to be
in a freeze and fucking New York.

979
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:59,050
I love New York and that
shit. But, uh, Jesus Christ,

980
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:01,420
when it's that fucking cold and
there's no Christmas lights out,

981
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:06,430
it's pretty goddamn bleak.
Um, but anyways, yeah,

982
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:10,570
I kind of do that. And then I'm
into, uh, your own body weight.

983
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,680
I have a climbing rope, I
got a peg board, I got a,

984
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,560
I got one of those pull up dip stations.

985
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:22,810
I'm into that type of stuff cause I
feel like it's a much better strength.

986
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,080
Yeah.

987
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,040
Being able to move your own body and
it's much more practical when you're in

988
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:31,970
situations to be able to move your body,
um,

989
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:35,420
climb up on to something,
lower yourself down onto something.

990
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:40,421
Just getting it up and out of bed is
easier if you're used to being able to

991
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,600
handle your own body weight as opposed
to that weird shit with like bench

992
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:44,434
pressing,

993
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:48,920
which is you're pushing all this weight
up off of you while adding this mop

994
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:51,260
muscle weight to yourself,
which is, I dunno,

995
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,220
it just seems more of a complete
workout when you move in your own body.

996
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:57,590
So I'm into that stuff. And, uh,

997
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,610
I'll skip rope I guess every once in a
while, but I make sure that I do, like,

998
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,110
I don't jump up too high.

999
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,250
So it's more like I'm kind of not
even like running in place so much,

1000
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:11,660
just sort of lifting a foot up
and setting it back down. Uh,

1001
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,190
once you get the muscle memory down,

1002
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:17,420
you can really minimally
be slamming your joints.

1003
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:19,310
Is she coming back down?
Uh,

1004
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:23,990
it's sorta like lightly running in place
as you do it. And I'll just do like two,

1005
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:25,640
three rounds. I, you know,
it's funny, as I brought it,

1006
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:28,070
I brought a jump rope on the
trip and I never used it once.

1007
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,820
I just never fucking used it. But I did
do like a lot of that elliptical shit.

1008
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,713
And,
um,

1009
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,873
I dunno.

1010
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,410
So what I, what's my routine?
All right. So my routine, I do

1011
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:44,140
a set of pull ups and I do it to
exhaustion as many as I can do.

1012
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,220
And even after I can't put my head
over the Chin a get my chin over the,

1013
01:00:48,221 --> 01:00:52,780
over the bar, I still am doing Reps. Uh,

1014
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,400
even if you only go halfway up a third
of the way up an eighth of the way up and

1015
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:01,300
just to exhaustion, that's
the first set I do. Then,

1016
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,810
uh, I climb up the rope, go back down,

1017
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,420
and then I go over to the peg board.

1018
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,290
And it's weird because my garage
ceiling isn't high enough.

1019
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:15,460
I had to buy the skinniest ones and to
have them go horizontal. So I'm actually,

1020
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,720
I only do the peg board but I go to the
side and at this point I'm only at the

1021
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,270
point where,
you know,

1022
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,360
I can take the pegs out like
two or three times total.

1023
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,173
MMM.

1024
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:31,580
You know, and actually make it
happen. If you do get a peg board,

1025
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,890
you want to aim a little bit
higher than the whole because your,

1026
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,300
your body is going to be going down.
So you actually stick it in there.

1027
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,980
And then the next time I go through is
I do a set of pull ups where I do the

1028
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:41,814
negatives.

1029
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:45,510
Will you pull yourself up over the bar
and then you lower yourself super slow

1030
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:50,880
and that actually helps you
reps over time. And then
the next, and then I do the,

1031
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,180
I got this tree that I jump up and I,

1032
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,300
there's a branch that goes
way out where I kind of do a,

1033
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,340
how the fuck do you describe it? Right
hand over, left hand, right hand over,

1034
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:04,590
left hand,
walking out towards the end of the branch.

1035
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,930
And then I come all the way back again.
Um,

1036
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,650
and I tried to keep my arms
at like a 90 degree angle,

1037
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,860
not just hanging straight down like that.
Um,

1038
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,150
okay.

1039
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,420
And then the third set I do is a wide
grip and then it's the same again.

1040
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:22,420
And I go back up the rope instead of
the tree that time, something like that.

1041
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:24,560
And then I'm always switching it up.
Um,

1042
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,850
sometimes I just do three straight things,
a regular pull ups or whatever.

1043
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:30,700
This sounds boring as shit, so I'm gonna
move on. But that's basically what I do.

1044
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,970
And then I take my dog for a fucking hike.
That's it.

1045
01:02:33,971 --> 01:02:38,350
And then I try not to eat like a fucking
animal. They go and that is my workout.

1046
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,070
Let me actually do the last bit
of advertising here. Fucking that.

1047
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:43,690
Richard Simmons,
the hell am I doing here?

1048
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:46,330
I'm sitting in candy striped shorts
right now. People doing this podcast.

1049
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,350
All right,

1050
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:52,090
stamps.com everybody get your
mailing and shipping done.

1051
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:56,230
Getting your mailing and shipping
done can seem like a no win situation.

1052
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:59,710
Nobody wants to go to the post office.
It takes up valuable time.

1053
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,680
You don't want to lease a postage meter.

1054
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:06,160
It's expensive with the multiyear
commitments and hidden fees.

1055
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,890
Who the hell wants to deal with that?
Do you want to deal with that? No.

1056
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,460
Well luckily I know a better
way. What is it, Bill?

1057
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:17,461
It's stamps.com stamps.com you can buy
and print official US postage for any

1058
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:22,370
letter or package right from your desk
using your own computer or printer.

1059
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,080
Even get the special postage discount.
She can't find it.

1060
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:28,660
The post office plus
stamps dot coms is a more,

1061
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,500
is more powerful than a postage
meter at a fraction of the cost.

1062
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:36,280
You could save up to 80% compared to a
postage meter and you can avoid all those

1063
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:38,560
time consuming trips.
To The post office.

1064

I use stamps.com to send out all the
bullshit that I said left or my shows.

1065
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,290

MMM.

1079
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,320
Then again, you know, you look at
the Robin Williams family there,

1080
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,770
they're challenging the wealth.

1081

You want to do this basically so the
state doesn't have it and the only people

1082
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:45,300
that are arguing over the will or people
that you want to get stuff anyways,

1083
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,150
I guess that's why you do it.
I don't know. But anyways,

1084
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,500
that's where legal zoom can help you.

1099
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,690
Um,
let me close this here.

1100
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,650
All right. Out of the closet.
Here we go. Dear bill,

1101
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:53,190
I'm a 17 year old high school student
who recently came out of the closet.

1102
01:05:53,191 --> 01:05:56,730
Congratulations. That's it.
Very courageous thing. It's 17.

1103
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,560
Um,

1104
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,120
I have always been fairly timid and
don't have a very aggressive character.

1105
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,920
Once again,
even more courageous.

1106
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,440
Three years ago I found your comedy
and I was inspired by your race,

1107
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,520
your religion of logic and passion.

1108
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:16,410
Listening to your comedy and hour on
the podcast gave me exposure to a strong

1109
01:06:16,411 --> 01:06:20,460
personality that I could relate to
internally and be inspired by outwardly.

1110
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,580
If this is going to be all compliments,
I can't read these. All right,

1111
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,920
some point you got to shit on me.
Uh,

1112
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,430
without exaggeration,

1113
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,410
exaggeration and moved my type table
up at least a year for forever.

1114
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:38,730
I plan on waiting til I was 18. Thank
you for the inspiration. Good, sir. Uh,

1115
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:43,020
this is where you call yourself an
idiot and downplay the situation. Ah,

1116
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:45,270
your son of a bitch.
You with two sentences short.

1117
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,210
I lifted that moved from you two.
When my aunt said I was very brave.

1118
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:55,050
I just brushed it off like you will
with this email. Go Fuck Yourself.

1119
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:59,460
Jesus Christ. He's fucking
guy's killing it here. Uh,

1120
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,020
should I be worried? Oh, it's totally
different. This is a different thing.

1121
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:08,220
I actually just assumed that this was
a guy too. It could have been a lady.

1122
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:12,720
All right. Should I be worried?
Well, congratulations sir. Or ma'am.

1123
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:18,090
Um, where am I? Uh, should
I be worried? Hey Bill.

1124
01:07:18,091 --> 01:07:22,080
Burrington the first,
please read this on the video.

1125
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:28,610
So I'm an English guy studying psychology
in France and I've been dating an

1126
01:07:29,101 --> 01:07:32,550
Italian girl for the last five months.
Do what? Do you fucking James Bond.

1127
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,090
Yeah,

1128
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:38,110
I'm insanely in love. It's
international cunt. What is the problem?

1129
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,630
Should I be worried?
You should be worried.

1130
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,640
You're an English guy living in France,

1131
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,280
studying psychology date
and some Italian woman.

1132
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:50,830
That's fucking awesome. I
want you to life. Uh, he goes,

1133
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:53,560
I'm insanely in love with her
and I think she may be the one,

1134
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,190
or at least the mother of my
hypothetical children. Hilarious.

1135
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,620
We both have a long
history of relationship.

1136
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,500
I've been with a lot of girls and
she's been with a lot of guys. Nice.

1137
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:06,970
You both experienced when he came
out of it unscathed? No STDs. That's,

1138
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:07,990
that's great for both of you.

1139
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,520
You know what that's like when you've
bagged a lot of women and she's banged a

1140
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,140
lot of guys and you get there unscathed.
You know what that's like?

1141
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:18,500
That's like one of those great
fucking Superbowl matchups you know,

1142
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:23,230
that's a pickup. It's like
the cowboys steel is 79. Uh,

1143
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:27,080
I'm insanely in love with Tara Bubba
Bubba way. Okay. The other day I bought,

1144
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:30,710
I brought up an ex and this
obviously pissed her off. Yeah.

1145
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:32,180
What the fuck you don't do that?

1146
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,210
Because she then said she was speaking
with an x on Facebook and he said he

1147
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:41,690
wanted to marry her. I know she's
still friends with some of her exes,

1148
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:46,700
those so am I. But I still, you
guys both need to fucking grow up.

1149
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:51,380
All right. Either get out of this
relationship, friends with your exes.

1150
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:56,300
But I still think her getting messages
from these guys who clearly still want to

1151
01:08:56,301 --> 01:09:00,610
fuck her is messed up obviously. And why
you still talking to your ladies? Uh,

1152
01:09:00,611 --> 01:09:05,180
you're keeping them in your little
fucking Dick Orbit, aren't ya? Uh,

1153
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:11,240
we're moving in together at the end of
the year and usually you would say dump

1154
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:14,060
the bitch. No, I'm not. I'm
saying you both need to grow up,

1155
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:17,930
but she says she loves me and I can't
lose this one. She's fucking beautiful,

1156
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:19,100
smart,
funny and sweet.

1157
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:23,150
So should I be worried about these fuckers
and therefore bring it up or should I

1158
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:25,670
just shrug it off? Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself. Well,

1159
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:27,650
I think you need to do what you
need to commit to this woman.

1160
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:30,470
You have to tell us. Say, listen,
I'm not talking to any of my,

1161
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:35,360
any more of my exes and it, and I would
appreciate it if you would do the same.

1162
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,300
I think we got a great
thing going here and um,

1163
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,163
you know,

1164
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:43,780
I don't,

1165
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,560
I don't feel it's right then I'm still
in contact with women that I used to be

1166
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:51,730
intimate with. It doesn't feel right
to me anymore the way I feel about you.

1167
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,480
And I'm hoping that you feel the same way
about you keeping in contact with your

1168
01:09:58,451 --> 01:10:00,070
excess.
I'm not trying to have a fight here.

1169
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,920
I just want to have a
rational conversation.

1170
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,270
Just start that way and then you know
what? You commit to her dude. It's over.

1171
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,030
Okay. All those other fucking guys
at Bangor and all that type of stuff.

1172
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:12,610
Did they give her a ring? No. You know,

1173
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,790
so you sound like you're an
older guy as far as like,

1174
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:17,140
you've been down the fucking,
you know.

1175
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:18,650
Okay.

1176
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,990
You know, you've been hacking your
way through the jungle for a while.

1177
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,020
Who the fuck's kitten home? All
right, what are you going to do here?

1178
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,430
You know you're going to lose this one.

1179
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:30,360
I don't think you're Gunna so commit to
her and then just show you come in by.

1180
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:34,940
But you know, once you lead by example,
maybe that'll work. I don't fucking know.

1181
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,630
But uh, that whole bullshit
where you both stay in, uh,

1182
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,510
well you're both fucking um,

1183
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:43,880
okay.

1184
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,160
You know, staying in contact
with the x's is bullshit. Uh,

1185
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:50,810
come on. Who's getting home? And you know,

1186
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:54,560
if you're a little drunk and then
he'd get on the fucking Facebook,

1187
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:57,670
their shit is said Bob bub knowledge.

1188
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,990
So you know what you need to do. You're
both too. All right, good luck to you.

1189
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,650
All right,
that's the podcast for this week.

1190
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:06,350
You'll fuck yourselves if you'd
like to donate to this podcast.

1191
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,620
Anytime you go on to Amazon, you're going
to go buy yourself a little hairnet.

1192
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:13,780
You know, maybe an apron a, if
you go to, uh, my wet website,

1193
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,250
[inaudible] dot com and you go into
the podcast page as an Amazon link.

1194
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,560
If you click that,
it'll take you right to Amazon,

1195
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,620
then buy whatever the fuck you want and
it doesn't cost you any extra money.

1196
01:11:23,621 --> 01:11:24,211
And then they get me,

1197
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:28,710
they give me a little doe
ray me for driving traffic
to their website. That's it.

1198
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,650
Simple as that. If you don't want
to do it, I totally understand. Oh,

1199
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:32,520
there's Joe to Rosa.

1200
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:37,521
Joe To Rosa will be at the punchline
in San Francisco this weekend.

1201
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:44,860
Oh, twinkle toes himself. So if you're
in the San Francisco area, it goes,

1202
01:11:44,861 --> 01:11:49,050
see fucking Joe to Rosa.
All right, there you go.

1203
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,950
That's my 2 cents for the fucking week.
Uh,

1204
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:56,250
I'm going to get caught up on some
Bruins games. I'm psyched to be back.

1205
01:11:56,251 --> 01:12:00,960
And once again, thank you.
Thank you to everybody.
Australia, New Zealand, Zealand,

1206
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:05,850
Singapore, Hong Kong in Mumbai. Uh,
thanks for coming out to the shows.

1207
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,390
Thanks to all the comics that I got to
hang out with and shoot the shit with. Uh,

1208
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,160
there's no fucking way. I'm not going
to come back and do it again. Uh,

1209
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:17,520
I just got to write some more
bullshit. Um, I had a great time.

1210
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:19,830
So that is it.
I'll talk to you fuckers next week.
