1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,290
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:09,550
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. And Ah,

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,010
just checking in on you.
Sorry,

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,760
I'm losing my voice is always
as I continue my way through.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,410
Um,
the first leg of the tour is over.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,500
I did Dublin, Belfast and
Galway, Ireland and um,

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,970
I could not have had a better time,
uh, caught a little bit of a cold,

8
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:34,090
but you know, that's what happens
when you go out. You know,

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,740
you have a couple of pops or whatever
and you didn't dress properly cause you

10
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:43,480
thought, you know, August and July over
here was going to be fucking warming shit.

11
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:48,370
Like it is where I live. It isn't
rains a lot. It's kind of cold.

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,030
And uh, I was running down so I got a
little bit of a cold, but I'm all right.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,943
But um,

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,600
I don't think I had done Belfast.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,493
MMM.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,270
By Monday. I don't think I did. And
maybe I was just going up there.

17
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:05,230
I can't remember. But I got to tell you
about Belfast fucking amazing, right?

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,463
MMM.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,170
I go up there and I was playing,
I wasn't aware of it.

20
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:14,850
The place I was playing was Ulster Hall,
which is a,

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,980
that's the first place of led Zeppelin
played it and that's the first place they

22
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:23,340
ever played stairway to heaven live.
So I was like,

23
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,600
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

24
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:29,601
So of course I googled that and then
some bootleg audio of it and uh,

25
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,910
the band actually said the
song didn't go over that well.

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,240
Sounded like they liked it enough,

27
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:37,560
although the person recording it was
kind of talking during some of it and I

28
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:41,400
found some pictures from when they
did the Gig there and there he is,

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,520
John Bonham sitting right
on the fucking stage.

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,123
MMM.

31
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,030
And then of course they had to look up
ACDC and 1979 they played there with Bond

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,020
Scott. And a lot of these places
you play by the time, you know,

33
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,140
I come around to them,
it's 40 30,

34
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:03,110
40 years after these people
that I love played them.

35
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:06,860
So they usually redid the place and
it doesn't look the same. All Hall,

36
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,670
they had not ridden the stage.
So I literally,

37
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:13,220
when I walked up on the stage,
got the fucking chills.

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,723
MMM.

39
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,580
Couldn't believe it.
So.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,613
MMM.

41
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:19,931
I don't know.

42
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,380
The only way to describe the people
in Belfast as you have to go there,

43
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,510
even if you didn't even know any of the
history, like the second you get there,

44
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,840
you're there for about three to four
seconds before you like, you know what,

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,970
I'm not fucking with anybody up here.

46
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,930
Um, the guy, I swear to God,

47
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,640
the guy who was running Ulster Hall,
one of them was like really nice,

48
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,970
but there's, you know, just regular,
hey, you're doing really cool guy.

49
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,700
But the other guy was also a cool guy,

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,910
but I cannot describe his vibe other
than to say if he was in a movie,

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,380
he would instantly like a
legend. Like I, I can't,

52
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,920
I don't think I, it's been a
long time since I met somebody.

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,200
I can't explain the guys vibe,
but I just knew that, um,

54
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,050
once again, the second I met him, I was
like, this guy has seen a bunch of shit.

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,010
This guy's not to be fucked
with. And, um, it was,

56
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:22,820
I dunno, it was just a
really, really, uh, you know,

57
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,110
anytime you go to a new city,

58
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:27,370
it's so cool just to see all this new
stuff and when you go there and it's,

59
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:31,820
that's such a fucking unique vibe. I
never felt like a vibe and that, uh,

60
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:36,530
in my life. And then I get to
play this legendary place and uh,

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,600
do the guy running the place,

62
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,390
I swear to God he should have
been like in one of those fucking,

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,930
one of those great guy movies,
one of those gangster movies,

64
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,420
he just had that vibe like, oh,
this is the guy, this is the guy.

65
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:49,790
If I pissed this guy off,
I'm going to get fucking whacked.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,500
That was literally the Vibe,
right?

67
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,440
So I go on stage and I'm up there and
my shit for the most part is working.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,800
And at one point I'm doing
some stupid bit and I,

69
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,690
and I'm using like American
sports references and it's
like the second night in

70
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:08,410
a row, they're not fucking working. So I
finally just say to the crowd, I just go,

71
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,920
all right. All right. And I go, obviously
this is an American sports, you know,

72
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,400
references, you guys don't know what I'm
talking about or you don't give a fuck.

73
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:20,230
I go, who? So you know, I was trying
to talk about a great player. So I go,

74
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,790
so who's your best football slash soccer
player? You know, who's like, you know,

75
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:29,170
the greatest of all time. And
this guy in the crowd said, uh,

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,220
we'll Griggs. And I was like, who
will Greg? And they're like, no,

77
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:37,990
we'll Briggs. I go by will Greg's.
And then they all cheered, right?

78
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,000
And I was like, all right,
now I've got the right guy.

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,320
So I continued doing my bits and anytime
I need a sports big, I'm throwing out,

80
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,150
we'll Griggs.
Right?

81
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,380
And then there was something about the
way they were laughing and the fact that

82
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:55,090
I got picked on so much as a kid that it
started to feel familiar and I started

83
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,930
thinking in my head like, wait a minute,
I, they fucking with me right now.

84
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,400
So of course after like
a fucking half hour,

85
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,700
I'm making a complete asshole on myself.
Keep using.

86
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:10,720
We'll Greg's his fucking name,
like he's the second coming of Palae.

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,380
I finally look at the crowd and I go,

88
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,220
wait a minute, are you guys just
fucking with me? It's this guy,

89
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:21,460
a really good player or are you guys
just making me look like a fucking, uh,

90
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,310
is he just a piece of shit and you
think it's funny to say his name,

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,920
not a piece of shit.
Just a journeymen guy.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,610
And they all laughed and
applauded that I figured it out.

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,820
And when I loved is after they did that,
I was like,

94
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,470
these motherfuckers got me again.

95
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,590
They like the best hecklers or this is
what killed me is after I figured out

96
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,410
that they just sat there and were content,

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,520
totally content to sit there and watch
me not figure it out or figure it out,

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,790
make an ass of myself or
eventually redeem myself.

99
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,560
Either way it was going to
be entertaining to them.

100
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,610
I really looked at the crowd and
it was people of all fucking ages.

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,700
I'm telling you the Irish sense of humor,
man,

102
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,140
it's every time I fucking go over there.

103
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,830
I told you in the last time
I went over there, I try,
I'm just going like, oh yeah,

104
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:14,510
you know, I didn't come from a touchy
feely family. My parents, you know,

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,160
my mother wasn't a big hugger and never
really hugged me, blah, blah, blah.

106
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:19,700
I was working to something else.
It wasn't the point.

107
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,970
I couldn't even get past that.
The whole crowd just goes, aw,

108
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,300
I know these are old stories,

109
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,330
but I've got to give you a refresher
just so you understand what happens to me

110
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,350
every time I go over there.

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,550
And then also I remember I was giving
out free autograph DVDs because I wanted

112
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:38,670
them to play him for their friends.
So hopefully I would draw more people in.

113
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:43,430
I'm literally at the end of my act.
Thank you so much for coming out. Uh,

114
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:47,510
I brought some DVDs, I
autographed them, they're free,

115
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,240
please just take one, blah, blah.
And I'm in the middle of just saying,

116
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm giving you a free fucking DVD that I
loved over there from the other side of

117
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,690
the world. I'm in the middle of
it. And this guy in the back,

118
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,360
I just hear this guy go,
oh fuck off.

119
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,530
It just, I dunno, they're fucking great.
So anyway, so I figured that one out.

120
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,020
So the next day I drive out to Galway.
When you drive across the country,

121
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:14,840
which takes like three and a half hours
to go from the east coast to the west

122
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:18,800
coast, we go out there, some of the most
beautiful land I've ever seen in my life.

123
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,180
They got these fucking stone walls,
dry stone wall,

124
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,260
nothing holding them together other than
the fucking brains of the person that

125
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,750
figure out how to place each rock.

126
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,290
Absolutely backbreaking work that
some of the walls are like three,

127
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,500
400 years old. And, um,

128
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,560
the driver's telling me all these
great stories and all this shit.

129
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,560
So I get out to Galway and um,

130
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,500
I get it in my head
because I have a fucking,

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,640
I had caught a cold at that point that
I wanted to buy one of those Irish old

132
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:53,120
man sweaters. Um, and Aran Sweater,

133
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,430
a r a n or something like that.
They kept saying,

134
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,920
it sounded like they were
saying iron. Like I r, O,

135
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:01,740
n or they just call them jumpers.
Say there's,

136
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,830
well you won't get a jumper or some shit.

137
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,620
I thought that meant like a fucking
Ranko and like no one of those knitted

138
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,870
fucking,
you know,

139
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:11,630
I'm an Irish guy and I want to
have a fucking drink of some shit.

140
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,230
Sit next to a boat. They're like,
yeah, jumper. So I go, all right.

141
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:19,640
So I get in my head that I want to buy
one of these fucking things and um,

142
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,531
it's all like,
all right,

143
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,380
I'll do it the next morning before I
go back to Dublin and then head over to

144
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,320
England.
So I go down to do a,

145
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,250
my gig in a side of them.

146
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,850
I came up with the name of the fucking
venue and we will ride over and they just

147
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,530
kept going, hey, just to
let you know, you know,

148
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,530
this isn't the most fanciest venue
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

149
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,910
And all I'm thinking of like,

150
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,570
there's no way this venue is worse than
some of the shit holes I played on the

151
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:48,800
way up. You know what I mean?
Or some of the fucking places,

152
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:52,160
the comedy condos. I stayed in and
I showed up and the place was great,

153
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,500
tremendous theater. They were more
talking about the dressing room,

154
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,600
cause it dressing room was
basically the men's room.

155
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,480
But even that was fine. They put
some carpet down. It wasn't bad.

156
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,390
So I'm waiting to go on and,
uh,

157
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,060
the act, who's is it up for me? She's
hilarious. What the fuck was her name?

158
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:16,590
I already forget. Oh God damn
it. It was an Italian name too.

159
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:20,340
She was hilarious. I'm
the worst. My apologies.

160
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,850
Um,
it was typical road,

161
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,810
like we've talked to each other for
like 20 minutes and then, I dunno,

162
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,830
not see each other again for
like five years. So anyways,

163
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,840
she says to me, uh, she
started telling me this story

164
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,020
right before I go on stage as to how like,

165
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,660
you know, back in the day, you know, if
you weren't married and you are a woman,

166
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,780
the fuck was her name. Adriana.
I have no worst. Anyways,

167
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,430
she starts telling me
that back in the day. Um,

168
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,631
you know,
if a,

169
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:01,631
if a woman got pregnant and she wasn't
married to save the embarrassment,

170
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,490
they'd send them to this fucking place
out there near Galway to basically have

171
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:10,280
the baby.
Then the church would take the baby,

172
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,060
the woman would go back to the family
and there'd be no embarrassment and then

173
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:19,061
the baby would then they'd make money
off the baby by fucking given it to some

174
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:24,170
rich white people in America who
wanted to adopt a white baby. Right.

175
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,500
And, but what happened was
to stay had a ton of babies,

176
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,070
cause evidently everybody over there,
I was doing a lot of fucking,

177
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,910
and they weren't using
any sheepskin right.

178
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,070
They didn't use that jumper and wrap it
around their fucking dick or maybe they

179
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,980
didn't the same and got through.
I have no idea. So anyways,

180
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:43,490
they had a ton of fucking
babies and toddlers and some
of them were getting sick

181
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,740
and it was kind of a big secret thing.
Everybody kind of knew,

182
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:49,880
but nobody said Shit. So I have
a deadly. When the babies died,

183
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,480
they just fucking put them in like this.

184
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,020
The comedian told me it was
like a fucking, not an oil drum,

185
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,680
like a what have you got?
A what do,

186
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:05,540
what do you call a big fucking thing
that holds oil and it's underground big

187
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,660
tank or some shit. Long story
short, one time when their,

188
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,730
whatever they went to dig it up,
whatever they put them in,

189
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:15,500
they found a mass grave of
800 dead babies and toddlers.

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,320
She tells me this fucking story, right?
It's right before I'm going to go on.

191
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:24,840
And then she laughed. She goes,
have a great set. Right? Um,

192
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,530
so of course that became the reference.

193
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:30,300
The entire show was the dead babies
that were out there because um,

194
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,820
Tom Rhodes told me that if he
could live anywhere in the world,

195
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:38,020
Galway is where he wants to fucking be.
That's where he would stay. And that guy,

196
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:40,840
he's been literally around the world.
So I'm going out there going, oh,

197
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:44,140
this is going to be the most quaint
fucking Irish fishing village ever.

198
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,900
And it was right before I go on stage.

199
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:51,700
Of course I got to hear about
800 dead fucking babies. Right?

200
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,920
So here's the,
of course,

201
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,340
anybody else who did that would be
world famous for being the fucking worst

202
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,170
person ever. Right. Would make
Hitler look like a Jay Walker,

203
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,290
you know? And, but of course
it was the Catholic church,

204
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,730
so there was really barely a fucking
investigation. Nobody got in trouble,

205
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,800
nobody went to fucking jail. Um, so that's
what I learned when I was out there.

206
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,640
And I also that there's a bear
out there called a Galway hooker.

207
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,050
And I went out there and I proceeded to
get so fucking hammered that the only

208
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:29,500
picture I took of Galway was
the fucking tap that you pulled.

209
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:33,160
It says Galway hooker. And I had to
kind of try and remember what it was.

210
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,190
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking bill,

211
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:40,120
you said you weren't going to drink a
lot on this tour. Well, I caught a cold,

212
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,280
so you know, you supposed to drink a lot
of liquids and flush in audience. So,

213
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,850
um,
anyway,

214
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,790
so the next day I wake up and um,
I dunno,

215
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,120
it was kind of freaking out about having
to drive all the way back to Dublin.

216
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,740
And then also having to go through customs
to fuck and then get into England and

217
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,050
show my fucking papers
and all of that shit.

218
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,160
Then I woke up and uh, I
just realized, I was like,

219
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,460
I don't have time to buy that fucking
sweater. It's an impulse fucking by,

220
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,080
I'll get one the next time I go there
and I'm probably just want to buy it,

221
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,010
you know,

222
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,640
because I'm in Ireland and I'm drinking
their beer and I'm getting all caught up

223
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:18,911
in it.

224
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,310
It's like he'd go to the Netherlands
and all of a sudden you buy some fucking

225
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,440
wooden shoes. What do you, what the
fuck are you going to do with them?

226
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,030
What do I need a fucking Irish knit
sweater for? I live in a Goddamn desert,

227
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,520
right? Although it does get
cold at night. All right,

228
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,740
and is the fucking worst thing,
do you know?

229
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,610
I haven't been able to stop thinking about
it and I'm like, you fucking asshole.

230
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,610
So now I'm going on their website.
I can't try it on.

231
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,320
I can't see which sweater I look like
the least amount of a Douche bag in.

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,780
And then there's selection isn't as good.

233
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,100
And I can't tell the story that I got
an in Galway Ireland when, you know,

234
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,310
cause if you have one of those sweaters
and you wear 'em out in fucking La,

235
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,700
you just going to look like
some fucking act to reduce,

236
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,810
trying to dress his type to get a part
in the next time they do the movie

237
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:05,470
departed. If I could actually
be like, no, you hipster cunt.

238
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,890
I actually bought that in Galway,
Ireland when I did a Gig out there.

239
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,660
So go fuck yourself.
By the way,

240
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,800
do you know about the 800 dead babies
that would shut anybody down? You know,

241
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,250
but I didn't buy it, so I already
have a fucking regret about that.

242
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,450
But the upside is, is that
just means that I, uh,

243
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,010
you know,

244
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,880
I have to go back and I have to buy one
and I'm not going online to fucking buy

245
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:28,714
one.

246
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,600
I'm going to go back to O'malley's out
there and I'm going to fucking buy when

247
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,710
next time I go out there. So, uh,
thank you to everybody out in Ireland,

248
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,530
came out to my shows. Um,
thank you. Do a shame.

249
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:42,280
My driver fucking drove like a
fucking lunatic and a good way,

250
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,300
made all kinds of great moves
to get me there and back. Um,

251
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,650
I wanted to see the peace walls when
I was up in Belfast and was just,

252
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,870
it got too late at night and we
were driving a nice car in the tags.

253
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,830
Just clearly showed that we
were from a, I guess, you know,

254
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,830
the Catholic side or whatever.
So they were just like, yeah,

255
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:07,730
we don't need to be driving by that wall.
So maybe next time.

256
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,060
And then also there's something weird
about all the pain and suffering.

257
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:15,830
Then everybody went through up there that
you fucking would want to drive by it

258
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,980
in like fucking rubber neck and
take pictures and shit. I always,

259
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:23,180
I always feel disrespectful when
I do shit like that. So, um,

260
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,220
anyways, the, uh, I ended
up making my flight.

261
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:33,050
I was way fucking early and um, I did, uh,

262
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,980
Bristol last night. Um, amazing
venue, unbelievable crowd,

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
Jesus Christ. I'm all, every
crowd I've got on stage.

264
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,500
The way that they've been
welcoming to me has been, uh,

265
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,890
I immediately go into my self
conscious fucking, you know, ah, Jesus,

266
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,420
their expectations are too high.

267
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,550
I'm going to do a bunch of Shit and
Dick Jokes and they're going to be like,

268
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,670
this show sucked or whatever.
Um, I've been having so much fun,

269
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,070
actually did a two hour
show last night and Bristol,

270
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,290
I apologize to the people in the crowd.
I mean,

271
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,560
as much as you like somebody
to go a little bit long,

272
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,650
that's too long to have people
sit in there. So my apologies. Um,

273
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,770
anyways, so today, uh,
also I get into Bristol,

274
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,990
I stayed in this really
cool, uh, in, you know,

275
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,510
and uh,
and actually had a key,

276
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,150
the name of my room was not a number,

277
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,800
it was just somebody named had
said Harvey's, you know, it's,

278
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,610
they had all these weird names and shits.

279
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,910
He kind of had to remember
what floor you're on. And uh,

280
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,260
I showed up and it was this really cool
ass looking room and they had left like

281
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,950
a little piece of chocolate cake with
some powdered sugar on it. And you know,

282
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,560
old freckles. I got a sweet
tooth, so I'm like fantastic.

283
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,670
I sit down to eat it and there's a bunch
of little fucking ants all over it.

284
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,250
Fucking gross. So I had it's take it
and I stuck it on the window sill.

285
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,610
I forgot to remove it
when I went to go leave.

286
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:58,020
So I hope the cleaning lady finds it.
Uh,

287
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,540
my apologies to whoever gets that room
after me. Um, if you get that room,

288
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,120
it's Harvey's and I
left it out on the deck.

289
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,380
It had this little deck area we could
sit down and it was just fucking ants and

290
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:11,990
they were all over the plate and I was
blowing them off the plate and I'm like,

291
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:15,320
what am I doing now? They're on the rug,
let's get this whole thing out of there.

292
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:18,920
And there was so many of them as I
was carrying them, I was filling them,

293
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,430
starting to climb on my hand
and I was just like that,

294
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,790
like running over to that little thing,

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,440
try to get it open and I stuck it out
there. So whatever the aunts love me,

296
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:34,040
cause I didn't kill any of them when
they all got a nice piece of cake. Um,

297
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,700
so this morning taking you
through the whole fucking trip,

298
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm driving up to Manchester and I keep
saying legendary Manchester Cause I read

299
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:46,920
this book among the thugs.
If you ever want to read a
great book, it's about a, a,

300
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,060
an American journalists.

301
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:52,190
They Yank who goes and he
somehow ingratiates himself to,

302
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:57,060
to the supporters over there and he gets
really into the fucking the hood limbs

303
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:01,380
and all hoodlums, whatever and all
that type of shit back when, uh,

304
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,250
you know, you were basically
taking your life into your hand.

305
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,960
It's seemed anyways when you
went to a match back then. Um,

306
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,611
so anyways,

307
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:15,690
we would drive it up there today and I
actually finally a bucket list thing,

308
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,160
I got to,
uh,

309
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,050
go by John Bonham's grave
and pay my respects.

310
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,550
And once again, you know, as much
as I wanted to take a Selfie,

311
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,330
it was just such a quiet, peaceful
place. It just didn't seem right.

312
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,950
So I didn't, I did take a
picture of the grave, um,

313
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,690
because it was just really cool.

314
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:40,560
All the drum sticks and symbols and stuff
and the stuff that people leave there.

315
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,920
And I did go in and sign the
guest book and it's cool.

316
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,410
You go and you get to say
a nice thing about, uh,

317
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,700
the greatest rock drummer and
my opinion of all time. And, uh,

318
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,260
I still can't believe that
I got to go the, it's,

319
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,180
it's like, I dunno, you walk in there
and you're waiting for somebody to say,

320
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:04,530
tell you to stop. You know, nobody
does this, this little cemetery.

321
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,770
And you just sort of walking
around looking for the,

322
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,280
you looking for the drum sticks,
leaned up against the headstone and uh,

323
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,480
and then all of a sudden,
there it is. And I don't know,

324
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,470
just that guy is so big in my
head, I couldn't believe, you know,

325
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,770
even though he's been dead and
gone for 30 something years,

326
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,010
I'm 36 years coming up.

327
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,993
Uh,

328
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,790
I dunno. That's it. I don't know.
It was, it was an amazing feeling.

329
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,690
And uh,
so I did that earlier today.

330
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:39,390
And then we stopped off at a place,
got some fish and chips,

331
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,840
did the whole fucking English thing.
And uh,

332
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,340
now I'm up here in Manchester.
I'm having the greatest time. Uh,

333
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,400
these crowds have been awesome.
So I'm playing the Apollo theater tonight,

334
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:55,350
which a lot of all these fucking
bands that I listened to, you know,

335
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,180
the fucking Beatles played there. The
rolling stones, led Zeppelin played there.

336
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,090
I imagine James Brown,
all the people from that era.

337
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:07,800
I Bet Jimi Hendrix played there. It's
been there forever in all those people.

338
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,090
You know, we're coming up during
that time and played there. So, uh,

339
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,470
that's what I'm going to be doing for the
up until the show is trying to youtube

340
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,330
all like shows like that. So this, this
really feels like a fucking paid vacation.

341
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,780
Um, so anyways, let me, uh,

342
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,190
I got a little bit of advertising
here. I got to read. Uh,

343
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,220
if I can type in my password
and talk at the same time,

344
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,800

25 minutes. Um, you know
I was up late last night.

416
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,670
I couldn't sleep.
You know what I was reading up?

417
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:17,780
I was watching a bunch of youtube
videos trying to learn a couple of Mike

418
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,950
Johnston drum fills watching this kid,
show me how to shave my own head.

419
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,380
Um, and then also I stumbled upon
a, I dunno how I got onto it,

420
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:30,260
but I saw that whole fucking
Twitter thing with Leslie Jones,

00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,130
one of the funniest fucking
Comedians I've ever seen. Um,

422
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,820
how she was I guess online or something
was on Twitter or whatever her movie

423
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:40,310
Ghostbusters was coming up right.

424
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,230
And a bunch of people attacked your road,
all this racist Shit,

425
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,700
you know, up to all about freedom
of speech. But this got to do,

426
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,400
you know what they should be on Facebook.

427
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,080
People should have to use their
real names and have their real face,

428
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,240
you know? And then if you want to go
say a bunch of racist Shit, you know,

429
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,530
rather than hiding behind your
faceless picture with the fucking egg,

430
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,150
it's just what, a bunch of just
a bunch of fucking pussies.

431
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:15,800
And that is so overwhelmingly depressing
that people still think that way.

432
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,113
You know?

433
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,133
I Dunno.

434
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,660
I also always wonder how people
who attract that is their fan base.

435
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,700
Never question what it
is that they're saying.

436
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,010
You know what I mean?
Like if that's how your fan base behaves.

437
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,140
And I'm not singling anybody out,

438
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:40,130
but I've had experience myself with
people like that. It's just like,

439
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,480
you know, I don't know, even like a
Donald Trump guy, it's some point,

440
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,610
he's never at any point addressed
like, hey, overtly racist people.

441
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,920
This is not what I'm
saying with my speeches.

442
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,170
He just completely fucking ignores it.
2016 it's fucking astounding.

443
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,450
So, um, whatever, in the end of the day,

444
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,860
Leslie's going to have the last laugh
because she's living her fucking dream and

445
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,694
you know something.

446
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,120
I don't wish those racist people
not to have their dreams come true.

447
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,930
I just wish that they travel a
little more, widen their fucking

448
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,450
array of friends and maybe they wouldn't
be such ignorant comments. All right,

449
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,190
I'm off my fucking soapbox.

450
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,350
So I'm in Manchester here tonight.
Uh,

451
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,640
I'm not going to lie. I have not
been eating as well as I should,

452
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:33,330
but you don't pay the price for it over
in Europe. The way we do in the states.

453
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,590
I don't know what their food is. It's
just, I know it's a better quality food.

454
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,503
Uh,

455
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,900
I can tell you right now,
I don't give a fuck.

456
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,850
We fish and ships don't Jesus Christ,
they put it in a fee,

457
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,550
wrap it up in this piece of paper in
the grease, but you can't even like,

458
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:50,540
as it's coming through,

459
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,930
the greases already been absorbed in
your body through like the skin in your

460
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:56,690
hands.
And I guess back in the day,

461
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,260
the promoted Gordon was
telling me, um, they use,

462
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:05,150
still wrap it up in like Dale newspaper.

463
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,290
So by the time you ate it,

464
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,390
some of your fries would have like,

465
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,030
would be blackened with
the ink from the newspaper.

466
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,900
And I guess they would up until
10 years ago, they finally,

467
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,440
they was still doing it until
somebody finally just said like, Hey,

468
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:25,070
this probably isn't the most
healthiest thing for us,

469
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,280
our citizens to dope.
You know, what to say.

470
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:32,420
We actually just use a sanitize
piece of paper. But, um,

471
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,190
I was sitting down where I don't
even know where the hell I was. Uh,

472
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,420
okay.

473
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,570
Right before we were going over
to go up to John Bottoms grave.

474
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,010
And,
uh,

475
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,300
you know, if you ever do that
by the way, like it's, it's,

476
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:50,250
it's an amazing thing to do and just,

477
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,060
uh, I dunno, I,

478
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,380
you'll see when you go there,
you're not going to fucking sit there.

479
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,440
I didn't want to say because someone
would do it just to be a Douche.

480
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,830
It's like one of the biggest asshole
things you could ever do is to do that

481
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:07,320
fucking, you know, that stupid
picture that all the kids do. The,

482
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,780
the Yolo Douche photo of, you know,
when you got the peace side, you know,

483
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,660
he'd have John Bonham's headstone
over your fucking head. Um,

484
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,920
you know, it's, I'm telling you,
even if you are one of those costs,

485
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:24,140
if you get there, you will
immediately just be like, yeah,

486
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:28,430
this is not the place for that
behavior. So, um, anyways,

487
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,950
that is the, uh, that's the podcast here.

488
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,473
Uh,

489
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,500
looking forward to all these gigs.
I do Manchester,

490
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,190
then I got two nights in London, then I
go to Amsterdam, then I go up to Scotland,

491
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,830
uh,

492
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,970
and then there's Germany.

493
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:47,470
And then fucking Belgium and then all
Billy freckles is going to meet up with

494
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:50,740
the lovely Nia and we're gone. I'm going
to be on vacation. I can't fucking wait.

495
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,643
Uh,

496
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,820
yeah.

497
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,920
And uh, I'm all right. I got
to whittle down my act though.

498
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:56,610
I can't do a two hour fucking special,

499
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,413
you know,

500
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,610
unless I call it for fuck sakes.
When you get to the point you freckled.

501
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,880
All right. That's it for the podcast.
Uh, have a good weekend. You constant.

502
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,050
I'll check in on Monday.

503
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:33,983
Sure.

504
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,233
Yeah.

505
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,400
What's going on? It's built,
it's the Monday morning podcast.

506
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,130
As you might have guessed.
I am a little bit under the weather.

507
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,770
Uh, I don't know what happened
actually. I know what happened.

508
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,770
I fucking traveled too,
too much.

509
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,690
I came back from my fucking vacation,
flew across the country,

510
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,830
was in la for one day,
got right back on a fucking plane.

511
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,420
You know that too with germs and that I
get four hours of radio in the morning

512
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,543
and that'll do it.

513
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,310
If you have a one to how comedian gets
a fucking cold in the middle of the

514
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:32,810
goddamn summer, you know, it was,

515
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,970
there was this lady in the
magazine store when I was in lax,

516
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,290
I went in to go buy a little trail mix,
you know,

517
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,350
trying to not spend
any fucking money what?

518
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm on the plane because I'm sick of these
guys with all the other added charges.

519
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,090
So like I don't want to go to do,
that's a loud truck.

520
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,470
You let him get up the hill for
a second. All right. I was like,

521
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:01,910
I know what I've got to do. I'm going to
buy some trail mix and I'll get a water,

522
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,800
a couple of waters and uh,

523
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,130
just nibble on the fucking nuts and the
berries or whatever the crap I was going

524
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:13,850
to get. Uh, and uh, so anyway,

525
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:17,060
so I go to the magazine store
and this lady behind the cow,

526
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:21,530
this lady behind the counter had this
fucking middle of the winter cold.

527
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:25,250
I couldn't believe it. I
mean, I'm talking like,

528
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,740
you know when you get a cold that day
and a half where you know what I mean?

529
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,700
It's like if we lived in a
little more of a police state,

530
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:37,730
you'd be fucking quarantine.
You know?

531
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,440
It was like that part of the
cold and she's fucking at work.

532
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,570
She sounded like me except her nose was
running and shit and she's fucking like,

533
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,970
yes. Well not small, but she
just wished you had exact change.

534
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,493
You know what I'm saying?

535
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,920
You know anytime you stand in line
there's always that fucking asshole.

536
00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,370
Usually a check who takes out the little
change purse and gives them the exact

537
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:00,861
fucking thing.

538
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:04,550
I bet they never get coats or at
least they don't get him for fucking

539
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,870
people in a magazine store or something.
I don't know what I'm saying.

540
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,490
I don't know what I'm saying.

541
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,580
You know that that's so much fucking
medicine I got in me right now.

542
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,540
I slept in 20 minute
increments last night.

543
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,980
Fucking blowing my nose.
Aos.

544
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,030
Funny is whenever I get a cold is I sound
like that guy from sexy beast to ever

545
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:33,260
see that movie. You know, the beginning
part when he's laying in the pool,

546
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,580
the next to the pool and he's just like,
I

547
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,120
did that. He had of sway

548
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,620
roasting
boy

549
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,810
like
swell.

550
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,410
It's like a sauna.

551
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,010
It's pretty good. Right? London,

552
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,150
well,
London,

553
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,370
every cab will allow face
Dell make me laugh. All right.

554
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,240
Oh my God,
my fucking head is killing me.

555
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,770
You know my fucking head is killing me
and I'm still doing the podcast is that's

556
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:25,310
how fucking dedicated I am. Actually,
yesterday was the worst part of it,

557
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,170
you know,
and I had the double Claude,

558
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,430
like some important cement in my nostrils,

559
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,150
so I had to walk around with my mouth
open like p diddy does and shack them.

560
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,190
I've talked about that,

561
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,240
that disease where your mouth is
open even when you're not talking,

562
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,300
you know,
maybe shack and p diddy I those,

563
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,140
those kinds of people who
they always have, you know,

564
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,510
you ever go to school with some of the,
always had a cold, you know what I mean?

565
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,010
It's like if we lived in the olden days,
the,

566
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,840
they're the ones who would have fucking,
you know,

567
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,830
got some sort of fever and died when
they were six and he's never had a chance

568
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:08,010
because there was no penicillin.
You know, looking at you,

569
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,810
you're like leather,
your leather man,

570
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,730
I can't get that fucking
movie out of my head.

571
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:18,731
I watched sexy beast the whole fucking
way up to Denver and the way vacs such a

572
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:23,510
great fucking movie. Teddy
Bass, Mr. Black Magic.

573
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,970
Um, all right, so if you knew
of my podcast, I'm usually,

574
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,030
I'm usually not sick.
In fact,

575
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:34,730
this might be the first time I've
ever been fucking sick. What?

576
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:37,010
I've done one of these and

577
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,740
it's horrible. It's just why not? Why is
it cold in the summertime? So much worse.

578
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,180
I don't usually, you guys
ask me questions. I got a
question for you. Why is that?

579
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,580
You know what I mean? I, I don't get it.

580
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,700
That's one of those moments where
you try to speak and then, you know,

581
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,620
it was just fucking clogs up so you to
swallow this just terrible. All right,

582
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,150
here we go. Let's get into the
fucking the questions question.

583
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,130
So you knew one of my podcasts, like
I said, I'm not usually fucking sick.

584
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,430
I usually don't have this
late night DJ sort of voice.

585
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,170
It's a little higher up like fucking
Steve Buscemi and uh, whatever.

586
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:19,700
People send me questions or I ask them
questions and I fucking bullshit around

587
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,130
and I hype stuff that I have
coming up. Like for example, um,

588
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,740
I have a one hour special called,

589
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:30,240
why do I do this coming out August 31st,

590
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,590
very easy to remember the last day of
August. It's a Sunday night. You know,

591
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,280
how'd you curl up with a
special someone and uh,

592
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,390
200 of your closest fucking Fred's.
Not even that.

593
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:46,440
Just find someone who has a
fucking Nielsen box. They know,

594
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,740
you know the old ladies who are in the
Jesus cause I think they're the only ones

595
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:54,630
who get boxes. If you think about that,
if you had a fucking, uh, Nielsen box,

596
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:58,320
like a, what would actually stay on
the air and what wouldn't, you know,

597
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,570
would you feel some
sort of responsibility?

598
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Would you deliberately be an asshole and
watch bad shows just to keep them on?

599
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,060
Um, I don't fucking know.
All right, let's get,

600
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,180
I only got one question this week for
some fucking reason. I don't know why.

601
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,820
I know I got more,
I couldn't find them and I feel like shit.

602
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,790
So I'll go through and I'll try
to find it for fucking next week,

603
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,350
but as of right now,

604
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,780
this is the one and only
question for this week.

605
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,000
[inaudible] all right.
Uh,

606
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:34,680
I wanted to know that being
in your thirties I'm actually
40 do you feel you've

607
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:38,850
accomplished a lot as a comedian so far
or do you feel you should have a bigger

608
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:43,410
fan base and be a little more well
known among popular celebrities?

609
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,640
Not saying none. No. About you though.

610
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,150
Okay. There's a lot of questions
in there. Okay. First of all,

611
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:55,170
I'm 40 do you feel you've covered
a lot as a comedian? Yes I do.

612
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,200
Do I feel I should have a bigger fan base?

613
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,190
I feel I could have been
smarter as a business person.

614
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,270
I don't know. You know what, I'm
right where I'm supposed to be.

615
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,610
And that's how you have to think
when you're in this business,

616
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,750
because if you start looking at other
people and compare and that's the quickest

617
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:16,020
way to be fucking miserable. And I already
have a cold and I'm already miserable.

618
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:20,160
So why start beating myself up? Um, no,

619
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,830
I actually think I have,
uh,

620
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,540
a great level of note notoriety where I
feel I'm a respected as a comic and a,

621
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:33,360
that's what I wanted, you know,
as far as being bigger, you know,

622
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,440
I had to get good and uh,
you know,

623
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,050
I'm not going to come up with the
catch phrase and shit like that,

624
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,060
but I'm getting better at the business.

625
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,930
Like I haven't taken all my sets with
stupid shit happens with the crowd.

626
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:49,360
I've been putting them up,
you know,

627
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:52,150
try to put them up on youtube to
keep my fucking face out there.

628
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:54,490
So I'm trying to get a little bit better,
but you know,

629
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,990
but do I think that should be more
well known among popular celebrities?

630
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,490
You know, it's fucking hilarious
is for some reason in my world,

631
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,200
celebrities don't watch TV.

632
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,710
They don't watch movies and they
have no idea they're just on TV.

633
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,120
You know what I mean? So
I would just, you know,

634
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:16,900
I always assumed they didn't watch it. You
know, kind of like if you're a mailman,

635
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,500
you wouldn't go home and then watch
somebody deliver mail. He'd be like, dude,

636
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:24,220
I did that all day, you know? But, uh,

637
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,961
I dunno.

638
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:29,140
I did that Spike TV awards and there
was a ton of fucking celebrities there.

639
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,510
And I gotta be honest with you,
none of them know who the fuck I was,

640
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,020
which, you know, I think is about right.
Cause I need to be honest with myself.

641
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,590
I can walk down the street and
I don't get mobbed. You know,

642
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,340
when I go walk down the street to
get a slice of pie or some shit,

643
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,570
it doesn't end up on TMZ.
Right. Oh my God, you got,

644
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:53,420
you got to see this. Bill Berg
got a fucking snickers bar. Okay.

645
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,640
It's like he couldn't even open the
wrapper and then have that old guy on the

646
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,790
show. He's just like, oh fuck.
That's definitely making this show.

647
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,140
That show is, uh, it's unwatchable.

648
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,860
It's unwatchable not because of
the clips I've watched the clip,

649
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:13,720
but when they go to their little fucking
home center and they try to act like

650
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,230
absolutely nothing is something,
you know,

651
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,290
when I like fucking Hell Nah,
I don't even know.

652
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,950
I can not only make it pass that open
apart where they just started talking

653
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:26,920
about, you know, okay, Meryl Streep.

654
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,980
Evidently she's in the deal point add.

655
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,920
She wants to make this
fucking American flag.

656
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,590
The old boy as she forgot to get yard.

657
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,150
So she was a little upset when
she drove back to the Onstar.

658
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,850
And then the old guy, oh my God,
that's making the shell, um,

659
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,180
roast in here,
boy.

660
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,920
Sweller and that's my favorite
word. He says. Sweller all right.

661
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,050
Uh, this is tremendous. All right. Uh,

662
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,050
last week I talked about shit that was
underrated or somebody asked me what I

663
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,090
thought the most underrated
overrated thing was,

664
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,510
which shut off a big debate here. And, uh,

665
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:08,350
so people send me and shit what they
think is underrated and what they think is

666
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:13,090
overrated. Okay? So let's start with
this first person. Uh, they would say,

667
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:15,850
I would say marriage is overrated.
Big Time.

668
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,740
I was married and it didn't work out,
so fuck it. I think it's overrated

669
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,220
as fucking hilarious. Anything that
you had a shitty experience with,

670
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,850
you know what I mean? You
just automatically thinks
it sucks. Like yourself.

671
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,810
Beautiful Girl. You know what
I mean? Eight. Oh, and you
sit in the top, your friend.

672
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:38,210
Oh my God, she's beautiful.
She's gorgeous. Uh, God,

673
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,130
what do I say to when you
go up and you ask her out,

674
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,620
ask her to dance and she turns you down.
Then immediately he like, she's a cunt.

675
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,570
Jan.
I don't think she's that hot.

676
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,090
Anytime anybody brings her
up for the rest of the time,

677
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,790
you get to say it's
overrated. So, you know what,

678
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't think marriage is overrated.
I think if you're with the right person,

679
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,350
that's got to be a great thing.
You know?

680
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,350
Cause what happens is as
you get fucking old like me,

681
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
you become susceptible to colds in
the middle of the fucking winter.

682
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,510
And uh, you know what I mean? Or
what are you going to do? You know,

683
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:15,170
at some point he wants some
sort of companionship and uh,

684
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,250
I dunno, I'm gradually getting towards
that. I don't want to be fucking alone,

685
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,950
you know what I mean?
Is that why people get married though?

686
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,731
I think people get bad.

687
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,950
That's when it's because they want to
have kids and I think people get married

688
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,010
their forties cause they don't want
to be alone. You know what I mean?

689
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,430
Why am I talking to you guys?
Like you can fucking respond.

690
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,080
Like this is some sort of live shit.

691
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,290
Like this is some sort of fancy
fucking technology. It is it. Okay,

692
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:40,520
next thing somebody said, John Mayer is
overrated. He's a boring guitar player.

693
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:44,840
He's boring. People need to stop
saying he's like Jimi Hendrix.

694
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,090
I didn't know they were saying that.

695
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,290
I knew that all of a sudden
he stopped doing that.

696
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,650
I want to run down the hall,
my High School,

697
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,950
whatever avenue that screaming
at the top of his lungs.

698
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,660
All of a sudden he's
playing with Steve Jordan,

699
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:03,070
my favorite fucking drummer of all time.
Um,

700
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,780
okay. You think he's overrated? I
might go with that a little bit.

701
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,040
I want to go there a little bit.

702
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,900
I think he's definitely a fuckin awesome
guitar player. He's got a ways to go,

703
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,100
but they already got them up on guitar
center where they got like Stevie Ray

704
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,700
Vaughan clapped it and
then it goes John Mayer.

705
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,640
I think that's a little bit premature,
you know,

706
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,480
and a guitar center since the fuck do I
know. I catch colds and fucking summer.

707
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,540
All right, next one. Underrated.
I would go with underrated.

708
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,390
I would go with friendship.
Isn't that a nice answer?

709
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:37,370
It's something a lot of
people take for granted.

710
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,390
People want to go out and meet a check
and hook up and yeah, I do that. Oh,

711
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:45,410
look at this guy. If I could talk himself
up. Yeah. People want a two onward,

712
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,340
you know, fuck it happens.
You wear the right shirt.

713
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,250
You got a good rap like me. Um, anyways,
but good friends are always there for you.

714
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,480
No one ever goes out looking for a friend.
But I'm glad I've got some,

715
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,960
I hope that didn't come across as
lame as the funny thing about a guy,

716
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:07,130
if you ever remotely open up emotionally,

717
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,020
you have to do a preemptive strike and
kind of call yourself half a fag before

718
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:15,430
somebody else did. What did I, sweet
little paragraph. He wrote that.

719
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,310
But good friends are always there for you.
No one ever goes out looking for Fred,

720
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,480
but I'm glad I have. So that's how he
heard in his head and he's like, oh fuck,

721
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,260
I need to correct as quickly. Uh,
do some damage. Corrosion control.

722
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,710
I know that there's a couple of
crosses lave, uh, by the way,

723
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:34,980
if somebody is blowing me, write down.
Yes, it is a female. All right. Uh,

724
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,540
what else we got? All
right. The crazy chefs. Oh,

725
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,690
was the question I asked.
If you watch that hell's kitchen,

726
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,480
my girlfriend watches that shit
and I can't watch it because,

727
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,510
uh, when that guy starts
yelling at those people, I just,

728
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,570
I lose all respect for because there's
no way I could fucking sit there.

729
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,020
You know, bad enough, I got to go.
Yes, chef. You know what I mean?

730
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,430
Like he's fucking General Schwarzkopf
or something, you know, uh, top of that.

731
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,180
If he's going to be screaming at me like,
well I know his dacha,

732
00:45:05,181 --> 00:45:09,220
who's the fuck is wrong
with you? I would just, Oh,

733
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,720
the whole plate of Nachos. I would heat
up the cheese first. I'm talking fucking,

734
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,850
I do it just to the side of his face,
you know what I mean?

735
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,040
Just to make his life more miserable
because he was just totally fucking just

736
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,570
get them, you know, just half his face.

737
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:27,120
So we looked like that guy and Dick Tracy
and he'd always have to cheat to his

738
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,660
right or his left while I
was really fucking evil and
I really thought that out.

739
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,960
They're not. Um, but anyways,

740
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:36,090
the person said the crazy chef
could act the way it does.

741
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:39,420
Cause apparently his food is amazing.
I don't know for sure.

742
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,160
I can't afford to heat this restaurants.

743
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,450
You really don't know what the
fuck you talking about. The uh,

744
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,580
okay. Uh, I can understand why you
don't understand Bruce Springsteen.

745
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,160
It's Kinda like how I am with Bob Dylan.

746
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,250
That's another fucking
guy I think is overrated.

747
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,440
And I know that's unbelievably,

748
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:01,620
I guess ignorant because there's a whole
generation of people that freak out.

749
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:06,330
I don't get it. I don't get it. He, he
sounds like he has a cold all the time.

750
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,550
They're retired aged guy.
I got too much of cold.

751
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,720
I used to be able to imitate him,
but fucking throw a bucket of Plato,

752
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,160
one bad knee this week.
All right.

753
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,760
That was the worst fucking depression
I've ever done. Hey, don't leave.

754
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,780
Still got level songs to play.
Um,

755
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,180
that's actually a quote somebody I knew
had when Bob Dylan was going through his

756
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:34,530
shitty fucking time in the 80s when he
was playing with Tom Petty and somebody

757
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:37,350
opened for him and blew him on
stage and everybody was walking out.

758
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,220
And I guess Bob Dylan, the fucking
legend of the 60s was onstage gold. Hey,

759
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:45,660
do leave. Still got a lot
more songs to play. Um,

760
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,680
alright. Uh, what else we got here?
Now listen, I love this person's cool.

761
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:54,030
If they made a nice quick list. What
enough to read a whole fucking paragraph.

762
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,530
Overrated. Colby Bryant. Um,

763
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,740
I dunno if he's over it cause
that guy does get a ton of shit,

764
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:06,570
but I was one of those people before
last season I was saying that he had the

765
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:11,571
skills to Jordan and then I watched
classic sports and I watch Michael Jordan

766
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,060
and then I went, oh yeah, that's
right. I forgot about that.

767
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,440
Um, he still his shit though.
All right. Number two,

768
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:22,080
a rod rod's overrated.

769
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:25,560
That I is a all over the amount of
buddy's fucking plump getting paid.

770
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:27,930
He's never won a ring. I'd go
at that. The Spiderman movies,

771
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,590
that might be my favorite thing
that someone has said is overrated.

772
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,640
Those movies fucking suck.

773
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,810
Does movies other worst fuck that.
Just bad.

774
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:41,430
That was such a great cartoon.
And then they just, ah,

775
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,460
what the fuck was his name? Uh,
he's going to say no. Wiley.

776
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,310
That's a guy for prevention.
They learn it's,

777
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:48,700
what's the name of the dude who fucking,

778
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,040
this is like two stars out there
that look exactly the same to me.

779
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:59,070
And I don't know that fucking I know
Alijah would is that the rings guy at the

780
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:01,630
Lord of the rigs,

781
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,960
the Lord of the Rings Guy and the guy
from Spiderman look the exact same ad.

782
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,050
If you were to scalp Josh Hartnett,

783
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:14,110
they'd all have the exact
same fucking haircut.

784
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:19,300
It's sort of an updated mo from the three
stooges. But those, those movies suck.

785
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,300
Um, I didn't see the last one
where they had the black suit.

786
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,120
That was my favorite period in Spiderman
when he got the black suit and made

787
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:27,100
them be fucking evil and
he couldn't control it.

788
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,590
But judging by the first two movies,

789
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:31,270
I was assuming they were
going to fuck it up. You know,

790
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,890
I just realized is that
a paranoid thought?

791
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,560
What if a guy have directed the
Spiderman movies for some reason,

792
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,650
knew who the fuck I was getting back
to celebrities of that type of shit.

793
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,150
A decided to fucking listen to my
podcast. He's like, this guy is great.

794
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:46,270
He's funny. Even way as a cold, he
can get a couple of lasts. Bob Dylan.

795
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:47,620
Freshman sucks,
but you know,

796
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,690
he's played on one day and then all of a
sudden I trash his trilogy. It was like,

797
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:53,680
I yo fuck him.

798
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,680
And he calls up an aging Donnie
most alright. Underrated. Uh,

799
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,150
I thought they said Robert De Niro,

800
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,020
this is the way I have dyslexia
person actually wrote Roberto Duran.

801
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,910
Uh, yes. Reverted to rent was
fucked after the no mas fight.

802
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,920
But uh, yeah, hands of stone.
Yeah. I, you know what?

803
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,580
It always goes back to fucking sugar
ray Leonard and I don't like how Marvin

804
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,840
Hagler actually plays second fiddle to
fucking sugar ray Leonard. Marvin be him.

805
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:27,280
All right, I'll fucking sugar ray
Leonard. Did he do that little flashy,

806
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,090
those little poo poo poo poo fucking
punches at the last 30 seconds.

807
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:34,840
He fucking steel around that he had on
shiny his shorts and next thing you know,

808
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:39,220
he went to the fucking fight.
It was bullshit. Um, well,

809
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,160
I'll tell you else Tommy Hearns go on
youtube and once with Tommy hard knocks

810
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:43,961
out,
Roberta Duran,

811
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:48,130
it's one of the most vicious fucking
left folks I've ever seen in my life.

812
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,493
He's like,

813
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,500
he's one of those freaks of nature
where he weighed like 150 860 pounds,

814
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:01,350
but somehow he was like six one or six
two so he could hit you from across the

815
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:05,890
room if you watch his arm when he throws.
It's kind of like the molar technique.

816
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,790
Huh? Anybody else? Anybody else tried
to learn that shit on the drums? Uh,

817
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:14,320
underrated. Number two,
voting, uh, is underrated.

818
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,030
You know what I think protest is?

819
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,600
I think people need to learn on
a protest to get in this country.

820
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,120
I couldn't protest, man. If
I fucking went to a protest,

821
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:26,080
I would feel like I was on the set of a
movie about protesting because it seems

822
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:29,930
so cliched. You know what I mean?
Maybe they could get some new chance.

823
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,830
It's like everything
has to rhyme with four.

824
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,570
You have a nurse sat at a fucking
protest and it's always one, two, three,

825
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:41,300
four window.
I have fucking war,

826
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,850
or solid sells a fucking Oer,
but we're walking out the door.

827
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:50,450
Whatever it is, you give really
limited. You know what I mean?

828
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,290
It needs to be set that the
IAB protesting. It needs,
it needs to progress.

829
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:56,420
I'll tell you, it was fucked
up. I was just in Denver, right?

830
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,530
Had an awesome time up there at
the comedy works and they have,

831
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:04,880
the Democratic national convention is
coming to town and this is how much of a

832
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:08,000
fucking police state we suddenly
live in in this country.

833
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,590
They actually have a designated
area where people can protest.

834
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
It's 200 yards away from where people
are going to be speaking it going in.

835
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,410
So when you watch it on TV,
you're not going to see the protest as,

836
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:27,380
you're not going to see that there's
any sorta addressed. It's really,

837
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,180
it's really a bad, bad, bad thing. And
I know you have to protect these people,

838
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,610
the politicians and that type of stuff.

839
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:38,900
But if the people of this country
are unhappy, that should be shelled,

840
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,880
which is the danger of having seven
guys own all the fucking media in this

841
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:48,020
country. You know? Fuck a Rupert
Murdoch, even though it's my space.

842
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:54,170
Bloody Hell. Every con with a love
face. All right. Uh, number three.

843
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:57,380
This is my, this is a good one
too. Underrated phone, sex,

844
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,600
phone, sex cures aids.
Okay, you've heard it here.

845
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:07,310
First people out there,
people out there,

846
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,690
there are their labs and they're
shaking stuff up and fucking graduated

847
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:14,570
cylinders uptown with you.
Alright.

848
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,580
Phone sex is better than having sex
with a condom cause condoms suck.

849
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,580
Okay. But if you don't wear a
condom that Danielle like, Oh,

850
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,600
let me ask you this county
times you guys done that,

851
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,460
how many times have you made a mistake
and then gone and got yourself fucking

852
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:34,190
tested? You know what I
mean? He just sitting there.

853
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,850
That's what you always renew your
relationship with God when you're in the

854
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:42,620
waiting room for your yearly physical.
You know,

855
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,750
I did it like three times. I fucked up
while I was just like sitting in that way.

856
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,370
We're going, I swear to
God. I know I said it,

857
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,560
but I swear to God I will never do that
again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

858
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,120
Unfortunately, I have not had to
live through that. Hell and you,

859
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,030
but uh, that's what brings
it back to phone. Sex.

860
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:07,031
That's why I sky is fucking great
because there's no worry STD,

861
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:13,100
there's no problem with, you know, if you
just met the person be want, do you know,

862
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:16,370
if you're in a relationship, obviously
you want to be there with the person,

863
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,850
but like, you know, that awkward moment
after you hook up with somebody and,

864
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,350
and you just want them to fucking
leave and maybe even they want leave,

865
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,670
but it somehow has to be finessed.
There's no real FIDESSA. I see.

866
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:33,270
You have to finesse a little bit after
the phone sex. You got to kind of be like,

867
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:37,320
oh, this is what are you doing this
week? But you could make faces like, God,

868
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:39,870
I fucking hate with it. She can be
doing that because you're on the phone.

869
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,630
You know what I mean? I thought it was
funny. I actually, I had is actually bad,

870
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:47,820
actually hung up on someone
during that phone. Sex.

871
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,310
It's one of the meat things
they have a fucking did. Uh,

872
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:54,450
I was drunk and the
person's stuck at it and uh,

873
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:58,050
they were annoying me and
it was frustrating. And

874
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,530
you know,
like when you're sober and you think,

875
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,910
why don't you just do this and you like,
because it's really fucking mean.

876
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,080
But when you drunk, whoever that
person is is your head who says,

877
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:13,020
don't fucking do that.
Goes away. They take a nap.

878
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,470
I think that's the first thing that
passes out in your head when you drink is

879
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,470
that person that says,
don't fucking say that or don't do that.

880
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:24,470
So I was in the middle of it and I just
hung up on the person and then they

881
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:27,480
called back and I was like, ah, Shit.

882
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,430
Now if I was smart and I was sober,
first of all, I wasn't hung up on him.

883
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,760
And even if I did hang up on them,
I wouldn't answer the phone.

884
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,220
And then they would have
thought it was a dropped call.

885
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:42,510
But me being drunk like a fucking idiot,
I picked the phone up and I was like,

886
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,230
oh wow. And she was like,
did you hang up on me?

887
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,220
And I was trying to come up with a lie,
but I was just too drunk and I just went,

888
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,040
ah,
yeah,

889
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,490
I swear to God, you know, if
I don't make it to heaven,

890
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,040
it's got to because B could
be because of that moment.

891
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:05,720
That's one of the meters fucking things
I haven't did to somebody. And uh,

892
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,010
you know what,
I never apologize maybe how to do that.

893
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,330
It's like that fucking TV show or
that show called pay it forward.

894
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:18,690
My name is Earl. Yeah, that's it. I should
really, you know, she really try to Wa

895
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,430
they should really try to set that
straight. So a false sex. Yes.

896
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,840
It's definitely underrated. But you've
got to watch out though now because, uh,

897
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,600
the government can listen to your phone
calls because they're trying to get the

898
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:31,434
terrorists.

899
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,680
It's not because they're trying to put
more of a stranglehold on your fucking

900
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:36,840
freedoms. Oh, hey,
here's something for you.

901
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,040
Someone was telling me that they sort of
subtly part of a bill passed some shit

902
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:43,410
where when you cross state lines,

903
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:46,470
the cops can pull you over and take
your laptop and your cell phone,

904
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,420
no questions asked. You know what I
mean? What the fuck is that about?

905
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,270
And like always, I didn't even
research this. Someone just said it.

906
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:58,530
I took it as law and now putting it out
there and it really just sort of freaked

907
00:55:58,531 --> 00:55:59,131
me out.
You know what?

908
00:55:59,131 --> 00:56:04,131
I really think that we are heading
towards a very violent period in this

909
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:07,950
country's history.
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

910
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,550
You know they're building this
highway from Mexico to Canada,

911
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,060
which is not bullshit. That's actually
true. Mexico's going to own it.

912
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:17,670
I don't get what we're doing. I don't
like it. I'll tell you right now,

913
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,690
I don't fucking like it.

914
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,800
I'm going to get a Spanish villa and I'm
gonna lay out there and a little yellow

915
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:27,820
speedo getting a sunburn.
A bloody has.

916
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,920
Um, all right. I'm literally fucking,

917
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,810
I'm clammy right now.

918
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,310
That's got to be one of the most
disgusting words and the fucking English

919
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,310
language.
Clammy picture.

920
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,210
The one famous person you would
love to meet and hook up with.

921
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,930
Now picture them clammy. Then
that just wrote it for you. Huh?

922
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,610
All you ladies out there.
How about a clammy Brad Pitt?

923
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,580
Oh, that's disgusting. All right.

924
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,670
A couple more underrated overrated things.

925
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:08,110
Then I'll wrap this fucking thing
up here. Uh, what are we doing here?

926
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,800
I never got spinners on cars.
I never understood spinners on cars.

927
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,460
Especially minivans. Who the
fuck are they kidding? Yeah,

928
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:19,360
those spinners things were, uh,
those are in for a minute. Allegedly.

929
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:23,410
The first guy to have of the debut one
was Latrell. Sprewell. Is that true?

930
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:28,090
Because the first time I heard them,
they were called the trails. Uh,

931
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,760
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
did that memory come from?
Uh, one more thing. I never,

932
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,150
oh, biggest the hype. The segue.
Remember that fucking thing?

933
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:39,480
That's another great one.
The segway.

934
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:44,320
Remember that he just stand on it and
you can lean forward and it goes forward.

935
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Now they just have cops using them
in meter maids. I don't fucking know.

936
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,290
Is that who does it? I have no fucking
idea. All right. You know what?

937
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,820
I think what I said I was clammy. That
was the time to fucking hang up. So, um,

938
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,750
so there you go. There's your whole, uh,

939
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,840
is your whole fucking list there.
All right.

940
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,520
There's a bunch of underrated than
overrated. Thanks. I got it was,

941
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,070
I don't know why I got to do, I've got
to drink liquids. Who the fuck belt?

942
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,590
You know what I did try and get rid
of a fucking cold. Just how dumb I am.

943
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:18,310
I went on the fucking Internet, right? And
I always heard garlic was good for you.

944
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,810
So I go on the Internet and
I just go to like fucking,

945
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,200
you know what's up with
garlic.com or some bullshit?

946
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,150
This part,

947
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,130
like they got people on Youtube who eat
raw garlic trying to say that it helps

948
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:36,130
you. You can put it in peanut
butter. Fucking nasty. Right?

949
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,790
But I'm feeling so bad and I had three
shows Saturday night at the fucking

950
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,350
comedy works. I'm, I'm desperate.

951
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:47,010
So I actually got honey lemon
fucking tea or whatever it was.

952
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,800
I don't know what the fuck was.

953
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,380
I put honey in there and then
I put two raw garlic clothes.

954
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,320
Fucking just dice them up and
put them in there. And uh,

955
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,130
I don't think it helped me,
but I'll tell you,

956
00:59:02,131 --> 00:59:05,110
it definitely fucking distracted
me. But I guess, I don't know,

957
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:08,410
does anybody know about that shit?
Supposed to be if he had garlic, uh,

958
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,150
we fucking do you want to talk about
fucking overrated or underrated?

959
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:15,220
It's gotta be gone.
Like you go to their goddamn website,

960
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:19,450
they got a cure and everything from
fucking the cold to AFC cancer, you know,

961
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,730
they said back in the day, if you had a
warrant, people used to rub garlic on it.

962
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,660
And I'm like, really? I'm thinking,
Oh shit, maybe that does work.

963
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:30,410
And then I'm thinking,
or maybe they didn't have compound w,

964
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,420
you know what I mean? So they had
to fucking put food. You know,

965
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:38,360
you had an appendicitis, you put fucking
chips Ahoy, you're on your stomach.

966
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,380
That doesn't make any sense but does it,
I'm going to that conspiracy to that,

967
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:45,680
these fucking drugs of bullshit and that
we should have listened to the native

968
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,850
Americans more. Let it be
great if you went to doctor
then got in, slice, you open.

969
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:51,950
He just fucking dressed up like that.

970
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:54,740
Eyes Wide Shut party in the end of the
movie and just sort of danced around a

971
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:59,660
little bit and through some Bays Alanya
how much you need that visit would cost,

972
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:03,500
right? Would need fucking
nationwide healthcare with that.

973
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,290
All you'd need was a balcony
and a little bit of sunlight.

974
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:13,110
That's the gas thing I've ever
seen. All right, that's it. Um,

975
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,880
I got to update my website here.
Uh, my next show is, is in Miami.

976
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,710
It's in, uh, which is in Florida. I'm
not going to be at the Improv now.

977
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:24,200
Allegedly white comedians
don't do well down there.

978
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,240
That's what I was told the last time.

979
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:31,010
White comics do not do well
down there because uh, you know,

980
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,450
they just go to see Latino people cause
there's a bunch of Cubans down there and

981
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:40,010
uh, so if you're Cuban, give
this white guy a chance and uh,

982
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,970
if you've got a white friend,

983
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,550
why don't you bring them out to
sort of balance out the crowd?

984
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,390
I'll just bring one so I got a familiar
face in the crowd, you know what I mean?

985
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:53,090
Cause the only thing I know about Cuba
fucking scar face, that's it. I know that.

986
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:56,210
I know they fucking got great cigars.
Wait, am I know some shit about Cuba.

987
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:01,340
They all drive around in cars
from the 1950s because of, uh,

988
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,570
our economic sanctions or what they'd
say is because communism doesn't fucking

989
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:09,140
work. Um, you know what?

990
01:01:09,141 --> 01:01:13,490
None of it fucking works because people
can't handle power, myself included.

991
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:15,890
You have a nurse that shit.
Take the average night's fucking dude.

992
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:19,640
You make them a bouncer.
He's instantly a fucking asshole.

993
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,820
And it just has to do with,
it has to do with that shit.

994
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:26,600
So I don't give a fuck anyway.
Fuck I'm talking about right now.

995
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,950
And I go from Cuba talking about bouncing.
Oh Shit.

996
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:32,330
The headache went away walking around.

997
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:37,331
Now I'm roast in hand and it I,

998
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:45,190
if this podcast blame it on fucking
Tylenol pm Theraflu airborne and too raw

999
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:52,400
