1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,470
Hey, what's going on? Spill bird.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,670
It's time for the Monday
morning podcasts from Monday,

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:09,570
April 23rd,
2018 what's going on?

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:12,190
How are you?
How's it going?

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,480
I'm actually recording
this on fucking Wednesday.

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,630
April 25th case.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,460
You listening to this and the future
and you wanted to know what was going on

8
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:25,230
with me as far as my health goes. Now
notice I said, as far as my health goes,

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,000
instead of health wise,

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,870
I learned in vocab improvement
back in high school.

11
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,310
There's no such thing as the
wiseguys healthwise weather wise.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,720
You know, that's why I can never
listen to come fly with me. Why the,

13
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,980
why is it such a lovely day?
A frank, I know you connected,

14
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,950
but that's improper grammar.
All right?

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm not attacking you or your heritage
of the fact that you from New Jersey,

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,310
right? You overly sensitive so-and-so,
um, of just saying that, that's, you know,

17
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:59,010
I don't know who wrote that song.
Okay.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,600
So why don't you Scooby Doo
da that, that, that blew over.

19
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:07,050
Do a fucking dictionary and you,
you find me wise Francis.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,420
Um, am I really trashing a dead fucking
Frank Sinatra? Sorry, I'm, I'm a, I'm,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,170
I'm almost lied and tried to tell
you I'm going call medication,

22
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,400
but I don't take cold medication.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,380
Cold medication is for
fucking millennials.

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,670
All right. And even if you're older and
you take it, you're a millennial at heart,

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,200
he can't deal with the fact that you
got yourself sick. You need to lay down,

26
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:34,980
get eight hours and let your body
fucking go through it. All right?

27
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,670
The reason why your nose is running this
cause it's trying to get the virus, it

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,750
just led an APP. He's fucking
assholes. I swear to God, man.

29
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,500
The amount of people that gave me advice,
you know,

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,980
there's no cure for the common cold, but
everybody thinks they have one. You know,

31
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,520
I'd sink. I'd go ted twice.
And Zinc shot a whiskey.

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,200
Dube I manager told me, he goes,
vitamin D, everybody thinks it's,

33
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:05,320
see vitamin D unbelievable.
Well,

34
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:08,490
the greatest managers in the world, and
he also knows the cure for a cold. I mean,

35
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,360
who knew that? Just
fucking we could Dave. Um,

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,280
let's get that out on the way.
Jesus Christ.

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,050
This is just the cold that won't quit.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,280
This is the cold that's letting me
know that mother nature is regrouping.

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,020
You know,
right now we're squeezing her all right.

40
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,070
Like the way Andre,

41
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:36,970
the giant was squeezed in fucking Hulk
Hogan in that documentary and they lifted

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,340
mother nature's arm and they're dropping
it down and they lifted up to dropping

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,750
it down. And I'm like, oh my God,
the bad guys are going to win.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,070
And I went point or I'm just going to
stay there and she's going to start

45
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:51,060
shaking a fucking blonde hair.
That was always my favorite part.

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,840
When oak would start coming back and
he'd give him that one big head and then

47
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,440
he'd walk around the ring looking up and
they look it up at the rafters to his

48
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:03,850
head. Uh, that was the best. I watched
that documentary like three times.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,910
And when, uh, when, um, I watched that,

50
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,500
that part of the fight with NEA,

51
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,500
we were both laughing our asses
off in a great way, like day,

52
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,510
just some of the greatest fucking
performers of all time and professional

53
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,700
wrestlers.
You know,

54
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,280
when I was growing up right through
the rock and all those guys,

55
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,610
like their ability,
stone cold, all of them,

56
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,960
their ability to work a crowd is just,

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,570
it's second to none.
You know,

58
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,990
I got a buddy might still
going like, dude, the Yampa
isn't it like a fake fight,

59
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,070
you know is but isn't it like
a fake fight? It's just like I,

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,040
how fucking dumb are you?
It's like,

61
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,140
yes,
it's entertainment.

62
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,310
They take fucking set at like
30 years ago at some guy cried.

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,080
All right.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,800
And the greatest thing they ever did was
say that it was all arranged and all of

65
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,390
that shit for the most part.

66
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,330
So then they could actually talk about
how fucking heart they got when they

67
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,970
actually would do in these fake fights.
I had to tell Burnsy that like fuzzy,

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,140
if you knew,
okay,

69
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:20,380
we had a fake fight and I said I was
going to pick you up and throw you across

70
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:24,070
the room and you're going to
land on your back, you know,

71
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,040
that would still hurt even though,
you know,

72
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,970
we arranged that I was going to happen.
Right. Physics is still in play there. No,

73
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,471
sorry,

74
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm a little hot here with this fucking
Mike's and I was having a problem with

75
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,400
my recorder here. Oh God.
Um, so believe it or not,

76
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm actually on the
other side of this thing.

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,890
I completely lost my voice by uh,

78
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,640
by Sunday and uh,

79
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,160
so I started gargling with a little bit
of a apple cider vinegar and some salt

80
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:58,050
in there and that kind of
cleared me up a little bit. Um,

81
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,800
I'll do that shit but I'm not going down
to the fucking drug store even though I

82
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,520
did and I bought all this shit and I
just looked at the ingredients. I'm like,

83
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:08,830
I'm not putting this in my fucking body.
So basically what?

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,900
I kicked the shit out of my fucking liver
so this medicine can fool my fucking

85
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,030
or knows that I don't have a cold.
I apologize to file stuff Ian.

86
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:22,090
But I got to do this cause I'm going to
be fucking backed up on podcasts cause I

87
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,060
got the Thursday one tomorrow.
I'm liking that.

88
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:27,460
I love Lucy sketch where they
got the chocolates coming down,

89
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:31,300
except it's podcasting. I mean, Christ,
I don't have time for this shit.

90
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,660
Guess what the fuck I watched
yesterday on the plane coming back,

91
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,030
actually went up to Boston and I
visited with my family back east and I'm

92
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,210
on a two by the way,

93
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:50,170
the fucking anger that is
still in Massachusetts.

94
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,550
It's not really what the younger kids,

95
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,180
which kind of makes me happy
and a little bit sad. You know,

96
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,890
some point you do have
to let go of the anger,

97
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:00,000
but hope I help all the
characters are still around.

98
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,760
But I was driving through my,
uh,

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,580
my old neighborhood and I this cop direct
and traffic and a little fucking three

100
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,280
way stop and he tells this guy
to stop and evidently he didn't.

101
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,790
And the cop starts flipping
out and I'm like, fucking two,

102
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,640
three cars down the line. So I,
I can't hear what the guy saying,

103
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,570
but he is fucking flailing his
arms like Earl weaver, right?

104
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,850
He manages the Orioles above
fucking 40 years ago. Sorry. Um,

105
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,113
yeah.

106
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,660
And I'm laughing my balls off. How
fucking angry is it? The Sky. Right.

107
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,070
And then when he gets the guy to stop
and then the other key waves us to start

108
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,660
going,
like that's not enough for him.

109
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,390
He walks up to the guy's car
and starts screaming at him.

110
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:45,540
So I'm thinking maybe this is some young
punk with his radio turned up and he's

111
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,610
not listening to the cop.
I show up,

112
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:52,000
it's like some old dude with like white
hair and this fucking eight foot cop is

113
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,010
screaming at a

114
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,943
Ah,

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,500
I dunno how you'd do it. I would
not, I would not have handled that.

116
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:02,670
Well if he came up to my window,

117
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:06,840
there's no way I would've been like relax
and then I would have been, you know,

118
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,733
in cuffs.

119
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,660
Cause she can't tell a guy who's flipping
out and screaming at you to fucking

120
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:13,111
relax.

121
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:17,550
I need to learn my rights for those
moments because I am a control freak and I

122
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:18,061
forget that.

123
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:22,650
I don't know how to fight in those moments
and I just immediately go to go fuck

124
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,610
yourself.
And then,

125
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:28,100
and then the ramification cups
that I am not prepared for.

126
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,483
MMM.

127
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,820
I actually got angry for that guy.

128
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,080
Okay.

129
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,830
And started, drove past the cops saying
all this shit to the cop in my car,

130
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:41,760
to myself as if I was that guy
talking to that cop of fucking nuts.

131
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:46,170
Is that or is that normal? Is that
something you do? I just feel like for me,

132
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,370
Jesus Christ,
um,

133
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,130
I haven't been this sick
since I'd been a dad.

134
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,740
She was fucking brutal to get this sick
when you're a dad because then you can't

135
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,710
hug a kid.
Uh,

136
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,430
which is the worst. I mean, that's what
you have a kid for seeking hog up, right.

137
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,020
In lie about what you did when you were
a kid. Right? That's what you did. Wow.

138
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,810
I used to make my bed every day.
I did all my homework.

139
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,040
I was never a problem for my parents.

140
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,540
Okay.

141
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,920
Um, anyways, I, uh, I
had a fucking amazing we,

142
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,270
so I got to work the Ryman once again.

143
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,350
It's the third time I've been
there. I did Vince violence, uh,

144
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,490
Nashville Comedy Festival in 2014 then
I did it again in 2016 I take my last

145
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,850
special there, walk your way
out, and then I got to do it. Uh,

146
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,500
one show Friday lunch,

147
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:48,830
so Saturday and they brought me a drum
kit and shit to play on and I was so sick

148
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,680
I couldn't play. It felt bad. And um,

149
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,060
I had a splitting fucking headache,
but the shows were really fun.

150
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,670
And I actually a, I always hit that
Jack's barbecue next door and then,

151
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:06,230
uh, I went to the Woolworth,
they've got a Woolworths sales,

152
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,820
like you owe the fucking lunch counter
like where they had like back in the day

153
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:14,620
during segregation where they just like
only white people can sit here and get a

154
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:19,060
grilled cheese sandwich.
God made everybody in his image.

155
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:23,320
Buddy made us closer to his image and
he loves his chest a little bit better

156
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:24,154
because of that.

157
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,190
We get to see it at this shine
and counter that RSD you on.

158
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:33,070
Why, why, and why fucking play
evil guy to go around bag.

159
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,180
Uh, so I sat down, I got a
fucking cheeseburger. They're,

160
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,260
you know, taking pictures.
Just, I went into Woolworth's,
like a white person going,

161
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,680
oh my God, I remember these things. You
know, he used to be able to buy from,

162
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,270
can assure it.
And then get a cheeseburger.

163
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,270
So I walked in not realizing
the historical, um,

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,360
magnitude or what I was walking
into. I was just walking, okay,

165
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,490
you guys tell self sharps hair,
nobody.

166
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,600
We doubt we don't.

167
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,200
And I walked right up
to the fucking count.

168
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,530
I was taking pictures and shit and
everybody thought I was like some fucking

169
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:06,680
historian and I was,

170
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I was as excited that had the same
emotional historical context to me is if I

171
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:17,290
walked into a Jordan Marsh,
did they have Jordan Marsh as anymore?

172
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,460
Do you remember all those?
All those defunct superstores

173
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,720
it's funny,

174
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,990
they were evil when they came up cause
they put out the mom and pop businesses

175
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:29,410
and then eventually when you watch
them get eaten, you love you.

176
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,750
You ended up feeling bad for them.

177
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,730
Places like mammoth Martin,

178
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,740
you remember mammoth mart and a big woolly
mammoth child world got destroyed by

179
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:45,440
fucking toys r us leach mayor.

180
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,330
They lost out to the fucking best buys
radio shack to still a few of them left

181
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,510
over. You know what I mean? They're like,

182
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:56,630
fucking old Nazis is still,

183
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:00,410
a couple of them are running around
scurrying around South America.

184
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:04,340
You know what I mean? Trying to get a
fucking tangent fit in with the regulars.

185
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,203
Right.

186
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,830
Well some of the other ones
that they used to have,

187
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,270
I can't even remember
anyone so long goes filings,

188
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,810
Jordan Marsh than Macy's just came along.

189
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,970
It just fucked him all up.
Just fucked him all up.

190
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,460
Okay.

191
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,560
Bloomingdale's beat the
fuck out of everybody.

192
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,480
And then you had all those like storage
she just heard about. But you know,

193
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,130
like Saks fifth avenue
when I was a little kid, I,

194
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,790
they might've been one in Boston,

195
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,960
but I think if you wanted to go to Saks
fifth avenue had to go to fifth avenue.

196
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,063
Yeah.

197
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,110
In New York City.
And nobody really fucking knew all of the,

198
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:49,920
all of that, all of that
designer shit that, um,

199
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,100
all the kids were nowadays like,
and I was like mobile, Alabama.

200
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,690
They had like a fucking, uh, Louis Vitton
store. They never used to have that shit.

201
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,700
You know what I mean?
They only had three series of the BMW,

202
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,130
the three, the five and the
seven till they also had the sex.

203
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,290
If you could afford one of those,
go fuck yourself.

204
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,710
Okay.

205
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,650
They didn't make it fucking SUV. I
didn't think. I don't think they did.

206
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,260
They didn't have a one series, a
to series of four series, you know,

207
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,720
just fucking doing anything they can.

208
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:28,250
That's like wouldn't miss Mercedes
Benz drop their co? Not that quality,

209
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:31,010
but they dropped it all the way
down where you could buy the uh,

210
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,330
was it the one 90? He the baby
Benz, they used to call it.

211
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,040
All of sudden you drive around in
Mercedes Benz that cost the same amount of

212
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,890
money as a Monte Carlo.
Right. And you were,

213
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:47,690
there's a Monte Carlo fucking t
top pot dealing Douche, you know,

214
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,780
who would it looked right
in his Oldsmobile cutlass.

215
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,340
But instead you'd ride around this one
90. He like, you're fucking sophisticated.

216
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,210
Everybody saw right through
your Keno second he got out
of the fucking car. Right

217
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,830
though your personal belongings fall
on the fucking ground, you know,

218
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,720
some scale to weigh your product.

219
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,240
Okay.

220
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,340
I know what I'm talking about,
but when I was a kid,

221
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,410
all the cool older guys to guys who
were like 25 which to me was a man.

222
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:19,380
You had a mustache,
you had your own place.

223
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,570
Okay.

224
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,930
It check was living with you and you
can fuck her whenever you wanted.

225
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,970
You know my id is a 14 year old
dude. He lives with her. They can,

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,150
he can fuck her whenever
he wants to not realize it.

227
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,180
Not realizing like the fucking
that he was probably looking at me,

228
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,240
envious of me.
Go look at that fucking orange headed,

229
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,870
hairless faced fucking loser over there.

230
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:48,380
He's got it all ahead of does
it have any credit card bills?

231
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,520
It doesn't have some broad living with it.

232
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:55,280
A bitch moaning and complaining about
where he leaves his fucking neon green

233
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:58,740
fucking sunglasses. Anyways.
But when I was looking at him,

234
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:02,030
they were the coolest people ever. And
then there was, there was the Buick Regal,

235
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,540
the Monte Carlo and
the Oldsmobile cutlass,

236
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:10,070
and they would get these two door coops.
And if you got the fucking t top,

237
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,450
you know, I loved, I loved the guy
that went down to the fucking art,

238
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,900
whatever the whatever auto parts store.

239
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:16,650
Okay,

240
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,780
got the auto zone's eight all up.
If you go down there.

241
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:24,480
And I remember people would get their,
uh, they put curb finders on them,

242
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,230
they'd cut tee tops at them.
They get the glass tinted,

243
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:31,960
the fucking headlights
and all these cheesy shit.

244
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,480
They'd get a custom license plate
on the front, said like Mikey,

245
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,943
you know,

246
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,980
and then you are the fucking mad
if you actually get a CD player.

247
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,990
And Emma, that was a big thing like you
gotta like it was an external thing.

248
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,070
I remember this, I knew it. He had
a fucking Volkswagen shall Rocco,

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,610
which looks cute. I swear to God
that was the name of the car. Um,

250
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,410
and he had this fucking
CD player and it was like,

251
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,180
it was like an external hard drives.

252
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:09,181
Like you had to plug this cord in that
Ben plugged into the CD that was mounted

253
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,190
on the armrests between
the two bucket seats.

254
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,150
And if you even hiccuped in the car,
the CD skipped,

255
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:17,660
but it was still fucking is Sayed.

256
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,960
And then of course she had to have your
radar detector for the fucking state he

257
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:27,730
stowed. And all of that is God. You
know it back then. If you got a cold,

258
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:30,880
you put a little Vick's vapor rub on
your fucking chest. And that was it.

259
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,830
Now what did they cut? Uh, Jesus
Christ. At least they could fucking,

260
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,660
they can hold off the HIV virus.
Now you'd think that they could fucking,

261
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,970
you know,
do something about the call.

262
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:46,510
But you always pay a price is always a
price to pay. You know, he's always pay,

263
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:50,230
you know, the battered fucking wife
of your organs is your fucking liver.

264
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,350
And liver always takes it.
You know what I mean?

265
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,070
You fuck up in other areas and
then you take your medicine, right?

266
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,990
You're scatterbrain alluded tank can't
get to sleep. See, take some Tylenol.

267
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:05,620
PM and who pays for it?
Huh? You're fucking liver.

268
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,573
Um,

269
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,450
how many times are you going to have
your liver have to walk around with his

270
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:17,170
eyes looking down at your fucking
colon, you know, as the other fucking

271
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,640
organs are going, what happened?
I walked into the ribs.

272
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,300
Is he making light of domestic violence?
Yes,

273
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,130
I am. Um, I think that's the
problem with this country.

274
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,320
There needs to be more domestic violence.

275
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,310
We actually live in an era that someone
wouldn't even look at that even remotely

276
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:43,330
is fucking absurd.

277
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,070
And in an era where in fucking,
I can't say the word anymore,

278
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,740
okay.

279
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,510
People unlike the, uh, the Internet,

280
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:56,760
we'll just take that clip and
they try to get you in trouble.

281
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,820
You know what I mean? Everybody's rat
and everybody out. Like, you know,

282
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:05,030
I really looked at that fucking
Conor McGregor thing, who's that guy?

283
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,440
Videotape and at four.

284
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,130
Yeah.

285
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,610
And then he fucking puts it up on the
fucking Internet and just get sis guy and

286
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,850
all this fucking trouble. I'm not saying
Conor McGregor was right, but like,

287
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,940
who's this fucking ass? I was there.
I would have videotaped that shit.

288
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,910
I would just be like, wow, glad
I wasn't on that bus. Right.

289
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,283
You know,

290
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,160
I mean,
that guy's a reason.

291
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:31,230
Everybody on that bus was making fucking
a zillion dollars anyways is any,

292
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,730
I can't every once in a while throw a
fucking two wheeler and a God damn by me

293
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,340
chief. He had the fucking champ, you know?

294
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,613
Okay.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,230
You'll get a little bit of leeway.

296
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,980
All it takes is one fucking Douche with
his flip phone and all of a sudden he's

297
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:52,760
down there talking to the,
I don't want to talking about,

298
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,890
guess what today is everybody.
Oh,

299
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:59,700
it's gained seven for the Boston Bruins.
Um,

300
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,000
everybody's freaking out and
all this shit. I'm like, God,

301
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,740
we have three games to one.
Who gives a fuck?

302
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:06,430
How are we going to do is win tonight?
Well,

303
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,730
you going to do is win tonight and no
one fucking remembers so many series than

304
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:13,640
a three to one go to game seven.
It happens all the fucking time.

305
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,653
MMM.

306
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,070
I will say though,
as a Bruins fan,

307
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,030
if I see or didn't have to listen to one
more commentator tell me that it was a

308
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,400
stretch pass.
Okay.

309
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,343
MMM.

310
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,720
You know, and Jesus Christ said,
Anderson is played so great for Toronto.

311
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,150
I don't know why he does all that,
flop it around.

312
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,410
You literally skate by that guy when
knocks him off his fucking feet.

313
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:40,620
Just shameless, shameless. But, uh,

314
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,680
I liked the fucking maple leafs,
you know what I mean?

315
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,850
Despite the timidly cocky fans on
Twitter who said absolutely nothing,

316
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:54,690
and now all of a sudden, you know, they're
like mere cats. You know what I mean?

317
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:58,800
What a fucking Cobra comes around and
they all sit there lunging at you and shit

318
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,480
talking all this shit as a backup.

319
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:03,120
If they're not really going to fight and
they try to appear bigger than they are.

320
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,500
Um, I got no beef. What's around you
guys went tonight. Congratulations.

321
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,740
I can get past it. I don't
give a fuck. Right. Um,

322
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,900
I know that we're a team of the future
and so you guys this still probably be

323
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,020
the beginning of a great rivalry.
That's what we need.

324
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,330
God knows because the Canadians
are in the fucking shit. Um,

325
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,770
I have his fucking guy that like,
I can't remember how fuck I met him.

326
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,830
So like a Gig a long time
ago and he drove his Sam,

327
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:32,220
somebody got my phone number this fucking
con to every year during the playoffs.

328
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,420
The brewers do so good.

329
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,910
One of those fucking
Douche is so I've finally,

330
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,890
I just finally blocked his number.
Like, I don't, I don't get,

331
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,900
I'll get this kid's like, I get it. You
fucking drove me to a couple of gigs.

332
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,130
I get to listen to your fucking horseshit
shit. Every time we're doing bad.

333
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,200
There's so many fucking country
sports fans like that. Um,

334
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,980
and after almost 20 years
of voting a cell phone,

335
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,010
I finally learned how to block people.
I love it.

336
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,550
It's fucking love it.
It's just like

337
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,170
if somebody I used to work
with to this business fucking,

338
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,520
I dunno what the fuck his deal was,

339
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:16,010
he fucking started calling
me and emailing me, you know,

340
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,550
block over.
You know what I mean?

341
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,390
It's like you get to assassinate somebody
without having to kill him and deal

342
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,670
with the guilt,
you know?

343
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,220
Okay.

344
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,970
I wonder if in the future when we're all
just being watched by robots and every

345
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,000
blessed thing you do is videotaped.
Uh,

346
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,160
so you can't do anything wrong.

347
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,940
I wonder if they'll have to switch
the commandments just so they can get

348
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,700
somebody in trouble because
nobody can do anything anymore.

349
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,380
So rather than thou shall not kill
the fifth commandment, we'll be,

350
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,530
thou shall not block
somebody on your cell phone.

351
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,710
You shall not assassinate them digitally.

352
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry,
did I just,

353
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,650
did I just float out a perfect
premise for the next blade runner?

354
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,500
Uh, no I didn't. I did not. However,

355
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,620
there was that movie that came out where
people had to take a test and if you

356
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,110
know, when the world was
overpopulated, those fucking cards,

357
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,900
where the hell did you get that idea?
God bless him. But you know what I mean?

358
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,960
How about a tip of the cap?
Uh,

359
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,830
anyways, sorry. People
have just at a fucking,

360
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,010
I just had a headache for so fucking long.

361
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,630
I did buy some bare aspart
I did that. Uh, Celtics.

362
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,430
Everybody.
How about those Boston Celtics.

363
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:36,500
How about the high or the Boston Celtics?

364
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:41,000
And how about those fucking Milwaukee
Bucks? This is the best day Ben,

365
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:44,480
since back with like Sidney Moncrief,
you know,

366
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:48,260
then they got that white dude from fucking
the Seattle Sonics with that fuck was

367
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:52,610
his name Jack Sigma.
Um,

368
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,050
but I have to be honest with you dude,
the basketball is so fucking awful.

369
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,140
Then I'm watching,
did I even playing hoop?

370
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:03,410
It looks like a fucking pickup game
and an unbelievably high level.

371
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,060
How many fucking times can you throw
up at three with nobody underneath?

372
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,123
Okay,

373
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,800
let me, I don't understand that
new little semicircle there.

374
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,420
I got to read up on it in the paint.

375
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:18,470
Is it illegal if you don't have the ball
as an offensive player to get under the

376
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:22,940
fucking rim was the last time you saw a
center post up and put his hand in the

377
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:27,110
air and do a couple up and under.
She got a little Kevin Mchale action.

378
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,130
Little Sky Hook.
It's all fucking God.

379
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,790
You just run down the court a little
pass and then the guy just takes a three

380
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,120
point.

381
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I had 10 go in or somebody does so
and one shit to try to get around.

382
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:44,090
A guy dropped a, it's
fucking, it's horrible.

383
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,540
I think a lot of the
entire second quarter,

384
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:51,260
I don't think I saw one pick and roll.
You know,

385
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,430
there's a reason that they did that for
fucking close to 80 years. It works.

386
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,280
I dunno why everybody's trying to
do this globe trotters shit data.

387
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,690
Uh, having said that, I love
where we're going in the future.

388
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:09,740
I just don't like the future of the game.
I guess people got too big.

389
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:12,000
Is that what it was?
Um,

390
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,030
I miss the bang and down low in the paint,
you know,

391
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,990
and then fucking old school yard play
with the guy's leaning against you leave

392
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:25,160
it and you stepped out behind him. Like
he pulled his chair out, he falls down.

393
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,830
Then they'd stand up and
get in each other's grills.

394
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,270
The little fucking ref came up to the
dicks. Who's trying to push them apart?

395
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:36,650
I miss all of that dumb ass shit,
man. I miss the way you smell.

396
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,330
Um, I actually got to be honest
with you. I shut the game off.

397
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,520
Okay.

398
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,630
Cause I was so fucking mad. Cause I
hate NBA hoop. I just hate basketball.

399
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,400
I just hate how no lead is safe.
It's like you're up by 40,

400
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,270
you go with the kitchen and then you make
a sandwich and it's like the audit team

401
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,950
follow the three pointer. This
could tie it up. It's just like,

402
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,630
can there ever be,
can you ever just have an easy win?

403
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,073
Um,

404
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,750
I just felt myself getting ready to throw
something at the fucking TV and I got

405
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,340
a kid now so I can't,
so I just shut it off and I was just,

406
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,880
and I just watched the score throughout
the fourth quarter. Then they wanted,

407
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,550
I was like good, uh, uh, more
of a hockey guy obviously. Um,

408
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,800
that, having said that, I,
you know, of course I have to,

409
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,440
I've got to edit some shift for
emphasis of family tonight. Um,

410
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,520
but I'll get to watch most of the game.
It's only a game seven,

411
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,220
you know, um, I'm very excited for this.

412
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,490
Got To love the game seven.

413
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,030
Even if your team was up three to one
who gives a fuck gotta love a game.

414
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:50,600
Seven and a, and here's the
deal is if we lose the Toronto,

415
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,660
that's my team for the rest of the
playoffs because they haven't won since 67

416
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,890
and uh,

417
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,560
I think it's high time that they get and
it'd be cool to see Winnipeg get their

418
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:01,610
first one. So those are my
two teams. Those are my onesy.

419
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,600
Twosy alright. Uh, so there you go.

420
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,620
Did she have fucking Bruins
is NBA and Nhl Hay fever.

421
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,720
Fucking talk for the God
damn week. Oh, you know what?

422
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,670
I forgot to fucking mentioned.
I started to mention it,

423
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,790
but maybe I'll mention it after I,
I do a little law.

424
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,100
I got one read for this week. All right,
bye. [inaudible] me on Ds me undies.

425
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:32,270
Get in the fucking paint
to do dooby ids me undies,

426
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,090
throw it down to is tanked.

427
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,020
Sped around and fucking dunk it.

428
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,370
Stop throwing up threes if you please.
It's fucking boring.

429
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:48,240
I feel like I'm at the fucking
YFCA except people can't dunk.

430
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,860
You've heard me talk about me undies
and you know that I'm a big believer in

431
00:25:55,401 --> 00:26:00,290
their product. They just sent me another
bag of underwear. These guys got to stop.

432
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,550
It's just like I don't have a
bladder problem. Okay, I get it.

433
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,490
You guys make a lot of underwear.
I have some and I like it.

434
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,490
You don't need to send me
some every fucking month.

435
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,620
Treat me like you fucking
underwear horror on the side. Uh,

436
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,230
there perfect balance of comfortable fit.

437
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,970
Every month they have new and exciting
prince and they arrive at your door in a

438
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:26,600
fun bag. Me Undies, uh,

439
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,170
uses lenses.
Micro Modal,

440
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,620
modal in their underwear.
It's sustainably sourced.

441
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:37,430
Naturally soft fiber that starts with
beechwood trees and ends with the most.

442
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,350
Imagine amazing fabric
you've ever experienced.

443
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:44,220
I don't know why that is in the
fucking copy, at least in my copy.

444
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,040
My listeners are not smart.
I'm not smart.

445
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,500
When you start saying that your
underwear is made out of trees,

446
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:54,210
we start thinking about kittens. Split
us in our under carriage. You know,

447
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,360
Joe, do you hear about fucking Fitzy
can't have kids is fucking underwear.

448
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:03,380
It was being out of beechwood trees.
He fucking took them off too fast.

449
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:04,990
He stabbed both his balls.
He's got older,

450
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,080
he's gotten to much is left well
because it ran down his leg. Kid.

451
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:10,670
You elicited a fucking story.

452
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,080
The results have been downright dreamy
beyond these adventurous prints and

453

editions. Yeah, it just, I,

of the rap. You know, who knows?

469
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,270
All right,

470
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,880
so I've tasted twice.
Let me see.

471
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,520
Liverpool football share. Joel,

472
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,450
what do they play next?

473
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:28,451
I was on the plane and I actually watched
level Liverpool versus fucking Roma.

474
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,830
Eh? It was a shock. It was a
blowout. It was an awesome game.

475
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,820
Liverpool went up five to fucking nothing.

476
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,980
Saturday 4:30 AM

477
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't I? I just, I just don't
fucking get how this shit works.

478
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,480
They play in Roma.
Isn't that like Rome?

479
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,370
Yeah,

480
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,010
that's the Champions
League. Semifinal leg.

481
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:02,880
Two of two.

482
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,160
Okay.

483
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,490
Aggregate two to five.
Yeah, they won five to two.

484
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,220
Okay,

485
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,110
so they're going to play again on May
2nd is that because they scored five

486
00:29:14,111 --> 00:29:17,800
goals? Enrollments coma score too.
What's the coincidence of that?

487
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,530
I just don't understand it because
they were up five to nothing.

488
00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:25,150
And then all of a sudden Roma Roma scored
a goal and then they scored another

489
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:27,250
one on a penalty kick and
then they would say it.

490
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:28,900
Then the dancers are going nuts.

491
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,260
Okay.

492
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,140
Like what are they?
And it's like fucking two minutes left.

493
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:33,760
Why they flipping out like
they going to lose this case.

494
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,840
I think there were some sort of tournament
that happens at the same time that

495
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:39,580
the premiere ship is being played.

496
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,493
It's weird,

497
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,850
but that's the Champions League
and I think Liverpool, Chelsea,

498
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:52,590
that's the Premiere Premiere League,
right? They do it at the same,

499
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:56,820
somebody from the love of God,
somebody over there in Great Britain,

500
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:59,340
somewhere around the fucker world
explained to me what's going on.

501
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:02,470
Cause I actually really enjoyed,
um,

502
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,740
the fucking game to this guy. Holy Shit.
This Egyptian dude who kind of look,

503
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,370
he looks like an Egyptian Judd Apatow.
Most Salah,

504
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,400
this fucking guy put on a goddamn clinic.
First of all,

505
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:21,060
he used to play for Roma. So he scores
a goal and he does his big dramatic.

506
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,610
I'm not going to celebrate,
you know,

507
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,410
which was more annoying than if he just
celebrated cassette. He scored again.

508
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,890
The first one
was like a fight.

509
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:36,891
It was like a lot of it's like hockey
but fucking top shelf quarter on the far

510
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:41,070
side,
I believe with his left foot.

511
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,810
And then a few minutes later whenever
he comes back down again and he just,

512
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:49,341
and that wasn't,

513
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:52,110
that was the first one was a fucking
blast and the next one's nice,

514
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:54,150
soft touch right up and
over the fucking guy.

515
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,070
The goalkeeper I believe for a second
goal. Once again, he starts praying,

516
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:02,130
getting on his knees and fucking kissing
the ground and doing all this shit.

517
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,070
Like he's not going to have a
threesome after the fucking game,

518
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,130
you know what I mean? Like he's going to
go fucking rescue a cat out of a tree.

519
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,750
So I like to take your junk out and shake
it and the other teams face, you know,

520
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:16,420
you want to, and then he
set up, he had two assists,

521
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,580
whatever they call the helpers,
uh, to fucking crumpets.

522
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,740
I don't know what the fuck they call you.
Guy had like four points.

523
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,540
If he was playing hockey, two
goals to assist. It was incredible.

524
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,340
Then there was this other poor pass
and I think he finally scored a goal.

525
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,150
He had a breakaway, fucked that
up that he was in one in hockey,

526
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:36,270
what would be called the slot.
And he just fucking miss kicked it,

527
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,040
blasted it over the fuck.
And that,

528
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,600
I think he spent more time on his
fucking Mohawk than he did on his fucking

529
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,140
learning how to shoot the ball
into the Goddamn net. But, uh,

530
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:47,310
there was seven goals.

531
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,370
It was like the kind of fucking soccer
game that a yank could enjoy it. But, uh,

532
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:55,170
I was stuck on a plane and we had a
ridiculous headwind and I was like,

533
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm going to sit here and watch this
fucking thing. And I totally got into it.

534
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,510
By the way, Liverpool's
fucking, uh, coach.

535
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,360
His dentist should be fucking disbarred.

536
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,640
He should have his licensed
fucking revoked. You know,

537
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,440
I'm sure it was the coach's idea.

538
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:17,550
But if you've got to fucking go tan and
you don't get your fake teeth whitened

539
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,760
to that level,
Jesus Christ,

540
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:24,300
he looked like the plant in little shop
of horrors except he had glasses on.

541
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,653
Uh,

542
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,590
so anyways, I was really
into it, so I guess I get it.

543
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,490
Why is it so much time between games
though? Oh No. The next one is April 28th.

544
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,930
That's it. I'm going to watch. Fuck
it. I'm going to support Liverpool.

545
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,200
I liked the Beatles. Who gives a fuck,
right? Like I got time for this shit.

546
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
There's no way to watch it and not all
of a sudden want to have a fucking beer

547
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:53,160
though. I will tell you that. You
know, and I've been fucking Billy.

548
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:56,670
No Fun Billy. No vice other
than four hits a weed one night,

549
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,750
which I immediately regret it cause all
it does is make me sleepy and not trying

550
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:03,000
to become one with the world.
I don't get munchies.

551
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,960
I just fall asleep like a
cat on a fucking window sill.

552
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:10,740
I don't give a fuck where I am.
I'm going to sleep. Yep. Um,

553
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,190
anyways, let's get on with the questions
here. I still have to watch that moto GP.

554
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:20,090
I know that mark mark has one.
It uh,

555
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,780
when there was a big anticipation
that him and a Valentino Rossi,

556
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:29,460
we're going to be fucking donkey kicking
each other about fucking 200 kilometers.

557
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,800
Uh, but he just fucking blew by
everybody by the second turn. Um,

558
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,500
I don't know. I got to watch it though.
I fucking love that sport though. Okay.

559
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,970
Emails for the week. I might have to,
to a little short, uh, podcast here.

560
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:47,780
Everybody looked fucking voices bugging
the shit out of me. All right, Belgium.

561
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,091
Hey Bill,

562
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:54,980
would you consider to come back to
Belgium in 2019 please keep us posted.

563
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,470
Uh, absolutely I would. I was only
there for like 24 hours and I loved it.

564
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,650
I was an ant Twerp I believe.
Excuse me.

565
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,410
Yeah. Gross. Disgusting. Sorry.

566
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,690
It has to be done.
It has to be done.

567
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,510
Yeah,
got a blow it out.

568
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,750
I should have do a kid show sketch
about having a cold. You know,

569
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,180
you just have some up,
but that's always fucking sick.

570
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,460
And then the kids can't fucking sell
touched the thing cause it's sick.

571
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:34,010
And then you make the firm up at
act all sad cause it's lonely.

572
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:36,260
And then when the kids come over
because they feel bad for it,

573
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,530
he chastised the hell out of them for
giving into the weak emotion of love.

574
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,510
And you see a yes, set them up for
the real world. Uh, fish start a pack.

575
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,470
You know what? I downloaded one of those
cds here. Harmonies are amazing. Uh,

576
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:53,870
the music,
it doesn't quite grab me.

577
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,660
They're incredible fucking musician,
but they just stayed. There's a,

578
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,050
I dunno, there's something I want
to keep listening. All right,

579
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,860
you're talking about fucking bad.

580
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:11,060
That's sold out Madison Square Garden
like 18 nights in a row or something.

581
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:14,270
So it's, it's gotta be me on
some level. You know what I mean?

582
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,643
Okay.

583
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,490
I look at fish, the way I look at Beyonce,
like it's, it's gotta be me. Right?

584
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,480
I have to be the person that's when
somebody fills up the fucking Rosewell.

585
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,580
You know what I mean?

586
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,790
The second they say they're going
to be there and you're like, yeah,

587
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:35,020
I don't get it there. Then it's
some point. It's you issue, right?

588
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,280
I Dunno.
Is Billy Bright breathes breaths.

589
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,950
I always say when I appreciate,

590
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:47,370
while I appreciated the last fish suggests
fish suggested of starting with rift.

591
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,050
It's a very specific album.
Pretty Ballsy,

592
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,430
but that guy who started you with rift,

593
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,300
it's as if he wants to make
it hard on you. Oh, okay.

594
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,070
I like this guy. I liked the other
guy too. They thought I was smart.

595
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:05,840
I liked this guy because he
knows I'm stupid. All right.
Yeah. Make it easy. Read.

596
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,200
Give me the answers.

597
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,640
You should download hoist.

598
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,743
Is that how you say that?

599
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,380
As the last guy suggested
alive one that'll give you
something fun to work with.

600
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,130
Again, I love riffs, but I also
want you to have a fair shot. Also,

601
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:31,131
story of ghosts is funky and
Billy Billy breaths is fun too.

602
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,360
Who Was it? Billy breathes. I'm so dumb,

603
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,790
and not to sound cliche,
but have you seen dead and company yet?

604
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,470
It's a really fun show and
definitely worth checking out, man.

605
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,510
Yeah.
Um,

606
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,310
yeah,

607
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,180
those hippy shows to, it's
just such a vibe of, of uh,

608
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,600
insincerity,
Adam that I can't handle from the crowd

609
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,130
where everybody's just trying to like,
I dunno,

610
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,360
you don't think when you see a mom and
she's talking to a kid in public and

611
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:12,500
talking really loudly, some cute
conversation and looking at you smiling,

612
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,910
it's like, will you shut the fuck up?
You bring the volume down. I get it.

613
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:19,700
Kids are cute. It's not my kid. You know,

614
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,350
I don't care if the kid
just countered the five.

615
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,810
No, no. Busy.

616
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:31,710
You have to sit there and you need to
put teacher in here First Ota and then

617
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:32,910
they look at you and smile

618
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,430
is they do the play by play of the kid
putting a fucking marshmallow in its

619
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,264
mouth.

620
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,870
I feel like when you go to one of those
hippie things that people are doing that,

621
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,860
but they're kind of doing it, you know,
to show like how everybody's, you know,

622
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:49,770
this is like how society should be man.

623
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,880
Oh, in the fucking, the body
odor. I don't mean like,

624
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,900
I mean the Cologne that they wear,
whatever the fuck it is, just the, uh,

625
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,270
the, the, the fucking Douche Gumbo.
That's what I can't handle when I'm there.

626
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,650
It's always fucking hot, you
know? And everybody's wearing
a sun dress. It's just,

627
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:15,510
I dunno, I'm too much of a curmudgeon.
Why? I think we bombed Syria.

628
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,680
Oh, good for you. Help me
out here. Or bill ball bag.

629
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,571
Uh,

630
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:26,490
I believe we blew their chemical weapon
plants up because they gassed little

631
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:29,550
kids.
Okay.

632
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,270
Jess,
a guess of what I read.

633
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:37,130
I think you overly simplified and
I think some kids also died. Um,

634
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,110
but if we're going to
start doing that body,

635
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,330
if we're going to start bombing people
because they gas people are bond people

636
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:49,250
and killed little kids, uh, for everybody
who does that as a piece of shit.

637
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,680
I don't know how well we come
out in the wash, their pal,

638
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,310
a chest to cast for what I've read.
But you're not allowed to say that.

639
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:58,640
Cause if you do, that means
you're an isis. You not
allowed to criticize anything.

640
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:01,400
It'd be like, what the
fuck are we doing? Uh,

641
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:03,440
but I do understand your fear of debt.

642
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,820
Love the cast and your work
as unimportant as it may seem.

643
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:11,330
We couldn't live without laughing piece.
Okay man,

644
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,590
you get your sun dress
on there. Um, yeah, okay.

645
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:19,310
I understand that Syria, okay. What they
did was horrifically wrong, but you know,

646
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,580
should we have a lot more of our ducks
in a row before we start policing the

647
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:26,710
fucking world is all I'm saying.
You know what I mean?

648
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,700
If we're going to fucking bomb those guys,
cause they guessed a little kids,

649
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,990
that sounds good.
But you know,

650
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,560
at what point were they going to fucking
shoot some missiles at the people who

651
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:39,820
poisoned our food supply,

652
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,320
that food supply then that we're now
trying to sell around the world and people

653
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,710
like, you're not bringing that shit
in our country. Do you know this?

654
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:51,490
Say that about our food like France
and India. Francis like, all right,

655
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:55,510
but you're going to have to say what's in
it? And we're like, no, we're not. We are.

656
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:58,840
There's no way we're going to say what's
in our food. I'll fucked up as that.

657
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,050
And I got to try to navigate those
waters with my kid. You know,

658
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,930
and there's no explanation to
it. There's no, well, listen man,

659
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,320
if you want to somehow make
300 people not starve to death,

660
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,710
you got to cut some corners
that I understand it, but
there's, there's nothing,

661
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:19,310
they're not saying anything. They're
like, shut the fuck up and a and eat it.

662
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,830
Um,
you know,

663
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,330
I dunno the key in this world to make it,
you got to make so much money.

664
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:31,510
You can donate the politicians' campaigns
and then they just fucking leave you

665
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,370
alone.
And you can do whatever you want.

666
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,290
Like poisoned the food supply of a
country, which if I'm not mistaking,

667
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,910
is a terrorist act.

668
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,200
When you then become an evil
doer, uh, dude, I'm fat.

669
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,871
This is all shit.

670
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:51,680
And you're not allowed to see if
you can say it about anybody else.

671
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:56,180
But if you actually fucking
Kev constructive criticism
about your own team,

672
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,610
you're immediately a conspiracy theorists
or you're a socialist. You know,

673
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,340
I don't understand.
I don't know when the fuck that happened,

674
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:09,310
but it's brilliant PR. Um, so evidently
I'm a communist right now. Oh, Bill. Yeah,

675
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,330
he's got a red beard.
I mean it's all right there.

676
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,570
Probably jugs off to Stalin's
fucking head shot every morning.

677
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:20,540
How dairy want healthy food for everyone
in this country. Uh, Hay Bell, no fun.

678
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,250
Hey Billy. No Fun. Love the podcast. I'm
a fat guy. Totally agreeing with you.

679
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,320
Fat people blame everyone around them,

680
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,510
but I'm one that knows that I shouldn't
be shoving cheeseburgers down my gullet.

681
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,110
Yeah,
dude,

682
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,610
that's the power fucking
choice right there.

683
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,340
If you start blaming everybody else
and all this other shit outside,

684
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:45,820
he has to change as you keep
fucking Chauhan this shit the,

685
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:49,450
granted I don't have a psychology degree
or even know anything about nutrition

686
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,830
as I trash what's in our
food supply. Uh, you know,

687
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:59,290
you know Kenny Rogers, who was the gambler
from the hypocrite. Uh, anyone. Anyway,

688
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,250
my question is,

689
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:05,251
do you think it's worse to know that you
are ruining your life and eating like a

690
00:42:05,741 --> 00:42:10,741
fat fuck or pretending like it's
a thyroid problem or some excuse.

691
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,670
Anyways, please come to the bay
area. I am, I'm doing a whole week.

692
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:20,671
It shows in May up in San Francisco or
reno cause I miss you on the last one.

693
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,240
Uh,
all right.

694
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:26,170
Do you think it's worse to know that
you're ruining your life and eating like a

695
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:29,050
fat fuck or pretending like
it's a thyroid problem?

696
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,950
I think if you pretend like it's a
thyroid problem is a good way to go.

697
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:37,630
If your apps, if you had no
power in this situation, like,

698
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,650
um, a lot of the shit that I alluded
to, you know, like our food supply,

699
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,200
like I'm powerless against that.

700
00:42:44,201 --> 00:42:47,770
So it's something I will joke about
and then I quickly don't think about it

701
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:50,950
because I don't know what
to do. What, you know,

702
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:54,460
you go down to a farmer's market and
those kinds of infiltrated down there too,

703
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:57,640
when you start asking the fucking hippie
down their eggs, so this is blah, blah,

704
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,810
blah,
where did this come from?

705
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,470
And they start getting all fucking
shifty themselves and they then all of a

706
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:06,700
sudden you feel like you're an invasion
of the body snatchers, you know? So, um,

707
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,310
but I think the fact that
you're addressing that,

708
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:12,710
you're the ones shoving the
cheeseburgers down your gullet. Um,

709
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,490
okay.

710
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:19,320
I have found that, uh, you
know, the longest time I
didn't think food was a drug.

711
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,980
I totally believe it now.
And Dean del Ray put me on this,

712
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:27,981
I guess it's a gluten free diet and I'm
all this and I barely have to work out.

713
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:29,680
Okay.

714
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,420
You know, and uh, Kina Wa
is like this fucking like,

715
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,900
I eat the food that I eat on this diet
afterwards. I don't feel like, ah,

716
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,880
I gotta take a nap. I feel like energized
even though I feel like shit right now.

717
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,743
But,
um,

718
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,720
yeah,

719
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,900
I dunno. But I was taking a multivitamin,
somebody shit all over that go.

720
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:52,280
It doesn't have enough of this and of that
you need to take this. It's just like,

721
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,790
okay. All right. All right. So, uh,

722
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,080
I think it's,
it's

723
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,570
okay.

724
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,970
Well, look, if you're not going to
do anything about being a fat fuck,

725
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:03,110
it's going to be more painful.

726
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,740
If you're just going to continue to be
a fat fucking not do anything about it,

727
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:09,980
then I would lie. That's your thyroid
problem. You know what I mean?

728
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,153
Yeah.

729
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,670
MMM.
Yeah.

730
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,490
That's like if you put out
something artistic and uh,

731
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,330
it doesn't do well and then you blame

732
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,940
the left or the right
or some shit like that.

733
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:24,950
Like I've seen with some
movies and other shit.

734
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,910
You can do that if you want stuck not
to help you. Next fucking project.

735
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,970
If the project have you a
navy training in Australia.

736
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,550
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

737
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,940
It's the last fucking place I would
be in the God damn navy is Australia.

738
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,163
Oh my God.

739
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,050
Okay.

740
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,320
What do you have to do to become
a fucking navy seal in Australia?

741
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,850
You have to stab a great white shark to
death after they cut the very make you

742
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:55,050
bleed before you get in the
fucking water. Alright. Hey Bill.

743
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,010
Just watched.

744
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,680
Okay.

745
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,880
Add voice clip.

746
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,040
I think that voice clip of you on Youtube
about how you watched the two weeks in

747
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,760
health thing. I was in the
Australian navy and it was similar,

748
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:11,420
but you got shit for not keeping your own.

749
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,520
I don't know what that means.
Preface,

750
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,910
this was before the media
cared about all genders.

751
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,950
We had big Bertha,

752
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,170
okay.

753
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,090
Which on the second day of recruit school,

754
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,100
we were kept up until 2:00 AM and
we're only allowed a breakfast bar.

755
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:33,050
The night before they woke us up by
smashing trash cans in each of our dorms

756
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:37,280
right there. I'd be out, I'd
be out. I'd be like, dude,
fuck this. And I'd walk out.

757
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,700
They'd be like, good, you're too
weak. And I'd be like, you're right,

758
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,850
and I'm going to a Holiday Inn.

759
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,030
I want to thank all of you for protecting
me in my eight hours sleep. All right.

760
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,230
That we had to run downstairs and
carry the rope called Big Bertha,

761
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,950
which was the equivalent. Oh my
God. Of the old ships anchor lines,

762
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,930
and we ran for about six kilometers,
3.7 miles. What the fuck?

763
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,830
Until we were allowed
to have food after that.

764
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,510
Anyone that couldn't continue,

765
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:11,020
we were partnered up with and had to
carry them and big Bertha shaming the

766
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:16,830
people that couldn't continue.
Uh, I couldn't do that.

767
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,243
Okay.

768
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,670
I couldn't do that to where
they up on the rope weeping.

769
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,450
Do they literally get broken
that bed? Every event? Well,

770
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,310
when we eventually got back to base,

771
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:34,311
we were allowed breakfast and then had
to go on with the eight hour drills and

772
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,530
fulfill our duty watches.

773
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,410
Yeah.

774
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:44,550
Wow. Dude. That is some psychological
breakdown right there. Holy Shit.

775
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,710
The most fucked up
thing about all of this.

776
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:47,950
Okay.

777
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,230
Hey, wait to, did you make
it through all of this?

778
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:51,680
Okay.

779
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,620
Oh my God.
Juvie or ATR difficult.

780
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,650
It is to be me.

781
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,290
Has your girlfriend ever said that to
you when you're thinking about that big

782
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:04,730
Bertha March? Was this, okay?

783
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:09,170
This was in m o two o three and
the Australian Defense Force,

784
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,160
our military,
God forbid we seem aggressive.

785
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,840
You say Defense Force had instituted
a policy where females could only be

786
00:47:17,841 --> 00:47:21,380
treated or ordered for
so many hours a day,

787
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:27,070
so handing a dash gas helicopter shoe.

788
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,040
So handling. Okay. Helicopter.

789
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:35,041
Sheila was only be performed by men
because it caused impotence and women but

790
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:35,974
also men,

791
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:41,310
but females could hold
positions on the yeah,

792
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:44,660
but they can also make a baby. They
know anybody. We'll fuck himself.

793
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,930
Your Dick and your balls are expendable
at that point. That's simple math,

794
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,550
but females could hold positions
on the Hilo refuel team.

795
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,410
Okay,

796
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,260
well that doesn't make sense, but when
it came to actually handling fuel,

797
00:47:57,261 --> 00:48:02,261
they get volunteer males to do it after
dealing with shit like being blamed

798
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:07,070
because my ship couldn't get any new
workers from land because the ship was a

799
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:12,071
fucking grinder and being in charge of
people when I haven't even been promoted,

800
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,350
I decided to just start drinking so much.

801
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,890
I got kicked off and it
was my best decision ever.

802
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,410
This is like a great movie.

803
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,880
Spent my last year of my contract
at a base in a rich part of Sydney,

804
00:48:25,881 --> 00:48:30,650
Australia surfing in the morning and
bagging a few of the new female sailors

805
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:36,070
that all over 21 he puts in parentheses
that had never been to sea by proudest

806
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:40,700
moment was when I was awarded these
humanitarian aid metal because I build

807
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:45,500
hospitals in some Matera
after the o five tsunami.

808
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,490
I spent days helping and building and the
people have so much or was some of the

809
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:53,480
most thankful, kindest people ever met.
What a fucking great story that is.

810
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:58,670
Oh my God. Can you imagine if you
quit like how tired you'd have to be,

811
00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:02,600
how excrutiatingly tired you have
to be to climb up on that rope.

812
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,530
It'd be carried back 3.7 miles.

813
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,890
I just have to go
mentally with every step.

814
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,320
This humiliation is one
step closer to being over.

815
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:18,560
What do you say when you get off?
Good. I make sorry about that. Yeah.

816
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,860
Have a fucking,
oh my God.

817
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,910
I can't imagine what people said
to you all the way back. Overrated.

818
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:29,450
Underrated or overrated.
New York and Los Angeles.

819
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,260
I've lived in both cities for
over four years each. I love them,

820
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,980
but I've also lived on a creek in
Virginia and a farm in Vermont.

821
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,400
Lsu need to be in one of those cities.
Just don't go there.

822
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,010
I that I agree with that whole
heart and he should visit him.

823
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,630
A underrated Wayne's world.
I never heard you talk about this movie.

824
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,490
He should definitely rewatch this. Next
time you take a hit man. All right,

825
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:57,000
I'll check it out. I will
definitely check it out. Um,

826
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,100
I ended it. Overrated. Underrated.
Okay. I, well, you know what? Overrated.

827
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:02,870
These new fucking elevators

828
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,380
where I got to fucking hit like 20 goddamn
buttons to let the elevator know that

829
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm going to floor four so it can fucking
compartmentalize all the people there

830
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:17,720
when I'm the only fucking person there,
you know,

831
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,800
and I gotta take my key out and
fucking run it over the scanner.

832
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,630
I liked the old school ones. We
just got in. You push the button

833
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,820
first fucking 10 years I was on the
road. That was, that was the way it was.

834
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:36,410
And I never had that guy from no country
for old men blow out the lock on my

835
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:39,770
door, you know, it was completely fine.

836
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,100
I've been one time I stayed in a bed and
breakfast in fucking Colorado with this

837
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:47,120
dude from Germany.

838
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,100
It was so fucking creepy cause he was
walking the halls at night and I was just

839
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:52,911
sitting there in the hall.

840
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:56,450
Light would be on and I was looking at
the light and I didn't have a lock of did

841
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:59,060
I think maybe on a skeleton cheat,
but I was just sitting there.

842
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,890
Oh I just moved with my luggage.

843
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,891
I had this ugly ass green like made out
of cloth bag cloth and plastic that this

844
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:13,220
guy puked on one side.
Oh my God. Remember that

845
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,490
change.
Describe it through a lot of shit people.

846
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,180
All right, let's tell the
chairman would first some fucking,

847
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,850
I will tell the puke one. No,
you've got to close with the puke.

848
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,960
I've already told that story
and it's so fucking gross.

849
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,860
I've been puked on twice in my life.
Once on my head,

850
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,073
you know,

851
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,610
everybody in my family had gotten sick
and we had this bathroom was a half a

852
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,010
bathroom with no door.
You were around the corner,

853
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,800
no privacy whatsoever. We lived in a
duplex, squirrels got into the walls.

854
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,430
I had to scare them out and then
my dad would kill him, you know,

855
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:58,220
was the 70s, eighties, you know,
Shit like that happen. So, uh,

856
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,820
there was no place to, you couldn't, I
couldn't make a Facebook video and Shay,

857
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:05,480
my landlord, you know, or my dad couldn't
do that, you know, so you just stopped.

858
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,160
She had to kill the fuckers. I remember
I had a broken, I was fucking shaking it,

859
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:14,030
try to get this thing to come out.
And my dad was on the other side.

860
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:18,710
You have this giant fucking butcher
knife or metal bar or something,

861
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:23,300
I can't remember.
And that was a metal bar.

862
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,310
That's what it was like a big
piece of lettuce or something. Any,

863
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:31,710
flush that thing out and that fucking
thing came running up the broom,

864
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,040
the broom handle,
I remember his eyes were wide is shit.

865
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,480
It's tail was straight up in the end.

866
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:40,350
This little brown Cutie Pie
fucking ran up my arm in,

867
00:52:40,351 --> 00:52:42,090
launched off of my shoulder.

868
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,830
I went la and then it ran
into the half a bathroom

869
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,000
and there was one way
in and only one way out,

870
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,530
my dad was in the way and
he fucking brought that led
dig down right on the back

871
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:58,200
of its fucking neck and just
slowly killed the three.

872
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,930
And I watched him do it.

873
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:02,763
MMM.

874
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,410
So anyways,
what time?

875
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:10,150
We were all fucking sick and I was in
there finishing puking in the bathroom

876
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:13,240
with no door.
My brother came running in,

877
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:20,730
just ran and rather than puking in the
fucking sink that was readily available.

878
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,601
You know,

879
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:25,850
we were young so it was just like you
puke in the toilet and my head obstructing

880
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:31,040
the toilet and it was like how low
pressure goes to high pressure.

881
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,570
It takes the most direct route,
which is right through the airfoil.

882
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,660
And that's how you get lift when you fly.
He used those same principles,

883
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:38,930
would puke it into the toilet.

884
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,820
And my head was the airfoil and
every fucking puked on my head.

885
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,680
And I just freaked out and I was punching
him as hard as I could in the stomach

886
00:53:48,681 --> 00:53:51,980
as he was continuing to Puke.
But parents came in,

887
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:56,900
they were laughing their ass off at bay
and the kitchen sink was there and she

888
00:53:56,901 --> 00:54:00,620
just fucking dunk my head in there,
fucking Washington. It was so gross.

889
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,010
So gross.
So then the second time I got puked on,

890
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,940
I was trying to save money and I was
taking a bus from Manhattan to Laguardia

891
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,700
Airport.
We were almost in my turmoil.

892
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,480
Yeah.

893
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,660
I take the subway up to Harlem and
then took the bus over the bridge

894
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,530
and this dude just got up,
look at all gray.

895
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:23,840
Yeah.

896
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,840
And he fucking projectile vomited and
he hit the sweet old lady in front of me

897
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:35,210
on her chest.
It was like the Kennedy assassination,

898
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:39,650
where to spray just went back except it
didn't go to the left and went to the

899
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:44,330
right where I was sitting.
And it got on my foot,

900
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:48,650
my sock and my lower pants
in all over my luggage.

901
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,100
And then he just stumbled off the bus

902
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,920
and I was like, you mother fucker. And
I wanted to beat the shit out of him,

903
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,520
but I was broke and I needed the
money and I had to go to my gig.

904
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,360
I just glared at them as all I could do.

905
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,160
And then I had to go in there,

906
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,150
got off the bus and now people look at
me like I'm an animal because I smelled

907
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:14,670
like fucking puke.
And I

908
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,160
went into the bathroom
like beyond Tourette's.

909
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,200
Took the sock off shoe off fucking,

910
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:29,010
but I didn't only had one
pair of footwear, so I threw
out the size disgusting.

911
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,440
Had to wash off my fucking
pant leg the best I could.

912
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,110
My sneaker was so could fucking wet.
I had one sock on, one sock off,

913
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:44,480
walking in a squishy wet
fucking sneaker and my fucking

914
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:45,940
okay.

915
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,810
Green cloth bag.
I wiped off all of the Pew,

916
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:54,760
but it was like stayed and they had like
the little fucking paper towel balls

917
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:57,490
audit.
It was so fucking gross.

918
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,560
It was so fucking gross.

919
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,430
And I then had to get on like a
fucking flight to like Minnesota,

920
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,440
just sitting there
smelling of stomach acid

921
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,370
and I got off the plane.

922
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,793
Yeah.

923
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:15,520
Yeah.

924
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,520
I immediately went to a mall and I
bought some sweatpants and the cheapest

925
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:23,890
fucking sneakers and socks and
I just fucking the shit out.

926
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,500
And I bought a bag. But I didn't have
time to do that before, which is about,

927
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:34,150
oh my God, it was a fucking terrible trip
on a fucking terrible trip. That was,

928
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,480
uh,
but you know,

929
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,360
it's not as bad as what fucking happened
on southwest could have been worse.

930
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,780
You know, the poor fucking
woman, Jesus Christ.

931
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:46,300
So that's the second time I've heard
of somebody gets sucked out like that.

932
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,330
He read that fucking story that,
uh,

933
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,360
it fucking mechanic puts a new
windshield on it, on the plane, and the,

934
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,830
uh,
the used the wrong fucking screws.

935
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,440
They weren't long enough and they
fucking fly in like, you know,

936
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,060
they're cruising altitude,

937
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:06,061
so they gotta be going full 500 miles an
hour in the fucking windshield flew off

938
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,240
and the captain got sucked out.

939
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:15,241
But his legs got stuck on the yoke and
he was outside the fucking plane and they

940
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:21,190
were trying to hold onto them and that
the door to the cockpit got blown in and

941
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:23,530
the guy couldn't slow down
because it was on the controls.

942
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,370
They sub out of the stewardess has helped
out, you know when the peer pressure,

943
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,240
okay.

944
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,790
I guess leveled off where they
can move and not get sucked out.

945
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:33,140
And they were trying to
pull them in and they could,

946
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,310
one of the students could see the guy
outside the window looking at him and his,

947
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,310
he wasn't blinking and she goes, I
think he's dead. We should let them go.

948
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,730
Fortunately they didn't.
They ended up landing.

949
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,190
It turned out the guy was in shock.

950
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,513
Okay.

951
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,760
Um,
fucking nuts.

952
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:57,080
Just sitting there like catatonic.

953
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:02,180
He got frostbite in one of his eyes.
It was just,

954
00:58:02,181 --> 00:58:06,980
and this is what kills me is a fucking
maniac was flying again in a couple of

955
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:11,470
weeks, but I think he still
flies. I can't imagine.

956
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:12,251
You know what the thing is,

957
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:15,460
is what they really should have in the
back of the plane is you should also have

958
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:19,240
those shoulder on a, since you
should have that, you know,

959
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,580
when it goes across your lap
and then over your shoulder.

960
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,340
So then if you sit next to the
fucking window, God forbid,

961
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,280
if the fucking thing blows out,
you still fine.

962
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:29,200
But that would be prohibitively expensive.

963
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,480
Yeah.

964
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,100
So I guess what I'm saying is get
the ILC. All right, everybody,

965
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,760
um,
go Bruins and,

966
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:44,490
uh, go Celtics. I had a,

967
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:44,951
I dunno,

968
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:48,320
I'm going to go fucking take a hot shower
and try to clear my goddamn scientists

969
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,460
is, uh, I want to do another
podcast tomorrow and I'll
be all caught up. All right.

970
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,580
Go Fuck Yourself. She can't sit. I'll
check it on your tomorrow. Go. Oh, Geez.
