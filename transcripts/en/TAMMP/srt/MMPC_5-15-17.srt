six the original six really weren't

00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,140
brand of baseball glove.

38
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,390
Goose Gossage use when he was still on
the fucking Oakland A's Rawlings Oh no

39
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,980
sorry the correct answer was a Wilson

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,200
douchebag family with the chance to steal.

41
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,323
I actually did.

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,400
You know if I can remember the category
my problem with those shows is sometimes

43
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:14,430
like I don't understand the

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,990
they'll say like Get Carter and it takes
like me like fucking three in a row to

45
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,160
understand like oh these are everybody's
got the last thing Carter I've got the

46
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,994
hardest one too.

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Or maybe I'm just the oldest they
brought up the fuckin dude on Michigan.

48
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,690
Then I think went to the fucking USFL
make this fucking Anthony car number one.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,460
I first started watching college football
he was the man out there with the

50
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,200
Wolverines All right.

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,140
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah.

52
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,820
That Doug a great fuckin fight songs of
all time the Michigan Wolverines dat dat

53
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,910
dat dat dat dat dat.

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,030
I'm fucking with you.
I know where it goes.

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,140
Hail to figurative value.

56
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,420
And I was singing the Notre Dame song
Oh Jesus this team made Oh Jesus.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,380
They're gone for a two
point conversion there.

58
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,570
Jesus. But you gotta say well you
know I mean they make. They make it.

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,970
I mean I love everybody get out of this
fucking locker room you bearded hippie.

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,500
That's what happened of Jesus came back.

61
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,930
Jesus ever went to the locker room
and Newt Rockne was in there right.

62
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,170
Oh five foot nothing of them
considered fucking average height.

63
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,360
Way back in the day before they put the
horse tranquilizers in the fucking horse

64
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:35,650
meat that they fed to the horses that
they then fed to the cows. Right.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,690
That then in my burger.

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,170
Maybe that's why I have such a fucking
disposition. I eat a lot of red meat.

67
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,730
There's so much red meat I
I don't consider hamburger
red meat to me red meat as

68
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,990
I had a steak.
I have a burger I mean it's it's

69
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,550
it's not it's not red
after I'm done cooking it.

70
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,310
No actually it's not even true.

71
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,590
I like I like all of it medium rare
and what I've been told by a cool life

72
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:08,200
freaks where they're like look
you can have a steak medium rare.

73
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,970
That's a lot less of a risk
because that's just one cup.

74
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,690
You know you're rolling the dice it's
like you're bang one hooker without

75
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,950
wearing a glove.
Jesus Bill right.

76
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,780
And then hamburger though
it's like a bank Vietnam.

77
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,570
Line pig Vietnam.

78
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,550
For some reason I went to fuckin full
metal jacket Hey baby you gotta go for

79
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,384
Vietnam.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,560
It's like you banged a
fuckin country at that.

81
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,700
That's what hamburger is because it's
just a bunch of cows all fucking mulched

82
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:43,480
together. Right. You have a steak
it's like you just fucked one cow.

83
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,650
That's what I'm trying to steer
I should say. What's the stare.

84
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,280
Well it's a bull without his balls buddy.
Right.

85
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,090
Take off its fucking horns.

86
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,480
I don't know what it is anyways and if
you have hamburger that's like you know

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,200
you know you're just Freddie
Mercury running around
fucking the whole free world.

88
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,190
Isn't that basically it.

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,950
I mean I'm not you know I'm not I don't
know my way around the kitchen enough to

90
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,250
know if that analogy worked
or not but I will say that I.

91
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,680
Let's just get back to
the original point okay.

92
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,180
What was the original point. Yeah.
I don't consider hamburger red meat.

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,500
Or was it that I'm not given some
fucking kid who lives in a chimney.

94
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,430
I don't know why a chimney.
You know.

95
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,800
You know seeing broke children is
always sad unless they're white.

96
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,070
There's just something fucking funny
about you know I think it's just a relief

97
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,540
as a white person that the
guilt goes away. You don't know.

98
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,560
You know anytime you see somebody from
another race broke you know white people

99
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:44,470
fucking pushed them out they
put a Wal-Mart down right.

100
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,950
They put one of those derricks in there
they started sucking all the fuckin shit

101
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:48,784
out of it.

102
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,420
You know I wonder if people around the
world when they watched the beginning of

103
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:57,100
the Beverly Hillbillies start crying you
know when they just see the white man

104
00:06:57,101 --> 00:07:00,760
even THEY FIRST THEY LAUGH LIKE OH MY
GOD IT'S toothless broke white people

105
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,970
hilarious and even they discover
oil and they get to keep it.

106
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,000
So they loaded up the drug and
moved to Beverly Hills that is.

107
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,680
I wonder if they cry
when the children cry.

108
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,970
You know nobody gets the
movie I was talking about.

109
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,490
I kept references.
We had problems with the family back east.

110
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,780
Anyway speaking of the children and
cry that's from white line everybody.

111
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,350
When the children cry was actually a hit.

112
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,050
That's how fucking off
the rails music went.

113
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,273
At one point

114
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,530
little jab jab. Yay. Yay yay yay.

115
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,180
Now it's like on the top 10.
I remember watching it.

116
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,900
I didn't give a fuck about that song but
I was like that lead guitarist of all

117
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:57,800
these fucking guys trying
to be Eddie Van Halen.

118
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,660
I'm not saying this guy was trying
to do the shit that Eddie did.

119
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,000
That fucking guy white line.

120
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,030
He came the closest you know out of all
the white bands you know the white lines

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,860
the fucking know who else was it was
white lion Great White who's white snake

122
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,900
it was Hey there Whitey.

123
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,350
It was a little known all white funk
band because that's what people used to

124
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,840
yell when they would say I care
about how cos I don't know.

125
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,590
Anyway speaking of children crying
my condolences to all the fans of the

126
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,040
Washington Capitals.

127
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,060
And you know what happens when you hit
the fucking wall for the third time when

128
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,680
you win the president's trophy.

129
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,300
You know under two
different presidents OK.

130
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,370
When Obama brings you to it Donald Trump
comes in with his tie hanging all the

131
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:52,730
way down to his tie would still touch
the ground even if he was wearing skates.

132
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,830
He goes walking into a locker room
and he gives you that fuckin trophy.

133
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,640
Yeah you're on your
second goddamn president

134
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,890
you've left the ugliest uniforms in the
history of the fucking game a hockey

135
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:09,050
possibly definitely up there.

136
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,010
Those blue ones with
that gold fucking eagle.

137
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,590
You know it just looked like they put a
stamp like them like the post office had

138
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,030
a limited stamp thing you know.

139
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,120
Then all those weird fuckin smelly people
you know people don't bathe collect

140
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:31,121
stamps you know and I'm not saying that
you know with all this stuff like what

141
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,050
do you identify with a man or
a women you know being a man.

142
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,300
I don't I am a man but I don't identify.

143
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,710
Stone identify when he mentioned the
fucking emptiness of that every day waking

144
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:46,720
up shave going What the fuck is this.

145
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,530
I can't relate to this
fucking beard on my face man.

146
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,450
You know when am I tits gonna come in.

147
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,170
I just I can't imagine that but whenever
there's other people that can't you

148
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,510
know they don't identify
with other human beings.

149
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,780
Forget about they don't
identify with their own gender.

150
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,170
There's another group of people that
we all need to care about and wear a

151
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,750
certain color on a certain
day or maybe a ribbon for.

152
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,030
And these are people that can identify
with other people they just can't

153
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:21,031
identify with human beings in general
and these people collect stamps you know

154
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,640
they just sit in their room they're not
bothering anybody taken that big giant

155
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:31,060
fucking book off that shelf.
You know blowing the dust off it.

156
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,640
Because they finally got the Washington
Capitals fucking horrific jersey from

157
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:40,110
the mid to early 2000s whenever they
had that it was an awful period.

158
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,520
That's why in the NHL

159
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,360
they added too many fucking teams and
everybody changed their uniforms I should

160
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:53,080
put it all on the capitals Washington D.C.
fucking horrific.

161
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,020
Thank God they went back to the
red white and blue. You know.

162
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,450
I mean you are there
in DC for fuck's sake.

163
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,580
You know if anybody shed the color
of the flags should be you guys.

164
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,500
You know the Buffalo Sabres.

165
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,700
That fucking HL horse shit they had you
know where they put a sheep on the front

166
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,400
even a bull anymore I was
terrible fucking terrible.

167
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,440
Props to them by the way when they
finally admitted that they made a fucking

168
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:24,490
mess there was such a horrible period
they had that strike that they lost a

169
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:27,450
whole season of the NHL All right.

170
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,650
They added a bunch of fucking teams too
many goddamn teams they had the Atlanta

171
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,130
Thrashers they had the
fucking Florida Marlins right.

172
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,840
That's right.

173
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,990
They played hockey first before they
suck so bad they were like you know let's

174
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,230
just fucking play baseball.
Now if the Florida Panthers.

175
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,110
The lightning the Coyotes

176
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,010
I think the North Stars moved down to
become the stars at least they kept the

177
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,150
kind of air there all right.

178
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,350
Because they kept the same
fucking uniforms and of
course they knocked down that

179
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,560
stadium in Minnesota.
They put up the Mall of America they're.

180
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,870
So sad. You know the place where Dina's
sister really smashed his stick over that

181
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:08,704
fucking guy's head.

182
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,640
You can now sit there standing there
eating frozen yogurt without a care in the

183
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:17,520
world. You know. It was that road game.

184
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,853
Anyways

185
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,150
the fuck am I talking about.

186
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,720
That's right.

187
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,650
So then you had all these new teams in
the NHL and then on top of that all these

188
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,670
teams that had been established
all changed their fucking uniforms.

189
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,570
So you come back after the strike and
you just watch and like Dude is this the

190
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,500
fucking Olympics.

191
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,730
Well actually that's not true because
after they started doing that in the 90s.

192
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,240
Because when the Sabres the
Sabres got fucked in 1999.

193
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,010
You know back when you could even have
a fucking shoelace tough like fucking

194
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,630
shoe leather that would sort out huh.
Who knows that one.

195
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,720
There's another obscure tough like
fucking shoe leather that mozzarella.

196
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,070
Woods around. Whatever the fuck you
said mozzarella. Who knows that.

197
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,390
If you're religious you might
know that that's a hint.

198
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,460
The title has something religious
a religious figure in it.

199
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,250
And it's not Jesus Christ Superstar.
That's the last hint I'm gonna give you.

200
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,640
The other savers got fucking nineteen
ninety nine. Was it Brett Hall.

201
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,503
Was it fuckin.

202
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,090
Danny mash Byrne I don't
know who the fuck it was.

203
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,590
Joe Berry Carol who had their foot in
the fucking crease I can't remember but

204
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,680
the whole year they're calling it until
the biggest goal of the year the one

205
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:40,180
that decides the Stanley Cup Classic NHL
yeah their new rule that's been fucking

206
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,260
everybody all year round.

207
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,250
Yeah forget it.

208
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,640
We've decided to change the rule in
overtime in the clinching game of the

209
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:51,730
Stanley Cup playoffs. That's
how we do it. That's right.

210
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,683
That's how we do it.

211
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,580
We take breaks every 20 minutes and we
have rules and all of a sudden the rules

212
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:57,970
go away.

213
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,970
So anyways my condolences to the city to
the District of Columbia capital fans.

214
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,960
Man they fuck identity again.

215
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,030
You know and you keep showing up because
you're real fans and yeah it's gonna

216
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,130
suck now they're gonna dismantle
the entire fucking team.

217
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,710
Hopefully they keep a Vatican.

218
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,100
You guys are out of your fuckin minds if
you get rid him are they gonna blame it

219
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:22,780
all on him. Did you see that picture
of his leg. I'll fuckin bruised up

220
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,460
he looks like somebody's trying
to get information out of him.

221
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,360
He wouldn't give it up you know.
Fuckin veins sticking out.

222
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,860
I thought his crane in there.
Jesus Christ.

223
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,960
I feel like a bad Dabney is in there
okay. He is handling it. Don't worry.

224
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,270
Can you hear that.
Yeah.

225
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,790
This is the time a night like she's so
like wants to know everything that's

226
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,720
going on that she does.

227
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,240
She won't nap enough during the day and
by the way fuck all your suggestions.

228
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,920
I don't wanna hear a million suggestions
put one of her shirts in in the bath

229
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:59,240
and that we've tried everything OK.

230
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,470
It's just you know it's a phase she's
going through and I am done listening to

231
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:07,420
fucking people who are
not wearing lab coats.

232
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,440
If you're not a lab coat on and you don't
have a fucking little degree hanging

233
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:15,930
on a wall behind you just keep
your fucking ideas to yourself OK.

234
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,150
The level of shit that parents talk every
fucking one of them has a goddamn cure

235
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,200
for every fucking thing that happens
every one of them just glided through

236
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,670
fucking being a parent.

237
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,010
I've figured it all out and
for some stupid reason they
didn't cash in on it and

238
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:33,844
write a book.

239
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,320
Why would you do that when you can just
show up to somebodies house and vomit

240
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:39,610
all your fucking ideas on.

241
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,240
If any of your people's fuckin ideas work
you should put it in a book and go on

242
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:49,420
the Oprah channel and you guys can sit
there holding each other's fucking hands

243
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:52,460
as she tells you how
amazing you are said it.

244
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,390
Come on over here boring me with
it and then I go and try it.

245
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,500
You know actually you know what the
shirt one worked the shirt when did work.

246
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,300
I will say that I should have fucking
said that because a relative suggested to

247
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,900
me and it was fucking great. That's just
the first thing that popped in my head.

248
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
I was actually thinking about somebody
else that annoyed the shit out of me was

249
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:15,670
something else trying to feed my kids
solid food. Three months into her life.

250
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,110
No it's fine it's fine.

251
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,480
This is this is the danger riffing
because you end up shitting on the person

252
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:28,690
you're not upset with
anyways plowing ahead.

253
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,040
Where am I. Oh yeah. Condolences.

254
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,480
You know so I would definitely
keep Ovechkin you've got
to build around the guy

255
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:41,480
build around the guy again and you know
get a coach with a neck and you know you

256
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,920
know maybe you can see if something was
offsides or not and you can you could

257
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,720
throw the flag or whatever you do to
challenge it instead of sitting there with

258
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,320
his spine fused.

259
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,560
Somebody made the joke said that every
coach in the NFL in the NHL looks like a

260
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:57,394
Bond villain.

261
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,070
And it is true.
I got to go with that.

262
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,933
You know what I mean.

263
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,810
Although I would say that Claude Julien
Claude Julien looks like that that dude

264
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:14,680
in the swamp thing that when he got turned
into a monster became that little guy

265
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:15,514
running around

266
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,230
such a weird fuckin movie where I don't
even remember the name of the movie the

267
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,920
whole thing about the movie was there
was this chick and she had these giant

268
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,530
fucking tits and you just waiting
for it to go into the lake.

269
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,520
So they'd show a little side boob.
Now this is the early 80s.

270
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,010
That was a big fucking thing
when you were like 12 years old.

271
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,513
All right.

272
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,810
So the deal with the Swamp Thing which
is where I got that thing I had problems

273
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,220
with the family back east
that's that's where it's from.

274
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,490
It's from the swamp thing.
I'm obviously fucking with you.

275
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,910
When I talk about the swamp thing.
Right. So how that worked. He was.

276
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,050
He was I forget what hand the
guy was walking near a swamp.

277
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,730
You know the usual thing and then a
telephone pole falls into the fuckin swamp

278
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,820
he gets electrocuted and then he becomes
the Swamp Thing and he's as strong as

279
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,250
shit and there's some fuckin bad guy.

280
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,400
So they figure out how he became the
Swamp Thing so then the bad guy wants.

281
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,980
He wants a Swamp Thing
of an army a swamp thing.

282
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,660
So whatever he can take over
all those swamps. I don't I
don't remember. Right. So.

283
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,030
This fucking little weaselly dude he does
the same thing and when he turns into

284
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,690
a monster he's as little
as fuckin weaselly monster.

285
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,170
So then the bad guy goes well how come
we didn't turn into what you are and it

286
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:37,810
says well you know when
you get electrocuted in the
swamp and you turn into a

287
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:40,540
swamp thing it just
enhances your personality.

288
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,883
All right.

289
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,520
So if you're a fuckin stud like me who
even know I look like a swamp thing I

290
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,010
could still bang that big tits
whore over there in the lake.

291
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,270
If you're a little weaselly can't you
just become an ugly weaselly cunt with

292
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,070
like mud and leaves for skin.

293
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,550
There you go people I.

294
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,180
And I can't think of a bet sorry
just blew out your is there.

295
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,630
I can't think of a better time to
read a little bit of advertising.

296
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,170
What do you say there. What do
you say then. What do we got here.

297
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Oh wait I got to finish so you know
what I could say to DC fans is when you

298
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,730
finally fucking win it it
makes it all the sweeter.

299
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,170
Just going through all of this shit all
right I watched the Bruins from about

300
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:20,710
seventy nine eighty eight
a week to late 2011.

301
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,740
So what's that a 9 9 9 2009 I
watched them for about 33 years.

302
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,843
All right.

303
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,030
And I know you go woo woo woo woo woo woo.
Shut up.

304
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,650
Shut up.

305
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,410
All right you got all those monuments
she could fucking walk around kids you.

306
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:39,920
Cheer up.

307
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,600
Look at the weather the Wizards forced
the game seven I'll talk about that a

308
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:47,320
little later after I read a couple
of fuckin advertiser minutes here.

309
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,800
He likes everybody he likes your unique
Oh you're a special little fucking cunt

310
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:53,950
aren't you.

311
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,300
You don't walk like everyone else talk
like everyone else sleep show chat.

312
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,673
Like anyone else.

313
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,320
Let me ask you this why is your
mattress one size fits all.

314
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,220
I hate this question just because there's
a general hate that people are from a

315
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:15,410
little baby all the way up to like if
you make a mattress that fits somebody

316
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:19,970
about six foot for your cover and like
babies all the way to like 90 percent of

317
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,140
adults it has to be right.

318
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,490
I don't know what do I
know about mattresses.

319
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,120
About as much as I know about reading out
loud but I'm going to continue because

320
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:34,121
a truly customized mattress will
cost you five to ten thousand bucks.

321
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,970
Until now.
Go to Helix Sleep dot.com.

322
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,110
Answer a few simple questions and they'll
run a 3D biomechanical model of your

323
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:50,120
body through the proprietary algorithms
they've developed with the help of the

324
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:54,380
world's leading ergonomic
biomechanics experts.

325
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,520
The results of fucking robots
shows up to your front door.

326
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,520
Looks exactly like you with a
mattress strapped to his back.

327
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,720
He gives you the URL for fucking Sheva
and next thing you know he's banging your

328
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,470
wife on the bed that you paid for.

329
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,250
Sorry.

330
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,400
Now what really happens is the most
comfortable mattress you've ever slept on

331
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,950
shows up right.

332
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,890
Your lady lays in and she's like
Oh my God this is great right.

333
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,880
She reaches over for your fuckin meat
hammer and next thing you know you need to

334
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:23,810
buy a new mattress.

335
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,080
He likes customers report a 30 percent
improvement in overall sleep quality and

336
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:34,070
for couples they customize
each side of the mattress.

337
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,440
The beginning of the end of your marriage

338
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,590
is when you have the customer telling
you that's the beginning end of it.

339
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,780
That starts with that.

340
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,930
And then he goes you know it'd be great
if your tits were a little bit bigger

341
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:49,100
right and then she starts redoing herself
like Matt Damon in the Liberace movie

342
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,510
and then one day just gets rid of her.

343
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,700
Maybe nowadays with millennials
it probably goes the
opposite way the way these

344
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:59,250
broads a slap and the guys around
in the shows now it's unbelievable.

345
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,900
Hanging them off of fucking balconies
and stuff your mattress arrives at your

346
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,090
door in about a week and
shipping is 100 percent free.

347
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,120
That's why everyone from GQ magazine to
Forbes are all talking about like sleep.

348
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,630
That's what they're doing.
They're not talking about ties.

349
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,430
They're not talking about the
next hostile takeover right.

350
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,000
They're talking about mattresses.
You have 100 nights to try it out.

351
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,670
And if you don't love it they'll pick
it up for free Gross and give you a 100

352
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:27,740

I don't know if you guys noticed but I've
gotten much better at reading out loud.

407
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,860
You know.
Watch this.

408
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,030
I'm going to say right now I bet I only
make three mistakes in the next two

409
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:40,480
fucking reads.
You want to bet what you want to bet.

410
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,080
You want to bet a little
calves easy shea butter.

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,750
I bet you have fucking
a handful of that shit.

412
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,870
All right.
Policy genius all right.

413
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,590
I never said how fast or slow I'd go.
Life insurance.

414
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,880
Do you have it.
See that nail that first sentence.

415
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,400
If not why.

416
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,570
Too expensive or a hassle man.

417
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,190
If you don't have life insurance what
would happen financially if something

418
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:15,060
happened to the primary earner.
What are you talking to the wife here.

419
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,190
God knows the primary earners that is the
man. And that's not a sexist statement.

420
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,210
I'm just saying I'm just I'm just a
progressive male and I've listened to all

421
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:27,870
these women bitch moaning and complaining
that we all make more money to do the

422
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:28,950
exact same job.

423
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,150
But wait a minute how many women are
plumbers and then Mary a plumber.

424
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,810
I'd be the worst.
You're all fucking competitive

425
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,250
both going to bed smelling
like fucking shit and wrenches.

426
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,750
All right.
Let's keep going here.

427
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,240
Life insurance is a good idea to protect
the ones around you but where do you go

428
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:53,220
to get the best prices or the best policy
with the best service policy genius

446
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,650
That was the last one.

gives me shit about the
airline bumping you know why.

451
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,790
Because it's very few people out
there that defend the man all right.

452
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Anybody can attack the man every once
in a while it takes a fucking fucking I

453
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:44,180
don't know the internet version of that
Clint Eastwood spaghetti western guy

454
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,910
coming to town with his little fucking
Mike Tyson's colorful Mike Tyson towel

455
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,280
over his fucking head right.

456
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,880
That's all broke Mike Tyson was when
he was a boy he first started up.

457
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,510
He was like I want to dress like Clint
Eastwood they said Oh we'll get you his

458
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:04,511
underwear his boots and we'll get that
little fucking that little shawl he puts

459
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:08,150
over it but you know we can't
afford to put any color on it

460
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,710
you know and that's the kind of thing
that lead you to bite somebody's ear off.

461
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,920
I'm just saying I'm not trying to say
that what he did was right but I'm just

462
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:16,880
saying I understand.

463
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,590
Hey how you doing up there in
Montreal everybody Montreal Canada.

464
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,480
How's things going up there.
Enjoying the fucking off season.

465
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,590
God knows you're gonna have enough
time to come and see me in June.

466
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,410
This is what I'm loving about
the predators. All right.

467
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,020
Although they seem like
they're losing right now.

468
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,950
I'm taping the game but I'll fuck I'll
fuck myself over here and I'll just look

469
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:40,670
it up right now.

470
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,900
Oh look at that the little time trial I
think you're going to fuckin load for me.

471
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:50,110
I think the ducks were up 5 to 2 or 5 to
3 how fucking weird Are these playoffs

472
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:51,084
this year.

473
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,970
You know.

474
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,970
Anyways you know I always give you guys
shit about the curse of Patrick wow you

475
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:00,360
humiliated that guy.

476
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,060
I mean what you guys did to him when
you watched like like horror movies.

477
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,890
You know what I mean when somebody like
you know thinks they're prom queen and

478
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,850
then you dump a bunch of blood on them
or they think that they're gonna go make

479
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:17,210
a wish in a well and then their
mother pushes him to the bottom of it.

480
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,050
Yeah I mean they think that you
know that that all of that shit.

481
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,160
All of that shit right.
Somebody drowns in a fucking lake.

482
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,200
You guys did the hockey version
of that to Patrick what. You know.

483
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,890
He thought you guys loved him.
That's what it was like Kerry.

484
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,060
He came out there you know has one
fucking bad game you won't pull him.

485
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,770
You'll leave him in there you fucking
do a mock cheer when this guy who

486
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,440
redefined the position

487
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,350
first ballot Hall of Famer continuing
the tradition of winning fuckin Stanley

488
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:54,590
Cups.

489
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,190
You know when he won it during the real
era when there was like 30 fucking teams

490
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,960
28 teams not all those cups the Canadians
and Maple Leafs won back in the day

491
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:05,180
when it was him the state was
like a fucking shot glass.

492
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,040
Seems skate around with the
thing looks like a fucking baton.

493
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,960
You know before it became
that giant god damn thing.

494
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,710
Anyways they booed him out of town.

495
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,460
So ever since then there's been
the curse of Patrick White.

496
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,580
And I think the next fucking part
the next chapter of the curse.

497
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,340
Okay is P.K. Sue Bowen. You know.

498
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,420
You know what they they ran him out of
Falconetti ran that guy out of town.

499
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,500
Now this wasn't your fans.
I think it was the organization.

500
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,290
I also think it's
because I'm a Bruins fan.

501
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,900
I just love giving you guys shit
because when I'm gone I do talk about

502
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,730
championships you guys
are gonna destroy me.

503
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,150
So this is this little fucking little
thorn I can put in the underneath your

504
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,640
fuckin elephant foot here.
All right.

505
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,763
What P.K.

506
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,630
was a fucking great dude and he gave too
much money that children's hospital he

507
00:32:56,631 --> 00:33:00,710
started becoming bigger than the Canadians
and the Canadians couldn't fucking

508
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,490
handle it.

509
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,070
Like when Kobe couldn't handle Shaq and
he said looky there he goes awry go.

510
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,090
And they said OK Kobe and they sent
Shaq to Miami and then he won a fucking

511
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:12,540
title there right.

512
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,930
Then they had to bring Phil Jackson back
and another fifty fucking free agents.

513
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,150
As they always fucking do.

514
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,300
You know I you know I just give Kobe
shit for the first the first three rings

515
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,310
Get the fuck out.
The last two I'll give you those.

516
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,720
You know even with the officiating and
that second time you played this Celtics

517
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,590
Hey let's call fucking 38 fouls
on one team in 17 on the other.

518
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,660
That's that makes for a
good game 7 doesn't it.

519
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,260
Not saying that we would've won but it
would've been nice to see the Lakers beat

520
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:40,840
the salt except you're just saying

521
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,030
anyways plowing ahead so now the
predators are up 1 did nothing against the

522
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:52,031
fucking Emilio Estevez as the Sheens
whenever the fucking column down there.

523
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,350
The mighty the mighty Sheens

524
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,360
the Anaheim s devils is the mighty ducks.

525
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,110
I don't like the ducks
I don't like ducks I.

526
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,810
Don't give a fuck. I just don't like
them. Okay I don't like the Honda Center.

527
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,690
OK I you go there there's no fucking vibe
there's no vibe in Anaheim it's just a

528
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:20,840
fucking it's just I don't know what it is.
It's just a strange god damn place.

529
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,990
Anaheim is fucking weird

530
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,170
his whole fucking L.A. areas weird like
people weren't supposed to live here.

531
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,143
You don't know me.

532
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,860
They weren't supposed to fucking live
here it's a fucking desert we still water.

533
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,760
Hold all things weird but at least
you know this is cool shit to look at.

534
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,590
You know except when you go to Anaheim I
don't know what you look at. All right.

535
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,640
And you go down there there's no
fuckin vibe. Maybe it's better.

536
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,780
I went to a ducks game in the late 90s.
They were still early right.

537
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,880
They were still the Mighty Ducks they
still had Donald Duck with the broken bill

538
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,210
on the front isn't what they had
for their logo. I don't know.

539
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,740
So anyways what if what if what if.
P.K.

540
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,080
leads the Nashville Predators.

541
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,800
To a Stanley Cup championship this year
I'm just throwing that out there for

542
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:06,790
everybody up there and St.

543
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,290
Catherine Street with your cute little
pocket squares that matches the color of

544
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,124
your socks.

545
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,860
You know what the fuck are you going
to do that Nashville that banjo playing

546
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:23,110
fuckin washboard down by the fucking
river. Ever been to Nashville.

547
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,720
I mean have the structures
there still have dirt floors.

548
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,720
It's unforgettable. It's
ridiculous. You know

549
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,330
like when they went this day when
they went to Nashville this year.

550
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,590
And they were like you know who
you voted for for president.

551
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,920
They were like I'll tell
you one thing I blanking.

552
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,050
You aren't afraid to fly.

553
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,280
That's how backward naturalists you know
I know there's all this shit out there

554
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:55,730
saying it's this growing city you know
and they're trying to get people to move

555
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,900
there.

556
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,640
The reason why they're trying to do that
is because so many of the structures

557
00:35:58,641 --> 00:35:59,630
still have dirt floors.

558
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Okay now if he can go down there right
and and fucking lead them to the Stanley

559
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:11,050
Cup the big boy Stanley Cup and have
their little shot glass that you want you

560
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:15,190
would fucking Toronto one like
fucking 15 times each. You know.

561
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,130
I'll give the Canadians their last 10
cups but I look at them like I came to say

562
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:22,980
they're equal Detroit because Detroit
was back then when it was a shock less.

563
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,360
You know sort of fancy shot glass.

564
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,720
Anyways
I'm just fucking with you.

565
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,490
I have no idea how the fuckin predators
were in the finals the Western

566
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,770
Conference finals with the ducks
and then the Ottawa Senators.

567
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,310
What the fuck is going on with that when
it when is when is the glass slipper

568
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:45,790
going to turn back into a fucking punkin.
I'm telling you.

569
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,600
If Ottawa goes any deeper
into the playoffs they're
actually going to sell out a

570
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:50,434
home game.

571
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,133
Midseason believe.

572
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,270
Did you see the first game of the Rangers
they had two thousand of the Rangers

573
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:58,120
three they had two thousand empty seats.

574
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,090
That's because they stopped playing
the Bruins. You know what I mean.

575
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,170
And the Bruins were just close enough to
Ottawa that that shuttle flight wasn't

576
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:07,300
it wasn't too expensive you know.

577
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,680
Then they played the Rangers
and God knows Rangers fans.

578
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,700
All those fuckin Manhattan cunts.
They got the money to fly up to Ottawa.

579
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,030
But then New Yorkers. Do what.
Why would they get bored.

580
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,480
They got a slice of cheese.

581
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,130
Why would I travel.

582
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,750
Look over there at the
Empire State Building. Oh.

583
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,740
That's what New Yorkers are there.
They're fucking they like country people.

584
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,490
You don't have to be lonely fucking
Skanks in the fucking five boroughs.

585
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,640
I am in an extra country mood and I am
just trashing people that I have no right

586
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:52,430
to trash. OK. My team
is not in the playoffs.

587
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,180
Ok my team has not won as many
championships as the fucking Canadians.

588
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,990
My city doesn't have as many
skyscrapers in New York City.

589
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,980
They don't fuck with my city.
You just fuck with the wrong city.

590
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,670
I probably would barely back east.

591
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,160
If you touch my family
I'll fucking kill you.

592
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,050
Those lines will never
get old in Hollywood.

593
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,250
You know it's another fucking hacky thing.

594
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,170
I'm so sick of every other fucking show
doing this speed dating fuckin scene.

595
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,760
How many times can you do that in
one fucking lunatic after an Emmy.

596
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,380
It's not that bad.

597
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,960
Jesus fucking Christ people showing up
with like half an axe in their side of

598
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:34,794
their head.

599
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,280
People live with their mother the person
who's actually gay pretending to be

600
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:43,020
straight to fucking say me mean Eddie
Murphy did this shit fucking and then

601
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,000
coming to America in 1989.

602
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,330
Jesus Christ why do you just have somebody
come in and slip on a banana peel and

603
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,610
then get a pie in their face
and then do the dating thing.

604
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,130
Hey Bill you so talented won't
you come up with something new.

605
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,580
Because I limit it.
All right.

606
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,230
I never said I fucking
would reinvent something.

607
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,550
All right unfortunately I have to take
a little bit of break and I'm on a nice

608
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:09,384
little roll here.

609
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,390
I'm on a nice little roll here but I
have a go I get some I gotta take care.

610
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,880
Which is why I'm doing this
at 9 o'clock on a Sunday.

611
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,840
But why do I need to tell you guys because
it's going to be a fucking second of

612
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:19,674
your life.

613
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,270
All right hang on hang on a moment.

614
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,530
OK I'm back.
I'm back and I am as illiterate as ever.

615
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,100
You want to this is somebody just
fuckin tearing me a new one here.

616
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,260
So I was talking about fucking United
Airlines and Delta and then just yanking

617
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:40,800
people off of flights and like
what happened to customer service.

618
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,820
And all of this type.

619
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,960
You know I felt guilty flying United
the way they just drag that Chinese dude

620
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:52,971
off the plane to go into China
just as so many was Chinese Asian.

621
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,160
Give me that right. Who knows. Who
knows. I'm so fucking hard I don't know.

622
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,210
You know fucking
fuck me anyways.

623
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,540
Airline bumping he said.
He says hey you uninformed cunt.

624
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,040
Well I'll tell you.

625
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,550
Nothing makes the reader want to read
more when you just start off with the

626
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:19,050
insults he said Congress and the
passengers bill of rights have led to more

627
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:23,070
passengers getting bumped
due to more cancellations.

628
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,450
And do you think he gives any examples.
Now he just moves on to his next point.

629
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,510
Also if people showed up for the flights
they booked the airlines wouldn't be

630
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:37,810
overbooked.
Many passengers book multiple flights.

631
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,090
How about if you buy.

632
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,170
So you're just assuming that the guys
that are yanking off the flights to those

633
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:46,360
people.
I don't do that.

634
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,620
I buy one fucking ticket nice show up.
That's how I do it.

635
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,590
So you're telling me that that Chinese
dude or that other fucking person on

636
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:00,550
Delta you're telling me that that those
are those people so they say you book

637
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:03,230
like 20 flight she only
showed up for one day.

638
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,210
Get out of fuck I said get out of there.
You're telling me that's what happened.

639
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,200
Or are you telling me that
because other people do that.

640
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,330
Because the guilty people did it that
United and Delta is now just going to grab

641
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:19,640
some random innocent person and
throw them off the fuckin flight.

642
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,810
I heard the reason why they did it was
because they had another plane that they

643
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:29,360
had to get a flight crew to and they
just fucking yanked the guy off.

644
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,870
That has nothing to do with that
other shit. As far as I know.

645
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,030
But I hate what am I am
just an uninformed cunt.

646
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:39,810
Evidently you who just like me just
make statements with no fucking evidence

647
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:42,220
behind it. All right.
Plowing ahead he goes.

648
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:47,370
How about if I buy a ticket for a flight
and miss it for whatever reason you

649
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:49,450
lose it.
Question mark.

650
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,320
Is that how you run your shows.

651
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,773
Was that a point.

652
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,010
How about if I buy a ticket for a
flight and miss it for whatever reason.

653
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,030
Karma you lose it.

654
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,950
Oh how about if you have
a problem with that.

655
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,800
I don't have a fucking problem with
that at all. I'm on the same page.

656
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,640
I hate when I show up on time for the
security line and somebody else shows up

657
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:17,840
super late and then they get rewarded
and get breezed through the fucking line

658
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,560
like they're in that team like they're
part of the TSA party they're the pre

659
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:22,394
check people.

660
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,450
You're bringing up all this other shit
that has nothing to do with a fucking

661
00:42:27,451 --> 00:42:29,690
just somebody who bought a
ticket and sits on the plane.

662
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,230
I drive a car.

663
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Other people steal cars should I be
yanked out of my fucking car because other

664
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,860
people are stealing cars.
This makes no sense.

665
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,720
I might be an uninformed cunt but you
are a pompous arrogant uninformed cunt.

666
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,050
I could say that because I'm
in show business. You know
we're all down to earth.

667
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:57,030
Alright let me read some more of your
air quote points. All right. Is that I.

668
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,930
Is that how you run your shows.

669
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,650
No I don't run my shows like that.
You know this is my fault.

670
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,370
Here's how I run my fucking show.
I don't have anybody kicked out ever.

671
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,690
You can be the biggest Conte ever.

672
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,210
I kicked the first fuckin
person out in 10 years.

673
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,990
Because he was so fucking drunk I'm
a hell of a guy. I don't give a fuck.

674
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,400
I'm a great guy when it comes to that
shit how dare you love me and with United

675
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:25,740
Airlines and Delta.
Ew ew ew ew hateful so and so.

676
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,460
All right. Let me please finish this point
here. Is that how you run your shows.

677
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,720
Or if someone buys a ticket to your show
and misses it due to traffic leaving

678
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:38,800
the house late etc. Do you honor
their ticket to the next show.

679
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,810
I will tell you this I've had plenty of
people fuck and reach out to me and I

680
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,830
have hooked plenty of
people up with tickets.

681
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,470
OK how about that.

682
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,470
Has everyone reached out to me
has ever seen every fucking email.

683
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,690
No but I hope people up.

684
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,650
I've run into fucking people walking down
the street drive by a occasional Fuck

685
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,000
you.
To go to show.

686
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,680
And I'm like it's all soda faggot fucker.
What's your name.

687
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,630
I've done that countless times.
So there you go sir.

688
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,660
I don't know you talking about

689
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,030
all the equipment to that is I fucking
pull up and stand outside the gates of

690
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:15,690
the airport.

691
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,580
Hey you guys flying in Minneapolis.

692
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:23,060
Yes sir we are. Could I.
Can I buy a ticket. Sorry.

693
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,370
It's all sold out.

694
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,660
Berman I don't worry about it.

695
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,290
Don't worry we'll get you on the plane
and then they fucking yank someone that

696
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,880
they yank somebody off.

697
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,360
I don't know why they
picked the Asian guy.

698
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,813
Huh.

699
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,360
Why couldn't they pick some fuckin
white dude in a suit. You know why.

700
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,440
You know why. All right. Leave
the house late in the game.

701
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,800
Well that is what the airlines
do if you miss a flight.

702
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,510
They put you on another one.

703
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,250
So fuck off you non reading pigment
impaired that's not what they do.

704
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,850
That's what they do sometimes.
Other times they yank you off the plane.

705
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,490
Other times it Taylor go fuck yourself.

706
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:12,870
Other times they say hey you have to
win a thousand miles you can't use them

707
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:13,830
when you want to use them.

708
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,800
And if you don't use them by next
Wednesday we're taking them all back other

709
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:23,330
times they say hey which is charging
extra because it's post 9/11 we lost all

710
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:28,030
this money which is charging for food but
eventually will fuckin stop overcharge

711
00:45:28,031 --> 00:45:31,490
and we'll stop charging for this shit
for all the money that we lost in 9/11

712
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:35,000
which you know we're now going to
pass on to our fucking customers.

713
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,550
So they take the hit one was fucking 9/11.

714
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,250
I know I'm an uninformed cunt as far
as my calculation were coming up on the

715
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:47,470
16th anniversary this September. You're
still paying for Pringles aren't you.

716
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,200
Sir I'm all for defending the fuckin man.

717
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,060
When it's when it's for I mean I don't
I don't know what you just fucking.

718
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,690
You just brought up a bunch of.

719
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,750
I guess behavior by frequent flyer people
so then evidently I should get yanked

720
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:07,960
off a plane at some point because other
people overbook and shit you don't you

721
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,140
you're the kind of person
that probably likes that Dad.

722
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,340
Well they call it a trap ride.

723
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,020
The trick car whatever that fucking
show is you probably like that show.

724
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,210
You probably think that that's
a good fucking show right.

725
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,170
That show I came to believe that
fucking show is on television.

726
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,870
It's on Tru TV.

727
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,960
We should change the name the fucking
horrific TV they fucking think they drive

728
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:35,961
down to like the fucking projects and
they leave a car with the door open keys

729
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,770
in it running and then they wait for
someone to fucking steal it and then they

730
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:43,260
act like they've got a bad
guy off the fucking street.

731
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,650
And I was reading comments underneath
that you know I love it they're going to

732
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:49,400
go out of their fuckin way.

733
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:54,040
To go down there and try to get someone
to go to jail what do you go down there

734
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:57,620
and try to help somebody out.
I saw one guy.

735
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,390
He actually stole the fucking car.

736
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,230
He knew it was the trap car whatever he's
driving with the door open because he

737
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:06,400
knows that they just like the big
fucking hit the locks he can't get out.

738
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,680
And he's saying he knows his strap
carries waving to the camera all that.

739
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,350
They ask if he knows a trap car why did
you do it he said I don't know maybe I

740
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:15,740
just want to get on TV and then he laughed
and everybody's like that goes crazy.

741
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,200
I want wanna party with that guy.
That guy's a dope or anything.

742
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,090
It was it was to me it was
fucking depressing. Like that.

743
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,740
That's the level of options this
guy has in his fucking life.

744
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,500
He would do something like that. Somebody
else brought up a great point. OK.

745
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,560
Like why don't they take that car around
the fuckin suburbs to the White cul de

746
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:34,820
sacs why don't they do that.

747
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,330
Maybe a book will go.

748
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,500
Kids don't steal the fuck they don't.

749
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,100
They absolutely do and I'll tell
you there's a point my fucking life.

750
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:43,963
I would have done that.

751
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,030
I absolutely would have done that just
for this stupid fucking just to have the

752
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,710
story so I could talk about it loudly
around chicks that I liked because I

753
00:47:51,711 --> 00:47:53,210
didn't know any other way to approach him.

754
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:01,490
If they ever did that in a fucking suburb
in a bunch of white kids started going

755
00:48:01,491 --> 00:48:04,760
to jail over that shit that shit
would not would be entrapment.

756
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,880
It wouldn't be held up in court and
the fucking show would be shut down.

757
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,090
All I'm saying. Okay. You sir.

758
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,440
You probably like that type of
shit you probably like that show.

759
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,070
You think that's a good show and hey
let's let's you know rather than giving

760
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:19,490
this guy an opportunity you know they
could just as easily controlled TV have a

761
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:22,100
fucking show where they go down and
they try to give somebody a fucking job.

762
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,953
You know.

763
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,160
Anyways plowing ahead making
your own baby food a Billy burp.

764
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,290
Had my first kid a couple years ago.
Congratulations.

765
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:41,200
A friend suggested we make our own baby
food because it's easier to get them to

766
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:45,610
transition to real and healthy foods.
We tried it and it was fun.

767
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,700
Friends suggest that we make our own
baby food because it's easier to get them

768
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:53,880
to transition. Okay all right. We
could hey there's another fun guy.

769
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,020
No lab coat no degree.

770
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,580
We couldn't do it 100 percent of
the time but was totally worth it.

771
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,600
My kid isn't that picky of an eater
and I like to think think that days of

772
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,920
pulverizing fruits vegetables and oats
into tasty meals. Oh it's because of that.

773
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,200
I'm sure you can afford the good stuff
for the little lady but just thought I'd

774
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,330
throw it out there.
Thanks.

775
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,700
Go fuck yourself. Yeah. I don't
know. I don't know what to tell you.

776
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,070
I'll cross that fucking robotic everybody
is always like you got all these

777
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:27,630
goddamn suggestions it was somebody
fucking you know everybody talking about

778
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,150
like private schools
versus public schools.

779
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,450
It's like these fucking kids
they only get to be kids anymore.

780
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,610
They should be fucking you know

781
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,070
this whole fucking thing that you know
from day one like it gets gotta be like

782
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,310
you've seen what it does
in these countries that and
push their kids too hard.

783
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,540
They have like all serrated fucking balls
like they've been working on fucking

784
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:55,330
Wall Street for 60 goddamn
years and in like 7.

785
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,500
The level of stress that they put on
I'm fucked that my kid's going to be a

786
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:00,334
goddamn kid.

787
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,460
All right I flunked everything fucking
in high school I fucked up everything I

788
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,180
got a restaurant drinking and driving.

789
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,400
I was unloading trucks
I did all of this shit.

790
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,010
Then one day I just figure out what
the fuck do I what do I want to do.

791
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,770
I found a passion and I
followed it and I was fine.

792
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,770
And I remember back in the day they used
to fuck all you need two years of the

793
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,010
language if you know to use of a fucking
language you can't level it's all

794
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:27,880
fucking bull you know it's to say
that the fucking language teacher fuck

795
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:28,714
everybody

796
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:33,820
fuck everybody like you could be a god
damn kid and fuck all these fucking

797
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:37,000
private schools within nine
zillion dollar fucking you know.

798
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Oh you better get in when the kids are
just playing with blocks the early you

799
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:45,760
get in the better chance you
have your kid to continue on.

800
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,510
In other words start fucking
line in our pockets now.

801
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,550
Yeah why don't you just have no.

802
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,140
Won't it be cheaper to just
have your kid homeschooled.

803
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,840
Drop all that fucking cash like
he's already going to Yale.

804
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,120
And then fucking going to school then
go on the wheels on the bus go round and

805
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:06,730
round round there and that'll be enough.

806
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,320
Yeah.
The credit card didn't work.

807
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,420
Yeah I can't teach the
rest of the song All right.

808
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,070
Birthday boat party.
A bill.

809
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,810
Your bald headed eagle.

810
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,610
Jesus.
Going fucking old school on that one.

811
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,870
Hey you Chesler.
Hey yes Sidewinder.

812
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,550
Recently my girlfriend dumped
me over a text message.

813
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,130
I swear to God if that if that existed
back in the day I would I would fucking

814
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,890
be lighting phones up if
that wasn't bad enough.

815
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,950
I got the text just as I was
walking into a movie with a buddy.

816
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,810
She told me straight that
she didn't love me anymore.

817
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,350
I took it like a man watched the movie
went home and cried like a bitch.

818
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,010
An honest guy. Two days later
I went to a party on a boat.

819
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:00,540
I spotted my now ex.
We made eye contact and she looked away.

820
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,690
So now I'm trapped on
a boat for four hours.

821
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,770
You didn't know that she was gonna
be there with a bunch of drunk cunts.

822
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,970
I don't want to be around and of course
her I made an attempt to ask her why the

823
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:15,750
fuck she had the balls to dump me face
to face but she ignored me totally.

824
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,550
She's young and immature.

825
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:22,320
I then saw her walk over to a guy
and start kissing him. Jesus Christ.

826
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,170
I commend you sir for not
throwing yourself in them.

827
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Also overboard a fucking double murder
slash suicide Bill I have no fucking idea

828
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:33,940
I didn't punch this cunt
but I decided not to.

829
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:38,890
I now wish I had punched
his stupid fucking face and
my question is what should

830
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:41,200
I have should I have done
something fucked now.

831
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,030
Why are you punching him.
He's doing what he's supposed to be doing.

832
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,330
He's supposed to be out there
trying to fucking a couple women.

833
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,070
All right. Any bad feeling you
have should be towards her.

834
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:54,970
But here's the thing dude.

835
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,440
You know in the long run she did you a
favor because she didn't love you okay.

836
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,330
And eventually she could have done that
while you had two kids with her and you

837
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:08,710
actually had to pay her fucking money.
She did you a favor all right.

838
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,080
Yeah.
Don't ever do that.

839
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:14,920
That's the dumbest shit ever when people
fucking date somebody and then they get

840
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:17,500
dumped and then they're
fucking dating somebody else.

841
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,410
I mean and then you go over and you
confront the other fucking party.

842
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,340
They're outside the circle.
You know so

843
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,870
what should he have done.
You should just been a fucking gentleman.

844
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,130
That's what you should've done.

845
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:36,660
You just be a fucking gentleman just
feel like you know evidently you know she

846
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:37,950
doesn't want to be with me anymore.

847
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,460
I mean dude I know this and I got dumped
I know fucking hard this is a one time.

848
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:47,860
I actually fucking was talking to somebody
hard on the table this woman dumped

849
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:53,000
me out of fucking nowhere and I'm in a
bar of course and I'm talking to a buddy

850
00:53:53,001 --> 00:53:54,110
of mine and.

851
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,970
The problem was he got dumped like 4
years earlier and he still wasn't over it

852
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:00,170
and he fucking hated women.

853
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:05,740
So this is one point my heart out to and
as you know I mean I thought everything

854
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:09,780
was going fine with the fight and I did
all that shit and he just goes hey you

855
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:13,320
know I don't know maybe she
want to fuck somebody else.

856
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,200
And I just said you know what.

857
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,710
I said you know fuck you I actually
flipped out like Fuck you you.

858
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,680
That has nothing to fucking do with this.

859
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:26,000
That has to do with that fucking shit
that fucking cunt you dated for fucking

860
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:26,630
years ago.

861
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,200
He is still not over and I've been having
a fucking carry you off the field like

862
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:34,400
Kellen Winslow after that fucking overtime
game for lack of every fucking bar

863
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:38,450
for less for you. You can't sit there.
He's like Do Alonso's egg of fuck off.

864
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,790
That's just part of a bad memory.

865
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,170
Actually did I say that.
That's what I said on the way home.

866
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,550
I think I said that on the way home.

867
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,910
I think I just said fuck you when I
walked out of the bar. That's right.

868
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,120
That's what happened. That's
how old I am. I'm so old.

869
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,990
My memories the fantasy that.

870
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,100
My memory is what I should have said.

871
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,610
I didn't say Fuck you and I walked down
as a guy and I just fuckin walked out.

872
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,320
One of the few times I didn't pay for my
round of beers I was just like Fuck you

873
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:20,730
walked out. Anyways she said Hope
you're well thanks and go fuck yourself.

874
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,450
Do you took it like a man.
What are you gonna do. And.

875
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:31,070
You know keep taking it like a man and
keep going home and private and cry it

876
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,390
out here. That's what women do. Fucking.

877
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:37,890
They cry it out of them and then they
can move on the fact that she dumped you

878
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:41,850
and then of course is immediately making
out with this guy is really suspect but

879
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:42,900
you never know with them.

880
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,813
You never know.

881
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,580
That could've just.
She could've just picked that guy.

882
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,200
Because you were there.
You have no fucking idea.

883
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,460
And here's the thing dude even if she
was already banging that fuckin douche

884
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,600
while making out with that douche
when she was with you then that's the.

885
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,670
That's who you were with. So
good fucking riddance. All right.

886
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:06,580
That's what you had.

887
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,530
You thought you drafted somebody in the
first round that didn't fucking work out.

888
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,870
And you know what that guy just picked
up her contract for you you know.

889
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,030
So now you've got all this cap space.

890
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:20,450
All right go crier out of
your fucking heart you know.

891
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,950
But don't go around hating women.
That's what I did. Big fucking mistake.

892
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,490
All that does is stop you from meeting
the fuckin sweetheart because you know

893
00:56:28,491 --> 00:56:31,580
who loves an angry woman
hater a fuckin psycho chick.

894
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,100
All right there you go.
All right.

895
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,750
Russian girlfriend a belly blue balls.

896
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,140
Hey man I was. Hey man I was wondering
if you could give me some advice.

897
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:47,470
I'm a 27 year old from New Zealand and
current resident and current Jesus and

898
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:52,980
current currently residing is what you
should say instead of current residing

899
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:56,450
here. Current resident
here current residing here.

900
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,180
Okay I've met and recently
started dating a girl from Russia.

901
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,380
We've been officially dating
for about five months now.

902
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,220
Everything is going great.

903
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,040
Never been happier if she ever
asked you to take a boat ride.

904
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,720
Don't get on the fuckin boat all right.

905
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,210
And I'm not talking about
because of the last thing.

906
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:17,020
All right this when you show up does a
couple of the shifty guys there and then

907
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:21,220
your identity gets stolen and we never
see you again. All right. She's hot.

908
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,750
Best in bed I've ever had
and I've had a lot haha.

909
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,830
Got a great personality and someone I
could see going further into the future

910
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:34,630
with. Okay well you're writing me so I
know the other shoe is going to drop.

911
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,080
The only issue is that our visa is about
to run out in a few months before she

912
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:41,140
moves back.

913
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,430
Unless we can she can
find a decent job here.

914
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,710
The only issue with that.

915
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,640
Is the job market over here for the
type of work she is after is very small.

916
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:55,930
A translator.

917
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,120
We've been checking the job sites and
whatnot over the past month with not much

918
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:01,954
luck.

919
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,860
So I've put up the idea of maybe heading
over to Russia and trying to start a

920
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:11,100
life over there. Oh no. Fuck no.

921
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,990
But that's a great way to see if she's
with you because she wants to be with you.

922
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:22,730
My qualification can take me anywhere
in the world but I'm still skeptical on

923
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,660
most I just uplift my whole life and move
to a country that doesn't really speak

924
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:31,850
much English apparently with my girlfriend
that I've only known for a few months

925
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,290
plus not knowing much Russia.
Yeah.

926
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,540
Plus you don't know how
that country fucking works.

927
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,040
All right. You have no idea how
that fucking country works dude.

928
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,870
You're talking like you're
dealing with the fuckin mob.

929
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,020
Hang on one second.
All right sorry.

930
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:57,060
I just realized I double booked myself
and a fucking Vegas somehow. Yeah.

931
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,620
Dude you have no idea what's
going on over there like.

932
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,370
That's a whole different
fucking animal over there.

933
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,820
That's a whole different government.
The level of influence that the mob has.

934
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,860
I mean that shit is fucking hardcore
over there. Russia is no joke.

935
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,080
What the fuck did you
say you were coming from.

936
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:18,120
You've gone from New Zealand to Russia.
You give the Guard name. Fuck that dude.

937
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:22,550
Fuck that.
Fuck that fuck that.

938
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:27,470
Get her a job interview they'll see
how beautiful she is and you know that.

939
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:32,040
You know do what you can fucking do.
To fuck that.

940
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,510
Fuck that.

941
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,720
Repeat fuck that. I mean I don't know
and I've been reading the rest of this.

942
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,230
Fuck that do not move from
fucking New Zealand to Russia.

943
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,480
Jesus fucking Christ.

944
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,650
Do not do that please don't do that.
OK.

945
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,020
I never beg in the podcast but I'm begging
you right now do not fucking do that.

946
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,450
Jesus.

947
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,420
You can go from the fuckin Garden of
Eden to that now you're the immigrant.

948
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,070
Now she's trying to get you a fucking job.

949
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:08,420
You know kind of money you're gonna
make over there. I'm gonna fuckin IDF.

950
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,240
Fuck that.
All right.

951
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,050
Soccer coach rips off
shirt after rejection.

952
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,550
Hey Billy dad SEC.

953
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:25,200
That was as original as
Billy bald eagle was.

954
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,770
Not that I saw this video and thought
it might interest you during a recent

955
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:35,550
soccer game an Argentinean player
accidentally knocks a player out from the

956
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:40,551
other team and ends up getting ejected
from the game as a result after he gets

957
01:00:40,651 --> 01:00:45,180
ejected the coach freaks out. Yeah I
watch the clip starts yelling at the refs.

958
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,350
Then he gets ejected.

959
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,040
So when he realizes that he's also ejected
he rips his shirt off only to reveal

960
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,130
he's an older guy too you know.
I don't know.

961
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:59,350
I can't tell older guys somewhere between
40 and 50 rips his shirt off only to

962
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:05,130
reveal that not only is this dude fucking
shredded but also his whole back is

963
01:01:05,221 --> 01:01:06,630
covered in tattoos.

964
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,550
Making him look like he spends his free
time going to bare knuckle brawling down

965
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:15,990
by the shipyard. Thanks for all the
laughs and go fuck yourself. Yeah.

966
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,130
I watched the clip of this.
This guy looks like.

967
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,410
This guy looks like he's
done some time in prison.

968
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:27,960
What's amazing is the rest of his body
that you can see he has no tattoos.

969
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,320
And then on the back it's just like I
don't know what the fuck he's got going on

970
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:36,150
but his entire back is covered
and it's all of those you know.

971
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,590
You know if he touch my family
I will fucking kill you.

972
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,910
It's those kinds of tattoos.

973
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,020
It's not the I was in a frat
and I got drunk one night and.

974
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,380
All right this is my old girlfriend's
name and we fucking turned it into a swan

975
01:01:49,381 --> 01:01:50,250
or whatever the fuck they do.

976
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,270
This is like hardcore you know this
guy is gonna punch you in the throat.

977
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,370
It's a great clip.
I really appreciate it.

978
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,110
And then make sure I did everything here.

979
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:06,090
Russian girlfriend Do not stay in
New Zealand. Birthday boat party.

980
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,990
Yep you got a lot of cap space. Good
for you. Making your own baby food.

981
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,190
Yes you know I'll I'll see
about that airline bumping a.

982
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,310
Agree to disagree but I like the fact
that you went out there and stuck up for

983
01:02:17,311 --> 01:02:21,450
the airlines and I think that
said it and all the things right.

984
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:26,970
Oh I didn't talk about the F1 race mother
fucker did you guys watch it have a

985

986
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:35,490
you if you were gonna watch a race the
Spanish Grand Prix was a great one.

987
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,460
Lewis Hamilton had the pole.
Sebastian Vettel

988
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,530
I think was yeah it was in the second
position and then Boris Karloff.

989
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:47,400
Well if I can't keep forgetting
his name fucking Lewis Hamilton's

990
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,620
driving make their his
fucking car caught on fire.

991
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:56,860
But the first guy the other guy drives
for Ferrari whatever fucking his whatever

992
01:02:56,861 --> 01:03:01,100
his name is Ricky Ricardo.
I can't remember. No.

993
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,960
Daniel Carl drives for Force India.

994
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,700
No he doesn't he drives for Red Bull.

995
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:10,890
Why don't I just fucking go on and look
up the goddamn names because most guys

996
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,650

don't know what you guys know as much as

997
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:17,040
I fucking know. So here's
what happened. All right.

998
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,380
The race starts and.

999
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:27,920
What's his face. Lewis Hamilton
as always gets a bad fuckin start.

1000
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,910
Sebastian Vettel goes around
a battle drives the Ferrari.

1001
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,190
Lewis Hamilton's with Mercedes Vettel
is out in front ramming fuckin points he

1002
01:03:37,191 --> 01:03:42,191
was ahead he was like 15 points ahead of
some shit and in the old days last year

1003
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:43,820
when I was on watch for a year.

1004
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,330
The old days which is Monaco of last
year when I started watching if you would

1005
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:52,530
if you went to the turn first everyone
got it got through the first turn first

1006
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:55,640
in first place drove in and clean air
that was it you won the fucking race

1007
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,890
unless you messed up a pit stop or you
your car shit the bed so he gets out in

1008
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:04,790
front
and then his jizz his buddy there.

1009
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:10,780
The other Ferrari guy gets knocked
out of the race OK and they fuck him.

1010
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:17,110
They cut to this kid in the stands
wearing this Ferrari thing where are the

1011
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:20,750
drivers why is it so difficult.
Drivers Here we go here we go.

1012
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:25,640
I should add this already to go I'm
sorry the bike slowing this the fuck down

1013
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:30,680
the Reagan and guy gets knocked right
out of the race and this little fucking

1014
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:35,360
kid they cut to him he's wearing all
Ferrari gear and he's just crying his eyes

1015
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:37,910
out and they're sitting
there going well like.

1016
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,390
Vettel still in first place.
Well he must have been a big

1017
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,300
Reagan fan over the fuck you say his
name and they shot him twice bawling his

1018
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,940
eyes out I could be the kid.
This little was that into racing.

1019
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:50,870
That was really cool.

1020
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:55,730
And later on the driver got knocked out
of the race Ferrari they actually they

1021
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:56,564
brought the kid in.

1022
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,690
He took a picture with them and everything
so it had been a good deal although

1023
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:02,340
he probably cried again when
Lewis Hamilton went around him.

1024
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:06,380
But anyways it was a great
race from front to back.

1025
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:11,890
These new fucking tires I guess I have
no idea why they got more gripped as more

1026
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:15,380
passing.
Lewis Hamilton past.

1027
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,950
Sebastian Vettel I think on like lap.

1028
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:23,420
Lanes like 20 laps to go which
never happened last year.

1029
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:26,280
The second place guy just could
never get around the first place.

1030
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,530
Guy once he was out there.

1031
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,980
I don't know.

1032
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,770
It was a great race and
then Lewis Hamilton for some
reason was like fucking out

1033
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:36,980
of breath when he was talking as I was
saying because they got the fatter tires

1034
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,610
they could pull more GS in like just
physically what the fuck they were going

1035
01:05:40,611 --> 01:05:44,130
through. And Lewis Hamilton
didn't have any drinks on board.

1036
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,650
I didn't know they had drinks on board.

1037
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:49,840
I'd never even dawned on me but he didn't
want to add any more weight to his car

1038
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,100
so he lost like four and a half pounds.

1039
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:53,023
So there you go.

1040
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,990
You know that actually you know this
people out here in Hollywood that have

1041
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:01,991
enough money now that the day before they
have to go to like a red carpet event

1042
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,770
they're gonna fucking you know
drive around in a fuckin race car.

1043
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,150
For three hours so they can drop that
final fucking four and a half pounds I'm

1044
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:15,170
telling you it's gonna happen.
So I believe the next next races in Monaco

1045
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:20,240
I don't know I'm enjoying watching it
now has got me all self-conscious about

1046
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:23,870
talking about it now. When I blame her
then I wasn't prepared to talk about it.

1047
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,950
Was there anything else.
I made my little list here.

1048
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,460
Those you nerds always wanted
do you read the whole thing.

1049
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,690
Pretty much pretty much.

1050
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,800
But I make like a setlist a shit and
want to talk to if I can fucking find it.

1051
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:41,240
How is it
I give up.

1052
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,120
I FUCKING GIVE UP WITH THIS SHIT.
WHAT DID I have on you.

1053
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,160
I don't know what that is.

1054
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,510
We'll close this window. This is the most
anticlimactic ending to a podcast ever.

1055
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,373
All right.

1056
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,280
I said predators Lewis and Hamilton.
Sebastian Vettel.

1057
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,500
Daniel Ricardo first time he
was on a podium this year.

1058
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:03,470
Oh he had to give a shout out to force
India still rock in the future whatever

1059
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:07,670
colour that is.
I think that was it.

1060
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:12,290
Oh happy Mother's Day belated Mother's
Day to all the mothers out there at a

1061
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:13,520
great time went to brunch.

1062
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,100
Yep that's where I am
right now went to brunch.

1063
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:20,810
My parents came out met their
granddaughter there over
there over the moon love

1064
01:07:20,811 --> 01:07:25,811
and she was so cute and was just didn't
cried all the whole meal and then she

1065
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:28,340
got in the car and then that was it.

1066
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:32,330
She friggin had it and was
just crying up a storm.

1067
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,080
And but it was it we ended up having a
great day and it came home and I was like

1068
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,770
it was crazy you know I've just
finally entered this part of my life.

1069
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,770
You know my parents are older.
I got a little one.

1070
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:47,370
I made brunch and I have
no say in the matter.

1071
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,430
And you know what it feels good.

1072
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,840
I had a great time.

1073
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,360
You know we had all kinds of family and
a big crew seven or eight people and we

1074
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:00,390
went to this fucking insane
brunch and everybody threw down

1075
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,400
and had like 3000 calories each.

1076
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:08,010
Great conversation great people
it's just it was awesome.

1077
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,930
What kinds of pictures
and that type of shit.

1078
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:15,750
And other than the fact that I forgot my
fuckin wallet because I decided to wear

1079
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:18,750
a suit and I was going to be the big
shot picking up the fucking cheque and I

1080
01:08:18,751 --> 01:08:19,980
had to go to my parents.

1081
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:24,330
So now now you know when a few days I
take it to the airport I gotta give him

1082
01:08:24,331 --> 01:08:27,600
the fucking money back. But OK. It
was embarrassing really embarrassing.

1083
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,430
So anyways that was my mother's day.
Go fuck yourselves.

1084
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:37,820
I will check in on you on
Thursday and let's go predators.

1085
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:43,240
And I don't know. I mean I've got
a bunch of friends I you know what.

1086
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,940
In Pittsburgh I'm just rooting for extra
hockey at this point Alpo series goes

1087
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,070
seven games. I want to be this
little fuckin country Gargoyle.

1088
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:53,730
Shitting on the ducks.
I don't want to fucking do that.

1089
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:57,300
You know why why do I gotta bring out
the predators success and then shit on

1090
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:58,300
Canadiens fans.

1091
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,590
You know all their pocket squares are
all soaking wet from them blowing their

1092
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:05,670
noses and crying about losing to the
Rangers. I don't need to do that.

1093
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,980
Not to mention I have no bragging rights.

1094
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:12,650
My team that fuckin bounced out you know
I'm going to try to be I'm afraid of

1095
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,040
Cutlass for the rest of the Stanley
Cup playoffs. How about that sceptics.

1096
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:20,500
First the Wiz. Ease on down
Ease on down the road tomorrow.

1097
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,680
My brain says it could go either way
but my heart says there's no fucking way

1098
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:32,650
there's no way they come in to the
garden even though it's not the garden.

1099
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,510
It's the Fleet Center.

1100
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,340
At the garden.

1101
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:41,340
Fuckin slash whatever fucking Gossett
Junior whatever other fuckin tags they

1102
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:44,980
have for that thing and I
just don't see them doing it.

1103
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,900
I feel like you know what it is.
The sceptics.

1104
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:52,450
They got that sound in their crowd the
same way the Yank old Yankee Stadium had

1105
01:09:52,451 --> 01:09:57,451
it you know knowledgeable fans with a
history of success and that can push your

1106
01:09:59,831 --> 01:10:02,890
team to fucking when I think they're
going to do it all by the way.

1107
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,320
Derek Jeter huh.
I missed it.

1108
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:08,700
I was at brunch I missed it but
that's what a fucking class act ran.

1109
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,450
He's such a class act.

1110
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,090
He can go into New York and
wing a speech and still kill it.

1111
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:17,300
That's it man.

1112
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,680
There are a single numbers

1113
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:25,550
see if I can do it Billy Martin number
one. Number two Derek Jeter number three.

1114
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,930
Babe Ruth. Number four I was
fucked this up. That's Garrett.

1115
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:33,200
5 is DiMaggio and six I looked up today
because that's the one I always forgot

1116
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,090
but they said it was Joe Torrey but
I thought somebody else had sex.

1117
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:45,170
Sevens Mickey Mantle number eight is
fucking Yogi Bear and somebody else 9 is

1118
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:51,231
Roger Maris 10 is Chris
Chambliss 11 is Gary Sheffield.

1119
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,980
I don't know the rest of
them 13 months since 15

1120
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:02,520
last I remember Reggie Jackson
the owner retires there was 44

1121
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:09,850
Bo Diaz with somebody when you were 30
I don't fucking know.

1122
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:10,470
All right that's it.

1123
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:15,470
That's the podcast I will I will check
in on you Thursday and God bless all the

1124
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:17,570
mothers out there

1125
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,000
who work with the family back east.

1126
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:22,580
All right I'm done.
