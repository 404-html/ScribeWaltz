1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:01,621
Hey,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:06,600
what's going on is bill burn his time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday?

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,150
Uh,
May 28th,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,800
may 28 2018 what's going on?
How are,

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,620
Ooh,

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,580
oh, sorry. I just had to cry it out of me.

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,740
Well, the motorcycle. Oh, Jesus.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,253
Ah,

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,680
if only kids knew how to
play basketball these days,

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,910
and I'm actually talking about
the Cavaliers and the Celtics.

11
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:51,930
If we just played basketball in the end,
if we just played basketball,

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,470
we actually could have, why didn't think
we'd win? Won Two games of that series.

13
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:59,580
I was just like the Barn James is
Lebron James. If we just fucking played,

14
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:03,270
but I didn't see one pick and roll that
whole fucking game. Maybe I missed it.

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,580
Mean I was having a couple as I
was sitting there just watching it.

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,950
It's game seven, you know, stressing out
ahead. I had to take the edge off the,

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,490
you know, I was talking to a
buddy of mine. I swear to God,

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,960
if you take a fucking three pointer
with nobody underneath and you miss that

19
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:25,910
should be in the stat sheet as a turnover.
That's all I'm going to say.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,950
Jesus Christ.

21
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:33,760
Okay.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,810
This is what happens when everybody in
the league is a fucking one and done guy.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,910
You know, they never took
a physics class or I dunno,

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,620
ever fucking had a ruler
and fucking measured.

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,510
Okay

26
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,930
Dude, we would, there was like six minutes
left. We're like down by, I don't know,

27
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:51,880
four, five, six, seven points.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,060
We just start taking threes every
time we go down the court. Like,

29
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,070
like there was like five seconds left.

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,840
Like the crowd was counting down.
I don't know.

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,440
Having said that, I got to tell
you right now, Lebron James

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,581
in my mind,

33
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:12,840
Leapfrog Koby Bryant taking
that team to the NBA finals.

34
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,643
MMM.

35
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,880
I just, I just think Colby would have
been too far. He just didn't have the,

36
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,250
he just didn't have that thing.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,980
He would just look at
everybody on the bench,

38
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,830
like the bumps they were and be like,
what the fuck?

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,100
And would just walk into the
front office and be like,

40
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm not playing with this shit.

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,010
Get me better guys or I'm fucking leaving.
That's, that's how he got his title.

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,190
He was also a beast. You
know, I'm, I'm a Celtics fan,

43
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,860
so I always have to shit on him a
little bit. You know what I mean?

44
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,870
Yeah.

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,640
It's your me or shack. Um, the Black Mama,

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,650
he's ice cold. Except when he was
crying in the front office. Jesus belt.

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,710
Can you stay on topic? Sorry. This
has nothing to do with Bryan East.

48
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,480
One of the greatest players of
all fucking time. All right.

49
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,330
I'm just a fucking butt hurts Celtics
fan right now. Who's team way over a,

50
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,080
so I said I should be
happy. Um, but Lebron James,

51
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:15,730
what the fuck that guy
did? Jesus Christ. Um,

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,920
unbelievable. Speechless. I died. I
don't know. I don't know what to say.

53
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,540
And uh, from what I've heard, the
warriors are a little banged up.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,510
They got that game seven tonight.
Uh, so I mean, I guess, you know, as,

55
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,590
as a fan of basketball
and more importantly,

56
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,610
competition,

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,730
I have to root for the Cavaliers
or the Houston Rockets. I mean,

58
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:46,210
do you just, you can't root for, uh,

59
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,510
a pile on team unless they're
playing another pile on team.

60
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,750
Isn't that how it works? And
admittedly, the Celtics had one in 2008.

61
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:53,990
Okay.

62
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,760
I didn't watch that team the whole year.
You know,

63
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,030
I watched during the playoffs
and we played the Lakers
and I was like, all right,

64
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,980
I'll pile on t verse your pile on team,

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,940
whatever. I'll do it. Um,
but I, congratulations.

66
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:11,320
Congratulations to the Cleveland
Cavaliers. Bron shapes.

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,210
Without a doubt. I mean, you gotta I
mean, I would put that guy like, I dunno,

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,060
it's hard. It's hard when you start
talking to Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell,

69
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,410
and I don't know where the fuck he is,
but he's passed Koby and the modern era.

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,280
I'd have to say that it's
him and Jordan and a,

71
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:31,510
I know a lot of your young kids right
now who didn't watch Michael Jordan. Uh,

72
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,411
you know,

73
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:35,140
you go back and you'd go into Youtube
when you watch his highlights and that

74
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,470
type of that guy,
he literally changed the game.

75
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,470
Um, I can't, I can't stress that enough.

76
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:49,090
Like the game changed. He didn't
dominate the game the way Colby did.

77
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:52,060
He literally changed it like, Oh, I
didn't know you could fucking do that.

78
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,050
I had no idea you could do that. My only
knock against the Bronch, James is what?

79
00:04:56,051 --> 00:05:00,700
He fucking block that shot and then just
stood there, basking in his own amazing,

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,650
amazing amazingness or whatever.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,070
And then the announcer Jackson goes every
once in a while I said something like,

82
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,350
every once in a while you make a play.
That's so unbelievable.

83
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,060
You have to stand there and admire it.

84
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,050
And I was sitting there like the
oldest old man ever go and like that,

85
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,370
that Yolo fucking, Yo, I
can't even believe how,

86
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,410
I can't even believe how amazing I am.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,690
The fuck down the court,
you know,

88
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,780
you can't really say to help out your
teammates. He had a ball in his back,

89
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:31,360
but just what the fuck
was he doing back there?

90
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,480
Standing there for like 20 minutes like,

91
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:36,850
do you understand what
that dumb look on his face?

92
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,830
Like he just stopped a Scud missile.
You blocked his shot.

93
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,910
I Dunno, I am officially,
this is how old I am.

94
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,800
Okay.

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
This is how I was actually watching old
school TV shows and like I turn 50 next

96
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,650
as much as it's fucking with me,

97
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,780
I wouldn't change what I was born
to live now as a younger person.

98
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,330
And I'm for the simple
reason that when I was a kid,

99
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,940
this is what a theme song
sounded like on a TV show.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,260
Sounds like a fucking porno.

101
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,700
All people playing that come on,
get to the fucking horns,

102
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,170
a nice big blue, white, whatever. You
knew somebody was getting fucked up

103
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,290
and those were all fucking people.

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,300
You know something after
they played that theme song,

105
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:51,590
they didn't stand in the studio admiring
and what the fuck they just did.

106
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,250
Other than that, I love Lebron James. I
do. I'm just breaking his fucking boss.

107
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,300
And I also love the city of Cleveland. And
I even still loved the city, Cleveland,

108
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,420
even after about five or
6,000 Cleveland Cavalier fans.

109
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,401
What APP?

110
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:10,401
Me sending me fucking all kinds
of shit over social media like,

111
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,600
like they weren't, they didn't have a
Cleveland steamer in their fucking pants.

112
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,700
Whatever the fuck. I hate
those stupid jokes, by the way.

113
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,500
You know what a dirty stage edges. No, I
doubt and yet keep the job to yourself.

114
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,690
It's all the same fucking egg.

115
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:27,390
When you stick your Dick in his shit
and you shove it up her nose and you go,

116
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:29,970
God bless you,
but you say it in Spanish.

117
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,530
It was water, bubbler, jokes.

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,750
Those are all jokes for people who
don't not to make a move. Right.

119
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,050
Did you stand there?
This one's cool.

120
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,260
Would you stick your dick
and you fucking polar comm?

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,540
Um Oh, that gives me do shells. I hate,
I always fucking hated those jokes.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,250
Anyways.
Oh my God.

123
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:57,820
We used to trash Patrice when he
used to do those jokes on stage.

124
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,870
We still have Trisha doing street
jokes. You're doing street jokes. Um,

125
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,120
anyways, uh, I'm all over the
fucking map here. Sorry man.

126
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:13,030
I'm shaking off a game. Seven loss. Um,

127
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,870
I was just psyched that we got
to these two conference finals.

128
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,920
Then all of a sudden it's like,
Holy Shit,

129
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,140
we could actually win this fucking thing.
Then I'm like,

130
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,610
and if the warriors lose to the rocket,
so who gives a fuck about the rockets?

131
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,550
We always beat the rockets in the file.
We beat him in [inaudible] 81 and 86. Um,

132
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,220
we're going to have the TRIFECTA.
I, oh, Billy started dreaming

133
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,423
anyways,

134
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,020
so it was Cleveland Flint fans who
were talking all this crazy shit.

135
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,640
All right. Yeah. You're lying to
yourself if you forgot about that.

136
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:49,090
Jason Tatum Dunk on Lebron James.
Okay.

137
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,870
That right there is what's known
as the changing of the guard. Okay.

138
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,750
That was like the first time Shaq
having problems with his big toe.

139
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,360
Like that's the beginning of the end.
Okay.

140
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:03,140
And a new chapters coming
in and it's dressed in green
and white. All right. See,

141
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,180
but this one fucking guy,
I trashed them on Twitter.

142
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,770
He gave me some shit and he had
his stupid Cavaliers Jersey,

143
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,570
you know, and has had on, you know, with
this game seven look at his face. I said,

144
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:15,730
but he was wearing his seatbelt.

145
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,673
Okay.

146
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,563
I Dunno.

147
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,900
Some Cleveland plans when they look up
on the rafters and they start counting

148
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:29,670
banners, they forget that an
eastern conference championship
is not an NBA title.

149
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,550
Alright. And a division title
banner is, is literally,

150
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,630
that's like up. Like that's something you
give to a millennial. Like, all right,

151
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,140
you did something.
Um,

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
I don't know what else we got like
five people gave me shit. Why am,

153
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:48,960
why am I doing this right now? Why
am I being so childish? Oh God,

154
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:53,100
we were right fucking there. We
were right there. Um, anyways,

155
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,090
and I'm not gonna do that dumb shit of
like boom, cause so and so was there.

156
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,750
Your won fair and square. Everybody
gets heard. Lebron's heard, right?

157
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,980
You've probably all fucked up
carrying those people. Anyways,

158
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,150
congratulations.

159
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,690
That really didn't sound like a
congratulatory fucking 10 minutes here,

160
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,020
but that's, that's what I was trying to
get to. Congratulations to Cleveland.

161
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,460
All right. Even like eagles fans started
giving me shit. It's just like, dude,

162
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,080
are you fucking serious right now?
Good Lord.

163
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,890
And if Philadelphia, when did Philly
ever start talking shit about sports?

164
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,050
This is what I want all of you guys to do.

165
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
What is the championship combination
to open your city county championships?

166
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,910
Ours is five six eight 17 ah,

167
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,330
that unlocks to safe and all the rigs
pour out. What happens in Philly?

168
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,490
Philly is two, two, three one.

169
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:00,490
Okay,

170
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,380
go fuck yourselves. You fucking green.
Cons. You hang around long enough.

171
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,630
You're going to fucking win one.
That was another one.

172
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:11,440
This guy was giving me shit on the
Celtics won like 11 championships and four

173
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:14,230
there was anybody. It's like, all
right, well since then we won six.

174
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,700
Stop talking about the Cavaliers.
Like they were an expansion team.

175
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:21,550
They bet in the league
for almost 50 seasons.

176
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,420
Fucking Miami Heat showed up in 88.
I think they want more than the Celtics.

177
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,980
Well they went one did they
been for they want four.

178
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,110
Um, I dunno. Why am I
trashing cities? I don't,

179
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,930
I don't want to try. I don't give
a fuck about Philly. I like Philly.

180
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,510
I like Cleveland. I like all of this
shit. I'm just fucking, you know,

181
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:44,770
it still stinks that I lost.
I suck. I said, I wish,

182
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,580
I don't even fucking hate the
Yankees anymore. You can't hate them.

183
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:51,730
They're all basically they added one free
agent. Other than that, it's whole team.

184
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,190
It's just a,

185
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,240
I think I hate the Lakers to the
most just because I live out here,

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,833
you know?

187
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,250
I'd say that was, yeah, probably cause,

188
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:07,010
cause I live out here and then
Canadian fans, but they just, you know,

189
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,150
chasing their own fucking tails so they
don't even matter anymore. I don't know.

190
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:14,270
I guess not. I guess I'm just not
mad anymore. I mean, I'm still mad,

191
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:19,190
but I guess it probably is
childhood issues. Wow. Well,

192
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:22,970
why the fuck do I even watch sports?
All right guys.

193
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,670
I'm going to end this podcast and I just
had an epiphany. None of this matters.

194
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,370
Um, and he wasn't fucking with
you. God Damn it. Oh God. Oh,

195
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:34,290
what game seven state game. Seven
loss stinks. It really stinks.

196
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:38,510
Jesus fucking Christ.
Um,

197
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm not gonna lie to you. I mean, I,
I haven't watched the, and so long.

198
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:46,080
I know I watched the Celtics like
all last season I watched him and uh,

199
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:46,950
I just,

200
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,950
I just cannot get over running down the
court and just fucking stopping and you

201
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,570
have to,
your teammates haven't even settled it.

202
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:57,510
Just pull it up and taken it three
and just now getting yanked out of the

203
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,344
fucking game.

204
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,830
The only thing that makes that okay
as the other teams are doing it too,

205
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,500
it's like watching this high
skilled like game at the YMC,

206
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,320
you know, there's no plays. Everybody
just met each other, you know,

207
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:15,160
you just fucking yacht. They're
trying to burn calories. Um,

208
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,840
alright bill, let it go. Okay,
I'll let it go. I'll let it go.

209
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,810
How bad ass is that fucking theme song?

210
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,240
It's from the streets of
San Francisco by the way.

211
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,710
I've been trying to find the original one,

212
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:29,370
but I went best I can find is the
Henry Man sees man Sini version of it.

213
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,120
That was the heyday

214
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,680
of the white cop chasing the
minority actor down the street.

215
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:44,250
And the only role that he was going
to get that decade, you know, um,

216
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,171
they should,

217
00:13:46,171 --> 00:13:49,530
they should go back and they should do
a documentary on all those fucking guys,

218
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,170
you know,
like who has the record?

219
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,520
Like what black actor in the 70s had
the record for the most times he did a

220
00:13:56,521 --> 00:14:00,540
scene where he was running down an alley,
being chased by the cops. You know,

221
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,150
when you get to the fence,
that's the scene I always wanted to do.

222
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,510
You get to the chain link
fence, you get like, you know,

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,900
a couple of rungs up and then they
grab you back. You're like, Nah,

224
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,280
they fucking drag you off
when you go and freckles.

225
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,830
Huh? You know, hurry is something.
Sorry man. I'm just not going nowhere.

226
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,280
Um, anyways, congratulations. And
other congratulations. I'm just,

227
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm just being, this is me
in a very generous, thankful
mood. It's Memorial Day,

228
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:38,040
right? Thank in the troops, the people
that made the ultimate sacrifice,

229
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,863
you know,

230
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,440
it's a bit of a drop off to thank a
fucking professional basketball team after

231
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:45,270
you thank the troops. But, uh, you know,

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,600
congratulations to Daniel
Ricardo winning his first race,

233
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:54,790
a Formula One race in Monaco.
How about that?

234
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,610
That's the race I want to go to.

235
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,250
And it's probably the most
boring f one race cars.

236
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:03,430
That race is all about qualifying.
That's the race.

237
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,730
Whoever fucking wins DePaul position.
I mean,

238
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:10,180
they're racing in those little ass
fucking street. You know what I mean?

239
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,110
You know why those streets,
it's so small over there.

240
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:17,460
It's not because the city is so old
and used to just ride a horse down.

241
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,910
It's because that's a sovereign city
and that's the Illuminati money.

242
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,830
And they liked the bitches skinny.
They're like, I'm young and thin. Okay.

243
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:28,630
So that's,
that's their locked the door test.

244
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:33,280
If they can walk down the street without
the hips touching either building, uh,

245
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,460
then they'll have their
current wife, uh, disposed of.

246
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,300
I think that's what they do.
And then they stay young.

247
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,480
Evidently somebody sent me
this fucking thing in here.

248
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,890
I think this is how they stay young.

249
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,810
Somebody wrote to me said for
skin injections, the old bill,

250
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:53,770
what gives in Hollywood?
Uh,

251
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,800
my girlfriend show showed me a video
of an actress on Ellen talking about

252
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,980
injecting for skin cells.
Imported from Korea.

253
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,820
Korean circumcisions.
Sorry.

254
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,620
Into her face to look young.
Get out of their bill.

255
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,010
We can't have you injecting dick
skin into your face for roles.

256
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,890
The fuck's going on?
Um,

257
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,070
what do you mean what
the fuck is going on?

258
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,840
We are the leaders of how to
stay young out here in Hollywood.

259
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,100
Okay. What do you, what do you
think you'll Rogaine came from?

260
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:35,190
What do you think you're at? Your Grecian
formula is going to come from. Huh?

261
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,900
What do you think all your workouts
come from? They come from Hollywood.

262
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,600
All your fad diets. That's us. Okay.

263
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,590
We came up with all of that. You know why?
Cause you consider always trashing us.

264
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,480
You hold us to a higher standard.
Okay?

265
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:57,400
You look to us to see what
the future of vanity is.

266
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,960
You look to us to make it okay.
Okay.

267
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:05,570
Potok started out here. Now look
at, it's all over the country.

268
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,600
You're all fucking doing it. All
these real fucking housewives, Huh?

269
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,100
He all made fun of us and now look at you.
Oh he all on steroids.

270
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,570
You get in the fucking good hair plugs
because people out here in Hollywood,

271
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:22,010
you know had the decency to stick
those ant legs into their fucking heads

272
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,550
to let these doctors make mistakes with
their own face until it becomes safe

273
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:32,030
enough that you could sneak into some
fucking back alley and get the same

274
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:36,170
procedure done to you when you start
getting your man tits. All right sir.

275
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,990
How dare you make fun of Hollywood.

276
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,980
Thanks to our self involvement.

277
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:46,520
You'll be able to wear a tank top welling
to your sixties you're welcome sir.

278
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,510
I mean,
I dunno who's more fucking arrogant.

279
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Cleveland Cavalier fans talking shit like
they own the NBA when all they ever do

280
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,840
is show up in the finals to
be the Washington generals.

281
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,190
Whoever the fuck they
sift that one you when they want.

282
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,993
Um

283
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,273
Huh.

284
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,290
Or you regular fucking people who sit
there and go on these fucking celebrities.

285
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:18,070
They need to be taken down a peg
and Yada Yada. Yad At fucking Yada.

286
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,660
Let me tell you something there.

287
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,250
Grill master you have to their foreman
grill or whatever type of fucking cookery

288
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:25,720
you have and your God damn kitchen.

289
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,103
Huh?

290
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,070
With your little fucking makeover
and you sad little fucking house,

291
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:34,901
you know?

292
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:38,920
And then you turn on the TV to see what
a dream looks like and who's standing

293
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:41,980
there?
Me and my bald fucking head.

294
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,200
Okay.

295
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,390
By the way, I'm not gonna lie to
you guys for my 50th birthday.

296
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,800
I think I'm going to give myself
hair plugs. I think I've earned them.

297
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,320
Okay. I'd like to brush
my teeth, you know,

298
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,360
and not stare at the sink.
Okay.

299
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:03,361
I would like to look up and see
something that I like and you know,

300
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,430
I just want to live my truth.

301
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:07,980
Okay.

302
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,410
You know, that's all that
I'm doing. And Hey, you know,

303
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:14,670
if hair plugs are going to make me
feel better than I say, I should do it.

304
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,690
And you know something,

305
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,170
I think it's time that I gave myself
permission to look sexy again.

306
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,783
Um,

307
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,230
why in the fuck would you ever

308
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,293
like,

309
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,330
I could see if she, if she had
American for skin cells. All right.

310
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,871
But like,

311
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:42,580
why would you get for skin cells imported
from a country that we're really not

312
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,510
getting along with? At least
not half of it. You know,

313
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,810
why don't you just get your botox from
China? It's probably where it's from.

314
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,750
Right? Said made from China, said um,

315
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,500
yeah,
people are out of their fucking minds.

316
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,513
MMM.

317
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,120
I am doing my damnedest to stay in shape,

318
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:05,330
but I am going to age fucking naturally.
That's it. You know what I mean?

319
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,020
Other than the I got a varicose
vein in my left leg, you know,

320
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,980
it looks like a God damn roadmap
to fucking Albuquerque. You know,

321
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:16,670
I might get that taken out at some point.
I keep meaning to get around to it,

322
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:21,350
but I never wear shorts, you know,
cause I respect people, you know,

323
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,260
all these fatties out there wearing
half shirts acting like they're brave.

324
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,830
You're not, you discussed it and
everybody should point at you.

325
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:31,550
Like we're in the invasion
of the body snatchers. Okay.
I don't care that you fat,

326
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:34,100
but you know, you put on put on a whole
shirt and maybe it is a whole shirt.

327
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,610
Maybe you just ate so much that now
we can see your belly again. You know,

328
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,470
like you ever see a woman with big tits
were and a half shirt and then when you

329
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:45,890
turn around to look at her it, it goes
all the way down to her ass in the back.

330
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,400
And it's like, oh, that's not a
half shirt. She just has giant tits.

331
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,890
She can't help it. She can't
help it. It's not her fault.

332
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,000
Um, anyways, uh,

333
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,620
I took my daughter, we went out
for a walk today and we went up,

334
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,980
we went on a hike and uh,
you know,

335
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,740
I was pushing the stroller the
whole way up. What a great workout.

336
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,790
And you go up the fucking hills
pushing a stroller, you know,

337
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,380
figure that's an extra 25 pounds
right there. Just pushing it away,

338
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,240
pushing it up the Goddamn Hill.

339
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,740
I saw this guy hiking with his daughter
and his son is, it got a little older.

340
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,290
I thought it was really cool. It was
like, man, I'd love to do that someday.

341
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,950
You know? Although his son was still
wearing his pajamas, I was just like,

342
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:32,410
come on man. You got to tell him, put his
clothes on. But then I was thinking like,

343
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:36,120
Dang, I leave my favorite pajamas and I
would've came to ah, right. All right.

344
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,690
All right son.

345
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,630
Now I wouldn't and I'd be like, all
right, well you wear them in the house.

346
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,290
Oh, whoa. Where am I? All right
then we're not going hiking.

347
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,290
Well, join the club, join the club.

348
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,630
Um, I, I really don't even know what
the Fuck I've been talking about it.

349
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,920
I'm just trying to fill up time here.
That's all I do here in this podcast.

350
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,580
If you new to it,
I'll tell you right now,

351
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:12,000
I've never been so offended in my life
that someone actually has the audacity to

352
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:15,300
make fun of the vanity of
Hollywood and the Boston Celtics

353
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,030
from two of the most simple combination
championship combination cities ever.

354
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,240
What is Cleveland? Cleveland
is zero. The Indians.

355
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:30,600
One in 48. I'll throw another one in
there. Let me, they, they'd fucking woman.

356
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,300
It's like, they're like zero one, two.

357
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,840
You know when it comes to championships,

358
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,960
I swear to God there should be a Fisher
price tag hanging off the ones in

359
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:45,470
Cleveland and saying your children,
when it comes to success out pill,

360
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,760
why would she go back into that bucket
or hate? Cause it's Gig. It's fine.

361
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,150
I must use the line from
bread. Darn. It keeps me warm.

362
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,240
All that heat is going to burn you up.
Keeps me warm.

363
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,390
Powers booth was it powers but
was power powers booth in that?

364
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,600
Um,
what a fucking name I powers booth.

365
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,150
You guys see Morgan Freeman
gotten a little bit of trouble
this week. I, you know,

366
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,100
nobody said how fucking cool it is than
an 80 year old guy could still fuck.

367
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,500
You know what I mean?
I mean,

368
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,080
why can't we look at the bright side
of sexual harassment in a plus? He's a,

369
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:24,240
he's 80. I mean what, what do you
think he's going to do? I mean,

370
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,340
you stop listening to music a couple of
years after high school. You get married,

371
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,030
you have a kid,
you don't know what the fuck's going on.

372
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,300
This guy doesn't know what's going on.
Wait,

373
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:35,250
what are you gonna do next to make
fun of the playlist on his flip phone?

374
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,440
He's in his fucking eighties
Oh my God.

375
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,910
I was so afraid.

376
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,810
I was so afraid when that guy
pushing a hundred that clip

377
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,130
where he was saying,
I wish I was there.

378
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:54,060
I thought he was making
fun of Michael Caine going,

379
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:56,370
I wish I was there when you stuck
your foot in your mouth saying,

380
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:59,880
are you pregnant? And the woman wasn't.
That's how I took it. I have no idea,

381
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,110
but what would I know?

382
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,780
What would I know about male
and female relationships? Okay,

383
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:10,440
what the fuck would I know? What was
I looking up again? Okay. CLEVELAND,

384
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,960
the Cleveland Indians.

385
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:17,100
This is such a country thing to do after
they just had success to talk about

386
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,960
their entire pastures,
but this is all I got.

387
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,270
This is what she listened to me is a sad,

388
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:25,380
pathetic man taking swings at people
who are no longer in the room.

389
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,300
They've moved on Cleveland Indians.
I want to, I want to coin that.

390
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:34,500
What is the, what is your, your your
combination what? Cleveland Indians.

391
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:39,501
World series [inaudible] chips and I put
it plural out of respect world series

392
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,370
titles too.

393
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,640
So they got two world series one NBA
zero Superbowls and we'll give them the

394
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:54,150
fucking Columbus blue jackets
with zero Stanley cups.

395
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:59,151
So the combination to
Cleveland is zero zero one two.

396
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,550
All right. Do you understand stand we've
one more super bowls. Then you have,

397
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,110
why am I doing this?
This is so checked because it's fun.

398
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,380
I'm not doing it to all Cleveland.
I'm just doing it to the fucking,

399
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,390
how do you only went to Superbowl?

400
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,390
I mean two world series and you
have like 58 retired numbers.

401
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,790
What'd you retire the numbers for?
For,

402
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,650
for having a fucking jumping
on the grenade and joining
that franchise. Oh, Bell.

403
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,630
I liked the Cleveland Indians.

404
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,250
You don't really as I kind of just had
a great weekend and I don't really have

405
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:35,460
anything to talk about. Uh Oh by the
way, did anybody see the highlight? I, I,

406
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,310
I, I don't know what I did. I tried
to favorite that thing on, on uh,

407
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,690
my Instagram page, which by
the way, I, I suck at it. Like,

408
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:47,060
I'm not making these stupid
videos go like, hey man,

409
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:49,220
I'm in the grocery store to
fucks up with cantaloupe.

410
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,920
Check me out at the San Jose Improv.

411
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,670
Okay.

412
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,320
Did you see that fucking Guy Moto GP race?
Where that fucking guy,

413
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,650
I can't even describe what a,
he basically he's stick,

414
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,070
they're all coming around the corner
were all two inches from each other.

415
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,390
One guy wipes out.

416
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,493
Okay.

417
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,690
Okay. And his bike lands
perpendicular to the guy behind him.

418
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,843
All right.

419
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,850
And the guy just hits the
gas and drives up over it.

420
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,980
Like a fucking stud man.

421
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,980
Yeah,

422
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,660
he's going a hundred and
something miles an hour.

423
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,990
He goes flying through the fucking air
and then lands on gravel and somehow

424
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:37,170
saves it. It doesn't go down and
continues on. Oh, and by the way,

425
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:39,090
like his airbag popped.

426
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,920
I don't know if you've ever seen
those guys when they get off.

427
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:43,630
The bikes were after they wipe
out their arms looking weird.

428
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,790
Like then like there were these weird,

429
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,860
you know when somebody gets knocked
out in their arms kind of go,

430
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,810
oh they kind of stick out. They
do that a little bit. And I, I'm,

431
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm guessing that's because the airbag
popped and they can't bring their arms

432
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:58,000
back down. This guy's airbag popped,
making them less aerodynamic.

433
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:03,001
He continued to ride the race and
he's just fucking bad ass bad ass.

434
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,061
You know what I miss?

435
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:07,930
I miss the fucking Indy 500 after
interviewing Danica Patrick,

436
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,480
who by the way was so fucking bad ass.
And um,

437
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,020
I think it's really cool that
she's retiring, you know,

438
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,640
retire while you still have some
years left, you know, it doesn't look,

439
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:26,230
uh, you know, you don't want to limp out
of the league. Like fucking, you know,

440
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:29,050
Brett Farve, you know? Yeah. I don't
really think of those last few years,

441
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:31,840
but it's just like, dude, you're
in there, you're a hall of fame.

442
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,300
You one of the greatest
ever. What are you doing? Um,

443
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,220
you want to get out before then?
Um,

444
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,550
and then she also had like a vineyard
or something like that. It's really a,

445
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,350
that's the way to do it. That's the
way to get out of show Biz. You know,

446
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,420
I think the smothers brothers did that.

447
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:50,730
Okay.

448
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,280
Like didn't even announced their
retirement. They, from what I heard,

449
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:57,030
I was working in Vegas. They did
their last show at the Orleans casino.

450
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,550
Didn't say it was the last show.
Just said thank you.

451
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:03,900
Good night and just fucking
went retired to the vineyard.

452
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,220
How fucking bad. I mean
that is, that's that's it.

453
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,880
Like with Jordan hit
that last shot as a bowl.

454
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,630
Smothered brothers didn't come back
to play for the fucking wizards.

455
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,710
Um,
all right,

456
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,090
so Celtics lost a game seven and I
am in the last days of my forties.

457
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,610
I am basically sitting here with a
bottle of tampons in some Kleenex. This,

458
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,240
this is, this is the end of it,
man. You know, I mean, Jesus,

459
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,510
I look really good for fucking
50 I'm not going to lie to you,

460
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:43,260
but I'm going to tell you right
now, nobody looks good at 60. Okay.

461
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:48,261
I don't give a fuck what you do when
you're 60 you're 60 and all even I know

462
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,900
that's not true.
Kenny Aronoff did my podcast.

463
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:55,980
He looked fucking unbelievable
and he was a little north of 60.

464
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,730
All right, that's it. Katie.
Error on Kenny Aronoff Snell,
the guy I'm looking at.

465
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,920
All right.
The day that guy falls off,

466
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,830
whatever fucking year that
is going to be like, God man,

467
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,320
that's officially you fucking old.
Right?

468
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,390
There you go. Um, anyways, let me, let
me read a little bit of advertising here.

of a fucking mannequin. Yeah,

555
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,380
All right. Podcast is going to be a
little, little short this week. Everybody,

556
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,610
you know, it's going to be a,
just like that guy in taxi,

557
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,090
you know on, uh, what's it,
what is the fucking show there?

558
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,960
The fucking so always sunny in
Philadelphia. Spacing on the guy's name.

559
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,520
He was awesome in one. Flew
over the Cuckoo's nest. He
was in kindergarten cop. No,

560
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,810
he wasn't.
He was in twins.

561
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,093
Okay.

562
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,070
It was in romancing the stone,
I think.

563
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:03,810
Yeah.

564
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,040
Keep thinking Alan Alda.

565
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,570
Fuck he got drunk on a talk show
was hilarious. Louie Depalma.

566
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,020
Do you know what I'm talking
about? Anyways? Uh, all read
the force. Get injections,

567
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:22,300
the wine country advice.
A Billy Barolo breath.

568
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,100
Heard you talking to Danica Patrick
about why you said you were Nia.

569
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,770
Want to do a wine country trip?
Thought I'd give you some ideas.

570
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,860
I grow grapes and make wine for a small
producer in Sonoma county and I've been

571
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:39,910
in the wine industry for 10. All right.
You have established credibility,

572
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,550
why can't you just tell
me where the fuck to go?

573
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:47,080
Rather than reading me your entire resume,
you self-involved jackass.

574
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,620
How soon before this guy has fucking
Korean for skin cells injected into his

575
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:55,390
fucking gray teeth,

576
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,290
make his teeth white again
after all that Merlow um,

577
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,730
I am not drinking Marlo. I guess that
fucked up the whole Merlow industry.

578
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:08,260
I like Merlow. Um, first of all,

579
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,950
don't do Napa.
It's Douchey as fuck.

580
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,530
Uh,

581
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,530
honestly you only need to drive a couple
hours into Santa wine as valley for an

582
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,260
awesome weekend of wine tasting.
They have all kinds of great wines there,

583
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,970
but if you guys do want to come all the
way up to the quote real wine country,

584
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,470
I really do think Sonoma county
is better than nappy Napa County.

585
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,910
The mistake people make is going
to the actual town of Sonoma,

586
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,910
which is boring and pretty shitty.
Uh,

587
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:43,300
the move is to stay in Hell's dude,
you're hooking me up.

588
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,210
Helzberg which is in
northern Sonoma county. Shit.

589
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:53,020
Loads of excellent tasting rooms and
restaurants just walking around town plus

590
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:58,021
tons of other wineries nearby
to drive to slash hire a car.

591
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,120
Napa is only an hour away at most,

592
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,100
so you could always cruise
over there for a day.

593
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,000
If there are some specific Napa
wineries you want to check out,

594
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,880
it's okay if there's some specific
ones you want check out. But seriously,

595
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,810
Fuck Napa blown up way over price wide,
most of them,

596
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:17,560
which aren't great and they can't
even grow Pinot noire over there.

597
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,530
It's too hot and Pino is
the best wine there is.

598
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,860
Once you learn to notice and
appreciate the little details.

599
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,640
Bonus fact Les Claypool has a winery here.

600
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,410
He makes Pino because he knows what's up.
I fucking love Les Claypool

601
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,110
shape baby. Do you want to fucking drink
wine with me? Um, other football leagues.

602
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,190
Well thank you sir.

603
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,150
I'm going to fucking copy and paste that
and send it to my wife and see what she

604
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:46,450
says.
Or other football leagues.

605
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,040
Hey William Shit. Just
one. Oh, you know what?

606
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,380
I missed the Liverpool Cup final.

607
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,610
I'll have to catch their next
game next season. Evidently,

608
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,480
I don't even know who
won. I would think, uh,

609
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,220
Liverpool one a loss because I
didn't get any fucking, hey dude,

610
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:12,221
I hope you watched your adopted
team one Liverpool Cup final.

611
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,450
Uh, Geez against Madrid. Where
the fuck is it over here?

612
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,470
Why is my cable so slow?
Not Cable. My Internet.

613
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:22,950
Okay,

614
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,200
come on. You fuck hoes? Come on. Come on.

615
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,670
Why? Well, I don't fucking know.
Oh, you don't? Never, definitely.

616
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,660
My computer is allergic to soccer.
Uh,

617
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:39,910
okay.
Other football leagues.

618
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:44,350
Hey William shivers was wondering since
Johnny Manzel has made the switch,

619
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:47,290
if you ever watch any CFL,
I love the CFL.

620
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,530
CFL is so fucking underrated.

621
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,870
CFL is better than college football.

622
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,780
That's a bunch of college all starts
that weren't quite good enough to make it

623
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:59,830
to the NFL. But what? Hawaii,
any college football team,

624
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,100
bigger field. It's exciting. I don't
even know what the fuck's going on.

625
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:05,470
And there's only like six tapes,
right?

626
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,920
The Edmonton Eskimos. They're like
your Washington Redskins, right?

627
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:14,680
Are they getting pressured to change
that name? The Calgary rough riders,

628
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,930
the BCA Eagles on as the Calgary
stampede, right? Isn't it

629
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,780
the Winnipeg nostril stickers
or something like that?

630
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,230
Something about the cold weather out
there. I don't fucking know. Um, oh,

631
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:33,100
by the way, tonight's the first
night of the Stanley Cup finals,

632
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,200
right? Stanley Cup final, not the
NBA finals. Stanley Cup final.

633
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,620
And congratulations to the fucking Vegas
nights and the Washington capitals.

634
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:47,470
That's going to be exciting
to see the team win. But uh,

635
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,810
I'm really pulling for the capitals.
I'm a big,

636
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,190
I'm a big fan of a fucking, what's
his face say? Oh, a vet chicken.

637
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,010
You know, Russian players get
a bad name in the NHL. Uh,

638
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,360
cause I guess a number of them could
give a fuck about winning a Stanley Cup.

639
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,090
You know, who is that guy, that sign,
you know, it was fucking amazing.

640
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,950
Played for the Atlanta thrashers.

641
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,770
Got a giant contract with New Jersey
was just like, yeah, you know,

642
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:16,060
I just don't give a fuck. And he
left, went back to play hockey and uh,

643
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,470
Russia like the Stanley Cup does,

644
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,610
like that's the stereotype that it doesn't
mean shit to these guys. All right.

645
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,200
So guys like you know, Mulkin in
Ovechkin got a bear. The, the,

646
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,890
the carry a load of these other Russian
constant I guess didn't give a shit.

647
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,400
So I'm rooting for that guy.
You know,

648
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,380
Trump probably wouldn't like
it then I'm rooting for Russia,

649
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,460
but I want to see him. Uh, I
want to see him win one. Um,

650
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,940
we should, we shall see. But what's
his face? Uh, Vince Neil Motley Crue,

651
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:47,290
one of my favorite groups of all time.

652
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,680
He's out in Vegas and he's become
a big fucking Vegas Knights Fan.

653
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,760
So no matter what, I'm going to be
happy whoever wins. Um, anyways,

654
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:57,340
other football leaks,
uh,

655
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,350
I would absolutely watch the CFL. The
biggest differences. Our field is longer,

656
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,380
long and wider with bigger end zones in
field goal posts are on the goal line.

657
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,080
Uh,
we also function on a three down system.

658
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,480
I'm probably a poor source for the rules,
but hey,

659
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:16,930
I'm just some jackass right
into the podcast. Well, let
me know when it starts. Ps,

660
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,140
you should see a Saskatchewan
rough riders game.

661
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,340
We are considered one of the best
football fan bases around and do a show in

662
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:30,300
Saskatoon too. While you're at it, go fuck
yourself and have a lovely day. I did.

663
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,400
I did a show. That's how
I know you guys go. Ooh.

664
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,440
I did a show in Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan.

665
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,380
I did one in Saskatoon and Regina
that steady, that rhymes with fun.

666
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,640
I never need to hear that again.
Um, I'll definitely be back.

667
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:48,170
It's fucking God's country up there.

668
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,330
And you can see the northern
lights like all year round.

669
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,890
A boyfriend found out I cheated
on my ex husband. Oh boy.

670
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,920
Uh, Billy Babushka Lips. What the
fuck is Babushka I gotta look that up.

671
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,893
MMM.

672
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,660
Liverpool quest for glory ends in tears.

673
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:13,500
Is Gareth Bale wonder goal breaks heart.

674
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:18,900
Oh No. Oh, I had enough sports
pain for the fucking weekend.

675
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:25,020
What happened?
Okay,

676
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,260
I'm clicking on the link.

677
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,540
Why won't you do anything?
Alright,

678
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,580
what was I looking at?
Babushka

679
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,090
it's one of my favorite words of all time.
I don't even know what it means.

680
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,680
Oh, Billy Babushka. That
was a wrestling manager.

681
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,330
That would be my name. Alright.
Should I end my relationship,

682
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,350
my boyfriend of a year and a half fun out.
I cheated on my ex husband.

683
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,330
He's not being a huge dick about it.

684
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:03,080
Just passive aggressive whenever shit
goes down, which is not too often.

685
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,260
He's a little bit,
he's a little on the sensitive side,

686
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,400
but until he found out about my past,
that's what I liked about him.

687
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:15,290
He's a math computer guy, not an
Alpha male. Uh, well, you know,

688
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,700
if you get what you pay for sweetheart,

689
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,840
he does not care what people think about
him and he has a unique sense of humor.

690
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,780
His family definitely has mental issues.

691
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:29,090
His Dad refused to stay on dialysis and
died when he was in high school and two

692
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:34,091
older brothers off themselves when he
was a sophomore and a senior in college.

693
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,170
Jesus fucking Christ Dayton,
the Hemingways here.

694
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,440
I'm in my mid thirties
and have a good job.

695
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,890
He's two years older and has a great job,
owns a house in a good neighborhood.

696
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,640
No kids involved. Our relationship
is the best I've ever had.

697
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,700
I feel a lot of love recently though,

698
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:58,240
after he found out I sense a lapse.

699
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,740
He never wants to talk about it. I could
never imagine myself cheating again.

700
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,920
I got married to my ex too young,

701
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,390
but now that my baby making years are
coming to an end, I don't know what to do.

702
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:15,270
Should I stick around to see if we
get back to where we were or move on?

703
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,580
Go drink yourself.
Um,

704
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:21,450
okay.

705
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,700
Yeah, I don't fuck it. I,
you know, I don't know.

706
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,900
I don't know.
Um,

707
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,060
just be like, look, I

708
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,930
you ever going to be able to get,
just ask him,

709
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:35,610
are you going to be able to get past this?

710
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,940
You know, here's the thing. You know,

711
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,270
you did do it so

712
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,680
it gives you shit.
I kind of got to roll with it.

713
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,260
I guess I have gives a fuck.
Yeah.

714
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,770
I just rolled with it for a little bit
and just see a full fucking sensitive,

715
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,580
sensitive are there. Um, I know
people always say that, you know,

716
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,110
if you fucking cheat, you're going
to cheat again. I, and I don't know.

717
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,880
It all depends on where you are in
your life. Who the fuck you're with?

718
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,580
I don't know about that one. Has there
been a study on that? I have no idea.

719
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,540
I honestly don't know
what to tell you man. Um,

720
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,240
maybe you could turn it into some sort
of math joke. Uh, dating older women.

721
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,490
Dear Billy blue balls.
My name is prince.

722
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:30,150
I am 23 and about to
be 24 in about a month.

723
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,950
I am in a relationship with a 44
year old woman. Yeah, this is easy.

724
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:36,930
Get the fuck out of it.
You're not in a relationship.

725
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:40,620
You're banging a 44 year old woman.
Uh,

726
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,340
now I know what you are thinking.

727
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,230
Mommy issues much now.

728
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:50,780
And I don't end fucking sentences
with the word much. Nonetheless.

729
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,410
I just said, hey, that's too much.
I don't know. There's some fucking,

730
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,480
I hate that. Something something much.
You know what else they, when I hate, uh,

731
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:05,250
so and so, and then at something in
quotes me something in quotes in the year.

732
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:09,210
Always the coolest
fucking person. Ah, Bill,

733
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:12,430
you're all get over it. People
talk differently now. All right?

734
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,830
We remember when you were young
and everybody would yell, not,

735
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,270
you didn't think that was annoying
to older people. All right,

736
00:46:19,271 --> 00:46:22,870
you got me now I know what
you are thinking. Okay,

737
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:25,400
now I know what you're thinking.
Mommy issues much yet.

738
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,530
That is part of the reason I am with her,
if I'm being honest. Well, there you go.

739
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,610
Gotta love honesty.

740
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,210
We have been dating for about five
months now and things are good,

741
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:36,310
but there are things that
irritate the hell out of me.

742
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,460
What her fucking silver pubic hair.
Uh,

743
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,150
like she thinks some of my views on
life and other things that are odd.

744
00:46:43,151 --> 00:46:46,570
I honestly think it's because she grew
up in a totally different times. Yeah.

745
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:48,160
It's called a generation gap.

746
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,140
If he gets your face out of her gap and
look at the fucking calendar. Sorry.

747
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,750
Um, we had been dating for about
five months now and things are good.

748
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:02,140
No they're not. But there are things
that irritate. Okay, I read this.

749
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:04,450
They're not good, sir. You need
to get the fuck out of this.

750
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,240
This is not going to end well. Some
point you're going to want to have a kid,

751
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,800
all right. And her vagina is
going to be in a fucking museum.

752
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,360
Um,
anyways,

753
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,950
uh,

754
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,180
with the fuck wasn't something that's
definitely different time than me,

755
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:26,500
but some of it is that
she isn't into science

756
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,130
or she better be if going
to try to keep herself

757
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,940
young.

758
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,350
Like we got into an argument about high
fructose corn syrup because she said

759
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:40,060
it's only sugar until I prove to her
that it's not just sugar and she thinks

760
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,470
that's not really science.

761
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,300
Okay.

762
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,680
Yeah.
I thought you were into science.

763
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,890
You're just reading facts that scientists
figured out that's not science.

764
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,780
Right? I mean, I could, I mean the fact
that I could look that up and just go,

765
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:57,010
here it is. That's not scientist. If I
can figure it out, it's not science, sir.

766
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,080
Um, and she thinks my fear of
chemicals in our food is odd as well.

767
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:07,081
It's hard being with someone that doesn't
get me another thing in another thing

768
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,780
in a black male. Oh, I'm a black
male and she's a white female,

769
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,320
so she doesn't really understand how
it is to be a black man in this day.

770
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:22,090
And that Jesus fucking Christ, sir.
How many red flags do you need?

771
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:24,843
Okay.

772
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,560
You know, and, and she's, uh,

773
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,530
she got fired from the Police
Department for dropping the n word.

774
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:35,240
Other than that, I think I really liked
her. Sarah, what the fuck are you doing?

775
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,160
I'm going to keep going here and did
jump taught, uh, and did jump topic. Uh,

776
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,480
sex with her is good,

777
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:45,440
but it's like we only have
sex once and it sucks.

778
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:50,030
She says it's because I leave
or to, so a, okay. I'm not,

779
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,270
I leave her to soar as you know.

780
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,520
Is there anything worse than a big
fucking Dick? Nincompoop I can't fuck it.

781
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,300
I know at 1:00 AM 1:00 AM I
supposed to do with you, sir?

782
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,660
You and your porno cock need
to fucking date somebody,

783
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:08,440
uh, you know, from, from,
she's almost twice your age.

784
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,140
Okay.

785
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,140
And she listens to country.
But this is such a fucked up email.

786
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:15,890
I don't believe it.
I'm calling bullshit on that one.

787
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,610
Yeah,

788
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,150
you kind of did a slow roll on me.
You had me, you had me, you had me,

789
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,690
and then you sat and I'm black
and I got a big deck ad she saw.

790
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:27,620
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

791
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,040
Okay.

792
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,731
Maybe it's true.
He goes,

793
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:33,900
I want to have excitement and shit in
our relationship and she just doesn't

794
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:37,590
bring that to the table. I like her a lot
and we watched documentaries together.

795
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:40,410
I'm sure. Did she fall asleep
half way through it like I do.

796
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,310
Um, anyways. All right.

797
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,933
Okay.

798
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,500
Okay. And she has a venereal
disease, but you know,

799
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:02,000
other than that, you
know, we laugh a lot. Ah,

800
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,000
fuck. All right. Do we
have anything else here?

801
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,890
Is there anything else that that needs
to be discussed other than why is my

802
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:11,660
computer that I got kicked off line.

803
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,113
Okay.

804
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,040
You know,
and now novel,

805
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,610
it'd be funny if I never
go to the Internet again in
the last thing I did was I

806
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:24,960
looked up Babushka
um,

807
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,590
all right. People. It's
Memorial Day. Whose kid? No,

808
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:32,770
you're not fucking working today either.
All right.

809
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,130
I have to go to a picnic. That kid
picnic and I can't wait. You know what?

810
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:42,360
I actually got a great book here.
It says 88 great daddy daughter dates.

811
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,280
I think I'm going to do most of these.
You know, I got all these books. You know,

812
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,830
uh, dad's prayer for his daughter's
daughter. That's fucking weird.

813
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,860
Strong fathers, strong
daughters. 10 secrets every
father should know. All right,

814
00:50:58,861 --> 00:51:00,960
let's read a little bit of
this sandwich to the salary.

815
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,680
Protect her defender. Okay. She needs,

816
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:12,000
oh my God. This is like, all right.

817
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:16,140
How dumb would you have to be to
read this fucking book? Okay. One,

818
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:20,490
you are the most important
man in her life. Chapter two,

819
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,220
she needs a hero.
Chapter three,

820
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:27,720
you are her first love chapter
four, teacher humility. Oh,

821
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:32,490
she shouldn't stand there like Lebron
James after he just blocked a shot a her

822
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,460
defender and use a shotgun if necessary.

823
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,120
Pragmatism and grit.
Your two greatest,

824
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:41,460
I'll read that chapter because I don't
know what either one of those meets.

825
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,610
I know one of them was a John Wayne movie.

826
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,670
Be the man you want her
to marry. Gross. Uh,

827
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,050
teacher of who God is. Gross
teacher to fight. That's right.

828
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,930
There you go.
Keep her connected

829
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:03,330
afterward. Acknowledgments, bibliography,

830
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,680
notes, index. I don't know what those
last thing chapters were about. Let's see.

831
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:08,550
Let's read the chapter.

832
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,690
Start with index here.

833
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,160
Let's see what the Hell I'm supposed
to tell my daughter a abortion.

834
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:22,310
12 abstinence comma went 13 dash one 14.

835
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,070
Uh, this doesn't make any
sense. Add health study,

836
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,760
Adhd,

837
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,390
advertising. African Americans.
This book is all over the place.

838
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,710
African Americans and it
says depression and st

839
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,500
ds aids.

840
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,870
But why did you have to
drag black people into this?

841
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,430
Alcohol use is a weird chapter. I don't
think I liked this book. I know that.

842
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:54,640
I don't know who wrote. Um, anyways.

843
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,620
Oh, fucking Billy burger face is
going to go fucking turn on the grill.

844
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:07,620
Make a few here. Um, it's just one of
my last podcast in my 40. [inaudible]

845
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:12,460
this is so stupid. I'm turning 50. I'm
not going to feel any fucking differently.

846
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,413
Um,

847
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,890
I'm definitely gonna try to eat better
and I've been doing that for the last

848
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:18,724
three months,

849
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:22,600
and I was facetiming with somebody and
they would like to have you lost weight.

850
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,780
And I was like, Nah, not
really. I was excited.

851
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,160
Um, so anyways, um,

852
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,100
I think that's it, right? Anything I'm
doing a Trump do my double bass drum.

853
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:41,300
It's coming along. It's coming along,
you know, working on that song.

854
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,900
I had the beholder eye of the
beholder. Little Metallica. Oh.

855
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:48,890
And I played streets of San Francisco.
It's all serendipity. All right. This is,

856
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:49,840
this is it.
I'm done.

857
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,640
I'm not going to just fucking me and her
for another fucking six minutes just to

858
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:55,190
say I did it. Uh, once again, I apologize.

859
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,440
Everybody in Cleveland and in
Philly for being a content, right.

860
