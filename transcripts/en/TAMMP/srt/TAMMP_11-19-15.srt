1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,790
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
it's time for the Monday morning part. No,

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:09,390
it isn't it. What am I talking about? It's
time for the Thursday afternoon. Friday,

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:13,020
just before Friday.
Fucking Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,120
Just checking. Oh, Narnia. What's
going on? You're like, dad,

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,220
that was a little siren version for you.
You know,

6
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:29,890
it's the little things that make your day.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,780
Um, all right. How's it going? I haven't
done shit. Why does it sound weird?

8
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:36,860
People are going to trash me again.

9
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:40,490
Sorry about last week because a on Monday
I didn't have it plugged in all the

10
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:44,600
way and it came out like a
fucking 1940s Benny Goodman.

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,740
It wasn't a stereo is what I'm
trying to say. There was no stereo,

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,550
no stereo for you. But look at Thursday,
Huh? Oh, you know, it was, I was,

13
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:56,780
it was a metaphor.
It was a metaphor for a Monday.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,580
You know what I mean? That everything
just seems bleak and there's no way to go,

15
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:05,060
you know? So you don't get
stereo on Monday on Thursday,
right. Why? What happened?

16
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,680
What do you have on Thursday? What do you
got? Uh, you got your fucking paycheck.

17
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:13,220
He got money in hand. You can see
the light at the end of the tunnel.

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,570
That broad came in
wearing that little outfit

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,690
fit your Dick's going dough,
cheese wearing it for yo man.

20
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:21,720
She's wearing it for you and make a move.
Right?

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,730
So you get Stereo Stereo on Thursdays.

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,620
Sorry, this still sounds like
I'm inside of a fucking 10 can.

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,760
And I know a lot of guys are saying,
well bill, why don't you get a producer?

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,280
And I just say,
why don't you go fuck yourself?

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,250
I don't do this to have a job. I turned
it on. I do the best I can. All right.

26
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,163
You know,

27
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,110
most of you guys are probably not even
saying this and I'm just yelling at you.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,620
I don't know why I'm yelling at you.
I'm on fucking vacation.

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,530
I'm psyched. It's two 30 out here in
la, which means in an hour and a half,

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,260
uh, I'm going to watch my Boston Bruins
take on the Minnesota north stars or the

31
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:05,240
wild as the kids call them
after we fucking lost a San
Jose. We're just, we just,

32
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:09,740
you know what it is? It's like we play
one period and you're like, you know what?

33
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:13,730
They could be as 16 and then the next
period. Yeah. I don't know what happens.

34
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:17,740
It's just up and down and it's
frustrating. But, uh, I'm still,

35
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,430
I know the fuck.
I'm going to watch them.

36
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,850
I think they're going to turn it around
called Julian's too good at coach.

37
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,340
We've got too many pieces
leftover from our Stanley Cup.

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,920
They're going to whip these guys into
shape or they're going to fucking dig.

39
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,940
Going to send a few people
a next thing you know,

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,240
freckles here might get to try out. I
could be a good grinder on a fourth line.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,870
Right?

42
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,950
Get out there on the penny penalty kill
skate nor all around my face is red as a

43
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:44,950
fucking tomato. I do it. Um, yeah,

44
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,380
I don't think you could do
that. Uh, who the fuck does a,

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,590
who the fuck is on a
Minnesota is where they get it?

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,340
They got Zach per Reezy who's on their
lines. You know who's at first line?

47
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:02,400
Who says second line? Oh, that's right.
I'll go to fucking daily face off.com.

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,360
You know these kinds of, to throw me
a fucking hot dog or something, man.

49
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:10,470
I hype the shit out of this. Where
am I going here? Minnesota wild.

50
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:13,500
You Click right there and then all of
a sudden the lines are looking at him

51
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:18,500
right there. Thomas Vanek, the
former fucking save. All right.

52
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,660
Did he go to the islanders and that
fuck another trade or something?

53
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't know any of these guys.
Mikael Granlund. Jason Palmerville.

54
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,770
Okay,

55
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,160
Jason. Hey, wait a minute.
Where's Zack for easy. Did
you get traded? Is he injured?

56
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,500
Is He, he is nice. I don't
wish ill will on anybody.

57
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,770
I hope we just twisted his fuck.
Maybe he's got a hangnail you don't.

58
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,330
Every time he puts his gloves
on it hurts and he goes, oh

59
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,470
yeah,

60
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,310
try it again, Zach. Oh, ah. You Know
Jack, you could shut it out tonight.

61
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,330
Maybe we'll get a win.
Oh, look at that guy.

62
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:58,290
The fucking right wing on
the second line. NATO. NATO.

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,263
NATO Renner.

64
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,110
Yeah.

65
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,310
Yeah. Jason. Um, anyways, let's get
skip back to the podcast here. So, uh,

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,740
I have been not doing shit. I slept
for like two straight fucking days.

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,220
It's all I did.
I put on my old PJ's all Billy PJ's,

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,940
I didn't do fucking shit for two days.
I haven't drank, I haven't smoked.

69
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,250
I haven't left the fucking
house other than a walk my dog

70
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,030
and I'm still exhausted. I think
that last, uh, the last, you know,

71
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,600
you go hard for a month, people,
you know, when you're 47 and,

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,360
and basically a half, if I can
say my age, like a little kid,

73
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,170
I'm 47 and five months, um, you know,

74
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,210
and your drink every night for like
a month straight essentially. Uh,

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,060
yeah, that's going to do some
damage. So, uh, I figured, you know,

76
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,670
I beat the shit out of
my body for 30 days,

77
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,230
balance it out by taking four days off.
That math works out in my world.

78
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,960
Um, speaking of which
two, do you know what,

79
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,600
somebody sent me this
book and I'm only in,

80
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,080
I read the foreword and um,

81
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,210
into the first chapter and if
you're into standup comedy, um,

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,470
this book so far, it seems unfucking
believable. It's called the Comedians,

83
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,980
um, drunks, thieves, scoundrels,

84
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,880
and the history of
American comedy by cliffK ,

85
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,870
l I.
P h nest or off.

86
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,540
And I have to tell you already,

87
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,690
I'm absolutely blown away by just
the stories from the Vaudeville days.

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,010
And even like in the middle of the book
when I'm looking at these pictures of

89
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,880
some of these comics that
I never heard of. Um,

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,490
uh,
what the fuck is this guy?

91
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:47,200
There was a guy in like 1962 we used to
be like a blueberry bluegrass musician

92
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,480
and he became a standup comedian. And he
did this album called the first family,

93
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,900
uh,
1962 von meter.

94
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,790
I hope I'm saying his name had the highest
selling comedy record of all time up

95
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:05,110
until 1962. And I'm assuming doing
his impression of President Kennedy,

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,120
all right. When the president
was assassinated, uh,

97
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,350
meter plunged into a meltdown,
a mental breakdown. By the way,

98
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:17,770
there's a typo on this,
said Vietor Vaughn Meader,

99
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:21,490
they call them Vietor and the
next line. Um, but anyways, yeah.

100
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:24,490
So he was crushing it,
doing this Kennedy impression,

101
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:29,440
and then Kennedy gets whacked and he's
completely fucked. And uh, in fact,

102
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:29,670
I wrote,

103
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,590
there's another story in here would
that night I kind of just blew the joke,

104
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:35,260
but a Lenny Bruce did not cancel the show.

105
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,040
Most people did reminded me in
nine 11 while they just sort of,

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,600
there was no comedy shows for about
three, four days. Uh, but nobody, uh,

107
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,770
I guess the cancer all comedy shows,
but Lenny Bruce did is any way and uh,

108
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,970
walked on stage, very solemn and
kind of look down at the ground.

109
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:56,320
The crowd was all quiet and he
just looked up and was like, man,

110
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,220
von meters fucked.
Never dealt what he was.

111
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,060
I felt bad for the guy.
1962, he was riding high. 63.

112
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:09,510
The guy does the impression
of gets whacked. 1965,

113
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,400
he's broke flat, fucking broke, can't get
a God damn job by the early seventies.

114
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:18,720
He's back in Maine singing
bluegrass music. Once again,

115
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:22,790
the name of the book is
the Comedians by cliff k.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,370
L. I. P. H. Nesteroff, n e. S t like nest.

117
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:32,371
Like what a bird sits in till it
gets booted out by its mother nest.

118
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,280
He are off. Um, two F's.

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,320
Okay. It's not, it's not
Nesterov it's an SRF, but uh,

120
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,360
it seems great so far.
And um,

121
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,730
okay.

122
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,150
Is already just looking at the pictures.
I didn't know Joan Rivers was,

123
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,980
was not in a comedy team.

124
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:55,981
She was in a comedy almost troop with
two other fucking guys and she lasted six

125
00:07:57,461 --> 00:08:01,720
months with them before. She's just
like, yeah, fuck this. I'm out. I'm so,

126
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,750
I can't wait to read the rest of that. But
anyways, I have not been doing shit. Um,

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,810
I just went over and I did a, I had
a voiceover for a, uh, for a TV show,

128
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,790
which is cool man. You know, uh,

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,370
did that in the morning and
then I was going to go over

130
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,760
okay

131
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,950
and do something productive and ended
up being in a part of the city where

132
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,860
somebody show me where
there was a good bargain.

133
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,340
I got the Burger and then down the street
there was this place where you get an

134
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:30,240
ice cream sandwich that has a fucking
that instead of having the sandwich part,

135
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,750
it's actually a donut. I know what
you think it built Jesus Christ,

136
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:37,560
what are you doing? And it's like, I'm
on the rails and I'm off the rails.

137
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,400
I ate perfectly the last three days
I was over in that part of the city.

138
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:46,200
My wife was there. She always knows
every good place to eat. I folded.

139
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,850
I just wanted her to know that I knew
were some places where a to, you know,

140
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,000
and we'd already gotten into a fight.
We had a brutal fight today.

141
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,830
She fucking screamed at me and I didn't
say anything because she was right.

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,220
What happened was, was I was in bumper
to bumper traffic out here, right?

143
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,590
So we got a green light,

144
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,200
but I can't get across the
intersection without blocking it.

145
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,200
So I'm waiting for the people
to pull up as the light screen.

146
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:10,760
So I hit this guy behind me,
beep.

147
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,490
Then all of a sudden he tries
to pass me on the right,

148
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:17,120
like he's just going to go around me
like I'm some sort of bitch, right?

149
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,880
So I step on the gas if my Prius

150
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,450
and we fucking drive up and he's trying
to cut in and I fucking cut this guy off.

151
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,860
He came within a coat of
paint of hitting us, right?

152
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,270
But I fucking boxed him out between me
and the parked car and he had to give in.

153
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,530
So now we're just parallel.
Nia screamed like, oh,

154
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,160
like a person who was not driving the car
and was sitting in the passenger seat,

155
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,530
right.
Fucking screamed.

156
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,640
And initially she starts yelling at
the guy and I'm yelling at the guy.

157
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:52,960
He puts the window down. I'm like, dude,
what the fuck is wrong? He was a boy.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,760
Fuck you still blew the
fucking greenlight. I'm like,
there's no fucking Ramis.

159
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,730
He's like, blah, blah, blah, knees
screaming at him. And then I go, dude,

160
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,330
you're a fucking psycho point in my own
head. You ever fucking psycho? He goes,

161
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:06,260
you're a fucking psycho too. Now
looking back, I should have been like I,

162
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,680
it's a decent point,
but you know, I wasn't,

163
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,150
I wasn't in psycho move until you did
that Mad Max shit. You fucking cunt.

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,680
And then this is what kills me.

165
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,820
Nia rolls the window up and then the
fucking guy goes around me on the left.

166
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,500
This time it makes a left and leaves.

167
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,860
So that's the end for him.

168
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,370
Now Nia is just sitting there like shaking
with their arms crossed and I'm like,

169
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:36,170
Oh fuck, here we go. And I just saw, I'm
trying to be funny about it and I'm like,

170
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:38,330
Hey Nia, great job. You
really gave that guy hell.

171
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,213
And,

172
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,790
and then she just fucking
staring ahead and I'm like,

173
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,280
I might get you mad at me. And
she just screamed like, Hey,

174
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,560
all of us at this side of the
car that's site that I was on,

175
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,710
like freaking out. And I
was just like, yeah, Jesus.

176
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,620
And then I wanted to apologize and I
started thinking about Johnny Roast beef

177
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:00,920
and good fellas.
You know when he bites the pink Cadillac,

178
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,983
you know,

179
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,160
it's fucking Jimmy's going,
what's the matter with you?

180
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,060
What's the matter if you and
just keeps going. Sorry, it's,

181
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,010
it's in my grandmother's name. Like I,
I just kept picturing as dumped face.

182
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:14,460
Unfortunate.

183
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,190
She didn't look at me cause I had a smirk
on my face because that's what I felt

184
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:22,110
like could she goes, she was a
hundred percent right. So, uh,

185
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,190
like a good 10 miles of
silence in stop and go traffic.

186
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,840
So that's the equivalent of like 40 miles.

187
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:33,430
If I didn't live in such an overcrowded
city and she's just like, you know,

188
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,541
she,
her face,

189
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,720
she has like three different levels of
mad and she was at like the top level of

190
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:39,740
Matt and I kept looking over,
you know,

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,020
her bottom lift was still
stuck out like a, you know,

192
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,630
she laid a little dog that was mad.
You know,

193
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,540
he's a little brother right before he
cries, you're like, is he going to cry?

194
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,640
You're going to punch me in the head.
You know when you do that,

195
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,590
when you push it a little brother
too far, he like, he's eating,

196
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:52,740
they start swinging and I start crying.
I Dunno.

197
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,040
Might want to lean back a little bit.
Get the arms up right.

198
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,250
She had that look on her face and the
next time I looked over it was just an

199
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,750
angry face and then I looked over again,
then our arms would just crossed.

200
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:07,710
So I know at that point that you
can actually talk to her. So I, uh,

201
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,540
I try to cute my way out
of it. I said, listen,

202
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,230
okay,

203
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,050
you were 100% right. She goes,
that's right. I was, I go,

204
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,790
all right, let me rephrase
that. You are 110% right.

205
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,770
And she gave me shit back again. And I
said, all right, look, you are 120% right.

206
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:28,520
And that's my final offer. All right,
got a little bit of a smile out of it,

207
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:32,700
but she was fucking mad
at me. Uh, I don't know.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Then I tried to turn it around on her,
tried to say like,

209
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:39,380
that's why I'm successful, because I
don't take shit from other people. Like,

210
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,250
like that's a situation that you,
you,

211
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,540
you need to take shit and just let the
fucking maniac go. Who gives a shit bill?

212
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,680
Why do you give a fuck?
Why do you immediately go into like,

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,560
like a lunatic mode?

214
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,590
And I was actually thinking
about it when I was driving home,

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,530
how my wife's energy is so much
more chill than mine. And I'm like,

216
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,580
am I just like,

217
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,650
like a car engine that just idles
higher and I can't fucking, you know,

218
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:11,651
I'm just burning through the tank of
gas or do I wake up in the morning chill

219
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,850
like she does and I just don't
let life affect me. No one I let,

220
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,520
she doesn't let life affect
her the way it affects me.

221
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,800
And I actually think it's a,
I think it's a little more,

222
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,270
the second one. I think I just
need to fucking relax a little bit.

223
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:32,720
What the fuck is wrong with
me? I'm yelling at the guy.
You're a fucking psycho.

224
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:34,060
You're in for,
what do I draw?

225
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:37,630
I know that guy knows all that Jujitsu
shit singing now he's got me down.

226
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,790
You know, he's passed my guard.
I'm laying on the street, you know.

227
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,091
Oh.

228
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:48,380
So my Prius goes into gear and it runs
over my wrist and snaps my watchband but

229
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:52,400
doesn't break any bones cause it's a
Prius. Right. Fuck is wrong with me.

230
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,670
So it was like a perfect day.
I'm on vacation.

231
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:59,480
She was loving that I was relaxed and
all of that. And within two seconds,

232
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,970
one cunt fucked up my whole day.

233
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:05,180
And what was really making me
laugh was that guy was by himself.

234
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,760
So the second he went around me and
made the left, it was over. He left.

235
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,660
And then there I was getting yelled at
by my wife for the next fucking 10 miles.

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
And I was kind of laughed to myself.
God on son of a bitch.

237
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:21,540
One I thought I won one. I, he didn't get
in. I thought I won. I didn't. It did.

238
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,650
And I won the first round. Then
got the old right there, Fred,

239
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,750
when I went to the judges.
Right. So it's fucking pathetic.

240
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,000
Um, anyways, what a Dick. I
didn't think it was him like,

241
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,150
cause he had like this foreign car,

242
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:38,360
but it had like an American car sounding
horn. So I didn't think it was him.

243
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:43,260
So I was off my game and he almost
got around me. I don't know.

244
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:46,880
It's probably stupid, right? Oh fuck
you. You, you don't make mistakes.

245
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,970
We all make mistakes. Ooh. All right.

246
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,990
Let's read a little
advertising here for this week.

247
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,820
Um, let's see here. Uh,
blue apron, everybody.

248
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, flowy blue apron. You
need to know how to cook.

249
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,060
Not only do you feel like you know
your way around a kitchen, uh,

250
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,530
but cooking at home means eating healthier
and saving money instead of ordering

251
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,130
expensive takeout. Again. Yeah.
Nobody shuts you off at the Bra.

252
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,790
But where do you start? Blue Apron has
you covered for less than $10 per meal.

step by steps. Instructions. Uh,

255
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,960
each meal can be prepared
in 40 minutes or less.

256
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:32,130
No overwhelming trips to the
grocery store. No more sad takeout.

257
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,740

258
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:39,030
Blue Apron makes it a breeze to discover

right in your own kitchen.

260
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,440
Coke with ingredients that you've never
used before. Like watermelon, radishes,

261
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Pharaoh or Pharrell of Ferraro and purple
potatoes and recipes are between 500

262
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,200
to 700 calories proportion.
That's pretty good man.

263
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:00,170
And then he crushed waters for the
rest of the day. Rest of the evening.

264
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,680
Beautiful Save money. You don't got
to go out and you get a flat stomach.

265
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,090
Delicious and good for you.

266
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:09,740
Right now you can get your first two
meals for free at blue apron. Got Dotcom,

267
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,070
slash. Bird. That's blue apron.com/bar hi,

268
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,030
blue apron.com/birth it's a
better way to cook. All right,

269
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,230
Boll and branch.

270
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,710
Yeah,

271
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,040
ball and branch. B. O. L. L. A.

272
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,100
You probably spend more time with your
bedsheets than anything else you own.

273
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,410
You really shouldn't
skimp on your bedding,

274
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,890
but most people do because
great sheets are very expensive,

275
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,240
but thanks to bowl a ball,
a ball, l, l and branch.

276
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,050
That's not the case anymore.
And when you spend a big chunk,

277
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,700
big bucks on sheets with
a super high thread count,

278
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,170
you think you're getting the best,

279
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,950
but what you're really getting
is marketing Mumbo jumbo
thread count has nothing

280
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:54,760
to do with quality and don't get me
started on the so called Egyptian cotton

281
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:55,594
over there.

282
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,520
That's just the name of a plant grown
in Pakistan and China doesn't mean Shit.

283
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,953
All right,

284
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,240
the upbringing up Egyptian cotton,

285
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,403
listen,

286
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,860
you value sleep, right? Of course you do.

287
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,140
But whenever you had
to a department store,

288
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:16,110
you're forced to pay a huge markup for
sheets that aren't even that great.

289
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,960
Boll and branch sheets that different.
First of all,

290
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,380
you can only get them at Boland,

291
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,390
branch.com p o l l and branch.com so you
know you're paying for quality sheets

292
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,390
and that for overhead.

293
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,270
And quite frankly then the most
comfortable sheets in the world,

294
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:30,781
they're made from it.

295
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:35,781
The entirely organic from an with entirely
organic cotton in a nights sleeping

296
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:39,190
on boll and branch sheets.
Make sure day so much better.

297
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Three US presidents slept and bang
mistresses on Boll and branch sheets.

298
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,990
These are people who can afford
asleep on any brand of sheets they

299
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,900
want. I Bet Marilyn Monroe
got fucked on a pair of these,

300
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,140
probably what she did.

301
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,720
Happy Birthday this to
president. All right. I, uh,

302
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,310
get over there when the boll and branch,

303
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,670
they even cut out the middleman
department store markups, which means,

304
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,300
which means, uh, by the way, up
to 800% that you're going to save.

305
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,820
So you get an amazing luxury. Okay?
We got it to get to the fucking India.

306
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,690
Bola branch is so confident.
You'll love the sheets. Uh,

307
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,890
they'll let you try him completely
risk free for 30 nights.

308
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,370
And then what? I don't like him. I send
it back. Then. What do you do with them?

309
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,790
Gross.
It's even better if you order right now.

310
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,900
They'll give you $50 off a set
of sheets plus free shipping.

311
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,630
Go the Boll and branch.com and use the
Promo Code [inaudible]. That's right.

314
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,910
Dot com and using the Promo
Code Burr Jesus Christ.

315
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,610
I could barely get through that.
Um,

316
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,910
I'll tell you what I didn't have a
problem getting through is over the last

317
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,500
couple of days when I wasn't sleeping,
um,

318
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,670
me and cleo watched all of season one
of peaky blinders and you have know

319
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:05,460
nothing about no robbery. Um,
what a fucking show that was.

320
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,530
Um, and by the way, if
you want to get into it,

321
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,500
I'm gonna let you know the first episode
and a half is a little slow because

322
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,780
it's setting up the story.
Also,

323
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,910
you got to go into captions and just have
English subtitles going the whole time.

324
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,500
It will really help you out because,
uh, you can't understand. I mean,

325
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:25,380
I can't understand a lot of what the
fuck they're saying. And then you,

326
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,990
you understand most of it
except for the last word.

327
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,340
And it's a completely
different, like, you know,

328
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:35,750
they say whore har effect can,
hi,

329
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,680
what? I mean I knew he was calling
her a whore because of the situation,

330
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,470
but he just said he just stuck his
face right now. Grilling just goes, hi

331
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,930
thought he's a pirate,

332
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:52,290
like error every meeting now he's calling
her effect affecting higher get second

333
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,750
hire. Um, alright. Which
one to use in charge?

334
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,740
They'll be oldest.
Roy,

335
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,750
I can say that you making
fun of me brother. Right?

336
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:08,010
So he's the oldest and you're the
thickest so you must be in charge.

337
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,760
They got lines like that and it's
just, it's fucking great. Um,

338
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,110
I watched all of the first season and
now I'm going to binge watch the next

339
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,100
season as I read this book on comedy
because I am on fucking vacation.

340
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,520
I'm not playing drums. I'm not flying
helicopters. I'm not doing shows.

341
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,130
I'm not doing shit.
All right.

342
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,200
I'm trying to eat right and
working out a little bit,

343
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,470
but I'm just laying in my fucking bed.

344
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,460
Like that fucking dude with the spruce
goose plane. What the fuck was his name?

345
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,980
Howard Hughes.
All right.

346
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,550
That's all Billy booze is laying here
like Howard Hughes until I feel like

347
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:48,030
getting up again.
I ain't doing the Bruins.

348
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:51,900
Come on and an hour and 12 minutes.
I'm watching those fuckers.

349
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:55,530
I got Thursday night football.
I'm sitting here with my dog,

350
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:59,940
it's the fucking best. Um, best year
of my life. Best Year of stand up,

351
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,620
the best Gig I could have possibly. And I
did on, I'm still flying high over that.

352
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,450
It's just fucking perfect.

353
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,110
And it's getting to that time of
year out here in la where it's cold,

354
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:13,590
it starts to rain this,
the fucking air quality's way better.

355
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,340
It's not even the small og man because
the cars burnt so much cleaner nowadays.

356
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:21,930
It's, it's really just all the dust and
sand and dirt and fucking just, you know,

357
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,370
Shit from other human beings. It just
kinda gets settles down to the ground.

358
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:28,870
It's fucking does a snow cap
mountain out here that you can,

359
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,120
you can't see most of the year
it starts to come out. You know,

360
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,380
people start going home for the holidays
to city becomes more of the level of

361
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:41,370
population it should be. It's
just fucking great. And um,

362
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,410
yeah, nothing but nothing but good.
Uh, good thoughts that I mentioned.

363
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:51,150
I'm going to go see the king's hawks game.
November 28 it staples center.

364
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:54,360
I mean, to me, I feel like in
a hockey way that's like a,

365
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,930
it's kind of like back
in the day when the 70s,

366
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,970
when the Steelers and cowboys
played where you just like,

367
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:04,860
how many hall of famers are in this
fucking game? Um, although the hawks,

368
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:09,600
I don't know why they let so many people
go, but Teva is going to make it right.

369
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:12,840
Patrick Kane is going to make
it get at least two over there.

370
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,390
Okay.

371
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,370
Fucking, uh, my quick is gonna make
it, what the fuck is that guy's name?

372
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,080
It looks like Dave Grohl to
doubt he's gonna make it. I mean,

373
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:26,830
it's just a bunch of, you know, who
knows? Maybe Copa Tar, I don't know.

374
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:30,100
So you get the numbers. I'm not good at
that shit. I just know like these are,

375
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,260
these are the two, fuck,
these are two fucking teams.

376
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,960
As much as the Canadians are playing well,

377
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,550
and I want to watch them on the package
because I don't even know what's a

378
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:39,940
Canadian. And I like
watching great hockey. Uh,

379
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,990
they're in the east so I would watch the,
the,

380
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,840
the habs if they played the hawks are
the kings of the stars or somebody out

381
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:51,820
there, um, on the west. Cause I just
still think it's all about the west.

382
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:56,760
I just, I fucking bastards. They, they'd
been dominating forever. Yeah. So I'm,

383
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,840
I'm gonna I'm going to
check that game out. Uh,

384
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,100
Steph Curry's come into town tonight.
I'm going to watch him. You know,

385
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,491
it was cool.

386
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:06,950
Kevin Durant's said he's the greatest
shooter of all time and that sounds like a

387
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Versie thing. Like how he says that so
early on. But I got to tell you, uh,

388
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,840
I don't disagree like this is the one
time where I'm like, he's he dude,

389
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,990
this guy's, he's doing shit. Like he
seemed like the Harlem Globe trotters,

390
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:24,730
but he's fucking doing it in a real
game. He's unbelievable. And a,

391
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:28,600
that's on my bucket list to see him live.
I can't go to the game tonight, but, uh,

392
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,800
I definitely want to see him
like when he plays the Lakers,

393
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:35,980
cause I feel like Colby is going to dig
down deep and try to have another one of

394
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,790
his back in the day games, you know. Um,

395
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,330
but it's unreal. So
anyways, uh, not boozing,

396
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,960
not smoking any cigars and a rest and up.

397
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,990
So it's not too hard not to for me.
It's not that hard to just quit booze and,

398
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:55,080
and smoking, uh, when
I'm this tired. But, uh,

399
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,070
I got a feeling of,
you know,

400
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:02,030
there's a place down the fucking street
somebody told me about has got this

401
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:04,190
cognac that's like, I dunno.
I Dunno what happened.

402
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:08,900
Like fucking Louis the 14th get whacked
in the back of the head and his fucking

403
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:12,400
cognac slid down his sock and into a
fucking hole and somebody found anyway,

404
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,060
somebody got a bottle
of this shit. So, uh,

405
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm already thinking I got to go
down to try. What are you doing bill?

406
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,540
The fuck are you doing? What's, what's,
what's, what's wrong with you? Um,

407
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,810
but anyways, I'm not doing any
standard. I'm not doing shit,

408
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:29,220
so I really don't have anything
to fucking talk about. Oh,

409
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:32,930
did you guys see that fucking Guy School?
Those two people on uh,

410
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,720
on, uh, he schooled me too by
the way on my saying schools,

411
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:41,300
I'm not too fucking old to say that.
Um,

412
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,600
made some great points that the people
on CNN could not refute when he was

413
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:51,440
talking about people who are just blaming
the Muslim religion for terrorism.

414
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,550
Like everybody there,

415
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,270
everyone who's a Muslim wants to fucking
mutilate women and do all this fucking

416
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,830
shit.
This guy was just strong.

417
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,230
Yeah.

418
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,490
These two people on CNN and what blew my
mind is in a lot of ways the people on

419
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:10,491
CNN when it came to the Muslim religion
where justice uninformed as I am in a

420
00:25:11,581 --> 00:25:13,720
lot of ways,
like a,

421
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,050
okay.

422
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,930
You know, when they were talking about
those mutilating women shit, hey,

423
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,490
the guy's just going like, yeah,
that happens in this country,

424
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:26,690
in this like Sudan as see named like
two African countries and they're like,

425
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,610
yeah, that was a Muslim countries.
He goes, no, they're not.

426
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:29,660
They're Christian countries.

427
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,110
And he really just broke it down
where it's not the religion,

428
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:37,640
it's depending on what country they
would trash and like Turkey or something

429
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,580
like kind of lump them in and he goes,
no, they don't do that in Turkey.

430
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,010
They don't mutilate women and Turkey.
They actually,

431
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:46,580
there's women rights and they've elected
more women to positions of political

432
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:50,570
power, you know, intelligent
and informed, logical,

433
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,560
like thought as opposed to these
morons that think that they're tough.

434
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,970
Who Go, we'd go to fuck, wipe them all
out to go to fucking kill everybody.

435
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,030
Fucking,
if you folk religion,

436
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:08,770
you use fucking chill like
dead dumb shit that they,

437
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:13,480
that what's kills me is
that CNN is starting to come
around too and just be like,

438
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:17,780
yeah, this is like a violent religion
and all that. Yeah. Look, look at the,

439
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,470
what kills me,
what fucking kills me,

440
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,510
especially with Christians is the lack of
honesty with your own fucking religion.

441
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,760
Are you really gonna fucking sit there?

442
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,330
Okay.

443
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,670
Cause if you're going to indict these
people because of their religion,

444
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,800
then I could go with you as
far as if you say all religion,

445
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,210
eventually you're going to have some wing
nuts that it's going to cause them to

446
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:46,170
do some fucking shit.
You know what I mean?

447
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,880
You can't as a fucking Krish,
especially a Catholic. I should,

448
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:53,340
I'll just speak for my religion here.
There's fucking

449
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,640
rap sheet.
You know when they fucking,

450
00:26:57,641 --> 00:27:02,641
whenever you watch like an Nyp de blue
or one of those built toto toto shows and

451
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:05,350
they always, there's always
that guy. He's got a rap sheet,

452
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:08,290
a mile long armed robbery,

453
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,020
fucking assault battery,
you know,

454
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,440
twisted park and meters off and spending
the change that are an arcade as kids

455
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:20,230
spend more days in jail that he has out.
That's my religion.

456
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,870
That's my fucking religion. Where
the inquisition, we had the crusades,

457
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
we were in bed with the Nazis,
do you know, Jewish people.

458
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:31,780
And they were trying to track where the
fuck they have debt property went to.

459
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,880
I ended up at the Vatican and
we're like, Oh, oh is that yours?

460
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,270
Oh, sorry. Uh, we will, you know,

461
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,800
we didn't know what was going to win.
So, you know, we kinda had a, you know,

462
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,090
fucking get in bed with Paul
people and uh, sorry about that.

463
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,310
Pedophilia torture. I mean,

464
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:58,570
just horrible shit. Torture,
genocide, you name it, you name it,

465
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,630
go right down the whole
fucking commandments.

466
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:05,350
They've broken every fucking one of them.

467
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,000
And uh,
see that,

468
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:10,510
what does that and that right there
is the kind of thing that makes me a

469
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,240
question, the validity of an
afterlife and being judged.

470
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,200
Okay. Cause that's what they're
peddling, but their actions,

471
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,520
they're not worried about
judgment on any fucking level.

472
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:26,380
So it makes me think that,
you know,

473
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,650
well maybe we just go
into the ground and we,

474
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,930
we decompose and we,
we give life to something else.

475
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,380
You know what I mean? But they
created this mommy and daddy thing,

476
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:42,214
you know,

477
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,900
either going to get an ice cream or get
a spanking to keep everybody in fucking

478
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:49,660
line.
And then maybe they know it's bullshit.

479
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,960
Like maybe when you get high enough in
the church, they just go, all right.

480
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,360
They close the door,
you know,

481
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:59,440
and they're sitting there and that stupid
getups right. And the guy just goes,

482
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:03,070
look,
here's something you need to know.

483
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,240
You can't tell anybody or will deny it
and we'll kill everybody that you know

484
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,100
and that you're related to. All
right, here's the real deal.

485
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,370
He looks left, he looks
right. It looks back at him.

486
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,930
He shrugs his shoulders and he just goes,
we made it all up.

487
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,110
Yeah. Yeah. We just made it up. Not being
good or bad, you know, being good, bad.

488
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,770
Again, it makes sense. It's the
moral compass you're born with,

489
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:33,600
but the whole afterlife is, and we
have no proof. We, we have no idea.

490
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,240
Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. I mean, he lived
by the, you know, we kind of, Eh, we,

491
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,620
we hyped it up a little, kind
of oversold it. You know,

492
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,550
maybe you didn't walk on water maybe.
Yeah.

493
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,410
Maybe waded into it a little bit and
was the first guy to do the butterfly

494
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:55,820
stroke or the backstroke maybe kinda which
back then, no one ever done that. No.

495
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:58,610
We thought to be on their back when
they swam. So that was equivalent to

496
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:05,020
walking on water and they didn't
have leprosy. They just had a,

497
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,450
they sat a rash and it just sort of
cleared up naturally anyways, but I,

498
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,200
they did talk to him, you know,
so whatever. But you know,

499
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,420
it's also why I don't watch the news. I
actually love, that's why I love Facebook.

500
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,370
I'm an old white guy.
I love Facebook.

501
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:23,180
I love going on it and just click it on
the fucking videos and I'll try to get a

502
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:26,030
link out of just don't know how to copy
and paste that ship out of that guy.

503
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,540
I'm just totally fucking

504
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,780
just making sense and not
demonizing everybody over there.

505
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,210
Whenever they start talking like that,
I swear to God, that's just like the,

506
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,060
it's unbelievably ignorant and all that
is, that's just big business talking,

507
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,280
you know, they're all evil or
getting the machine going there.

508
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:51,970
I'll ilow he got to fucking do all this
shit and spent all his fucking money and

509
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,890
then we'll make a ton of money.

510
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:58,030
And when the tab comes along
with giving it to you guys. Yeah,

511
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:03,160
go fuck yourself. I'm sorry.
That's just my own view by the way.

512
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,200
We F is for family trailer is out.

513
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,620
And a thank you everybody
who retweeted it.

514
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,360
We got over a million views
between Facebook and youtube. Uh,

515
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,990
tremendous positive response to it.
I'm very,

516
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:21,640
very excited and um,
my phone is going fucking nuts here.

517
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:26,260
What's going on here?
Um, Oh, you know what?

518
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:29,710

gonna post a clip here to my Twitter.

519
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:31,390
A Cup. Sorry. I got the hiccups.

520
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,530
Unless it happens to when you have burgers
and a fucking ice cream sandwich at

521
00:31:34,531 --> 00:31:39,210
jerk. Um, I'm actually going to
tweet this out right now. Uh,

522
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,010
it's a video of just
showing frank that get the,

523
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:46,570
the character's face and I'm doing the
voice for which is an amalgam of my dad

524
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,460
and everybody's dad in the writer's room
and they have some of the outtakes of

525
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:54,100
some of the shit I said. So, uh, I'm going
to post that today. Um, oh, and also,

526
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,560

I almost forgot the Patrice O'neil,

527
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,150
the fourth annual Patrice
O'Neal comedy benefit. Uh,

528
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,900
the benefit is surviving family members
and also to keep the name alive of the

529
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:09,460
greatest standup comic I ever saw live.
And I'm not understating it at all.

530
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,730
It's going to be Tuesday,
January 26th,

531
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,360

to pay out to rent the fucking building,

532
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,200
which isn't that bad.
Everything else goes to his, uh,

533
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,390
to his loved ones. And, uh, it's been a
tremendous, tremendous success every year.

534
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:28,960
And it's become like this
high school reunion and we
got some new blood in there.

don't know what it's going to be and I'm

555
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:46,350
not the guy who picks it out and you know
I did because it's not arena rock from

556
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:51,180
the 1980s. Um, I am the worst.

557
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm like 15 years behind in music.
You know,

558
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,110
I know a little bit of this
shit just cause, cause I'm

559
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,260
okay.

560
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,270
You know, cause I ride them around
with me every once in a while.

561
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,740
Okay.

562
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,573
I know

563
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:11,250
Dec and only me one thing, right?
So if there's something Yo yo,

564
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,440
Yo, that guy call you on yourself. Uh,

565
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,910
[inaudible] uh,
um,

566
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,530
I do like the drums on that
because I'm a drum nerve. Right.

567
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,120
Goes fucking 16th of 30 seconds to 68th
note triplets on the high hat while they

568
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:32,160
keep the fucking groove the same or you
think I'm not going to go fuck with that

569
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,080
my pajamas.

570
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:34,540
Yeah.

571
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,860
Well it make me a better person. I don't
know. All right. Have a great weekend.

572
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:39,870
You can't sell.
Talk to you right

573
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,743
Monday.

574
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,110
Huh? Maybe to go holiday shopping with
all these fucking maniacs and get pepper

575
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:23,670
sprayed. Cause I'm trying to buy
a juicer. You know I haven't,

576
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I don't have one ounce of fucking
sympathy for any fucking idiot out there.

577
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,660
I don't give a fuck about your
financial goddamn position.

578
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,110
Go make a popsicle stick
house. Okay? Don't fucking go

579
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,110
down to Walmart and sit there with your
God damn fucking big gulps face pressed

580
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:48,571
against the glass trying to run down
a fucking an aisle with foreign other,

581
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:53,410
the crazed maniacs trying to get a
waffle iron. The fuck is wrong with you.

582
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,460
Walk in there like a gentlemen.
All right,

583
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,110
go in there some other time
when it's not fucking mayhem.

584
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,540
It, why don't you do this? Pay
Full price and buy less shit.

585
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,910
Why don't you do that? You know, or
well, let me guess. Is this incidence?

586
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,860
Oh, I'm about to people that don't
have any money. Well then you've just

587
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,600
shit how you know you don't want.

588
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,670
The fastest fucking way to still having
no money is to go down to a fucking

589
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:30,410
department store and buy a ton of shit.

590
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,490
These people that they're there,
they're fucking idiots. You know?

591
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,240
I'm not saying that they weren't blessed
that they didn't get some gifts from a

592
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,390
high up.
I'm not saying that.

593
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:49,130
I'm not saying that some of them can't
sing a song, can't do a dance, uh,

594
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,940
can't fix a fucking motor.
I'm not saying that.

595
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:56,150
This is why I'm saying you're a fucking
idiot because you're buying into the

596
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:57,290
hype the same way.

597
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:02,291
Those stupid fucking nerd cons buy
into this fucking I whatever I pad,

598
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,740
Ipod, the new iPhone,
every fucking God, damn,

599
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:11,741
six months they get themselves all worked
up into this fucking frenzy and they

600
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:14,570
go on the website trying to sell.
How many are there?

601
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,320
How many of there it's,

602
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,260
it's completely,
it's false panic.

603
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,790
It's manmade. I swear to God. You
know what kills me is Walmart has,

604
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,260
has an, I have not been able
to find their reaction, um,

605
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,120
to basically, I mean,
aren't they in a sales way?

606
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,140
Screaming fire in a crowded movie theater.
Isn't this what I mean?

607
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:42,740
Every fucking year I remember
this security guard got trampled.

608
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:47,741
He had a fucking heart attack guy died
because somebody is trying to go down and

609
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:51,440
buy a fucking he man doll for half price,

610
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:52,971
you know,

611
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,940
so somebody can pop the head off and
have a toddler get it lodged in their

612
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,600
throat. These are all facts.
People, all this shit's happened.

613
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,630
Alright. Porter ranch. Where
the fuck is porter ranch?

614
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,630
That just sounds like the one of
those, none of those states, right?

615
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,070
Just a good old boy,

616
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,730
mayor.
Meaning no harm.

617
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:17,731
Went down to the Walmart to get some
fucking chaps and his shadow on our man.

618
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,910
Gotten his challenger and
Lily fucking drove away.

619
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,640
What the fuck is it? I lost it. Woman
pepper sprayed porter ranch. All right.

620
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:31,390
Porter ranch.
Uh,

621
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,820
would you like balsamic vinegar Grad
or would you like the porter ranch?

622
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,360
Here we go. Uh, Yukon Porter ranch.
Now that's fucking Los Angeles.

623
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,340
Get the fuck outta here is in a fluid
neighborhood and the northwest region of

624
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:49,660
the San Fernando Valley. See, look at
me getting exposed for the moron. I am.

625
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,740
That's even worse.
You know,

626
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:57,160
I refuse to believe that rich people went
down to a fucking Walmart with pepper

627
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,380
spray.
I'm not buying this one.

628
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,400
Have they seen the lady
who did it anyways?

629
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,140
People stop buying into this fucking crap.
You know,

630
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,500
take some power back in your own life.

631
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,860
You know what you should do
on Black Friday? Stay home.

632
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,490
Saint Patrick's Day. A bunch
of poop morons going out,
drinking their faces off,

633
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,181
being loud,

634
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:26,470
the green allegate as in these stupid
songs with plastic hats and they heads and

635
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:29,680
eventually they're either going to punch
you in the face or throw up on your

636
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:34,630
shoes. Stay home like a
fucking gentlemen. Go Out,

637
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,260
go down to the liquor store,
get yourself a nice bottle of Scotch,

638
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:42,700
have a few friends come over, you know,
make you corn, beef sandwiches there,

639
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,240
you know, and then watch
some fucking Irish mob movie.

640
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,260
Go Watch state of grace of some shit.
I don't fucking know. But you know,

641
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:54,210
go down there for that horse shit.
You don't go out on Valentine's,

642
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,410
go on a Valentine's,

643
00:39:56,411 --> 00:40:00,520
go get yourself Sushi that's been
marked up 300% go fuck yourself.

644
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:05,500
You go out on the 15th I can't say
I love you on that day. You know,

645
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,080
independent thought people
on a very low level.

646
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,690
I'm not reinventing the wheel.

647
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,550
I'm just realizing there's other days in
the year where you can go and walk into

648
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:23,140
a store and buy a fucking Flowbee without,

649
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,060
they'll get run through with the
fucking swifter mop handle. Ah,

650
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:30,530
US just should have said swifter.

651
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,320
There's a lesson in comedy without
getting run through by a fucking swifter.

652
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,440
That would have been funny,
but I was,

653
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,140
I've got run through whether
it's swift or mop handle.

654
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,350
It's like I was in a band and I
stopped fucking late. Oh, Jesus.

655
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,820
Oh Jesus. Bill, you can't even say
it funny. Let's read about this.

656
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,860
Porter ranch. All right. Porter ranch,

657
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,670
the woman accused of shooting pepper
sprayed other customers at a busy Walmart

658
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:58,360
store in Porter ranch,
injuring 20 was described by police.

659
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,590
Today is about five foot,

660
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:04,591
three inches tall between the ages of
30 to 38 with black hair and brown eyes.

661
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,830
A police do not have a description of
the vehicle. The woman was driving. Well,

662
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:13,820
I'd like to make a guess if I could.
Um,

663
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,010
I'm going to say she was driving
some sort of Chrysler vehicle,

664
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,630
probably some rusted out cab
forward designed, you know,

665
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,700
with one of the tail lights, you know,
the backup lights hanging down. Um,

666
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,440
Los Angeles police department.

667
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,130
Fucking detective said
detectives are actively

668
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,210
working on the case but are not expected
to receive surveillance video from

669
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:43,211
Walmart until early next week
because of technical glitches.

670
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,920
How hilarious is that?

671
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,760
Okay.

672
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,050
I bet if that bitch went in there and
rob the fucking store cleaned out all the

673
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,640
registers, how quickly to think Walmart
when it got that video over. Yeah.

674
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:59,520
You know we can,
we don't have technical glitches.

675
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,610
That's how fucking powerful Walmart is.
They just told the cops to stand down.

676
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,190
We'll get you the video when our
lawyers are dumb looking at it.

677
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,690
That's what the fuck that means.

678
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,350
The how much money we generate
for this community officer.

679
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,223
Huh?

680
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,990
I live in a gated community with my own
fucking private police force that has

681
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,160
better guns than yours.

682
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,910
We'll get you the video when we're
good and God damn fucking ready.

683
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,160
No wonder Walmart hasn't made a comment.

684
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,033
Okay.

685
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,551
You know,

686
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:36,540
they never used to have this shit when
I was a kid or at the very least it was

687
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:39,960
never reported. You know,
they'd start to have sales,

688
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:44,940
but it wasn't this fucking mania.
I'm an asshole.

689
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,990
I got to do that next year.
Next year I'm going to hire a camera crew,

690
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,100
okay.

691
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,010
And I'm going to go down there and I went
to just fucking start talking to these

692
00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:56,920
people and ask him what is
all the excitement about?

693
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,330
What do you think is in there
that's gonna make your life better?

694
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,310
Huh?
What do you think's in there

695
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,590
and don't give you the sad sack fucking
story about how you got kids and it's

696
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:15,320
Christmas time. And if there's no
presence under the fucking tree,

697
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:17,180
what's going to happen? Gee, I don't know.

698
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,290
Okay.

699
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:23,820
Biggie small seed to make it work.
Didn't he?

700
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,700
He just rapped about being broke
and everyone related to it.

701
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,970
And then he made a soul, a bunch
albums, and then he got shot. All right.

702
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:33,460
That was a bad example.
Um,

703
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,620
look,
all I'm saying is this,

704
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,383
all right.

705
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,990
There's no reason.
You know,

706
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,500
you're probably thinking that
I'm trashing you for going.

707
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,150
I just don't want you,

708
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,720
I want you to just have
fucking respect for yourself.

709
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,270
Like those fucking idiots when they go
to a Goddamn game and they'll skip and

710
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:03,800
jackass has come out with the free
tee shirts and everybody reaching over

711
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:04,634
everybody.

712
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,970
Okay.

713
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,830
I just wish once I could just have some
sort of crowd mind control and as they

714
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:14,380
sat there, you know skipping
around with their eyebrows up

715
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,310
like ha ha,
do you want it?

716
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,490
Everybody just sort of sits there staring
back at them until it's so fucking

717
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:22,881
awkward.

718
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,360
They just have to throw it and then
it just sort of lands in the aisle and

719
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:31,160
nobody picks it up. Right.
Then of course the people,

720
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,100
the arenas like,

721
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,840
well someone's going to trip on that.

722
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:37,200
We're going to get sued and then they
got to send those skip and Jack asses to

723
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:40,200
go pick up all the tee shirts that nobody
wanted and then they're left with the

724
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:43,620
fucking truck load of them.
That's what I would like to see happen.

725
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,020
Shop trying to get me excited about
shit you at Walmart has in it.

726
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,800
It has a bunch of shit. What do
they really have in their bicycles?

727
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,450
Forming grills. Shack. It's rakes.

728
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,500
What else do they got?
Fucking DVD player. I mean,

729
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:04,350
you can't get one of those for
$9 on the Goddamn Internet.

730
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,820
Okay.

731
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,360
I Dunno.

732
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,530
I just think if you're in a financial
position where you have to risk being

733
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:13,640
trampled to death,

734
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:19,040
where you basically have to go to the
store version of the running of the Bulls

735
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,470
to get a God damn fucking,
I dunno.

736
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,220
Grilled cheese maker are running
out of dumb shit to talk about.

737
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,660
Okay.

738
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,360
Or a playstation or whatever the
fuck it is. If you have to do that,

739
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:36,260
you can't afford it. And if you
go out and buy the fucking thing,

740
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,080
he just sticking yourself
further behind the fucking rock.

741
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,860
Why don't you just have a couple of
light Christmases so then he can have a

742
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:46,970
better Christmas. You know, why don't
you do that instead of doing what?

743
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:51,290
All these fucking dump concent, that
real housewife wife show, do you know,

744
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:55,730
pay for that cash money. Those fucking
morons who do not understand money,

745
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,803
you know?

746
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,600
Oh, I'm on my soapbox this week. Okay.

747
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,953
Yeah.

748
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,840
Just live with nothing for awhile.
As long as you can fucking eat.

749
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,590
And you got plenty of water,
you find,

750
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,730
do you realize if you have
enough to eat and you have water,

751
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,930
do you realize that you're,

752
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,960
you're living better than probably a
third of the world just doing that,

753
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,630
having a place to take a shit,

754
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,100
having clothes on your back,
having toothpaste and toothbrush.

755
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:36,100
Do you understand how
fucking far ahead you are?

756
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,870
You don't need any of that shit.
And yes, it's nice to have,

757
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,000
but it's not worth going down there

758
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,690
in fallen down and having your wig fall
off or your fucking ass crack hanging

759
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:49,751
out.

760
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:54,751
All this shit that I've seen dislocate
and your knee having some poor bastard

761
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,880
trying to hold people back and has
a heart attack and he dies. Oh,

762
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,060
you saw som too small.
I need a competitive edge.

763
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,100
Let me go get some bear mace.

764
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,340
Okay.

765
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,310
Like do you want to stand like how
caught up into the fucking frenzy you are

766
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:11,400
that you make those goddamn decisions.
You know what? You need to be down there.

767
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,900
Just go down to a fucking,
uh,

768
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,270
Oscoe drug to those things still exist.

769
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,470
Whatever happened to the old
days, leach mayors. Remember that?

770
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,120
He's talking about that with some buddies
yesterday. Go down a leach mirrors.

771
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,150
What'd you go down to the lumber yard?
Go make some toys. Like a fucking else.

772
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:33,570
Yeah.

773
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,403
Anything.

774
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,000
Anything you know other than,

775
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,950
I mean, couldn't you just go like,
look, we don't have to say to your kids,

776
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:48,300
we don't have money for Christmas
this year. All right, we don't,

777
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:51,500
but I do have money. Take you to a ball
game. I'll take us all out to a ball game.

778
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,040
All right? It just know this. We're
going to have better Christmases,

779
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,010
but the most important thing is that
we're all together and we all love each

780
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:01,470
other and that we don't get trampled

781
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:08,040
by some hot dog eating jackass with a can.
A fucking bear mace.

782
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:13,800
It's more important to me
fucking showing up Christmas,

783
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,941
you know,

784
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:18,510
dressed up as Santa Claus
with a dislocated shoulder
and your fucking eyes are

785
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:23,490
all red. Oh, Ooh, don't hug.

786
00:48:23,491 --> 00:48:27,540
Santa said hurts. Um, I don't know.

787
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:29,640
I'm sure I'm going to get some
fucking hate mail over this.

788
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,180
That was so insensitive to
people who don't have money.

789
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,260
I know they don't have money, but
they have fucking brains. Bill,

790
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,620
why do you always only have one TV?
Cause I live within my means,

791
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,530
which is why I don't go
down to black Friday.

792
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:47,430
Get trampled by some fucking big gulp.
Top of shit with a can of mace. All right.

793
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,990
Those people who got mace date
that that lady did them a favor.

794
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,880
Do you think any of those consequent
going to come back next Friday or next

795
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:59,130
black Friday? You think they're going
to come down there for that shit?

796
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:01,830
They're not. They got the
beat down. They deserved.

797
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,460
Which brings me to our one and
only youtube video of the week.

798
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:26,191
Did you guys see the,

799
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:31,191
the beat down and Mcdonald's with that
dude was standing there and these two

800
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:35,120
ladies came into the Mcdonald's.

801
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,750
It's the one right down there on uh,
uh,

802
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,620
you get off the west fourth street eat
train right there down in the village,

803
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,860
you know, two blocks over at Joe's pizza.
That's a good slice of pizza. All right,

804
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,900
right. Did you come out of there and spike
Lee's probably filming people playing

805
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:55,690
basketball and handball go,
well yo get your New York City right.

806
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,990
I trashed him on Twitter yesterday. He
was talking shit about my Boston Celtics,

807
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,250
you know,
so I,

808
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,390
I said something but I kept
at funny hoping that he
would still put me in one of

809
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:06,890
his movies,
you know,

810
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,270
and I could either play a complete nerdy
white guy who doesn't understand black

811
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:13,070
people or an over the top racist.

812
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,100
Um, anyways, I give a fuck,
get me in a movie, I'll do it.

813
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,720
So anyways, that Mcdonald's down there,
so these two ladies, they walk into the,

814
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,710
okay and they try and buy a goddamn
big Mac and a happy meal and they,

815
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:37,700
they, they throw a $50 bill
on the counter right there.

816
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,140
Major Red Flag.

817
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:44,850
Who the fuck pays for McDonald's with a
$50 bill who even has $50 and it's going

818
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:49,790
to go into Mcdonald's?
Nobody,

819
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,390
there's not been a $50 bill in Mcdonald's
since they started that fucking place.

820
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:01,970
So these ladies try to pass this 50 and
the guy behind the counter and he starts

821
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:05,240
looking at the 50 and he's like,
excuse me ladies,

822
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,750
I don't think that this is real.
So they go, listen motherfucker,

823
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,730
you better give us a God damn
fish fillet and uh, whatever,

824
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:17,780
quarter pounder with cheese and give us
a fucking change or we're going to fuck

825
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:20,270
you up. And he said, um, I don't think so.

826
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:22,580
And then this girl just
hauls off and slaps the guy,

827
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,140
slapped some and then the other one and
then she climbs up over the counter.

828
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:31,280
Now the other one just starts just really
slowly just walking around the counter

829
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,390
like, well I guess we got to fuck
this guy up. This is what we do.

830
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,130
And the guy backs up into the fryer later
area and I don't know where the fuck

831
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:44,270
he found this God damn lead pipe.
It was like a car.

832
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:48,650
Do you know like in the cartoons when
bugs bunny would just sorta, you know,

833
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:49,880
he'd be standing sideways,

834
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:53,480
you'd save a side view and he'd have a
problem and he would just turn it to it.

835
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:57,110
To the blind side and all of a sudden
he'd have a giant hammer and he hit Elmer

836
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,210
Fudd over their head. You'd be like,
where the fuck did that come from?

837
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,290
Was that leaning up against his right
rabbit leg? And I didn't see it.

838
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,420
How did Elmer Fudd not fucking see it?

839
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,850
How would that gigantic head of his,
how did he not view that as a threat?

840
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:15,050
This guy did the real life version
of that. He was backing up,

841
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:18,950
backing up and he was next to some French
fries and next thing you know he's got

842
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:21,890
this lead pipe.
Oh.

843
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,560
And he just fucking starts wearing
these girls out with it. Bam, Bam,

844
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,140
Bam. I got to give it up to those
girls. They took a good three,

845
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:35,141
four each and then they disappeared under
the counter and he just keeps fucking

846
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:39,680
hitting him. Bam, Bam, Bam.
And this lady's got what's

847
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,920
and he just keeps fucking going like a
fucking like this bitch is screaming.

848
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,570
It's like those little Doggie toys,

849
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,450
you know those little Doggie
toys that squeak that you know,

850
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:56,850
you make those little noises.
You know why dogs get so excited?

851
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,220
Cause it sounds like a
fucking animal dying.

852
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,790
It taps into their wild animal side.

853
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:06,450
So this bitch is thinking she's helping
shit. She should have been like,

854
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:09,510
excuse me, is that something you
really want to do instead? She's gone

855
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,480
and this guys, he just fucking,
he won't stop hitting him.

856
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,330
Will Not Stop fucking hitting him.
All right?

857
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,610
So you know the shit works.
Fucking two ladies attack guy.

858
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,890
It doesn't make a difference.

859
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:29,570
They can sit there and slap you
around like you're a fucking cartoon.

860
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,140
You're supposed to be like, they're
women. I need to respect them.

861
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,680
This guy said fuck that.
Fuck that.

862
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:41,710
And like bugs bunny turned to the side
and there was this magic lead pipe and he

863
00:53:42,111 --> 00:53:44,660
fucking kicked the shit
out of both of them.

864
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,490
So of course he gets arrested for assault.
Um,

865
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:54,140
and I got to admit, I was
totally supporting what he
was doing through the first

866
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:59,370
three seven hits.
It's the last 19 then I'm just like,

867
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:02,220
all right. All right. Okay. Okay.

868
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,780
Neil was saying he actually was like that
dude and drive when he stomped at kids.

869
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,780
That guy's head in and the elevator,
he kind of went to that level,

870
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,480
but at the end of the day I'm like,
well,

871
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:17,370
that's why you don't go around slapping
people in the fucking face because they

872
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:22,371
might have gone to magician school and
they know how to magically have a fucking

873
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:25,410
goddamn lead pipe on a nowhere.
All right,

874
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:27,810
so this guy is going to trial and
I'm thinking there's no fucking way.

875
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,180
Then you find out this
dude actually has a record.

876
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,610
This guy went to jail for manslaughter,
all right?

877
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:41,750
And he got out and there's only two
places that you can get a job after you've

878
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:43,620
gone to jail for manslaughter.

879
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,860
You can either get into show business
or you can work at Mcdonald's,

880
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,070
all right? You can't get a
job at fucking Macy's there.

881
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:00,050
There is a glass ceiling when you
go to jail for fucking manslaughter.

882
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,240
That's it. Unless your dad owns a
company, you can get into sales.

883
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:05,340
You can sell somebody a
fucking piece of shit car,

884
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,020
but you're not selling a Mercedes.

885
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,970
You're going to be at a Sam's hot
car lot down the street, all right?

886
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:17,040
Reservoir dogs. Anybody.
That's why right there, okay.

887
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:21,330
Before even continue talking
about the story, that right there,

888
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,280
ladies and gentlemen,

889
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,640
is why you don't walk around slapping
perfect strangers in the face.

890
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:34,380
It's because you don't know
their backstory. You don't
know what they've done.

891
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,600
You don't know what
they're capable of doing.

892
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,640
This is a guy who already took somebody's
life and you're looking at him like,

893
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,550
oh, hey, what's up? Their
mic? French fry guy.

894
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,820
Take this 50 or I'm going
to slap the Shit Outta you.

895
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,110
And you don't realize that this
guy has been in fucking prison.

896
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,233
All right?

897
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:59,310
He probably knows how to turn that
piece of paper with Ulysses s grant.

898
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:04,230
He turned that into a fucking
shank. Somehow he figured
out how to fucking do it.

899
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,153
You know what I mean?

900
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:11,270
So these two ladies get an unbelievable
life lesson in why you can't walk around

901
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:20,910
acting like you're some
action hero in real life.

902
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,110
So anyway, so it goes trial and I
can't fucking believe it. I'm like,

903
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:28,860
there's no way this guy's not getting
convicted. He's fucking, he's a guy.

904
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,740
He beat down to women with a fucking pipe.

905
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,520
He went above and beyond with this
shit. And he's, he has a record.

906
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,760
It's fucking over right over.
He's not rich,

907
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,730
you know, it's over. This guy is going
to jail. I can't fucking believe it.

908
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,090
He got off,
the guy got acquitted.

909
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,870
So for once on the podcast,

910
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,630
I'm actually happy and
I can tell you this,

911
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,440
if they convicted him of a lesser
charge because he just kept hitting,

912
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,210
I wouldn't have been mad cause I would
have been like, dude, they were down,

913
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,320
they were fucking down and they were
down and then they were part of the tile

914
00:57:15,321 --> 00:57:19,640
and you was still fucking hitting him.
Uh, we have this clip, by the way, um,

915
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,140
on the podcast page has now been
turned over the new fan page.

916
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:28,220
It's just bill bird.com. You
just go to my podcast page. Um,

917
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:33,580
and anyways, we'll have the video up
there and all that shit. So anyway, she,

918
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,570
um, he got off and they
charge the women was shit.

919
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:42,260
And I don't think that they're getting
off the property get lesser because there,

920
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,470
because they're women, you know
what I mean? And that's just,

921
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,760
women always get less
time, it seems, you know,

922
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:53,120
because at the end of the
day, the judge thinks, well,

923
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:54,470
maybe if I give him a little less time,

924
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,440
they'll come over here and blow me under
my robe. I don't know what the deal is.

925
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,940
I told you this story a few weeks ago
when I saw that this amazing trumpet

926
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:04,760
player, you know, and I was like,
man, I never heard of this guy.

927
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:09,761
And I find out he was murdered by his
fucking girlfriend in 1972 and she got out

928
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:12,530
of jail in 1978

929
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,003
okay.

930
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,990
I would go to jail longer for parking
tickets. Then she did for killing a guy,

931
00:58:21,991 --> 00:58:25,950
shot him right up on the bandstand,
took out a gun and fucking shut this.

932
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:27,660
They had an argument.
She left,

933
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,860
she came back with the gun and she shot
this dude on the fucking band, Stan,

934
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,990
all these God damn witnesses.

935
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,120
And she did that in
[inaudible] 72 it was out by 78

936
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,310
so let's just say they, they, they
went, they flew through her trial,

937
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,240
set a right to trial.
She still only did five and a half years.

938
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,460
I Dunno. I Dunno how
that fucking works. Um,

939
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,820
and I bet she was able to forgive herself,

940
00:58:56,821 --> 00:59:00,600
the fucking sociopath that she is and
she was able to go on and live her life

941
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,900
and then that guy is in the ground
cold is his God damn trumpet.

942
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,603
Yo

943
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,650
don't know

944
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,610
if vice for the week number one belt,
my wife and I

945
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,700
are both workout people, triathlons,
half marathons, et cetera.

946
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,750
You guys are going to get his and her
hip replacements and your fucking early

947
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:47,700
sixties, uh, last year we
started attending a class.
I'll do, this is fucked up.

948
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:53,910
I remember this one last year we started
attending a class to help with this,

949
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,890
uh, to help with this or are working out
and the instructors seemed like a good

950
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:02,730
shit. We got along great and he
works for the same company we do.

951
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,790
This is a huge company in,
I'm not going to say where,

952
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:10,710
so it's not like he sits next
to me or something. Anyway,

953
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,970
we really enjoyed this guy's class and
he would email all the people that took

954
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:18,690
the class regularly, telling them what
they needed for that day's class weights,

955
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:22,740
uh, Matt, jump rope, et
cetera. It's P90x oriented. Uh,

956
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,910
since we were both on the mailing
lists, we knew, uh, his email address.

957
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,780
I started to see these things happening.
Um,

958
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:34,830
my wife was emailing him a lot.
He was emailing her a lot.

959
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,320
It was a conversation between them via
work, email, which is okay, I guess.

960
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,340
But then they started texting each other,
oh,

961
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,120
GG.

962
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,760
And it was frequent.
I come downstairs and hear a phone,

963
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,360
snapchat and I'd say,
who you talking to?

964
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,310
She would always say no one or just
checking my messages, et Cetera.

965
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,700
Being that I'm a system
engineer and technology,

966
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:06,650
I called bullshit and proceeded to
capture her passwords on the laptop

967
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:11,450
downstairs. Jesus Christ. He goes, I
know, but I wanted to see what was up.

968
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,750
So I got a password logged into her
phone account online and Lo and behold,

969
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,870
she was texting this guy back
and forth. First of all, do it.

970
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,520
How did you capture her password?
This is why I don't bank online.

971
01:01:25,521 --> 01:01:29,480
I don't do any of that shit. This is
the kid's a secure site. No, it isn't.

972
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,720
Um,
anyways,

973
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,330
so he finds out that
she's texting this dude.

974
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,610
Both of them are texting back and forth
and he says, I'm not just saying, uh,

975
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,461
during the day,

976
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:45,440
a few times I'm saying throughout the
day and up until 11:00 PM at night,

977
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:50,390
even after midnight and while
I'm lying in bed next to her,

978
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,230
she would always get pissed if I said
anything about who the fuck are you

979
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:57,110
talking to at 11:00 PM?
Um,

980
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,080
we became mutual friends with
this person from the start.

981
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,150
And I asked some girls I knew and some
guys and some guys that I that both knew

982
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:07,790
him and they both said,
yeah, you need to address it.

983
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,970
So I called the dude one
night and pretty much said,

984
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,310
stop fucking texting my
wife at night. Uh, are,

985
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,860
are you and I are going to have a problem.
And he immediately shut it down.

986
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:22,940
This guy, five, seven, 150 pounds
and not some stutter or anything.

987
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:26,930
I'm six [inaudible] 200 pounds.
It could easily stomp his ass out.

988
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,323
Um,

989
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,420
okay.

990
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,050
Oh, let's see. He's an endurance
runner, not some super jacked guy.

991
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:38,040
He immediately stopped and every time I
saw him in the locker room or the gym,

992
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,580
he was very cautious
around me and way too nice.

993
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:46,530
Almost like it was his
way of saying sorry oof,

994
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:51,240
everything's stopped after that. My
question is, was I right doing this,

995
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,490
addressing it with him?
Uh,

996
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,560
basically texting has blurred the lines
between what's okay and what's not.

997
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,660
Guys and girls always say, oh, it
was just a text, but no big deal.

998
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,340
But I think that's horseshit.

999
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:06,843
MMM.

1000
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,530
It's this,
it's the same as a phone call to me.

1001
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:14,040
So if you want to call my wife while
I'm in bed with her, go for it.

1002
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,590
But they won't.
Texting is a bitch move,

1003
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:20,500
which is why so many people get busted
doing it. If they were with a want to,

1004
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:24,300
eem emailed each other at work and
discuss workout routines, I get it.

1005
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,610
But having that instant
connection through your phone,

1006
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:29,580
no matter where they are is a little odd.

1007
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,650
Especially while I'm in
bed right next to her.

1008
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,280
Am I wrong for putting this bitch
in line and telling him to stop it?

1009
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,730
Uh, yeah, dude.

1010
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,390
You know what?

1011
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:43,470
The only reason why you're asking me if
you're wrong is because you busted your

1012
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:47,760
fucking wife. And right now she's
mine. Fucking you manipulating you,

1013
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,110
trying to get you

1014
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,930
she, she's basically almost done.
It. Almost flipped it around.

1015
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,960
You were actually questioning,

1016
01:03:55,961 --> 01:04:00,961
am I fucking wrong for four
fucking catching my wife
texting with this other guy

1017
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,600
at 11 o'clock at night.
Get,

1018
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:08,530
there's only one reason you text somebody
at 11 o'clock at night. Two reasons.

1019
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:11,260
Either you ran out of gas.
Oh, you trying to fuck them.

1020
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,880
That's the only two reasons people
text at that fucking hour than I.

1021
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:18,010
He's trying to fuck your wife.
All right.

1022
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,960
And I don't know what's up with
your wife. Okay? Cause you're going.

1023
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,210
Who are you texting? Oh, nobody right
there. The fact that she goes, oh,

1024
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:28,090
nobody in slams the fucking
phone shot right there.

1025
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,730
She knows she's doing something
that ain't fucking cool.

1026
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:34,810
This is a very fucking touchy subject.
All right?

1027
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:40,380
Because this involves the woman cheating
and guys solve problems with violence.

1028
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,600
So I'm not trying to fucking
egg you on here, sir,

1029
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,340
but you definitely did the right thing
and that's really a what the fuck

1030
01:04:48,341 --> 01:04:52,900
situation that you're in. That
ain't fucking cool. All right,

1031
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:57,840
I'm going to step outside
of your situation now, sir.
All right. Other than that,

1032
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:02,860
say that you 100% did the right thing
and do not let her fucking worm her way

1033
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:04,454
out of it.

1034
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:05,610
Okay?

1035
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,540
All right.
Personally speaking now,

1036
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,420
now I'm talking about make
stepping away from this story.

1037
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:15,850
If I caught my girl doing it,
that's a fucking rap. It's over.

1038
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:20,170
The relationship is fucking go fuck
yourself. All right, it's over.

1039
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:24,100
It's over. I know where the fuck this is
going. I know where the hell this is. Lee.

1040
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:27,280
What the fuck he Texas guy for 11 o'clock
at night. You want to suck his dick?

1041
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,130
Why?
W w what was he telling you?

1042
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:33,370
How to do the the perfect
jumping Jack at 1130 at night?

1043
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,180
He couldn't tell you that.
If four he has to email you,

1044
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:41,020
text you fucking 9,000 times during the
course of the day to tell you how to do

1045
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,680
a fucking pushup. Give me a fucking
break. You're flirting with this guy.

1046
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:49,750
You want to fuck them.
So relationship is over.

1047
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:54,670
Happy fucking
bum buddied up on Mudita.

1048
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:00,010
Mudita right. That be trails too. You
get the fuck out of here. It's over.

1049
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,690
That's that's,
that's how you got to handle it.

1050
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:09,691
Then the same way fucking Colbys wife
when she busted him cheating rather than

1051
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:13,300
taking that big tweety bird
diamond that she got from him.

1052
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,700
Sheets that right there, the relationship,
it's fucking over. It's fucking over.

1053
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,960
Trust is gone. It's fucking over. But he's
worth hundreds of millions of dollars,

1054
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:27,130
which for some reason she's entitled
to half of it. So she stuck around.

1055
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,280
She stuck around,

1056
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:34,320
put in her 10 years now he has to pay
for her fucking life for the rest of her

1057
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:39,070
life. He has to fucking support her, but
she's a God damn child and it's legal.

1058
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,160
Somebody please justify that.
I'll never get over it. People,

1059
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,420
I'll keep going back to it.

1060
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:47,350
To one of you motherfuckers can morally
justify the reasoning behind that

1061
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:48,184
fucking law.

1062
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:53,310
Please stop wasting my time by telling
me what the law is in speculating.

1063
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,370
Well, at the tables were flipped,
Colby, what had done ad caught caught.

1064
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:03,130
I'm not saying who would have
done what I'm saying morally.

1065
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:07,540
Tell me the reasoning behind
that fucking law. Okay.

1066
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,250
The only thing I can think of is that
back in the day guys would start families

1067
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:16,270
and then jump on the horse and say, I'm
fucking Outta here. And they just left.

1068
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:20,290
And then you had this poor woman with
four kids and they were in poverty.

1069
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:24,310
I get that. You want to fucking avoid
that. Okay. If that's what the justify,

1070
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,950
if you're going to try and
justify it that way, I get it.

1071
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,860
But what I would like to
introduce is a, is a, uh,

1072
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,080
a new modification of that law
with is some sort of salary cap.

1073
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:40,990
Okay. I don't think just because you
married somebody who's rich, man or woman,

1074
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:45,790
that that gives you the fucking right to
sit on your goddamn ass for the rest of

1075
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:50,410
your fucking life and get arrogant license
plates say in his money, her money.

1076
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,830
I didn't pay for it. Ha
ha ha. I mean right there.

1077
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,180
You wonder why people get killed.
That's the kind of shit right there.

1078
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,270
That's two minutes for
instigating right there.

1079
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,200
If he comes over and fucking slaps
the Goddamn spit out of your mouth,

1080
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,430
what did you do it? Look at her license
plate, your honor. Eh? You know what?

1081
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:11,260
That makes sense.
The fuck is wrong with you.

1082
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,830
What do you have that license plate for?
That's not how it works.

1083
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,780
I don't care that she's being a cunt.
That's no excuse for treating or like one

1084
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:31,923
hello.

1085
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,103
No,

1086
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:55,883
no.

1087
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,180
Geez.
