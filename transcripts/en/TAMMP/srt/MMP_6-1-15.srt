1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:00,931
Hey,

2
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:05,070
what's going on is bill burr and it's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,570
UH, June 1st, 2015.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,580
How's it going everybody? How, why? Yeah,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,020
how are things that is good.
Um,

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,430
I apologize for a last
Thursday's podcasts.

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,200
I guess I recorded it in Mono,

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,100
which was just on I guess
not stereo is what I learned.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,220
I don't know if I'm doing it again because
I don't know how to use my recorder

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
and I am currently not in the United
States, so I don't know any nerds.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,110
I'm where I'm at.
Where am I at right now?

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,140
You asked [inaudible] I am in Paris,

13
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:44,190
France.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,290
stake in pumps.
Free Bull [inaudible] Helge ohm frame.

16
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,640
All may know. Um, yeah, I'm over here. Uh,

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,830
I dunno. What the fuck, what else am I
going to do? I tell shit jokes in a mall.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,630
Government takes all my fucking money.
I might as well blow a little on myself.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,110
I'm over here with the lovely Nia and uh,

20
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:17,850
we actually just got here and uh,
we're going to be here for whatever,

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,510
seven, 10 days. You know what's cool
man? I'm actually going to go to the, uh,

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,930
the Roland Garros the fucking
French Open on the clay,

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,050
going to go to the, uh, going
to go to a game at some point.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,480
Going to go over their scalp some
tickets. That's going to be fun, right?

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,800
Talking to some fucking French scalper
this goddamn Bahrain is stripe shirt.

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,710
It really wished they'd look like
that, but they don't. So, uh,

27
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:45,600
we just got here to the city.
I'm about maybe 40 minutes ago,

28
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,920
had a decent flight coming over here.
It was a little delayed, but uh,

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,420
this guy in front of us. Oh my
God, you guys think I'm an asshole.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,050
I know you do. I know you do. I know
you think I give ne a ton of Shit.

31
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:03,051
This fucking guy was just one of the most
horrible human beings who still weird.

32
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:07,470
His thing, like he was walking
around like talking to everybody.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Just one of those older guys that
just talks all the time. First of all,

34
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,980
when he sat down, he's
got one of those, uh,

35
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,470
I lived the good life guts or
one of those bodies, you know,

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,430
will your legs and arms are the
exact same size, like super skinny.

37
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,220
And then he's just got
this belly. Um, and he,

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,500
and one of those people that starts
to sit down and then the weight of the

39
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,000
decisions that they've put down,

40
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,700
their mouth just takes over
and then they just give up.

41
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,780
They don't use any leg muscles.
They just collapse into the seat.

42
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,310
And that's what he would
do every time he would,

43
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:43,311
he'd go down about a third of the way and
then just free fall into his chair and

44
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:47,220
then at the top of his lungs
would go, ah, what he sat down,

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,730
which to me was funny. That was just like,
this is an old guy, doesn't give a fuck.

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,340
He's probably going to have a
couple of something, you know,

47
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,920
a couple sasper gorillas on the flight.
But dude,

48
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,930
he was so fucking rude
in Maine to his wife.

49
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,290
He was nasty.

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,860
Yeah.

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,220
He kept telling her to shut up. Like I
tell me to shut up, but I'm joking around.

52
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:14,900
This guy was serious and one
point he goes, he goes, he goes,

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,790
he goes, where my books? And I heard her
mumble something. I guess she said what?

54
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,510
And he just goes, my God, like yelled
at her and then everybody else,

55
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:28,220
he'd walk up to the guy I used to work
for this place. We had a great time there.

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,780
Jay. You're cute. As a button.
Fucking weird as shit. So, um,

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,310
okay.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,230
So we're sitting there and
we're reading right from Osh,

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,890
whatever the fuck they given us.
Uh, I love her. That's it. That,

60
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,950
that's their idea of a dessert cheese.

61
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,000
The fuck is wrong with you.
Put It on a burger,

62
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,200
take this back and go put
it on a birth. Right. Um,

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,080
and then they have like a date and
that's supposed to be like your sugar.

64
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,510
God knows, you know, that's probably
the right way to eat. Who knows?

65
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,420
They're all fucking skinny over here,
but they smoked like a goddamn chimney.

66
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,320
So me, I always think that that's why
they're so skinny. So anyways, um,

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,570
I'm trying to watch a couple of movies,
both my movie thing.

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,950
Every time I go to watch it,

69
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,090
I'll get a half hour and then the dialogue
gets like the audio gets like five

70
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:15,600
minutes behind the movie,
which I guess I deserve.

71
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:18,990
That was my punishment for doing my
last fucking podcast and Manav right.

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,970
Let me make sure this thing is
even recording here. Okay. So, um,

73
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,360
I started watching a cupola with the
late Great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

74
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:34,010
That guy was fucking unbelievable.
I was enjoying the hell out of the movie,

75
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:38,510
first of all because I saw in cold blood
a long time ago with Robert Blake and

76
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,380
somebody else, one of the most
amazingly shot movies. Um,

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,610
well I guess trauma could probably wrote
the book. God knows I don't read. So, um,

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,390
but I knew a little bit of the backstory
and I was really into it and all of a

79
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,960
sudden the audio was like
five minutes behind. Um,

80
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,670
so then I put on Americans

81
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,280
and um,

82
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,070
that was really a joy in that
Bradley Cooper was great.

83
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,630
He was picking everybody off.
I liked how they had the, uh,

84
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,200
soldiers seemed to be talking the way
they would talk, they way they would talk,

85
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,380
you know, it's a bunch of
savages over here and animals,

86
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:20,290
just the way you dehumanize the
enemy and all that type of shit.

87
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,420
I was enjoying the hell out of it, you
know? And I also, I really respect,

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,120
I was almost gonna say archery. What
do you call it? No, that's good.

89
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:32,050
The bow and Arrow. What's, when you're
good with the pistol and a rifle,

90
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,280
what do you want to sharp shooter?
I just really respect,

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,110
I really respect anybody that
is a master of anything and a,

92
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:45,430
and weaponry. I think he's just a
really cool thing, you know what I mean?

93
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,170
Being a fucking snipers bad ass,
just fucking nice throat shot.

94
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,070
She's taking people out, controlling
your breathing and all of that.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,680
I was really getting into it. I'm really
enjoying it. And then all of a sudden,

96
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,460
like the,
you know,

97
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,420
they're going after this butcher guy and
when it was getting really fucking good,

98
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,400
the audio kicked out again. And uh, so I
was like, all right, fuck this. Whatever.

99
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,990
I'm going to go to sleep,
so I start,

100
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm in the middle of sleeping and I hear
this glass hit the floor or something

101
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,800
and the guy,
it's spilled his water,

102
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,690
the nasty guy up front in the row
in front of us or he had spilled a,

103
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,320
his wife had spilled the water and he was,

104
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:27,020
he just started screaming at
the top of his fucking lungs.

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,490
It wasn't like every word. You would just
like, you know, like the way it went,

106
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,000
my box, he would go like that.
He would just be like, oh,

107
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,380
now it's all what you just yet,

108
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,100
I wanted to fucking kill this guy.
He's just,

109
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,150
he was,

110
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,720
he was yelling like he was walking around
in his underwear in his own fucking

111
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:51,830
house and nobody would say
anything to the guy, including me.

112
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,430
I wanted to stand up and be like,
do we stop fucking yelling at your wife,

113
00:06:55,431 --> 00:07:00,080
your old content. There's other
people on the plane. You Nasty God.

114
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:04,840
He was fucking nasty, mean son of a
pitch. Then he goes to get off the plane.

115
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,730
He's walking way out in front of
his wife and that type of shit,

116
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,840
just like just a fucking asshole,
complete asshole.

117
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,370
Other than that, other
than that, it was a, uh,

118
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,600
a nice flight over here. So, you know,
Nia picked out this little apartment.

119
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,090
Little is the key fucking word.
Jesus Christ. He's fucking thing.

120
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:29,060
Napoleon Bang somebody in the
say I'm telling you it's small.

121
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:33,600
You know what I mean? Now seriously,
it's fucking old as hell. And uh,

122
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,990
so everything in here is like, I
guess whoever owns this, you know,

123
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:43,070
they rent them out. So everything is
antique. He goes, he's a real antique.

124
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,900
So he's like, these are very
Betty, uh, dedicate. So you,

125
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,690
you sit down like easy, easy,
easy, uh, the table, you,

126
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,810
you set the bull down easy.
Everything is like, it's like, dude,

127
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:58,010
what the fuck how the fuck apartment
is? I can't sit down. He said,

128
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,930
you know what's funny too?
Cause there's English, you know,

129
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,250
he said the last person who stayed
here was very strong and they kind of

130
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,830
weakened the chair and I wanted
to be like, you mean fat?

131
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,270
But he was a cool guy, man who explained
and everything is that you use the uh,

132
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,690
uh, they stole that is the day the
fatality and it would go dah, Dah, Dah,

133
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,920
that say Yada, Yada, Yada. He had Dah,
Dah, Dah, you liberals, the auto spa.

134
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,280
And so anyways, so we're fucking
over here and I'm sites, um,

135
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,920
my whole thing is my wife's
birthday in a couple of days.

136
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:34,280
So that's why I brought her
over here. And, uh, you know,

137
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,210
when you're as big an asshole as me,
you need to do shit like that, that,

138
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,044
that'll status.

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,180
That shuts him up for a good
two to three days. You know,

140
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:48,800
when you get back, you got a good two to
three days where they're like, you know,

141
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,610
he took me to Paris, I'm
going to, I'll, I'll back off,

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,690
you know, trying to change him
a bitching about shit and um,

143
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,850
you know,
and then it's,

144
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,710
then it's all back to normal and it
doesn't mean shit to other than the,

145
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:05,130
unless you bring it up, which you
have to do, you gotta be like,

146
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:08,460
I just took you to Paris really three
days later you still bitching about it,

147
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,740
you know, you got, I'm telling you,

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,680
they give us like a boxing
match with as a bigger guy,

149
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,140
he just sticks his myth right and right.
And the other dude's face.

150
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,230
That's what you gotta do. You just got
to keep that mic right in their face,

151
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,400
you know? So anyway,
so why would I do that?

152
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,620
It's such a nice city and I got
to take it to that fucking level.

153
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:30,460
I'm really laying in this fucking bed,
this ikea bed next to something that, uh,

154
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,280
Louis the 14th probably fucking, I
dunno, bank some whore on and uh,

155
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,910
they got a, I'm looking
out here, the rooftops,

156
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,500
we've got a five floor walk up each floor,

157
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,200
the fucking stairs,
getting more like angled,

158
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,220
like you'd have to have like 20 beers in
you for these stairs to look straight.

159
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,250
Like, like a lot of these buildings over
here. Super, super, super fucking old.

160
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,320
And they don't do anything to update
and they keep 'em all original. So, uh,

161
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,870
they've settled for like three century,
so it's really weird.

162
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,040
But I'm up here on the fifth floor and
I'm looking out the window here and all I

163
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,210
see is like TV and tennis.
It's Miami,

164
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,310
that Flintstone episode when him and
Barney were gonna get in trouble and they

165
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,080
were driving down the street
and he was last someone,

166
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:17,430
although the wooden TV
antennas by the way, um,

167
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,500
off of the rooftops. So
anyways, whatever, um, um, um,

168
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,710
Pavlin here this week I'm on vacation and,
um,

169
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,270
I had an unbelievable,
a unbelievable month.

170
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,730
I'm still riding high on the whole,
uh, all those shows. I didn't Boston,

171
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:38,820
so, so here's the deal, you know,

172
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,380
and we spend like 10 days here
in France and then writing,

173
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going to be home for like three,
four days.

174
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:49,590
And then I started another tour of the
west coast and that ends up in Vegas.

175
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,170
And then Tucson.
So I'm like,

176
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,930
well there goes my entire June.

177
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,270
So I've been doing the helicopter
lessons and I was done.

178
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,040
I basically been done with ground school,
um,

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
since like February,

180
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,580
but I worked a lot in March and April and
I was studying for the written part of

181
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:14,850
it. So when I did the southern
tour, I really, you know,

182
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,850
that whole month I was studying for
the multiple choice part, I should say,

183
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,600
test that you had to fucking
take. And, uh, as I told you guys,

184
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:26,130
I passed that and then I had, you
know, I was looking at my schedule,

185
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:30,840
I had that run in Boston and then, oh
my June was fucked. And uh, you know,

186
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,810
flying a helicopter is like anything else.
It's like going to the gym.

187
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,930
You don't go for fucking two months,
you're going to come back sucking wind.

188
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,990
So it's like, dude, I got to
fucking put this thing to bed.

189
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,850
So it was just talking to my
instructor. I was like, dude,

190
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,450
I got to take the fucking check ride this
month. I got to do it. And he was like,

191
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,700
I like it. I like it. I like
having a plan, let's do it.

192
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:52,701
So just studied my fucking balls off
this whole month while doing shows.

193
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:57,420
I would literally be in the green room
like reading on fucking airspace and w

194
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,530
when correction angles and all of
that shit. So long story short,

195
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,293
um,

196
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:03,980
yeah,

197
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,020
my check ride was on Saturday.

198
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,970
And your check ride is where you sit
down with the FAA guy for like an hour,

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,240
an hour and a half. And depending on
how you're answering the questions,

200
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:18,680
depends on how long it is. If you
fucking crushing it, it's uh, you know,

201
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:22,330
it can be short as a half hour if it's
a little bit longer, you know, if you,

202
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,410
if you're not quite getting them and
they'll, they'll talk to you more.

203
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,880
And then if you pass that,

204
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,240
then you go out and fly and it's
all these different maneuvers.

205
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,600
And um,
and then if you,

206
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,170
there's this weird thing when you,

207
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,810
you were either a fail or you pass a
bunch of things and you just failed.

208
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:41,561
Like one thing,

209
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:45,190
like if you failed your steep approach or
your hover rado or something like that,

210
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,130
you could pass everything else.
And then when you retook it,

211
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:52,120
you just have to do that one maneuver
and show that you could do it. So,

212
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,090
um,
we're coming right up on it.

213
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,010
And they ended up looking at my log book
and they realized that I was short on

214
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:04,800
my solo time and I was
short on my, uh, uh,

215
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,640
my fucking, um, night flying.

216
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,340
So I had to go down there Friday, I was
taking a Saturday morning at 9:00 AM,

217
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:18,960
so Friday night I go down there all right
around four and I just flew around the

218
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:22,900
traffic pattern. I needed
a, a one point, uh,

219
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,790
I needed a 1.4 and I was flying around,
flying around.

220
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,370
I'll tell him one time I
scared the shit on myself.

221
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,190
I was gripping the throttle too much
and I started my descent and the low rpm

222
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:36,900
horn came on and basically if that drops
below 80%, you just fall out of the sky.

223
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,400
So when that fucking thing comes on,

224
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:42,030
like you just slammed the collective
down and I couldn't figure out why it was

225
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:46,170
doing that. Uh, for like this split
second, I realized I had a death grip,

226
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,500
not really death up. I just had a
two fucking tiny just let go on.

227
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,940
The RPMS came back up.
But you know,

228
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,240
I could have just rolled the rpms on
and couldn't put it down. But you know,

229
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,490
the first, the first time I've been
alone in the helicopter and the law,

230
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:02,220
our pm horn came on and uh,
you know,

231
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,720
kind of like,
you know,

232
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:06,650
I brought it in for a landing and just
kind of sat there on the pad for a second,

233
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:10,140
go and like, all right, fuck it,
don't grab my, is unbelievable.

234
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,570
It's an unbelievable experience.
I can't explain it.

235
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:13,770
When something like that happens,

236
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,720
it's like the adrenaline rush and you're
slightly nauseous and then you plow

237
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:22,980
through it and you feel fucking
awesome about yourself. Um, so anyways,

238
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,300
okay.

239
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,530
So I did all of that and then we did a,
I got my points,

240
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:31,770
I needed 0.7,
so I had a total of 10 hours.

241
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,350
I had my 10 hours of a solo
time and then I forget what it,

242
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,900
how many hours I needed a night flight,
but I was like 0.7 short,

243
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,920
which is a,

244
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,740
yeah,

245
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,970
I dunno, what does that seven
times take? About 40 minutes. Um,

246
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,980
it means basically an hour,
I believe on the Hobbs meter.

247
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:56,690
Every one is six minutes. There's 10, 10
times six is 60 minutes. I think that's,

248
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,880
I believe that's how it
goes. So anyways, I'm a

249
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,270
flying around with my instructor and
he's taken me through the paces and he's

250
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,090
really, really a stickler, um,

251
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,690
and just gets on you about everything.
And I'm old enough to,

252
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,510
to not be frustrated
by it because I'm like,

253
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:18,080
I know this guy is being as hard as the
f probably being harder than the FAA

254
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:21,740
guys going to be on me, which is
going to help, um, come game time.

255
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,030
And um, so anyways, we did like, you know,

256
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,760
auto rotations at night,
you know,

257
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,570
which is fucked because you can't see
where you're going to land until you get

258
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,760
down there.
And the auto rotation is basically,

259
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:39,710
if you had a drive system or of engine
failure, you use the weight of this ship,

260
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,420
um,

261
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,310
to basically and the glide Jesus
Christ can't even explain it here.

262
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,580
You want to basically establish the 65
not a attitude and the way to the ship,

263
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,080
the air rather than being pulled down
into the main rotor is now rushing up

264
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,770
through it. And that's what's turning
it. And you just keep it, you know,

265
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:03,680
you want to keep it in the green.
Um,

266
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:05,901
and you can just,

267
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:09,290
you can just bring the thing down and
just like set it down on a fucking picnic

268
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,570
table. When you get good at
this shit. I can't do that yet.

269
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,870
So we're doing it at night. I'm fucking
him up and everything. I'm going, fuck,

270
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm going to flunk this thing
and I instructors going,
don't psych yourself up,

271
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,180
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So anyways,
I know him take drunk, dragging this out.

272
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:27,520
So anyways, long story
short, Saturday morning,

273
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,530
I'm going to take it. I wake up at
like fucking three 30 in the morning.

274
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,100
I went back asleep, woke up at
five, and then I just, you know,

275
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:39,101
I went over everything one more time
and then I went in there and uh,

276
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,210
I sat down with the guy and I was
like, Oh fuck, here we go. Here we go.

277
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:48,770
I don't want to flunk this fucking thing
and then go to Paris and ruin the first

278
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:52,700
fucking day of the vacation. Moping
around, ruined it for my wife, you know.

279
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,540
So I sat down and, uh, I had a really,

280
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,200
really cool FAA dude and,
uh,

281
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,190
you know, we went through
the whole thing and you know,

282
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,850
I was getting a lot of questions, but I,
I got, I felt like I got a lot wrong too,

283
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:11,270
but I got a lot right. And,
um, and then he finally,

284
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,610
and I saw he was getting towards the
end of it and I was just go, I just,

285
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,380
I was gone, but God, he's going to tell
me, I gotta fucking take this over and a,

286
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:21,040
which is embarrassing because your
instructors or did there at the school,

287
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,830
you're going to come walking
out. Like I failed. And, um,

288
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,270
we finished and he goes, all right, he
goes, that was adequate. Let's go fly.

289
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,950
And I was thinking, I thought that was
horrific. Alright. So we'd go out there,

290
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,290
I'm thinking like, all right, now,
two thirds of the fucking way there,

291
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,310
it's an hour walking out there.
We're doing the preflight. And, um,

292
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,490
I was just thinking of
something my instructor said,
well, it's just like, just,

293
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,920
you know,
slow controlled movements.

294
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,700
And I just made that like my,

295
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,730
my mission statement that I was going
to fly controlled smoothly as much as I

296
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:03,810
can just to demonstrate that I had
control of the aircraft. Then, uh,

297
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,210
so we go up, right.
And uh, we started him,

298
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,430
of course it's fucking easy is shit.

299
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,750
It's the most hazy Goddamn
fucking day I've ever flown in.

300
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,570
I mean, I couldn't believe it was
still like visual flight rules.

301
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,310
Like that's how fucking hazy it was.

302
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,790
So the first thing we're doing is we're
flying up to this place Rose Hills to do

303
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:33,870
these pinnacle landings, which
is, uh, basically if you're,

304
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,950
it's like you remember in Mash when they
were flying around the Hollywood hills

305
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,100
and they'd find a patch of dirt to
land on. That's what you gotta do.

306
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:45,360
So you go to your high reconnaissance
first and you've gotta be talking out loud

307
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:45,871
going,
all right,

308
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:49,980
it looks like it's hard packed dirt
sloping down like four degrees.

309
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,250
I got trees on this side.
The wind's coming from here.

310
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,750
Son is not going to be a factor.

311
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,800
You gotta be saying all of that shit
while you're maintaining your fucking

312
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,710
altitude, which is, you know, not going up
and down and that type of shit, which is,

313
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:03,210
you know,
it's not easy when you start out.

314
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,430
So we started heading up there and I
lucked out. It was so fucking hazy.

315
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,790
We ended up, you know, he goes,

316
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,350
turn around and take me to Compton
content has an uncontrolled airport.

317
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,700
So I turned back around,
I'm making my calls and uh,

318
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,180
on the radio and I think I'm doing
all right. And I'm thinking like,

319
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,800
I've never gone to Compton this way.

320
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,390
And I know basically where it is.

321
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,950
I fly out of Long Beach, said, I know
how to get it where I fly, you know,

322
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,210
westward load departure and you follow
this road and you get to these oil tanks

323
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,630
and you bang a right,
except when north of that shit.

324
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,500
So all I'm doing is I'm looking
for the fucking courthouse.

325
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,030
So I'm trying to stay cool and I'm like,
if I can't find this thing,

326
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:51,510
I'm going to flunk this fucking thing
and we'll come through the haze.

327
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:55,530
And all of a sudden I just see it
sitting right over there. And um,

328
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,430
we did a couple of maneuvers.
They're one point.

329
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:04,200
I was so nervous I forgot to do a clearing
turn and he was all right with that.

330
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,690
Um, I did a running landing. Um,

331
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,140
that one went great. Running landing
was basically if you will, coming in,

332
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,770
if you were at high density altitude,
which means the air's really thin,

333
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,740
you wouldn't be able to,
you wouldn't be able to hold the harbor.

334
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,010
So if you actually came in, how,
you know, your normal approach,

335
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:27,870
if you went to to try to hold a harbor,
you just basically you'd crash. Um,

336
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,760
so what you do as a running landing,

337
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,040
which is you basically come
in like an airplane does.

338
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,650
It's actually one of my
favorite things to do maneuvers.

339
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,180
And he put it down on the skids and you
fucking slide and your brand gradually

340
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,500
bringing the collective down,

341
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,960
which is the thing that looks like the
emergency brake. That's your power.

342
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,350
You know,
he just brat gradually bringing it down,

343
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:50,140
creating more and more friction as you
stop and then you're steering the nose

344
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,423
with your feet.

345
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,810
And a I did well on that and um,

346
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,610
I thought I did anyways. He's not
saying shit. So he told me, he goes,

347
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,150
if I'm not saying anything, you know,
that doesn't mean you're not doing well.

348
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,310
You know that you're doing fine.
If you see me writing down that doesn't,

349
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,490
you know, I can be taken a lunch order.
He was real cool, really put me at ease.

350
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,860
So then I did a,

351
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,460
a normal approach and then
I did a steep approach.

352
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,600
Then we did the landing off airport shit.

353
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,850
And then we did a hover auto in
the harbor. Rado is basically,

354
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,000
if you were in a hover like
eight feet off the ground or so,

355
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,070
and I'm all of a sudden your engineering,
your drive train system quit.

356
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,750
Um,
he engine quicks it's going to kick it up.

357
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,810
The nose is going to kick to the
left and then you go right pedal.

358
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,010
It's pedal settle. Kush is what you're
supposed to think. Right. And He,

359
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,560
we'd just done the, the the, which is
basically you go right pedal to get,

360
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,440
you know, straight and then
you settle, you're dropping.

361
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,360
And right before he hit the ground,
you pull the,

362
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,970
the collective up in that
cushions your landing.

363
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,280
So fucking he does it and I'm
thinking pedal settle cushion in it.

364
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,740
And he does it in the low rpm horn comes
on and I'm trained like a lab rat to

365
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,860
slam the, collected them. So
I put the collective down.
Then I was like, no, no, no.

366
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:18,610
Up, up, up. And we landed hard. And then
he just goes, now why would you do that?

367
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,690
Why would you do? I was like,
sorry man, I got, I go, I was
nervous, man. Let me just,

368
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,230
you can ask him, like, let
me, let me try that again. It
goes, all right, do it again.

369
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,230
And then I nailed it the second time,
but then I was thinking like,

370
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:33,640
I just fucking flunked it. I just
flunked it. And I, I, the way he said,

371
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:38,350
now why would you do that? I felt like
I was gonna pass you and now I can't.

372
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,780
So, um, so then we got to do the
last thing, the auto rotation.

373
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,450
So we fly around, we come in and he
could come sit down three, two, one,

374
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,760
we do it.
And uh,

375
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,620
for a lot of the time the fucking
low rpm horn was on, but I kept it,

376
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,900
but I wasn't losing it. It was just
underneath 97% or whatever, once percent.

377
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,080
And then I'd get it back up in and then
it come back down or whatever. And I, I,

378
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,180
but I guess it was good enough or
whatever. So he goes, all right, let's,

379
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,760
I w I didn't know. So he goes, all
right, let's go back to long beach.

380
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,380
So I'm thinking like, ah, fuck,
I just flunked it. Is it over?

381
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,250
I don't know what's going on.

382
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:22,360
So a flying back and I'm talking to the
guy and he's like a test pilot for these

383
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:26,740
things and he's telling me all
these cool stories and shit. And uh,

384
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,740
at that point we flew over to Torrance.

385
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,410
We'd already in Torrance where I
did the other half of that shit.

386
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,060
So I was just thinking of myself on the
way over there. I was like, you know what,

387
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,250
even if I flunk this fucking thing,
how cool is it that I, I'm, I'm,

388
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,340
I'm doing a check ride in a
fucking helicopter right now.

389
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:47,330
If you told me this a year and a half
ago, I wouldn't believe it. Right?

390
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:51,620
So fuck it. Just keep yourself
in that mindset. So we ended up,

391
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,800
we go back to the,
uh,

392
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,090
to long beach land over at air
plex, set it down. Fuck it.

393
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,470
Set it down real nice.

394
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,520
And he's not saying anything and I'm like,

395
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm not going to ask him. And
then I'm thinking, well, ask him.

396
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,040
It's not going to change either
way. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

397
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,390
And then I'm taking everything out.

398
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,860
And they left the key in the ignition and
I was like, oh fuck. Cause he pointed,

399
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:18,800
he goes, you left a key there. I was
like, Oh God, is that the tipping point?

400
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,070
What's going on? So, you
know, put the wheels on it,

401
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,850
wheel the thing back and then rose, we
start walking back in. He said, all right,

402
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:30,470
you passed. And I couldn't fucking
believe it. I couldn't believe it.

403
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,910
Um, so there you go. That was my,

404
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,800
that was my Saturday morning.
Uh,

405
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:44,801
all freckles is officially
a licensed pilot and I am a,

406
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,130
I am licensed to fly
helicopters up to a 12,000,

407
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:56,240
500 times
I'll fucking call.

408
00:24:56,241 --> 00:25:00,020
Is that? Huh? So anyways, um,

409
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,040
today I know what you think it's, we
do bill, you're going to go fly around.

410
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,180
It's like, no, I'm not.

411
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm going to go take the advanced
auto rotation class because um,

412
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,270
I don't think my reaction time,
I didn't like it with the low rpm horn.

413
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,320
I didn't think it was quick enough and
I want to get like he'd take that one,

414
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,640
like the low rpm that I have
to do now to pass my test.

415
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,360
I just had to take it down to the
flare, which is basically, you know,

416
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:27,650
40 feet off the ground,

417
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,180
gentle aft cyclic and you basically
killing your airspeed and your descent and

418
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:36,110
you basically stop in the air and then
that's when we roll back on the throttle.

419
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:39,080
We fly away, the advanced, you've got
to take it all the way to the ground.

420
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,530
So then you actually come in
lower and then as you drop down,

421
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:46,190
then you just like the hover auto.

422
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:48,320
He pulled the fucking
collective to cushion it.

423
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,430
And I've watched these guys do it. They're
fucking amazing at it. And it's like,

424
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:56,690
I want to be able to do that. I if
I can, if I can fucking do that,

425
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:00,380
then I'll start flying
around the La Basin. So, um,

426
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,170
for those of you thinking like,
Bill, you're already fucking mine.

427
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,360
I'm taking it really seriously.
And uh,

428
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,070
so I'm going to pass that class and get
200 hours under my belt before I ever

429
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:13,820
take anybody up by now. But, um,
I still can't fucking believe it.

430
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,180
I can't fucking bleed them.

431
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:20,181
And the great thing now is that fucking
God damn weight is off of my chest.

432
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,280
I passed it. I mean,
instructor told me goes,

433
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:28,700
this is the biggest hill to climb as
far as like just getting your license,

434
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:29,360
getting through,

435
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,410
just starting from fucking zero and
getting all the way up there. But, uh,

436
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,371
I don't know.

437
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:37,430
Getting instrument rated sounds like
it's a motherfucker too and it's like 40

438
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,300
fucking hours of that shit. I don't
know about that one. So anyways,

439
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,480
I hope I didn't bore you
with that. Um, let me, uh,

440
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:49,000
I got to read some of the
uh, the advertising here. Um,

441
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,150
I'll do it.
I am so fucking relieved that I passed.

442
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,550
Thank fucking God.
Thank God.

443
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,330
If I didn't pass that thing then I'd
have all of June to be sitting there

444
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,350
thinking about it. Trying to cram in
lessons. Thank God. All right, here we go.

450
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:24,900
Their raises are amazing and it's more
convenient and it costs a fraction of the

451
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:29,550
price. So what's the issue? Still don't
get it. Here's how the club works.

452

The two blade humble twin.
Personally,

454
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:41,130
I think that two blades was the best one.
Blade sucks too,

455
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,060
is perfect. Once they did three or more,
it was too much. You know what I mean?

456
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,710
Who's like Britney Spears
back in the day when she, she,

457
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,850
she just accessorize too much. It's like
Brittany takes some of that off. Right?

458
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,180
Wow. All right. Um,

you get to three blades there, uh,

461
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:09,210
that's what I use. Is that what I use?
Is that what I use? I use the two blade.

462
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,860
Oh, I guess I'm supposed to pick the
one. The two blade humble twin. Uh,

It includes a free handle in
a sleeve of blade cartridges.

465
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,500
It's high quality stuff. Everybody,
uh, it's got that weight to it.

466
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,590

467
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,030

468
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,640

471
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:49,860

month or every other depending on how

496

528
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,870
Is Tomorrow we'll do two and two. How
about that? All right. So anyways,

529
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,970
I was reading another fucking
thing. You know, I talked to her,

530
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:25,020
the baby seals of Washington up on the,
uh,

531
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,640
the shores of the west coast because of
oceans are fished out now on the east

532
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:32,960
coast of the United States.

533
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,990
You got fucking a bunch of turtles by
just dying off because there's something

534
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,320
like this too much because
the temperature went up.

535
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,970
There's too much algae in the water,

536
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:46,971
which creates something and which just
gets into the fucking turtle shells.

537
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,480
It gets infected and it actually paralyzes
them and they just drown and they

538
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:56,140
fucking die. And I,

539
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,550
I'm telling you, I, I,

540
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,970
I think I finally figured out why they
never addressed the population problem.

541
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,400
And it's basically because the upper
1% does not view it as a problem.

542
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,420
They view it as an opportunity
to make more money.

543
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,690
You know what I mean?
To hoard water and do all of that shit.

544
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:18,530
I was watching this thing on the plane
about cities of the future that they're

545
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:22,280
making. I mean it's apt. Like the whole
fucking thing is total big brother.

546
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,690
They are saying everybody is going to
start migrating towards the cities and you

547
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,570
have like fucking eight zillion people
living in the city who's going to live

548
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:30,470
out in the country.

549
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,120
You know those fat cat rich people and
you know what eventually is going to come.

550
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:38,240
It's going to happen that it's going
to be illegal for a regular person to

551
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:41,480
fucking go up to the country.
You're going to be shot on sight.

552
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,940
Um,
it's insane what they,

553
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,920
if they really wanted to be responsible,

554
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:52,190
what they would be doing and being
encouraging people to have less children.

555
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,590
Let's level off it's 7 billion
people and let's try to dial it back.

556
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,960
You know,
dial it down.

557
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:04,430
Everybody has one fucking kid and then
the people don't have kids or people who

558
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:08,540
die or people who can't have
kids or gay people. Right.

559
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,260
You know,
it'll actually cut off more than a half.

560
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,320
The way I look at it, right. With one jet,

561
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,300
a generation could cut itself in half
and then the next generation cuts itself

562
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:24,760
and half, and the next one cuts itself
in half. Right. And then after, you know,

563
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:27,730
the older generations that had
three or four, they all die off.

564
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,210
If you have like a string of four
generations that all had one kid,

565
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,240
you can go from 7 billion all the
way down to three and a half million.

566
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,300
I think my math is correct on that.
I don't fucking know.

567
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,610
But they don't bring it up.
They don't.

568
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:43,790
They just fucking figuring out new ways
to corral people and we're going to beat

569
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,280
powdered food. It's
fucking, it's terrible.

570
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:51,700
Then I, I, I don't really, I don't have
anything fucking funny to say about it.

571
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,120
Let's, let's get scored as something
funny. Let's talk about soccer.

572
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,350
Speaking of billions of God damn people.
All right.

573
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,930
Everybody in America doesn't give
a fuck about soccer. You know,

574
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:05,410
it's funny cause that Pfeiffer, FIFA,
whatever the fuck they're called,

575
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:07,960
the f I f a the, the, the,

576
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:12,190
the ruling governing body of world soccer,
World Cup soccer.

577
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:14,940
I don't even know what they are. I'm
American. I don't give a shit. Right?

578
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,630
I really don't. I've finally given
up on that sport. I sat down,

579
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,350
I tried to fucking watch it.
It's so fucking boring.

580
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,700
And the crying and laying. I know I've
said this a zillion times. I can't,

581
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,600
like if I'm in England
or something like that,

582
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,330
there's a premier league
game and I go there,

583
00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:35,470
I go to the game and I'm
sucking down some beers. I then,

584
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,330
then I could get into it, this singing
songs and shit and I just, I dunno,

585
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,400
whatever. It's like you were
in a pub with no seats, right?

586
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:44,910
That's basically what's happening. Well,
they are, but you never sit down it.

587
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,600
So anyways, um, Darin, they're in trouble.

588
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,140
Uh, first of all, this is how big
soccer is, by the way. Football,

589
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:57,070
let me have some respect here. Call it
by. It's real name football. All right.

590
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,010
For all the, all the fellow
Americans set, listen to this shit.

591
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:02,860
This is how big a world cup soccer is.

592
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:07,630
They had some big championship match
recently that wasn't the World Cup.

593
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,450
Or maybe it was the World Cup.
Let's just say it was the World Cup.

594
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,820
The worldwide viewing
viewership was 3.5 billion.

595
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,600
It was like half the planet.
They got a 50 share on the planet.

596
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,590
All right? And they, that was
listed to the end. Something
like NPR I'd like to do,

597
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:31,520
to put that into perspective,
the Superbowl had 150 million viewers.

598
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:32,720
Okay.

599
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,510
So if you're looking at it like a TV show,

600
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,280
the Superbowl would get cancelled
to be an absolute fucking flop.

601
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,540
So that's how big,

602
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:39,950
yeah,

603
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,450
this sport is. And that's how big
that fucking league is. So surprise,

604
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:45,440
surprise.

605
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,800
Okay.

606
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,800
There's a lot of people jockeying to get
the championship game in their country.

607
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,740
There's a lot of people jockeying
to get the fucking TV rights.

608
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,270
So there's a lot of payola. There's
a lot of, kickbacks is a lot of coke.

609
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:03,090
There's a lot of horse surprise,
surprise.

610
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,890
So here's the funniest fucking thing is
they're being prosecuted as some of them.

611
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,560
I like nine of them got busted in one,

612
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,520
one network executive is taken off
the fall for an entire fucking, uh,

613
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,080
attire. Fucking, uh, a network.

614
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,640
Just hilarious to me.

615
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:25,320
I'd love to see what his payoff is
after he goes to that fucking, you know,

616
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,880
white collar jail. It's probably the same
place where they play Wimbledon, right.

617
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,440
And,
uh,

618
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,730
the United States Department of
Justice as the one pressing charges.

619
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,780
And I'm thinking like, what the fuck?
How are we involved in this shit?

620
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:40,890
We don't even like the game.

621
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,860
This is just gonna be another reason
for people to fucking hate us.

622
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,130
But I guess they did all this
shit with American banks,

623
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,740
so it fell under our jurisdiction.

624
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,170
So not only do we not give a fuck about
the game when I'm going to sit there and

625
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,670
break their fucking balls.

626
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,320
Yeah.

627
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,560
About corruption. You know what I mean?
Because we don't tolerate corruption.

628
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:06,270
Here are the United States. Ah,
everything's above board over here.

629
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,490
Hang on. I gotta blow
my nose. I apologize.

630
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,120
Yeah. The stupidest shit ever like this.

631
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,330
There's a fucking
zillion dollars at stake.

632
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,500
Yeah.

633
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Obviously there's going to be horse,
there's going to be drugs,

634
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,310
there's going to be a lot of underhanded
shit going on, but nobody got killed.

635
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,440
Right. The only thing that they're
really, I thought was fucked up was they,

636
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:34,420
they've been accused of
fixing a couple of games.

637
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,370
I thought that that was
fucked up. Although if it's
done on a worldwide level,

638
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,940
you know you do it in some
shit bump country, you know,

639
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,440
and I know you're not
supposed to say that,

640
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:47,680
but the fact that I haven't named
the ship bump country, can't,

641
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:50,590
we all agree that there are shipped
bump countries, you know what I mean?

642
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,470
Because for all you know, I'm not
talking about Yeoc did this. Just this.

643
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:57,930
Just like, you know what I mean?
There's this nice cars in this car,

644
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:00,580
so it's just like, this really
isn't a car. This is a shitbox.

645
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,250
This was not done correctly.
You know what I mean?

646
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,970
The physics of it, it's
still fucking work. And look,

647
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm not saying the trees aren't beautiful.

648
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm not saying that
people aren't beautiful,

649
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:13,510
I'm just saying the way the
whole fucking thing set up,

650
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,400
or if it's being crushed
by a more powerful nations,

651
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:22,570
I'll, you know, I'll give you a
pass. Shit, I fucked up a hover auto.

652
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,450
That guy gave me a pass.
I can't give you a country.

653
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,600
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

654
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,200
There's two shitty ass fucking
teams playing each other.

655
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,820
Okay.

656
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,030
You know what I mean? To make an interest.
Interesting. Let's, let's fix the game.

657
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,381
I don't fucking know.

658
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:38,620
I'm just embarrassed that we're involved
in it and I also think it's fucking

659
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:42,550
Hilarious, Huh? The rest of the world,

660
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:47,551
you bunch of scumbags can't even run a
fucking legitimate league like we do here

661
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:50,380
in the United States. The
national football league, there's,

662
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:55,480
there's an upstanding that's an
upstanding leak. It's all fucking corrupt.

663
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,130
It's all corrupt.

664
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,590
We take money from fucking cancer to
buy yachts and I collect per fucking

665
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:04,060
helping out people who were sick.

666
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,110
You know those fucking console over while
we're here in France. What do they do?

667
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,720
Right. The whole fucking
bike thing is, is, is,

668
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:15,670
is a filthy from top to bottom.
Lance Armstrong figures and out goes,

669
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:17,200
all right,
that's how the game's played.

670
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:20,380
I'm going to play it better than
anybody else. It was fucking assholes.

671
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,430
They couldn't catch him.

672
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:25,050
They had a wait to 10 years later where
they froze his fucking year in Assam

673
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,020
shipped or they finally had a test
advanced enough to catch the guy.

674
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,940
I actually feel like the statute of
limitations to run out on that. Um,

675
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,680
I don't mind corruption and sports
unless you, you're like fixing the game.

676
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,440
You know what I mean? If you're
actually fixing the outcome of the game,

677
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,251
then that bugs me.

678
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:46,810
But as far as like performance
enhancing drugs and like cycling,

679
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,210
I don't give a shit.
All right.

680
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,240
These people riding a bicycle 60 miles
an hour up and down a fucking mountain,

681
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,070
they're obviously on something and
everybody's on something. All right?

682
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,180
They're all on something.

683
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,740
At that point it becomes fair,

684
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,080
I think. And I say, let them do
the drugs, let them do the drugs.

685
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:12,640
Let's see the side effects, let's adjust
them. And then once it's all safe,

686
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,810
give it to me. Give it
to a guy like me. Right?

687
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,190
I'm turning 47 and a few weeks.
I love to get the spring in my step back,

688
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,360
you know,
which was a steroids for your hair.

689
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,890
Would that be amazing if he had like,

690
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,930
like fucking mark McGwire like his
forearms. You had that level hair.

691
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,100
Every once in a see a guy like that.
Like my age with hair like that.

692
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:35,911
It's just like,
dude,

693
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:40,500
you got no fucking idea how fucking lucky
you white motherfucker. Um, all right.

694
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,500
Let me read some, uh, some of the
questions here for this week. Um,

695
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,680
we have two 41 minutes here.
All right. Sinatra comparison,

696
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,600
a Billy big leagues. Uh, this week
I'm Billy check ride or Billy big day.

697
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,081
Uh,

698
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:58,250
I recall a few months back you mentioned
Frank Sinatra at the end of his career.

699
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,710
Well,
driving down highway 80,

700
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:05,570
I saw a billboard for the silver
legacy casino in Reno. Uh,

701
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:10,571
with you and Frank Sinatra Jr sharing
the same weekend as well as the same

702
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,830
billboard. Oh Man, I'd
love to meet the guy.

703
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,990
Maybe this will drive you
further to become that slum
Lord you've always dreamed

704
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:21,470
about being after you retired from
co after you retired from comedy.

705
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,920
I'll try to take a picture of
it. Uh, the next time I pass it.

706
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,670
Can't wait to see in Sacramento. Thanks.
And Go. Fuck. Yeah, just soft veil.

707
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:32,280
It's hilarious. Um, yeah, I told
you guys that story like, uh,

708
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,810
the way Sinatra retired the
right way the first time. Okay.

709
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,780
Yeah. Whatever that line he had that ended
that song who stand in the spotlight.

710
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,550
It was something like,

711
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:49,200
excuse me while I something step aside
or something and he just steps out of the

712
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:52,230
light and that was it.
And he was gone and it's like,

713
00:42:52,231 --> 00:42:56,460
that's the way you fucking do it. But he
kept coming back and it's just, you know,

714
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,880
and that was Sinatra.
Sinatra had to make a comeback.

715
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:02,520
So I understand how this fucking,

716
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,090
okay,

717
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,240
this business works,

718
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,690
like how quickly they forget about
you and all that type of shit. So, uh,

719
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,250
having said all that,

720
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,750
I would love to meet Frank Sinatra Jr
what if I can do that when I'm out there?

721
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,750
Well I have to,
you know what actually in Reno has my,

722
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:22,370
one of my favorite stores
in a, in a, in the country,

723
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:26,690
it's bizarre guitar and gunshop I
told you about this same guy owns it.

724
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:28,160
It's a strip mall,
two stores.

725
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:31,400
One side is this sick ass
place with all these guns.

726
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,670
Every gun you've seen from every
fucking Stallone movie back in the day.

727
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,260
Awesome guns.

728
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,490
And then the other one is his guitars
and you walk in the guitar place,

729
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,520
it looks like a normal place,

730
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:44,990
but downstairs is where he has his real
collection of this giant fucking safe.

731
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,240
He has like the third
fender guitar ever made.

732
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,770
Just like there was like,
I don't even,

733
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,100
it was like millions and
millions of dollars worth of
vintage guitars downstairs.

734
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,720
So, um, I'm a big fan of Reno.
I am a big fan of Merino.

735
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,410
I actually like it better than Vegas.
Uh,

736
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,620
I don't know why I'm just one of those
struck in people. I like the, uh,

737
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,430
like those kinds of cities better.
You know,

738
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:14,820
the ones that are still trying instead
of the ones like, yeah, we're the shit.

739
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,700
Everything's a fuck over. Go Fuck
Yourself. You know what I mean? Uh,

740
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,260
it's hilarious to see. I like those kinds
of things as I'm sitting here in Paris.

741
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:27,210
All right, periscope.
Hey dear Billy Gates. Um,

742
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,810
I'm sure it's fucking annoying having
people stick their phone in your face for

743
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:33,420
the watching on periscope.
That being said,

744
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,420
I think you would kill it on
there just once or twice a week.

745
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:40,290
You should go on and rev your truck
engine while hollering and your southern

746
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,190
accent or Pester the shit out of me.

747
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,640
It's Nia with an n
people and the lovely Nia

748
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,740
n like axl rose, Shannon,
ana knees, knees. Um,

749
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,920
uh, pester the shit out of Nia while
she's trying to read a book. Uh,

750
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,920
I love the podcast now I periscope,
this is why I don't like periscope.

751
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,900
Periscope is like, so like people just
walk in, like comics are doing that now.

752
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:13,410
They just walk in with it on Luke.
Hey,

753
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:16,320
walking backstage at the
comedy store, it's like, dude,

754
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,720
shut that fucking thing off.
It's like,

755
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:22,230
if you want to turn your life into a
TV show, you know, more power to you.

756
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,190
But like, you know what, everybody's
chilling out here. It's like,

757
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,330
and when I do this podcast,

758
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,390
I decide what the fuck I'm going to
tell you about and what I'm not going to

759
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:34,500
tell you about and uh, what I'm going to
leave and we're going to take out. Okay.

760
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,240
She didn't understand what
I just said previously.

761
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,200
I literally just said the same
thing two times in a row, whatever.

762
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,170
I don't have my headphones on my
headphones. I like my fucking light saber.

763
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:46,380
It's my security blanket. I don't
have him on, I'm feeling naked. Okay.

764
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,040
I'm feeling very fragile,
um,

765
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,090
for someone else to just come walking
in and it's fucking annoying as shit.

766
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,080
And um, I advocate the, uh,

767
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,950
we got to come up with something
for people who don't like periscope,

768
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,390
I don't know what to call it, but is
a working title, the periscopes slap,

769
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,280
which is basically somebody comes in and
with their phone and they're holding it

770
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:15,180
up to their face. You just fucking
slap it right down to the floor. Right.

771
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,230
And then you do Bruce Lee's finishing
move when he kills him, which is a stomp.

772
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,930
And then a twist and
you're going to do the, Oh,

773
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,300
when you do it be perfect.

774
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:28,230
And then somebody else films that right
now don't film it because then they'll

775
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:32,730
have evidence. Uh, he should do,
I was just, you know what I mean?

776
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,320
Or you walk around with a water bottle
and you don't like to do it for like a

777
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:40,260
fucking cat that won't get off the
couch when somebody comes in just doing

778
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:42,990
periscope without asking you,
you just fucking, you spray.

779
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,310
You just spray the water and ruined their
phone. Something like that. I advocate,

780
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,770
I mean last week I
advocated killing your boss.

781
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,470
I actually felt bad about that
cause I just thought of, I like,

782
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:56,490
what if somebody actually went out
and did it? The world is so fucked up,

783
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:59,700
I could actually get sued.
And the like, you know,

784
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:03,480
it was irresponsible, but blah,
blah blah. It's like say, yeah,

785
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:06,900
you don't think that that person's a
maniac listens to a podcast. Like, Hey,

786
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:11,820
go commit a murder. And then they
go, okay, okay, you told me to do it.

787
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,920
You owe me money. Um,
yeah, don't kill your boss.

788
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,400
But a I advocate slap, slap on the
fucking phone out of somebodies hand,

789
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,860
slap it right down to the ground, stomp
on it, twisted, knowing full well the,

790
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:28,290
you don't have to pay for it, but you
just, you preserving your privacy.

791
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,740
It's gotta be a politically correct
way to say it. You're a, uh,

792
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,990
you're a privacy warrior.
Sorry. Oh fuck you.

793
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:42,730
You come up with a Goddamn
name for it. Um, all right.

794
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,680
You know, it's funny.
It's my wife's birthday.

795
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Tomorrow is her birthday
and she's a fucking smarty
pants and she always figures

796
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:54,370
out what the fuck I get her and this,
this year I totally threw her off.

797
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,740
Totally fucking threw her off.

798
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,720
She's got no fucking clue where I'm going
to take her one I'm going to do while

799
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:03,820
she knows that somewhere in Paris,
but she has no idea.

800
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,550
And right now this might be a lie,
this might be a lie,

801
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,310
just in case when he decides to Tweet,
Oh,

802
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,830
Bill's going to do something fucking
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Do it.

803
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,940
You already know what the fuck I'm doing.
All right. Now, I can tell you right now,

804
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,900
I only have 50% of an idea of what
the fuck I'm going to do. All right,

805
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:24,280
so don't even try and figure it out.
All right. It's fucking useless.

806
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,980
It's a waste of your time.
Uh,

807
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,780
favorite music video downtown Billy Brown.
Nice fucking reference.

808
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,440
I absolutely fucking love downtown.

809
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:38,920
Judy Brown at the biggest fucking crush
on her. When I first moved to New York,

810
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,220
um,
and like 95,

811
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:47,221
96 I went to some benefit thing is hoity
toity thing where my manager at the

812
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:53,641
time knew a bigger manager
who was managing a big comic
and we got to tag along

813
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:56,980
and I went there and she was standing
just hanging out at the thing.

814
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,150
She was fucking gorgeous.
Fucking gorgeous. All right.

815
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:05,710
Too early to get into comedy.
No such thing, sir. Dear bill,

816
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:09,100
I'm 17 and just did my first
open mic at a coffee shop.

817
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,780
I've got a few laughs and a few
awkward silences silences, but overall,

818
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,970
uh,
I enjoy it.

819
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:21,010
I really want to go to a comedy club
soon so I don't have to be so selective

820
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:21,910
about my words.

821
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:26,740
And advice to someone this young
looking to get into this. Ps.

822
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:31,060
I know bombing is part of the process.
Problem is I have paper,

823
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:35,710
thin skin. Does your hide thicken
up after a while of bombing?

824
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,730
All right, two things. Any
advice on somebody, uh,

825
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,640
looking to get into this?
Dude, you're already into it.

826
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,830
It's like you just shot heroin and now
you're asking me about heroin. Dick,

827
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:48,610
you're already did it.

828
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,190
Now you're hooked and you already
want to go down to a comedy club. Uh,

829
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,080
you started at 17. That's not
too early. That's fucking great.

830
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,850
And don't listen to the fucking older
people who are jealous and be like, dude,

831
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:03,340
you 17 years, you've got nothing to talk
about. You got nothing to talk about.

832
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:07,000
And then watch them go on stage and see
what the fuck they're talking about. Ah,

833
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,650
dude, shit jokes. Wait,
am I talking about myself?

834
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,080
Don't listen to them. All
right? This is the deal.

835
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,280
You're young and there's going to be
a lot of people fucking jealous. Okay?

836
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:21,790
And then there's,

837
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:26,560
if you're a guy and he's going to be a
couple of old fucking lady comics that

838
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:29,810
are going to try bang, you stay
away from them if you're a female.

839
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,593
Okay.

840
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,680
MMM. You know, just stay away from,

841
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:39,560
and anybody who tells jokes cause
they're all gonna try to bang you.

842
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,500
I'm so fucking, it's a job. Go
down there and get better at it.

843
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:45,970
Surround yourself with positive,

844
00:50:45,971 --> 00:50:50,260
motivated people that you feel are going
to make it and then not doing this just

845
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:55,261
fucking around and you guys will
all feed off of each other's drive.

846
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,800
That's what happened to me
in Boston when I started.

847
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,750
I started with Dane and Patrice O'Neal,

848
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:06,751
rest his soul and we were
down at Nick's comedy,

849
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:09,190
Stop Donald Warrants and street in Boston.

850
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:14,191
We were down there every fucking
night unless we had a gig elsewhere.

851
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:18,160
And even then, a lot of times
we would drive back in there.

852
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:22,720
We were there every fucking night.
And um,

853
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,180
okay.

854
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,060
I remember when one of the
great compliments I got
when I first started out,

855
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:31,720
this guy came walking in and I was
like, and I was already there, you know,

856
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,540
write down my jokes. And he looked at
me, he said, dude, you are everywhere.

857
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,310
And it's just like, yeah, yeah, I am.
So that's what you gotta be, Dude.

858
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:41,680
And you can't just do
like club comedy clubs.

859
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:46,420
You've got to do stand up any way
you can. And as far as bombing, yes,

860
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:49,840
it is part of the PRA process. Every,
you know, I had a paper, thin skin,

861
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,650
I was shy, I was introverted,
I had all of that.

862
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:58,570
And it just fucking hot. When
you bomb it, it was just, ah,

863
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,420
just sucks.
It just sucks in the beginning.

864
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,380
But I'm the same way.
You learn how to kill,

865
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:09,580
you're going to learn how to bomb
and you can learn how to, how to, um,

866
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,520
like have hold your,
uh,

867
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:19,460
hold your ground and you'll have,
you'll have poise while ground, uh,

868
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,580
bombing. And then when you get to a
really high level of bombing is you'll,

869
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:28,230
you'll VA began to understand if you're
bombing, because if it's your fault,

870
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,330
if it's the crowds fault, if it's
just a set up, if it's half the crowd,

871
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:38,010
half you, if it's 60%, you are
the, that to me is the best thing.

872
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:42,240
When if you figure it out, it's you, then
you just start making fun of yourself.

873
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,410
If you figure it out,
it's them.

874
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:47,250
You start giving him shit and
they loosen up a little bit. Um,

875
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,480
if it's a little bit in the middle,

876
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:50,580
you sort of make fun of yourself
while you're ripping them,

877
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:54,990
you'll figure out the whole recipe
to the thing. But, um, you know, uh,

878
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:58,810
I think it's great. You Start and it takes
a lot of balls. 17 to start off. So, uh,

879
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,340
my, my fucking, my hat
is off to you. All right.

880
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:08,160
Helicopter loser. Hi Bill.
And then quotes it said,

881
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,240
oh my God, I'm gonna lose her. I'll
never own a helicopter. I'm a disgrace.

882
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,050
And they said, that's from Bill
Burr, emotionally unavailable.

883
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,210
That's quoting one of my jokes.

884
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:23,570
So do you remember saying this
during the MTV cribs bit? Uh,

885
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:28,320
feel like you made it now. Shot
helicopter guy. Go Fuck Yourself.

886
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:33,120
But seriously, well done on the helicopter
driving. Thank you. Um, oh yeah,

887
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,220
I remember that bit. I didn't know that
I've said helicopter, but I remember uh,

888
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,110
talking about how MTV cribs,

889
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:43,050
how you would watch that show and you'd
just end up feeling like a fucking loser

890
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:45,330
because it was all like these,
you know,

891
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,080
am I really going to say Brittany Spears
twice in this fucking podcast? Yes,

892
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:52,270
it is. 2015. Um, I'll,

893
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,890
I'll all those fucking people's
houses back then. Cisco's house,

894
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,270
the one hit wonders to,

895
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:00,630
they all had pet and all of this shit
and they made you feel like a loser.

896
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:05,220
He is a fucking inside joke.
A inside story on, on that.

897
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,390
All right.
When I did that pit,

898
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,393
um,

899
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,980
one night I did it at the comedy
cellar in the late great. Greg Geraldo,

900
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:21,510
rest his soul. He came up to me
after I did the bit. He goes, dude,

901
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,280
he goes,
just to let you know,

902
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,530
I have a bit on MTV cribs and
it's almost word for word,

903
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,070
the exact same bit,
it's exact same angle.

904
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,490
And both of us would just send a part
of our career where we were writing our

905
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:39,910
hours and we, I didn't have anything
else. I was just like, ah man.

906
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,010
He's as like, neither one of us wanted to
dry. You have to have the conversation.

907
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,780
Usually someone's like, I'll drop it
now. You do it. Nah, Nah. You know,

908
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,860
and I've usually been the one that I,
that I was always like, I'll drop it,

909
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:56,250
I'll drop it cause I didn't
want any of my shit. You know,

910
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,520
somebody else seen somebody else
doing it and thinking I'm stealing.

911
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:04,350
So we both just sat there going like
stare at the floor and then we both just

912
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:07,590
started laughing, going like, all right,
we'll only do that, choke on the road.

913
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,250
So me and Geraldo had this, this, uh,

914
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:15,210
gentleman's agreement that even though
we didn't steal from each other,

915
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:18,960
but we basically had the exact same bit,
um,

916
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:23,340
that we would only do it on the road.
So that's what happened.

917
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:28,550
And we never really talked about it again
and we both just kind of forgot that

918
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,670
we kind of had the same joke.
And then like the same season,

919
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,250
we both got a half hour on comedy central

920
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,840
and Lee and we both did the bit.

921
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,000
And I remember my special came out
first and I remember getting an email in

922
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:48,060
somebody's gone, hey bro,
just to let you know,

923
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,530
Greg Geraldo still jury is still your
MTV cribs that, and I've gotten like,

924
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,250
oh fuck, that's right. He's got the
same thing. So I emailed the kid back,

925
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,084
told them the story,

926
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:01,620
and then I called Geraldo and we both
just started laughing and we were trying

927
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:06,450
to guess which one of us was going to
be, you know, called the joke thief more.

928
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,370
Wow. That was, wow. That
was way back. Way, way back.

929
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,060
It was like 2002,
um,

930
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,850
oh my God, I'm a loser. I'll never own a
helicopter over just Christ Jesus Christ.

931
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,300
That's fucked. I don't remember
saying that. Here I am.

932
00:56:24,301 --> 00:56:29,100
Years later, years later, years later. Um,

933
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,040
all right, let me read a couple
more of these, uh, these,

934
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,070
these advertising things here.

935
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:38,250
Then I can wrap this podcast up and
hopefully I'll be able to upload this with

936
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,260
the Euro fucking Internet here.

937
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,040
Okay.

938
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,540
Please tell me that's not wind chimes.

939
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,650
Is that a fucking telephone?

940
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:48,680
Okay,

941
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,640
I'm going to answer in that shit.

942

So before I check out here and uh,

995
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,640
begin my fucking vacation here,
what are you going to do, Bill?

996
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,380
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm not doing shit.

997
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,910
I'm going to sit in the cafes and uh,
I don't know.

998
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,330
Eat some fucking as some of their food.

999
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,170
I forget what that beer was that I
liked the last time I was over here.

1000
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:03,830
I'm looking forward to doing that,
but uh, to be honest with you,

1001
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,990
I just want to chill out,
not be an asshole.

1002
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,690
It makes sure my wife has a
good time to be honest with you.

1003
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,290
That's going to be my attempt because
I know I don't want to end up like that

1004
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:17,090
guy. That guy was so I was fucking
depressing. I felt bad like it.

1005
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:21,230
His wife was just sitting there taking it,
one of those old school fucking women,

1006
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,700
just someone needed to
take her aside and be like,

1007
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:30,701
d can't take this from this guy in a
fucking slap them around or something.

1008
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,850
I don't know what. So anyways,
let's talk about the NHL Finals,

1009
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:39,660
which I'm gonna fucking miss over here.
Unless they can find an NHL bar. Um,

1010
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,841
I know,
I know.

1011
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:45,800
You can watch it online with the password
and I'll probably fuck it up. Uh,

1012
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:50,630
but anyways, uh, black hawks
versus the Tampa Bay lightning.

1013
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,520
Um, I'm going to say something
right now. Jonathan tapes,

1014
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,560
Dat guy. He is in the process of, uh,

1015
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:07,030
being one of those guys who they're going
to be selling his Jersey like 20 years

1016
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:10,640
from now and little kids in 20 years.

1017
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:12,560
They're going to know who
he is that fucking gay.

1018
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:17,510
Like he's just a man that
cage just fucking steps up,

1019
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,780
dad, game seven against the ducks and
congratulations to the ducks to where,

1020
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,140
what is, what it, what it sees. And
they had just a great fucking team.

1021
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,860
Um, and, uh,

1022
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,540
just game seven,

1023
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,310
they're on the road in Anaheim and
just write in the first two minutes,

1024
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:40,970
just shuts the crowd
the fuck up with a goal

1025
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:47,840
and then scores another one. And the
first period it's two to nothing and teed,

1026
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:51,980
scored both fucking goals. It's just
the gay is, he's just, he's the shit.

1027
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:56,600
So I dunno. Uh, um,

1028
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,120
who isn't a fan of greatness sold?
There's usually I like the underdog and I,

1029
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:03,790
I like Tampa Bay and I really like,
you know,

1030
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,630
Steve [inaudible] and everything
that he's done with that thing.

1031
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:10,540
So it Tampa Bay wins. I'll be, I'll
also be happy, but like, uh, I,

1032
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:15,570
I obviously just having a player
like teams get a third is,

1033
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,910
uh, it's great for the game and it's also
for Chicago. Cause then now, you know,

1034
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:24,890
when they do their, their whole,
like the great people of, uh,

1035
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,950
who are the greats of Chicago
Sports, right? Bobby Hall,

1036
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,730
Michael Jordan, I'm sorry,
Walter Payton, Michael Jordan.

1037
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,400
And then tapes is going to be right in
there. Right. He gets his third. Um,

1038
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,110
wait, we've got to have they
to have a great Ernie banks.

1039
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:44,560
Okay.

1040
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,720
Who is it? Who's a great
white sock? I don't know.

1041
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:50,490
Let shoeless Joe Jackson
from the fucking black socks.

1042
01:02:50,491 --> 01:02:52,440
I hate that they call him the black socks.
It's like no,

1043
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:57,441
they were the fucking white socks or they
think fixed the world series now that

1044
01:02:57,781 --> 01:03:00,090
my friends,
that was cheating

1045
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:06,100
fucking air pressure. I'll never get
over it. I'll never get over it anyways.

1046
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:11,650
Um, so obviously I think the Black Hawks
are going to win just because they're so

1047
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:15,400
deep in the, uh, the uh,
experience they have.

1048
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:18,670
But I'm really bummed out that I'm
not going to fucking see it. Um,

1049
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,160
I'll figure it out a fucking way to do it.

1050
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:22,600
And then what's the other one we got here?
Oh,

1051
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:25,930
let me sit in this fucking antique
chair. I hope it doesn't break it. Um,

1052
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:32,650
who else is it? Oh, Lebron first.
What's his face? Steph curry.

1053
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,730
I don't know shit about basketball.
All I know is curries,

1054
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,580
one of the most amazing basketball
players I've ever seen in my life.

1055
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:40,840
But I gotta be honest with you.

1056
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,980
I am so sick of a closeup on his face
while he's chewing his mouthpiece.

1057
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:46,120
It's fucking gross.

1058
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:47,730
Okay.

1059
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:51,780
Okay. Just keeping your fucking mind. That
shit. Do you know what it's going to do?

1060
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,800
Cause he's so good.

1061
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:56,490
It's going to inspire an entire generation
of young kids to walk around with

1062
01:03:56,491 --> 01:03:59,760
their children on their fucking mouth
piece after every fucking play cause they

1063
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:03,330
want to be like him. You know?
Then when you want to be like Mike,

1064
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:06,960
you just stuck your tongue out and tried
to dunk as you floated in sideways.

1065
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:10,400
Then you just tripped and fell.
Uh,

1066
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,690
now they're going to have the fucking
that thing hanging out of their mouth.

1067
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,470
But um,
I don't know who the real fruit for there.

1068
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,750
I love the whole thing that's Lebron came
back in one, one for fucking Cleveland,

1069
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:25,110
but they could finally put their fucking
wine and all the time about how awful

1070
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,280
the sports situation is.
But then on the other side,

1071
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:34,070
I like golden state man, golden state
to me like a, that team is like a,

1072
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:38,790
what was that will Ferrell movie semi-pro.
Like to me,

1073
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:42,810
golden state is like,
they got the sickest floor in the NBA,

1074
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,620
but before they had a man, like where
they play is just old school sports.

1075
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:49,530
It's not a lot of venues
like that anymore.

1076
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:53,370
I went to a game there a long time
ago when they played the Spurs. Uh,

1077
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,160
David Robinson was still on the team.
He was in street clothes. Uh, and uh,

1078
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:02,010
what's his face was really young, uh,
captain, the big fundamental there,

1079
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,850
whatever the fuck his
name is. Uh, but anyways,

1080
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:10,860
they are the sickest live
band there. So you know what?

1081
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:14,040
This is tough. I think I got to go if
I might got to go for the warriors.

1082
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,293
You know why?

1083
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:20,300
Because Al Madrigal is a fan and he's
the fucking driving force behind the all

1084
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:25,330
things comedy network. They go that
tipped it in favor. I know you like,

1085
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:28,570
what about Jason Law head? What about
Jason Law had, well, you know what?

1086
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:31,330
The buckeyes wanted it this year,
so he's already got a championship.

1087
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,160
So I'm rooting for the warriors.
They go,

1088
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,860
I'm rooting for the warriors and
I'm rooting for the Black Hawks.

1089
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,930
The greatness of a Jonathan tastes.
I want to see a,

1090
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:43,210
I want to see him get his third
one and a plus original six.

1091
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,740
And I obviously got to be honest with you,
the fucking Black Hawks that,

1092
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,090
that home jersey,
which used to be the way that red one,

1093
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:52,510
that's one of the best jerseys and
all the fucking sports. All right,

1094
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:53,620
that's the deal.
Everybody.

1095
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,530
A thank you to everybody that's listening
and I'm going a generous move here.

1096
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,420
I'm still gonna tell you to
go fuck yourselves. But, uh,

1097
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,640
I'm just so fucking psyched.
I finally got the helicopter thing

1098
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:07,790
done and then I can now go on to a,

1099
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,510
actually really learn how
to fly the fucking thing,

1100
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:13,540
which is really what your
pilot's licenses. It's a
licensed to learn, they say.

1101
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:16,210
So I got to get on that shit.
So that is it.

1102
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,170
I'm going to do another goddamn
comedy jam coming up this month. Uh,

1103
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:22,360
so I got to get my drum
and chops back together,

1104
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,490
but nothing but helicopters
this month. So, uh,

1105
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:26,500
brought my little fucking pad over here.

1106
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:29,650
You don't get a pair of digital my
fucking way back into drumming shape,

1107
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,280
but when I come back, I
forget what date that is. Uh,

1108
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,620
but they'll have it up on their website.
As always,

1109
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:40,260
please visit the all things comedy
network and, uh, that's sick.

1110
01:06:40,261 --> 01:06:41,980
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
