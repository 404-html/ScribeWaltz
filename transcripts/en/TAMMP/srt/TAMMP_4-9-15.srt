1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,170
Hey, what's going on? Just checking

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,720
what's up. It's bill burn.
It's the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:13,440
Monday morning podcast just
before Friday special edition.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,980
And I'm here this week with a very
special guest may and I'm here to talk to

5
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:24,120
you. What's going on? How's your
week been? How you fucking baby?

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,800
You made it through Tuesday and Wednesday.
All right. Quit your whining. Okay.

7
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,450
You got your shillings for the
week. Didn't shift. You know,

8
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:33,300
it's funny I told you guys when uh,
this,

9
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:38,301
this recorder that I use this
fucking recorder that I use it for,

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,460
I have to talk for 30
seconds for it to get the um,

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,900
the proper levels levels that are
made in nor they'll have a good audio

12
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:50,360
experience. Um, so you
know, what am I doing?

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,900
I run out of shit to do so I just sing
the national anthem and I just fucked it

14
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,734
up.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,310
Why is that such a hard song to sing by
yourself and everybody else is singing

16
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,144
it.
You know it.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,430
Okay.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,000
You always end up going,
I throwed up pear raw Luz Phi.

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,610
What so proudly we hailed at
the twilight's last gleaming,

20
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:14,950
whose broad stripes and
bright stars don't apparel.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,080
You always go back to that flow.

22
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,580
They'll pile you did the stuck in this
fucking groundhog day of patriotism.

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,330
So you know what?
All you guys we've ever made fun of.

24
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:26,540
Anybody tried to sing the national anthem?
I challenge you right now.

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,730
Start singing it to yourself at your
desk. Just whisper. Hey, can you

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,233
see how far you get?

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,910
See how far you get and we'll see
how much you support the troops.

28
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,310
We'll see how much you love America.

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,970
Yeah,

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,930
we'll see whether or not you live or die

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,070
in a work camp coming up.
You know what?

32
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,420
The other day I was talking to I was
talking to somebody about finance and he

33
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,200
had heard that, you know, I don't let
anybody fucking handle my money. You know,

34
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,390
cause I watched behind the music
and that's the first thing.

35
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:03,300
The first thing you'd do if you want
people to fucking steal from you is let

36
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,350
them handle your money.

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,470
The second thing you do is you
give them power of attorney,

38
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,350
which means they can sign your name,
which means they're essentially you.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,260
They can legally sign your name.
Hi, my name is Frank Gifford.

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,430
I'm also Frank Gifford. I don't remember
you being on the giants. Well fuck you.

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,270
I got a piece of paper says I
did. Well, at least on the check.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,530
Why did I pick Frank Gifford?
I Dunno. Um, so whatever.

43
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:28,140
I was talking to this guy about all
my theories. You ever like be talking?

44
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,380
He talks to somebody and you just see
them sort of half smiling and you just

45
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:35,070
like ask, I think I'm a fucking
moron. I should have just stopped.

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,680
I should have just been like,
dude, you're giving me the,

47
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,000
this guy's a fucking moron.
Smile. Which I might be, but, uh,

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,220
I don't think I am. You know, I
still remember the Billy Joel One.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
Shit. I got friends I know got
fucked over, fucked over already.

50
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,150
And what's the number one
thing that happens? They,

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,590
these people could go and
they could infiltrate. How
the fuck do you spell Miami?

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,360
Sorry, add kicking in here. Um, they
could go into your fucking account.

53
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,780
Okay.

54
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,900
You're, you're out of your fucking
mind. No, dude. You said you quit.

55
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:14,350
I've been working with him forever.
Oh, have you? People Change, you know,

56
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:18,100
people go through a divorce. You know,
a lot of that mental shit if you're,

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,930
if you're,
if you've got mental problems.

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,150
You know what I mean? When was the
last time we met a schizophrenia?

60
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,060
Eight year old. It never happens. Okay.
Somewhere around 30, all of a sudden,

61
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,010
you know, the person is over in
the corner talking to other people.

62
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:32,930
It happens later in life. Okay. And you,
and you can take that to the bank because,

63
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:36,560
uh, I am not in the medical field.
I'm just repeating shit that I heard.

64
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,020
You don't know what's going to happen.
They go to a door,

65
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:43,370
so they start smoking crack. They go to a
fucking rave. You know, they do ecstasy.

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,130
They banked some chick way out of their
fucking league. Next thing you know,

67
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,690
they're doing that,
right.

68
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,700
Okay.

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,000
This is fucked up. I don't trust
anybody who drives a white car,

70
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,590
not like a fucking Camry.

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,240
Anybody who drives a white
Mercedes Benz or white BMW.

72
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,230
It's a nice car.
And the car is white scumbag,

73
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,510
straight across the fucking
board. Scumbag. All right.

74
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,680
When was the last time you saw a class
act getting out of a white Mercedes?

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,070
A White Ferrari? You
know what I mean? Well,

76
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,550
for Aria gets you a little fuck what
have, I mean, you know what I'm saying?

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,150
Okay.

78
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,660
Fucking tacky. All right. People have,
oh, anybody has a white leather couch?

79
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,350
You know, just fucking,
just bill, you know,

80
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:36,550
I forgot something in my car and
just leave scumbag. All right?

81
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,510
Okay.

82
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,670
Um, you know, I'm actually
creating new stereotypes on
this one. I kind of like it.

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,160
Um, well built in. What
color car do you trust? Uh,

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,460
somebody as a brown car.
They never gonna steal from you,

85
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:51,380
but they're not going to make
you any money either. You know,

86
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,950
that's a lunch pail Louie,
right? It's got an a brown sack,

87
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,980
fucking Greece armpit stain of the
fucking greasy sandwich coming through the

88
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,110
side of it.
That guy's just accepted his lot in life.

89
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,990
He's gonna put his head down on, one
day's going to look up and he's 60. Right.

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,320
It's got to hit them with the fuck did
I do with my life and right there you

91
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:14,300
drop dead usually with hedge
clippers or something, you know,

92
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:16,090
cause he didn't make enough
money to fucking, you know,

93
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,170
by the electric pair or maybe even
get a gardener. Right. All right.

94
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:24,410
So what has happened over the last couple
of days since I last talked to you?

95
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,360
Well,
I lost,

96
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,110
I lost money by betting on Wisconsin.

97
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,490
Okay.

98
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,810
I bet.
I bet a steak dinner with Keith Robinson.

99
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:38,810
But either way I get to have dinner
with Keith Robinson. So it was really,

100
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:43,100
it was really a win win, you know what
I mean? He's such a sharp dresser,

101
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,620
you know,
man of the world renaissance man.

102
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,600
He could discuss everything from Earth,

103
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:51,650
wind and fire to the gap band.

104
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,170
Now we would talk shit the
entire, and uh, I dunno,

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,330
I don't know shit about basketball,
but I'm going to tell you,

106
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,780
I'm going to tell you why I would
not draft oca for in the first round.

107
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,250
I think that guy is a classic
waste of a first round draft pick.

108
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,910
I think he's a freshman.
He's probably a sophomore,

109
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,620
but I'm telling you he should have been
destroy a net fucking jam band guy on

110
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,050
fucking Wisconsin number 44,

111
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,760
you know with his Kevin
Mchale 2.0 fucking moves.

112
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,330
I don't know why everybody just,
if you're a big man.

113
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,610
Yeah.

114
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:29,951
All right.

115
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:34,090
If you're a man who's big and you play
the game of basketball's Michael Jordan

116
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:37,840
used to say, he never used
to say basketball was always
the game of basketball.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,650
Kind of like that. Mike and Mike, I
always goes a year, he'll flip wall leak

118
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,410
a day. Right now you're going to have
a lot of problems covering. She'll be

119
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,070
um, the fuck was I saying? Yeah.

120
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:54,170
I don't know why every big
man just doesn't go out.

121
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:59,150
Like if Dwight Howard just went out
and stole five fucking moves from Kevin

122
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,290
Mchale and five fucking
moves from, uh, uh, uh,

123
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,410
Keem Olajuwon fucking guy,
it'd be unstoppable.

124
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,590
He just did that right?

125
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,670
And he stole a heart and
stuck it in his chest.

126
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,430
I think that guy,
that guy could be dominant.

127
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,580
Fucking guy's a superhero. The guy's
got damn bicep is bigger than his head.

128
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:30,470
It's fucking unbelievable. You couldn't
draw a guy in better shape than him. Um,

129
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,121
what is he doing?

130
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:35,120
He goes on Ellen and he dances around
right then as a Celtics fan. I'm like,

131
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,740
the lake is not winning a championship.

132
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,960
Kobe's is not going to
pass the ball to this guy.

133
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:40,920
Yeah.

134
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,430
Um, you would have had to come on
screaming, like fucking powder salt,

135
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,660
punching his chest, freaking out. Ellen.
Um, I didn't know what I'm talking about.

136
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,130
Yeah. Oh, cool. For, I'll tell you
why I wouldn't draft if I were,

137
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:55,320
if I had to go back and if I was working
for like the w the bobcat's or wherever

138
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:57,090
the, whoever the fuck is going
to draft them, cause you know,

139
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:01,470
he's going to go early. All
right. This is what I would say.

140
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:04,670
I would just say, yeah, listen,
uh, I, I don't think, uh,

141
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,540
I don't think we should draft
this guy in the first round.

142
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,460
I think it's a waste of money.
And they would say,

143
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:12,420
why you uncoordinated unathletic
balding fuck. And I'd be like, you know,

144
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:16,260
that's a little harsh. Okay. You know,
you fucking ask me to do the Goddamn job.

145
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:20,230
Excuse my French. Okay. And, and I'm doing
the job. And you come in and you, what,

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,650
what's, what's the deal? If I don't
agree with you, you're gonna insult me.

147
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,330
I'd never say that because I'd be fucking,
I'd be, I'd be working for this guy.

148
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:30,090
So it'd be like, yeah, you know, I am,
I am a balding fucking loser. Right?

149
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,380
Take the paycheck, get in
my car and scream at the
windshield the whole way home,

150
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,140
saint, all the shit I really
wished I had the balls to say.

151
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,310
Then I'd walk in the door and my wife
would see that beaten man, you know,

152
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,881
next thing you know,

153
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:46,290
she's looking at the fucking neighbors
getting bent over a hedge there.

154
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,423
Um,

155
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,330
this is what I would say, I would say
don't draft. And they would say, why?

156
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,230
Look at his, look what he
did. Look at all this stuff,

157
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,170
all the spreadsheets across the table.

158
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,560
Why wouldn't you draft this guy in
the first round? I'd say it's simple.

159
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,070
The man breathes through his mouth

160
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,780
over.
Guy Breathes through his mouth.

161
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:14,860
I don't give a fuck what he does
on the court. All right. It'll jam.

162
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,420
Band Dad was fucking going
up and under all the time.

163
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:19,130
Even before he got into foul trouble.

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,750
He sat on the Goddamn bench breathing
through his mouth by two freshmen.

165
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,840
One Who looked like he
was in Lord of the rings.

166
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,123
Okay.

167
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,110
Little Elfin looking dude, Eddy
Munster looking guy. Right?

168
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:35,190
Just fucking drain and them. Then that
number three, whatever he was, that guy,

169
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,270
I swear to God,

170
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,050
he hits like a fucking 3.0 and I think
he screamed for like a minute gov down.

171
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,084
It's a 3.0

172
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,420
ah.
What is wrong with you?

173
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,340
You would've thought he wanted a
Kia or something with that shot.

174
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:59,670
I don't fucking get it. Did
he bet the game? I mean,

175
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:02,130
I know it was for a championship,
but even that reaction,

176
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,990
it's like the middle of the fucking game.

177
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,430
He's screaming like he just
wanted a that said new shit.

178
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:12,060
That's the shit that makes me feel old.
I literally watched the game going like,

179
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,770
what are these guys screaming above?

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,090
You just hit a bucket to go up 58,
54

181
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,300
stop yelling and get back on d or when
they dunked the ball and then they stare

182
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:28,920
at the crown like, oh my God, can
you believe what I just did? Yes,

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
you did it another games.
That's why I bought a fucking ticket.

184
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,420
I came in and watch you do that.
By the way,

185
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,820
you see that guy will get just scored.
That was your fucking guy.

186
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay.

187
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,590
Just negating what the fuck
you did because no matter
how hard you throw it down

188
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,880
and you still just getting two points to
get the fuck Vercon do friendship can't,

189
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,850
uh, who's tough on his podcast. I
am tough. I'm tough on my podcast.

190
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,680
Bill birth tough on the podcast.

191
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,230
Okay.

192
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,310
Fucking sweetheart and public.
How are you everybody? Um,

193
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,010
give them a microphone.
Instant cunt.

194
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,113
Okay.

195
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,033
I was singing,

196
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm singing Beatles songs today
with domestic violence lyrics and a,

197
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,610
that'll put you in a great mood.

198
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,530
You know I punched you in the face,
bitch, and you know, withdrew.

199
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,570
Just makes you laugh as
you drive down the street.

200
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,750
Does that mean you advocate that behavior?

201
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,320
What do we return controversially
on the Thursday afternoon podcast.

202
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,850
My name is Tripp tripper.
And you're watching the Thursday edition.

203
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm sorry. The fuck am
I talking about? Yeah.

204
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:42,710
So congratulations to the Duke
Blue Devils. First of all,

205
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:46,970
congratulations with being in the south
and being able to keep the name blue

206
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:47,804
devil.

207
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,670
I'm surprised considering the devil
rays had to change that. I mean,

208
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,460
how many pussies live in Tampa

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,940
or how strong are the fucking
pussies that live in fucking tamp,

210
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,990
I should say?
How big is that group?

211
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,170
How many people do you need a group
to really affect change like that?

212
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:12,171
How many fucking whining constant you
need to change the name of a baseball

213
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:17,070
team. You know what I mean? Or how bad
actually we know what the reality is.

214
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:21,420
How bad is your attendance that
you're trying to get those 40 cops

215
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,580
that you know, I dunno, what, what
are they doing? You know what I mean?

216
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:27,900
Okay.

217
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,300
I think if,
if you can't handle devil in a name,

218
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:33,780
I don't think you're going to go to a
baseball game because you're not going to

219
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,870
want to sit there amongst
all those sinners, right?

220
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
Abusing the Dayville alcohol.

221
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,810
Okay.

222
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,640
Using the Lord's name in vain,

223
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,810
cussing and swearing and other words
that mean the same thing, right?

224
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,270
You're not going to the game.
I don't fucking understand it.

225
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:53,250
So congratulations to them.
Duke on tobacco. Rude.

226
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,570
But game of basketball. We take it
seriously down there. We take it serious.

227
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:02,200
We take basketball seriously down here,
North Carolina,

228
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,710
north cack a lackey.
We take it so seriously.

229
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,250
We didn't even know we won a Stanley Cup.
What is that thing?

230
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,600
Why would you have a
spittoon so fucking high?

231
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,210
Am I supposed to stand on the table
and spitting that fucking thing?

232
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,920
Get it out of here.
I'm speaking of the south.

233
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,750
I got my southern tour coming up,

234
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,440
southern tor coming up
the Billy Bible belt tour.

235
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,420
Coming to a city near you.
And um,

236
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,520
ticket sales have been good as the first
time I've been to a lot of these places.

237
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:37,740
So a couple of them been a little rough,
you know,

238
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,290
so I'm trying to been hyping
the shit out of it, you know,

239
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,910
hoping that it's going to fill up.

240
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,060
But I've been told in Savannah
there's a lot of walk up traffic.

241
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,640
That's what they always say is to
the performer doesn't kill himself.

242
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:52,290
But actually we've been doing good there.
Um, if anybody can get the word out,

243
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,900
anybody remotely in New Orleans,

244
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:59,090
if you can try to fucking rally
some troops to come see me in uh,

245
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,400
the fuck am I going to be dumb?
Am I,

246
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:06,660
once I say Savannah was going to
say Savannah fucking New Orleans.

247
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,090
I know it's not that. Well, gee bill,
maybe that's why they're not coming out,

248
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:11,070
cause you don't know where the
fuck are you going to be. Hey, hey,

249
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,020
it's fucking side. Are you on here? You
know the hell am I going to be here?

250
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,420
Well, this weekend I'm going to be in
Miami at the Fillmore, Jackie Gleason,

251
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,650
and then I'm going to be up in Tampa.

252
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
If I just called 40 field
people up their pussies.

253
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,930
I'm at the Ruth Eckerd Hall.
Devil Hall in Tampa.

254
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,140
You speed the devil halts. Not
Savannah, Knoxville, Chattanooga,

255
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:38,370
Memphis is Shreveport, Shreveport,
Louisiana. I need some help there.

256
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
All right.
If anybody,

257
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,560
anybody at all knows anybody who knows
anybody at all that can come out to that

258
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,310
show,
I'd really appreciate it.

259
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm playing this legendary theater
that's a big fucking theater,

260
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:54,780
but it's the only game town. Um,
and it's this theater that like,

261
00:14:54,781 --> 00:14:59,190
uh, an unknown. Elvis
performed at an unknown.

262
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,560
Jerry Lee Lewis has fucking coolest
shit they got there. And you know,

263
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,940
I'm of course a bunch of black performers
that fucking, and they stole from.

264
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,650
So whose statue is out in front of the
thing? Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis. Of course,

265
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,170
white people. Um, the other
ones are going pretty good.

266
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,850
I cannot fucking wait to
get on that bus and, uh,

267
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,370
go to all these towns that I haven't
been to. Man, it's going to be sick.

268
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,400
And I am so upset that it's not football
season because we're going to a bunch

269
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:33,270
of sec, you know, we're going to
miss chipper going to Knoxville,

270
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:35,520
Tennessee. I mean, we just go and
buy all these fucking schools.

271
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,390
It's going to be killing me,

272
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,720
but I'm hoping I sell tickets here so the
next time I come back I do even better.

273
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:43,620
And then the next time I do the tour,
I can do it during football season.

274
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,760
Really Bill is at your plan?
Yes it is. Um, all right.

275
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:49,230
What else do I need to talk about?
All right.

276
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,800
I talked a bunch of shit
a couple of days ago.

277
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,340
I shit on the Ottawa
senator fans the fucking,

278
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,540
and I was saying, you're not making
the fucking playoffs. All right.

279
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,250
Cause I'm like, dude,
we want six in a row.

280
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:04,650
And it wasn't even looking at the
stats. I had no idea. I thought,

281
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,690
I thought Ottawa was fading.

282
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,000
So I said all this horrible shit
about them, you know? And uh,

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,320
now here it is, four days later
we lose to the capitals, you know,

284
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,980
which isn't good. It's not good
when you can't even, you know,

285
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,030
score a fucking goal. You know what I
mean? And it's driving me nuts. Anyways,

286
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,880
so a lot of you probably think it's
so, Bill, you're gonna apologize.

287
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,920
Are you going to back down
from what you say? No.

288
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,043
All right.

289
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,390
What's my name? Fuck. Yo.
Yeah, I'm staying with it.

290
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:39,770
I'm going Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen
Ross. Fuck you. All right. Fuck you.

291
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,010
The Bruins are making the
playoffs and like I said,

292
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:46,100
we're going to play the Montreal Canadians
and not only are we going to set them

293
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:49,400
in the first round, we're going to
sweep up. Okay. Which will be fine.

294
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,410
Montreal Canadien fans will be able to,

295
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,310
there'll be able to survive because they
have that little pocket square right in

296
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,020
the front pocket of that Blue Blazer,

297
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,290
which is great for wiping
away tears and snot

298
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,820
when you fucking lose.
Um, now who's kidding who?

299
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,530
I'm just hoping we're
going to make the uh,

300
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,760
okay.

301
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,070
I hope to make the playoffs. I mean,
shit, that's our fucking Stanley Cup.

302
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,210
It seems to shift.
But you know what's funny?

303
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:15,650
I watched like the first period of
half before I had to go to work, um,

304
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:19,050
if you want to call it telling
jokes work, which it isn't. Um,

305
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,390
and I thought we would, we were playing
great. You know what I mean? We will,

306
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,300
we will, it looked like we
were competing with them.

307
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:31,680
We just couldn't score a fucking goal.
I don't know what we need to do.

308
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,820
Who the hell knows? I mean, what do they,
they don't, I saw the first two goals.

309
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,510
The first one was, was a great goal.
The second one, I mean, no deflection,

310
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:41,550
what are you going to do? But, um,

311
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,820
I've actually become sort
of a capitals fan because,

312
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,190
you know,
just Ovechkin scoring

313
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,380
all of those goals. It takes
me back to the 80s, man.

314
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:55,560
Like that shit used to happen
all the time. You know,

315
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,180
like goaltenders were like my size
in the 80s and they wore pads,

316
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,960
you know, that weren't like
gigantic. Did you see, you know,

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,070
I saw a thing the other day that
saying how the fucking, the, uh,

318
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,580
the goalie's glove now doesn't even close,

319
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,860
which is weird to me, I think closes a
little bit, but they figured out that,

320
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:19,060
you know, what, why have it
closed? Because the goaltender,

321
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,940
we'll just have a closed and if he can't
open an in time, it might just slip by.

322
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:28,470
So just have this giant fucking
fishnet thing, you know,

323
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,990
like you're scooping up large mouth bass
out of the fucking a lake or something

324
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:33,780
and just have it open like that.
It's like really,

325
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,290
do we need to take away more than that?
You know?

326
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,060
I Dunno, but I actually learned
some shit about hockey. You know,

327
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,930
they always say five hole is between the
legs. And then there's one, two, three,

328
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,500
four, which is the fucking corner
starting down in the lower left,

329
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:54,501
I believe it goes like this lower left
corner is one lower right corner is two

330
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,700
and then you go straight up.
That's three.

331
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,790
And then back over to the left is four
I believe I might might have fucked that

332
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,390
up. And then five hole was between
the legs. That's all there was.

333
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,980
So the other day somebody goes,

334
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:08,520
he went seven hall and then I heard
there's a six hole. I had no idea.

335
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,020
And that's six holds seven hole,

336
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:15,021
his fucking his glove side between the
arm and the body and then blocker's side

337
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,290
between the arm and the body.
One six one seven I don't even know.

338
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,880
I never even fucking heard of that shit.

339
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,320
And it just struck me as
funny that they're now talking
about two more holes in

340
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:29,070
the goaltender when they're
fucking gigantic people, you know,

341
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,340
they look like refrigerators.
Like the padding that they have is unreal.

342
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,750
I saw to grasp on time,

343
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I did comics come home and some of the
Bruins were down there actually a bunch

344
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:40,950
of them down. It's fucking
awesome. But um, you know,

345
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,120
I thought that guy was like,

346
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,990
I don't know why I thought he weighed
like two 40 or something like that.

347
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,720
And he's very like, he's
tall, but he's like lanky.

348
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,610
But you look them with the pads on guy
looks like a monster. So there you go.

349
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:56,820
If you get mugged in the subway, just
get yourself some goalie pads, right?

350
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,720
If you get mugged every day, you know,
go to big and tall, get yourself a suit,

351
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:05,430
you put it over there. Obviously adult
wear the mask or the gloves. All right.

352
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,190
Then you do that weird little run that
you do when you're wearing goalie pads.

353
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:13,410
You sit down with the train.
Nobody fucks with you. If they do,

354
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:17,100
you got on all the paddock,
they'll just think you're fat.

355
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,340
You know he's a hitting you and that's
a stupid plan. What do you want from me?

356
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,940
Go Fuck Yourself. Okay. I'm trying
to help you out, you know. All right.

357
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,500
This is another being married story.
All right?

358
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,650
Just the shit that will fucking,

359
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,370
that will really drive
you up the fucking wall.

360
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:39,300
Unless you could figure out a cute
way to bring it up. All right.

361
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm coming home from the gym. All right.
We don't have any food in the house.

362
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,303
I don't know why.

363
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,920
Probably because we ate it all
and didn't go to the supermarket.

364
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,160
That's how you run out of food.

365
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,390
But who knows? You know, might
have a fucking mouse. I Dunno.

366
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,850
No Jesus fucking plot.
Guess it's going off the rails here.

367
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,410
Let's get to the thing here.
So I fucking,

368
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,770
I'm going to come home and
make some toast, right? We
don't even need lunch meat.

369
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,480
We got nothing. So I'm like,
all right, fuck this shit.

370
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,730
I'm just going to make a
fucking piece of toast, right?

371
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,440
Peanut butter and Jelly on top of it.
That'll fill me up. Bowl of cereal.

372
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:12,550
Who gives a fuck? Okay,
great. After work out great.

373
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:15,850
After a workout fucking meal.
So I show up,

374
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,170
I put the piece of bread to crust
all the way down to the end.

375
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:23,740
It sounds like a fucking like
one of those fairy tales.

376
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,870
Like I should be scrubbing the
floor with a toothbrush to the, the,

377
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:29,020
the level of lack of food here.
So it's the cross. The last piece,

378
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,750
they put it in the toaster.
I get the peanut butter,

379
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:37,050
the peanut and I get the Jelly and now
I'm looking for the fucking table butter.

380
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,830
Where is it? Where the fuck is it? And
I immediately start muttering to myself,

381
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:43,120
did she put it in the fucking bridge?

382
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,130
Why didn't she always put
it in the fucking fridge?

383
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,440
You know this fucking hard butter
in the fridge. You know you get,

384
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,100
I don't know about you guys, but I like
soft spreadable butter for my toast.

385
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,740
I don't want to fucking hard as a rock.
And then I'm going through the bread.

386
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,540
Some, the old me, the old me
would have flipped out. Like,

387
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,480
why the Fuck d? Like, you know? Yeah,

388
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:10,280
why the fuck do you keep putting
the fucking man? You know,

389
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,580
it would've been an idiot about it, but
I didn't. I wrote her a note instead,

390
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,120
I wrote Nia, I think it's time. We
talked about soft spreadable butter.

391
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,690
I like soft spreadable butter.
It's great for toast waffles.

392
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,710
And I imagined pancakes too.
There's already hard butter in the fridge,

393
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,270
so there's no reason to add to it and
eliminate all options for soft spreadable

394
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:37,100
butter. It's not. The summer
said, don't be a parlor. Say Yes.

395
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,780
This soft spreadable butter bill
came in laughing her ass off.

396
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,800
She still didn't understand my point.
I explained it to her.

397
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,990
She laughed and she said okay.
And she left. So they had golf.

398
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:55,810
And that's one to grow on.
Always use sense of humor when you can.

399
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:58,760
If you get the fucking broads laugh and
once they titty started jiggling and

400
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,810
your fucking homefree,
how would it do she know?

401
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:04,780
There was such a cute little story there
and I had to ruin it with my fucking,

402
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,130
my, my, my piggish behavior.
Um, look, and by the way,

403
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:11,860
for all you butter cones out there,
I realized in the summertime,

404
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,780
if it gets really hot, it
can totally melt. Okay?

405
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,790
That's why I threw in the summer
thing cause I was trying to think,

406
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:19,180
well how is she gonna fucking argue this?
So I think she understands it now.

407
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,380
All right. I am a waffle
making motherfucker. I don't
know if you guys know that,

408
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:28,820
man. I fucking got that shit down. I
make them all the time. I enjoy them.

409
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,340
Um, all right, Dave Grohl gets spooked
when he looks at Francis being Cobain.

410
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,710
I'm looking at news today. What's
in the news? Oh, by the way,

411
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:41,950
I've got a couple of retail. What do
we got here? A couple of quick reads.

412
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:43,450
One with a bunch of instructions,

413
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,200
getting a bad reputation for cunt
and stuff during copy, you know,

414
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,000
whatever. Um, okay, here we
go. Zip recruiter, everybody.

415
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,440
Ziprecruiter, are you hiring? But not
sure where to find the best candidates.

416
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,400
Um, well, zip recruiter, zip recruiter.

417
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,330

company is only as good as the people

418
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,740

419
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:10,370

job in one place isn't enough to find

420
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:14,120
quality quality candidates,
but when you're short staffed,

421
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,960
there's no time to deal with the dozens
of different jobs sites. Until now,

Chances are if you still have feet,

436
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,060
you wear socks in. Face it. Socks
haven't changed since they were invented.

437
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,780
They fall down.
They were up there and they always,

438
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:27,920
there's always that toe scene that never
seems to be in the right place. Oh,

439
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:32,150
he could reach down and adjusted. Right.
Our new sponsor Bombus has changed.

440
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:37,151
All of that bomb is dedicated two years
to engineering socks that stay up last

441
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,060
forever and feel amazing on
your feet. Yeah, that's true.

442
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,090
When they kidnapped subjects that made
him walk around in them for two years,

443
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:48,770
can we go? Yeah, no, I have
a pair of Bombus. No I don't.

444
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,510
Oh yes I do. Yes I do. Now I have
them and I tried them on. Oh Shit.

445
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,630
They feel great. They do. I
got to tell you all this shit,

446
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,070
all this stuff that people
send me, they're really
smart. You know what I mean?

447
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,610
They know the two areas that you really
want to have comfort in is your balls

448
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:06,920
and your feet.
Get balls and feet feel good.

449
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,820

your twinkle toes? You know,

win column. Um, anyways,

451
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,310

used is so soft. It's amazing, uh,

452
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,320
to know what I'm talking about. You
really need to try a pair of for yourself.

453
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,950
But listen, Obama's doesn't stop with
your comfort with every pair of socks.

464
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,170
Okay.

465
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,570
Oh fuck.
Was I reading there something about

466
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Francis Being Colbian today.

467
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:13,190
Rolling Stone published excerpts from
his forthcoming interview with Francis

468
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,350
Being Cobain,
uh,

469
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,380
the daughter of Kurt and executive proof
producer on the new documentary of his

470
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:21,530
life,
a montage of heck.

471
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,970
And unlike some sections of
the Nirvana diehard fanbase,

472
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,750
Frances isn't so quick to lionize her
father speaking about the potential

473
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:34,100
awkwardness of preferring
oasis to Nirvana. Francis said,

474
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,620
I would've felt more
awkward if I'd been a fan.

475
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,830
I was around 15 when I
realized he was in escapable.

476
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,610
Even if I was in a car and had
the radio one, there's my dad.

477
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,030
He's larger than life and our culture
is obsessed with dead musicians.

478
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,890
Yeah, that's true. We love
to put them on pedestals.

479
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:56,540
If Kurt had just been another guy who
abandoned his family in the most awful way

480
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,374
possible.

481
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,890
Hm.

482
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,270
What buddy wasn't,

483
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:04,500
he inspired people to put them on
a pedestal to become st cart. Yeah.

484
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,060
Well you know,
you fucking kill yourself.

485
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,810
Your kids are going to be
mad that I over simplify it.

486
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,180
Uh, Dave Grohl and this
is some fucking, you know,

487
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,520
had is like gossip. I didn't know was
going to be like this. Jesus Christ.

488
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,560
I can fucking read this shit. I love
Dave Grohl. Um, so anyways, there you go.

489
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,950
It's coming out in rolling
stone so you know it's true.

490
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,413
Oops.

491
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,150
Yeah,

492
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,540
these people raped her.
I know they did. Sorry,

493
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,680
we only talked to one person.
That's how you do journalism.

494
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,240
All right.
Are we done here for the week?

495
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,040
This is just me fucking
checking in on you.

496
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:47,060
So I'm only required to do a
half hour and we're at 28 45,

497
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,550
which means I only got a minute 15 left.

498
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:52,130
But if I was playing basketball
at a professional level,

499
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,120
this podcast would go on for like
another nine hours. All right. Did He,

500
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:59,150
is making Sean John Close for tween girls.
Now,

501
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,220
this is like when I looked up Google news,
this is what they suggested for me.

502
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,600
All right.
All right.

503
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:10,390
They got that awful story of that
police officers shooting the dude,

504
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,880
South Carolina. Man, it's just fucking

505
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,740
Jesus Christ fucking guys running away.
You know what I mean?

506
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,600
I know they're trained to shoot
center mass, but how about you now?

507
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,600
Fucking shooting the leg. Do one
shots. They'll give me a fuck dude.

508
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:30,420
If somebody had a sling shot shot in the
ass with it, I I, I'd go down. All right.

509
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,040
All right.
All right.

510
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:35,640
Obama set the test engagement
doctrine with Cuba in Panama.

511
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,870
This is annoying that like cube was
just going to be open to everybody.

512
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:41,780
I always want to just fucking there,
right?

513
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,230
Cause you're not supposed to now
going to be able to go there.

514
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,440
Yeah,

515
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,860
I'm calling this right now.
All right.

516
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:54,150
Within 15 years you're going to
see why Cuba did kicked us out.

517
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,500
You're going to see it. You Watch, you
watch what happens to that fucking place.

518
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:03,390
How soon before Citibank and
chase have skyscrapers there,

519
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,930
you know, and once they're there,
they need some place to eat, right?

520
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:11,931
It comes Papa John's and
fucking cheesecake factory
and next thing you know,

521
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,360
right.
You got your fucking biggest losers on TV,

522
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:21,880
the Cuba edition. Oh, Jesus Christ.

523
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,370
They can be sitting there eating
cheesecake, smoking cigars. I mean,

524
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:27,460
we're going to there. That's what
we, we, you know what I mean?

525
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:30,190
People were going to cause the die
down there, but just with our diet,

526
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:31,770
okay.

527
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,390
Coming down there with
Fritos and Coca Cola, um,

528
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,200
this is what I'm predicting.
Yeah.

529
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:41,610
We're going to ruin that place and
the kids are going to be eaten,

530
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:42,590
are poisonous food.

531
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,390
They're going to stop playing baseball
and there's going to be no more.

532
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:48,600
Sammy Celsus all eight ways. Was He
Dominican Republic? I can't remember.

533
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,740
Gloom and doom and the cigars aren't
going to taste as good because every

534
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:55,470
fucking jerk off now.
We'll just do it to do it.

535
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,880
Is there anything good about it, bill?
Uh, they'll get a roller coaster.

536
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,160
There you go. Why? I'm not buying
an apple watch. This person says,

537
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,180
Oh man, you're an idiot. If
I should say your an why,

538
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,970
why would you buy an apple
watch? Why would you do that?
Okay. You got to fucking,

539
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,350
you got a clock right on your phone.

540
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,480
Your phone can do all the shit the
fucking watch can do. What are you doing?

541
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,340
What does a tween,
well,

542
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,960
I want to know that the last thing
you want to do is search tween girls.

543
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,970
Fucking FBI guy will come through
your screen. I swear to God.

544
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,660
I was doing research. I was doing a
podcast. All right. Guns and roses,

545
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:38,160
new album underway. Steven Adler
questions. Axl Rose for not,

546
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,420
ah, here we go. Now I know them.
Okay, we'll end on this gossip here.

547
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,400
Do you guys listen to his podcasts a
lot? You know, I'm a big fan of us,

548
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,750
Steven Adler and a,

549
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:51,450
what am I working on with drums right
now I'm working on a little molar

550
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:55,940
technique coming together. So when I, uh,

551
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,410
play awfully, I can do it without
getting carpal tunnel, a guns and Ra.

552
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,980
Oh, good. A pop up ad.

553
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:04,410
I think I'll click on it and
buy whatever they're selling me.

554
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,720
Has Anybody ever done that? Maybe an 80
year old woman. I just, I don't know.

555
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:14,060
I just fucking close it, right. Anyways,
guns and roses, new album underway.

556
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,903
Steven Adler.

557
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,230
Questions axl rose for not
trying to set up a reunion tour.

558
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,150
Yeah, I don't understand why he's
still doing that. You know why?

559
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:28,590
Because people keep going to see him
with his band. Like if you're a true fan.

560
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,930
Well, I don't. I don't wanna fuck
with somebody tickets. But you know,

561
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,823
that's the deal.

562
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,670
A guns and roses have been making
some noise this year as a new album is

563
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,980
confirmed in a tour as well on its way.

564
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,610
The vocalist axl rose is being urged
by bandmates to do a reunion tour,

565
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:47,010
but he won't do it for money's sake.
Drummer. Steven Adler, however,

566
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:50,670
contradicts axle statement,
a guns and roses guitars.

567
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:55,020
Richard Fortis answered questions about
axl rose willingness to do a reunion

568
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:56,460
tour.
Here's what he said.

569
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,750
I've never met anybody that has so much
genuine musical integrity, integrity.

570
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,860
He won't horror himself out. He won't
do anything for business or money.

571
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,530
It's just about the music.
Well, this is a company, man.

572
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,600
What else is he going to say?
He won't horror himself out.

573
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,840
He's got a band that isn't guns and roses.
He's calling guns and roses.

574
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,020
We're going to file this under rule is
always a fellow red head. I got it back.

575
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm here, right? Here
we go. Let's keep going.

576
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,770
You guys think I should have
done that when I went bald.

577
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:26,910
Should I fucking got cornrows instead?
Sewed it into whatever was still left.

578
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,430
Okay.

579
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,110
Could somebody please Photoshop axles,
corn rows on my head so I can retweet it.

580
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,590
All right,

581
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,340
and he went and he won't defend himself
in the press because he doesn't think it

582
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:40,580
matters. It's just about the
music. That's all he cares about.

583
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:43,370
I've worked with a lot of people in this
business that I've never seen or met

584
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,480
anybody that has mo is motivated.

585
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:49,400
I was motivated purely by the desire
to make art. Well, you know what?

586
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,780
I don't fucking know the guy.

587
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,680
The only reason why I trash them 40
is doing this because I want to see,

588
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,000
because I'm being selfish.

589
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,110
Okay?

590
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,110
No, fuck. It's his career.
We can do whatever he wants.
Right. They get, go see that.

591
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:03,820
That is an enlightened man.
Um,

592
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,940
and his fucking late forties. Oh God.
I'm gonna be 47 this year doing it.

593
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:11,090
It's fucking over.
I got to pass the torch.

594
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,770
I got to find somebody
to pass the torch to it.

595
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,390
Okay.

596
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,060
Let's see who the fuck.
Who the fuck is on their way up?

597
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,630
I don't fucking know what torch do I
have a, that's the fucking bic lighter.

598
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,540
All right, well there you
go. Well, now with the, uh,

602
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,220

603
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:38,054
um,

604
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,330
we try to put in some classic clips
from back in the day back in the dam and

605
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,780

So a,

606
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,580

Thank you guys for listening and uh,

609
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,220
Shreveport new or a New Orleans,
Shreveport, Louisiana. Jesus Christ.

610
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,570
Trying to get the word out.
Um, you know what I mean?

611
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,700
I, you know, it's such
a legendary theater.

612
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:12,880
If I go there and there's nobody there,
I'm still going to give a fucking,

613
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,250
obviously I'm still going to give a
great show, but I just, I don't, I don't,

614
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,093
I just don't want to fucking,

615
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I don't want to disrespect that
legendary place by standing there

616
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,110
in front of five fucking people. All
right. That's it. Okay. Fuck you.

617
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:33,650
Auto was senators the Bruins and making
the play offs. I'm calling it right now.

618
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,140
All right. All right. Right.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

619
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,300
Like I fucking hate judge, Judge
Carol. I hate all those mother fuckers.

620
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,820
Okay. This one is some lady screaming
at this guy going, you know,

621
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:19,090
you don't come in here and
disrespect is quite like that.

622
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,780
Disrespect what court?

623
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,540
It's a fucking TV show you dumped cunt.
You're not a fucking judge.

624
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,730
We're so sick of these fucking people
who get TV shows about a job and they

625
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:37,730
think that that that's your fucking job
now is still the job that the show and

626
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:41,590
know you're a TV star.
It's not a fucking court of law.

627
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,750
Even though it has the
authority of a court of law.

628
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:47,290
How many courts do you know out there?
Okay,

629
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,290
that ceased to exist if
they get bad ratings,

630
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,533
you know what I mean?

631
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,500
Actually left that comment on one of
those fucking youtube video things, man.

632
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,810
He's fucking girl show boat.

633
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,350
They always show boat and slam it down
the hammer screaming and yelling and then

634
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:02,561
you know,

635
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,320
they go to the commercial and then the
producer comes up and whispers in their

636
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:08,530
ear like, yeah, that was great
television. That was great. Tells me, Hey,

637
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,150
do more yelling, yell more. ESPN is
making a killing with the yelling.

638
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,650
I fuck ain't oh maybe it's my hatred
of women. I don't know what it is.

639
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:23,480
But those fucking women judges, that's
my nightmare of what being married is.

640
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,200
You know, cause you're legally bound to
them and they can take half your shit.

641
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,540
So now they can fucking
yell at you like that.

642
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,900
Banging a hammer hammer on
some fucking coffee table.

643
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,910
Oh, I'll tell you right now.
You can take half my shit.

644
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,950
I'll fucking walk just to get away
from you and your fucking goddamn

645
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,930
menopause. Chicken neck fucking screaming
at me. Go fuck yourself, Judge Judy.

646
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,290
There's no fucking way I
would stand there. Okay.

647
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,270
And get yelled at like that because a
third of my swing set is on my neighbor's

648
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:57,880
property.
You're gonna fucking yell at me like that.

649
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,130
Yeah.

650
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,040
Cause cause why? Why are you yelling at
me like that? You don't even feel it.

651
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:05,010
Judge Judy, all you, all you
want to do is get good ratings.

652
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,650
Fucking grand standing.
Go Fuck Yourself.

653
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:10,890
Please tell me not naked under that rope.

654
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,980
You emaciated older fork.

655
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,813
Oh.

656
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,443
Oh

657
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,210
I got,
I got an overrated overrated.

658
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,540
Picking up a fucking magazine that lists
10 great places to go to breakfast and

659
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:47,560
then believing that no one else read
the magazine and there's not going to be

660
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,890
aligned three miles long the next fucking
morning when you show up to get your

661
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:53,080
pancakes.
That's exactly what happened.

662
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,100
We pull up and I see this fucking looks
like a God damn breadline during the

663
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,330
depression and then with Nia and a
mom and I immediately just go, hey,

664
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,810
you guys want to go somewhere else? And
then somebody in the car goes, well,

665
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:06,640
there's probably going to
be a line everywhere, right?

666
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,630
So we fucking stand in line for
40 minutes. Got to the point.

667
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,070
I'm crouching down like, uh, my back is
killing my lower back. Like I'm so old,

668
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:19,900
I can't stand for longer than like 20
minutes without my lower back killing me

669
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:24,690
some standing there, 40 minutes
in, I'm crouching down like a,

670
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,730
you ever see Asians when they
have a conversation in China,

671
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:28,850
how they just fucking nigger.

672
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,780
They can crouch down like that
and are people in India, you know,

673
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,620
they crouched down like that.
They'd been doing it their whole lives.

674
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,000
So their hamstrings are all stretched out.
I was down like that.

675
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,250
My big head turn it all red.

676
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:48,010
I'm trying to stand in a
little bit of the shade and uh,

677
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,180
I don't know. Finally I was like, let's,
let's get the fuck outta here. Right?

678
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,020
So everybody agreed, we leave
and we ended up going, I mean,

679
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,660
we stood in line for breakfast so long,
it's not time to get lunch.

680
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,980
So we ended up going down.

681
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:04,981
We were on Santa Monica and we go down
into West Hollywood and there's a place

682
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:08,650
down there, hamburger Harry's.
They have great fucking, uh,

683
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,370
they've got great burgers and it's one,

684
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,170
but it's also one of the gayest places
you'll have a goatee in your life.

685
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,170
I didn't realize how gay it was.

686
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,620
And I went there and the waiter
was like really gay or whatever,

687
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:22,090
but I didn't really think about it.
Right?

688
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,590
So I drop off the ladies and I
go over and I parked the car,

689
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,060
I get out of the car and I come
walking in and I'm starving.

690
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,290
And as I'm walking in, all of a
sudden this guy pushes me in the back,

691
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,290
like gave me a nice little shove and I
turned around and he goes to need a table.

692
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,340
Fuck it. It's fucking gay.
Dude pushed me in the bed.

693
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:52,720
He pushed me like fuck. Then like
not hard enough to make me stumble,

694
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,860
but hard enough to fuck up the
gate of my walk. And immediately,

695
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,390
you know, felt the feelings you feel
when somebody fucking pushes you.

696
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:02,710
When I turn around like,
what the fuck?

697
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:07,180
And the guys just standing there
[inaudible] the table and I went, no,

698
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,800
I'm just meeting them over there.

699
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,270
And then he kinda had a weird look on his
face and he walked away and I sit down

700
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,540
and he's like, hey, how's it
going? I'm like, wait, but
how's it going? I go there.

701
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,310
Fucking gay guy. Just push me. So
I tell her the story and I'm off.

702
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,110
I've got with like, what the
fuck is it? Some gay thing.

703
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:26,140
You just fucking go around
pushing people and then Nia goes,

704
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,210
he was probably hitting on you, right?
So now my ego kicks in. I'm like,

705
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:31,511
fuck,

706
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:36,511
I still am in shape sell for any of my
fucking twinkle toed listeners out there.

707
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:40,700
Is that how you guys hit on each
other? Was that just like, Hey Kelly,

708
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,830
do you want to table? Is that what
he was doing? Fucking annoying.

709
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,500
Whatever it was. And I felt
embarrassed and I felt bad, like,

710
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,790
like a that look on his face when I went,
now I'm sitting over here like,

711
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,860
then he thought that I,
I don't know what

712
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,600
okay.

713
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,450
That I was saying, get out of
here. You're queer. You know,

714
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,840
cause that's a whole big fucking thing
now you gotta be nice to those guys.

715
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,650
What the fuck I'm saying? So
anyways, so we sit down, all right.

716
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,000
And immediately the dude comes over,
how I'm, can I take your order?

717
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:18,110
We fucking order and we're getting our
food immediately the way you should when

718
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:22,750
you go out to eat. So now,
despite the fact that fucking the,

719
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:25,730
the waiter pushed me like
that dude who push Zidane Oh,

720
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:29,090
Chara after he scored the goal,
that's basically how he pushed me.

721
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,890
And then I turned around and looked at it.
I'm like,

722
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,200
I was going to run him into
the boards basically, right?

723
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,040
So they fucking bring the food over.
It's delicious, everything's going great.

724
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:42,041
And then all of a sudden this fucking
dude gets on the Mike and he can't see

725
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:43,490
him. He's like, okay,

726
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:47,750
everybody shows 10 minutes,
right?

727
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,960
And I'd say, Nigga, what's
going on? She goes, evidently,

728
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:55,790
they're going to have a show.
It's fucking broad daylight out.

729
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,380
I guess they're going to come out and
drag and they're going to do a show like

730
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:00,651
this.

731
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:05,651
This is how gave this place is that
they're going to have a brunch slash

732
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:10,130
transvestite Lipsync fucking show.
And I got to tell you,

733
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,740
it was absolutely fucking hilarious.

734
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,130
We was sitting there
and the guy on the mic,

735
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,780
it's like 1130 in the morning and he said,
cunt on the mic.

736
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,250
He goes, come on, bitches,
drink up. We're having a show.

737
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:28,250
Don't be a bunch of something.
And he goes, sorry, I'm sorry,

738
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,320
I'm just feeling a little cunty

739
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,530
there with Nias mom.
And this guy starts saying cunt,

740
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,090
like every other fucking word in
broad daylight. And as a comedian,

741
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,240
I had to respect the guy.
All right.

742
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:47,240
I've never said cunt on stage when the
sun's out, I'm not going to lie to you.

743
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,960
I barely say it on stage. I say at a
ton of times here cause it's ridiculous.

744
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,290
But I really don't say it that
much on a comedy club stage.

745
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:59,291
And this dude slash half a lane is
say it con every other word at Brunch.

746
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,630
And uh,
so anyways,

747
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:08,630
so they come down like three of them.
The host sucked,

748
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,070
right? He had this giant head
with this huge fucking, uh,

749
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,570
I dunno what blonde wig on

750
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,810
and he,

751
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,810
he was like doing jokes that should have
been funny but weren't at some point he

752
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,490
said something about a bloody pussy and
we're sitting here eating brunch and he

753
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:32,970
makes a bloody pussy joke.
So as a comedian, this, this
should have been hilarious,

754
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,170
was timing was awful.

755
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,670
He'd say the setup and then he mumbled
a punchline and he was annoying me.

756
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:42,000
The next one came out was, all right,
the dude looked like Nancy grace.

757
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:45,390
So that was cracking me up. And then, uh,

758
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,080
the next one looked like a soccer mom.

759
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,520
Yeah.

760
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,390
If, if she was in Battlestar
Galactica, you know, you know,
when they have those, uh,

761
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:00,640
you know, they get that Woodstock, Ellen
degenerate haircut kind of had that,

762
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:04,570
but spiked up and that was hilarious.
And then the last one freaked me out.

763
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:07,630
There's always one that's going to freak
you out because it's going to almost

764
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:11,620
look like a fucking chick.
So it had like acid plants and it's like,

765
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:14,050
I'm trying to eat and I got, I
gotta get Outta here. So I go up,

766
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:19,110
I walk out of the restaurant because,
you know, it's one of those deals.

767
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,740
It's like when in Rome you went into
their place, so you got to tolerate,

768
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,080
then becomes, does that point we
just like, all right, this is,

769
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:30,130
this is too fucking creepy. I
gotta get Outta here. You know.

770
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,910
So I walk out and I'm standing on the
corner out in front of this place that

771
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:39,910
turned into the gayest place I've
ever been in. And I got to tell you,

772
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,010
I walked down the street
all the time in la.

773
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,970
Nobody ever tells me that they saw
me, nobody's ever seen me, nothing.

774
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:47,860
I come walking out of this place right.

775
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,340
And this behind me is this something the
transvestite that almost looks like it,

776
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:58,600
chick with acid plants and his
dancing to salt and pepper push it.

777
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,463
I swear to God.

778
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,930
So I'm standing out in front of that
place and it's that part of the song was

779
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:09,931
going Bullshit Dona Ana and this guy
pulls up from the comedy store stopping at

780
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:15,010
the Red Light. He's like, hey bill,
how you doing? And I'm just like, hey,

781
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:16,290
how's it gone?
Done

782
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,900
and the fucking background and my face
literally turned red with embarrassment.

783
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,510
But fortunately,

784
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,500
fortunately the guy owned a
restaurant across the way.

785
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:36,280
So then he ended up coming out,
coming over to me coming out.

786
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:40,180
How fucking funny is that? He comes
over to me and he goes, uh, you know,

787
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:40,871
to shoot the shit.

788
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,210
Cause I've been telling him I was going
to go to his restaurant and that just,

789
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:48,211
then fortunately Nia and her mom walked
out and I've never been so relieved to

790
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:52,630
be like, this is my girlfriend.
And this is your mom.

791
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,020
I didn't know that there was gonna be a
fucking, it was like, uh, when I got a,

792
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,700
I had a mid eighties,

793
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,600
I don't know what a mid eighties,
a sitcom, you know, with this,

794
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:07,440
this situation

795
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,920
[inaudible]

796
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,720
[inaudible].
