00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,960
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:08,760
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, November 13th, 2017.

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:13,050
What's going on? How I,
yeah, what's going on?

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,830
I am in New York City, both boom, boom.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,060
Buttered oda doubt to dote. Um, oh,

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:25,170
it's actually Hollywood with the fuck
am I thinking? It's not a New York Song,

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,423
right?

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,800
Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam,

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,880
Bam,
Bam.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,020
Did it. It did it. That's Hollywood right?

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,120
That's in New York side.
Starts spread in the nose.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,420
Right? I don't fucking know.
I'm all over the map here. Um,

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,380
I'm winding down this trip. I just
wrapped up my acting gig on front runner.

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,580
Uh, I want to thank everybody that,
that allowed me to be on that movie.

15
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,630
I had such a great time. I met so many
great people on that shoot. And, uh,

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,100
the last night of the shoot,

17
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:05,700
I actually got to do a scene with
the star of the movie. He was

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,140
Jackman.
And um,

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,260
I can't even tell you how great
that experience was. He might,

20
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:16,860
he might be the not one of the nicest
guys I've ever met in my life. Uh,

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,710
totally cool. Big Guy too. He's like
six, four or something. Big Guy.

22
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,350
Totally cool. Nicest fucking dude ever.
Then you start doing the scene right.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,800
And it's,
his character in the scene was getting,

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,740
was getting mad and
frustrated with us dude.

25
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:38,240
And he went into that wolverine thing a
little bit. I was just like, Jesus Christ,

26
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:39,410
I will not fuck with this guy.

27
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,890
Just an amazing,
amazing actor.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,990
And uh, I was the coolest
thing. Like on the last night,

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,450
we had like two things to shoot,

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,740
like one quick thing in a car and then
the whole rest of the thing was, uh,

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,180
us, you know, like me and two
other actors and Hugh Jackman.

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,350
And it was just like, it was a,
yeah, we shot that the whole night.

33
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,700
And it was one of those
things where he's like,

34
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,940
I wouldn't really care if we continued
shooting this scene tomorrow.

35
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:13,220
I'm having so much fun. You know
what I found out? I actually,

36
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:15,860
I like to run when I act.

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,670
This scene involves me running into
running before I delivered the,

38
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,980
uh,
my lines or whatever.

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,810
And I found that I really liked that
and I was just like, wow, no wonder.

40
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:32,870
I always like William
Shatner and Tj Hooker.

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,190
I know I've talked about this before,
but if you ever watch TJ hooker,

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,300
I don't think in the history
of television they ever,

43
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,070
they ever made an actor run farther than
they made William Shatner who's well

44
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:51,071
into his 50s by then they would just have
like this the master shot of the scene

45
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,940
and I want to get all Hollywood here
run yet, but the master is just,

46
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:58,430
when you go to shoot this
scene is you're just,

47
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:02,140
it's a wide shot and you're capturing
every character in it or you're

48
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,350
establishing the place, the
setting. I have no fucking idea.

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,600
I think that's what it is.
Right. They would just,

50
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,360
they would just be standing
on the other side of a wharf,

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,630
a runway like Williams shot and he chased
after planes and they would just start

52
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,290
and he would come running around the
corner and he would always be like look 70

53
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,250
yards away and they'd be playing this
fucking music with the Bongos in the

54
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:29,251
background and you would watch him just
full speed running a man in his 50s all

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,940
right. And this is like
the 80 so no guys stretched

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,920
unless you were on like you know you
had to be like in the Olympics and even

57
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,850
then if you watch like the old NFL films,
the way that they would stretch,

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,080
you know what I mean? They weren't
doing like any just sort of you know,

59
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:48,880
doing a forward bend, none of that
Yoga Shit. It was like touch your toes,

60
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:50,470
touch your hips,
touching shoulders,

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,110
do a jumping jack come back down
or whatever the fuck they would do,

62
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:55,120
what to treat for that type of stuff.

63
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm running and cop shoes,
full speed for a good 80 yards.

64
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,110
This is actually a great youtube video
that I think I posted before of we have

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,860
of Tj hooker running. Um, so anyways,

66
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:13,120
I had the, uh, I had the best time and uh,

67
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,900
did the perfect amount of time on the
movie cause right when it ended I came

68
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,020
right here to New York and then I'm
going to go back and the rest of my year,

69
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,240
other than like two road gigs,
I am done.

70
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,050
And I'm going to get to spend this
ridiculous amount of quality time with my

71
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,420
wife and daughter and I can't wait.

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,320
I'm totally getting into the
Christmas spirit this year.

73
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,060
Not to the point of
sacrificing thanksgiving. Um,

74
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,530
you know,
I don't know,

75
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:43,660
I might even put up a couple of little
like cut up turkeys in my house.

76
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:46,270
I hate out thanksgiving, just gets
passed over. You know what I mean?

77
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,290
Gets passed over like a a,

78
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,090
I dunno like a person that should
have got the job but didn't write a,

79
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,600
but I'm totally getting into it and I am,
I'm still so ba was it,

80
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:03,160
he was 84 days on
Thursday. So 85, 86, 87 88.

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,000
Eric Lindros 88 Lynn Swann.

82
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,770
I wasn't he 88. Yeah. Um,

83
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,940
88 days. Not boozing. And uh, I think
I'm going to go for the hundred.

84
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,770
I don't know. You know, I
think I will be, let's see,

85
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,230
I'll be 91 on Thursday
a week from Thursday.

86
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,740
It'll be 98 and then there'll
be thanksgiving. And what,

87
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm not going to have a little
brandy in my eggnog there.

88
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,640
A big with the brandy and
the egg Nog you know? Um,

89
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,510
that's what I would have added to the
great opie and Anthony bit the Eggnog.

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,000
OPA Anthony Little Jimmy. Right? You think
those guys love to get back together?

91
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,390
Do like a reunion tour.
They should have like a one off.

92
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,020
You don't need like a toy. You don't
like the police got back together.

93
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,880
They should do that with great radio shows
where everybody eventually, you know,

94
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,770
just got sick of each other
and went the other way.

95
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:01,340
But the fans are still sitting there
like, come on man, just to one more tour,

96
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,980
man. They should all
get together. You know,

97
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,360
I think it will have guns and
roses can get back together.

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,730
Right.
Um,

99
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,290
I know, fucking know.
Anyways, plowing ahead of you.

100
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,700
I'm totally going to get
into the holidays. Uh,

101
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,820
okay.

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,010
And I dunno, I dunno about the drinking
thing. I think I'm done for a while.

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,250
Like I said, I want to go staying in
my fifties. I'm turning 50 in June

104
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,330
and um,

105
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,320
I want to make sure, uh, I dunno,
that's a critical fucking decade,

106
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,263
right?

107
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,550
That's that one. They make, you know,
people like fucking die in their 50s.

108
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,773
So I get them.

109
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,780
That's when people just start dying.
I mean, people, I've, I've gotten,

110
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,050
I've already lost, like I've lost count
how many fucking friends I actually,

111
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,730
I have a list on my phone,

112
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:01,120
so I don't forget all the comics
that I've known that have died.

113
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,150
Um, by the way, all men,

114
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,120
all men out of the 25,
they're all meant,

115
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,900
so all these women out there like you
don't understand how difficult it is to be

116
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:16,670
a woman. It's like, lady, I got
25 dead friends. They're all guys.

117
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,103
Okay,

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,600
I don't know what the fuck is going
on with us, but whatever you guys are,

119
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,220
there's something that you guys,
something in your life is easier.

120
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,680
I know in this age of feminism
where it just has to be,

121
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:34,030
everything is so fucking much harder
for a woman. There is one easy thing,

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,040
one easier thing for a woman and it really
is the most important thing and that

123
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,630
is staying alive.

124
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,440
I wouldn't fuck is my phone.
I got them all like I got and I'm,

125
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:53,610
I'm, I'm probably going to
forget a few people. All right,

126
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,810
let's see here.

127
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,380
These are all the fucking people
did I knew that had gone here.

128
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,750
All right. It all started with Mitch
Hedberg in like March I think at 2005.

129
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,430
Mitch Hedberg, Freddy Soto, Mitch
Malanie, Robert Schimmel, Bernie Mac,

130
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,180
Dave Fitzgerald, Kevin Knox,
Bob Side Bell, Bob Lazaruth,

131
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:19,130
rich size slur auto from auto and
George Greg Giraldo, Patrice O'Neal,

132
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,450
Todd Lynn, Sam Brown, Charlie Murphy,
Scott Kennedy, John Pinette, Richard Jeni,

133
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:28,140
Mike [inaudible], Fano,
Ralphie may and peak coming.

134
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,460
Those are all the people that I knew
really well or worked with as a comedian

135
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,090
then have all died since 2005 separate
day. Fitzgerald. He died earlier.

136
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,030
He doesn't like 2001. It
was a Boston karmic. Um,

137
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,890
and I probably forgot a few people,

138
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,490
you know, club owners,
Manny Dorman, Lucian Hole.

139
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,900
And then I have like let's high school
kids that I went to school with. One, two,

140
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,560
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. All guys.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,193
Okay.

142
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,640
Fucking unbelievable.

143
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,640
He just don't understand sometimes
what it's like to be, I know,

144
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,533
I absolutely,

145
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm sure it's fucking a much more
difficult than a lot of ways,

146
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:20,760
but I'll tell you that the most
important way, staying alive,

147
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,570
that's not, forget that. Um, anyways, uh,

148
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,080
so I did the, uh, the
new west side comedy club

149
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,830
and it was just the perfect layout.
And I also love to,

150
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:41,030
it's right around the corner from
the, uh, the beacon theater. So, uh,

151
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,770
I've gotten to play,
there were a couple of times,

152
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:46,820
but what I also love is if I was
a young competing starting out,

153
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,740
it's really like this motivational thing
where you walk out and then you walk

154
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:54,470
around the corner and there's the beacon
theater and you can kind of be thinking,

155
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,630
you know, Sunday, maybe I'll
be able to play that place.

156
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,580
That's the type of shit
that used to get me. Um,

157
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,360
yeah,

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,290
used to get me motivated
when I was starting out,

159
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,090
although I don't know
about playing theaters.

160
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,150
I think it was just seeing Caroline's
comedy club because when I was starting

161
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,510
out, like nobody played theaters.
It was like Cosby played theaters.

162
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,670
George Carlin like you had
to be like a legend. Um,

163
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,460
Joan Rivers,
um,

164
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,250
those people played like theaters

165
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,870
and um,

166
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,630
you know, for most comedians when
I started, I think it was, um,

167
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,170
the dream was to just sell out clubs.

168
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,660
The dream was to sell out clubs and
to get a Sitcom built around your act.

169
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,940
Uh,
that was the dream.

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,400
And then somewhere along the line it's
switched and a lot of people talk about,

171
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,290
you know,
social media and Blah Blah and all that.

172
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,960
I think the biggest thing that is created,

173
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,420
one of the big things that people
forget as far as like how all of these

174
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:01,890
comedians now are,

175
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,480
are big enough of a draw to play theaters.

176
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:11,481
I think one of the best
things that happened for
comedians that nobody brings up

177
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,324
is Napster.

178
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,560
An online file sharing air quote,
sharing of music,

179
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:23,561
which was really stealing
music that completely destroyed
the music business and

180
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:28,790
their ability to make stars.
Um,

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,400
you remember virgin records but you would
go in there and they had that little

182
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:35,720
CD listening thing and they had like
the top 10 or the top 20 cds and they'd

183
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:39,500
always be like a new band in there.
It's like they were feeding,

184
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,020
you know,
bringing new people in.

185
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,760
And once Napster came out and then there
was the live wire and all of that shit

186
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:51,650
and then iTunes and all of
that, what happened was, um, oh,

187
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:55,090
am I gonna use this term?
There was an the development of new,

188
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:59,980
like when you look at like the amount
of bands that broke through and like the

189
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:03,220
last 10 years that was suddenly
able to sell out arenas.

190
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,540
It's like a handful of bands
or people like lady Gaga,

191
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,770
Bruno Mars was at 21 pilots is very few

192
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
that got that big.

193
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,010
Um, at least not as much
as uh, as they used to.

194
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,400
I feel my might be completely wrong on
this, but if I'm, if I'm not mistaken,

195
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,900
there was like,
like the MTV music or had like the five,

196
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,590
the same five artists for a long time.

197
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:34,260
We're with a few new ones but like,

198
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,130
like Jay z Kanye and like, I dunno,
I'm not so good with all the,

199
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:41,810
all the youngest people stuff,

200
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:46,811
but they stuck around forever at those
music awards because there was not these

201
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:49,040
new people coming in.

202
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,323
MMM.

203
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,950
Usually for somebody to stick around
in a music award for over 10 years.

204
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:58,500
I feel like there was only a
couple of bands that could do it,

205
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:01,620
but they had to keep those people from
10 years previous cause they all got

206
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,230
knocked out.
And then I'm going to get to a point here.

207
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,660
So everything became a quick
little bullshit. I don't
want to pay for it online.

208
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:14,270
And I think in everybody went online,
either wanted to fucking uh,

209
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,640
watch someone do something incredible
on a skateboard, some x games,

210
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:22,950
shit. Or you wanted to watch people
fail and you wanted to laugh.

211
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,660
And I feel like standup comedy fit
into that set up punch, set up, punch.

212
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:30,330
It was quick. They made you
laugh, you fucking moved on.

213
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,310
And then I think comedians slid into
all of these theater gigs that were,

214
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:38,160
all of these bands would have been
playing. I'm not talking arenas,

215
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:42,600
I just mean like, like theaters. I
might be wrong on that one, but I think,

216
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:47,310
um, if you look at the graph
as music business imploded,

217
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:51,060
comedy went through the fucking roof.
Then also with technology,

218
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll comics comics could just
keep putting out these specials.

219
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,450
And then Netflix was another big thing.
But everybody talks about that.

220
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,330
But nobody seems, I don't know.
I think the music business,

221
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,390
I'm completely imploding
also helped out stand up.

222
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:09,990
It created a void. Um, I don't know.

223
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,110
You liked it and you're like me
discussing the fee, the INS and outs

224
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,350
of ticket sales and standup comedy.
So anyways, so I was working at the,

225
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:22,200
uh, west side comedy
club. You got to go there.

226
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,710
Some old friends of mine opened
the place up. That's why I did it.

227
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,400
I had the best time. And what was
really cool is it mostly, you know,

228
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,480
podcasts listeners,

229
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:35,481
so I could say whatever the fuck I
thought essentially in these times,

230
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,920
you know what I mean? Everything
that's going on, you know,

231
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,120
I heard like those fucking,

232
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,550
okay.

233
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,760
People were going down to the comedy
cellar and then writing down what other

234
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:47,630
comics were saying about Louis Ck and
all of that type of stuff was just,

235
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:52,580
it's just so fucking, it's
such a crazy time. Right. Um,

236
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,280
and, uh, you know, I dunno,

237
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,170
I love Louis C K and that
was really obviously just
at fucking hard thing to see

238
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,450
happen to somebody. And he was definitely
100% wrong. I'll just say this,

239
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:05,540
he was 100% wrong.

240
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,610
He did own up to it and I think
he will definitely be back.

241
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,080
Um,
I will say that,

242
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,930
and I also knew a couple of the
women that he did the shit too.

243
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,510
And I just felt bad for everybody.
It's just fucking terrible. And uh,

244
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,490
I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno. What
else do you see you say about it?

245
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,060
I feel like I'm in a divorce where,
you know, both the mom and the dad.

246
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:34,420
You need just, you got to like
pick a fucking side here. Uh,

247
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,320
you know, I dunno all, I think that
just this new thing though is like,

248
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,460
like the level of witch hunt that
happened when the Louis think came out.

249
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:45,100
Like the amount of fucking people
that they went after was just fucking,

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,550
it was like six degrees of Louise Dick,
you know,

251
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:51,400
to the point that even the fucking
Huffington post was even trying to like,

252
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,313
you know,

253
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,300
list people that clients have the
same manager that he had and stuff.

254
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:02,050
Food by the way, is one of the
great people I've ever met in life.

255
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,160
I stand by my fucking manager
and I'm never firing the guy.

256
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:08,020
I've been with this guy since 2006 date.

257
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:11,260
Becky's one of the great people that I've
met in this business. I love that guy.

258
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,710
It's still have him over
my house for fucking dinner
watching everybody just, Oh,

259
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,490
I think I remembered this
happening 15 fucking years ago.

260
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,800
And then watching everybody tried
to burn down this guy's life.

261
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,020
It's just fucking predicts people. This
is America. You remember due process,

262
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,370
like the whole thing, it's
just like, it's fucking insane.

263
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,100
I wouldn't be surprised
if they don't have to.

264
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,790
Louis Ck is mailman man saying if you
deliver his mail yet part of the problem,

265
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,530
um,
you know,

266
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,360
and it doesn't seem to be like
there's any sort of like, you know,

267
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:50,000
when the judicial system where
there's like if you steal a bike,

268
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:54,140
you get this sentence. If you rob a
bank, you get this. If you kill somebody,

269
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:57,440
if you kill a whole bunch of people all
the way up to the death penalty. Yeah.

270
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:01,030
This kind of seems like it's become,
um,

271
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,850
it doesn't make a difference if it's
sexual misconduct all the way to sexual

272
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,060
assault slash rape,
you know,

273
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,820
you're getting the exact same,
uh,

274
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,200
like level of punishment. Um,
so that's only my question.

275
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,950
Okay. Out of all of this
because he was definitely wrong.

276
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,970
Obviously I'm, that means is all
obvious shit that I'm saying. But, uh,

277
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,270
does the punishment match
the crime because you know,

278
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:35,800
sexual misconduct when you
talk about sexual misconduct?
Like I, I don't, I would,

279
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,360
I don't know how many podcast I would
have to do to tell you all the stories of

280
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:41,350
sexual misconduct,

281
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,440
but just women as a standup comedian
who used to go out after his shows,

282
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,280
selling his posters
all and taking pictures

283
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,270
with, to just the fucking
women. Okay. And I'll tell you,

284
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,310
it was never any of the young ones.

285
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,050
It was always these
middle age fucking women.

286
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,840
Couple of glasses of red wine.
Oh God.

287
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:08,040
And they'd come at you with their vulva
boom energy and you'd be like, oh no,

288
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,510
here we go. You know, that's my advice.

289
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,350
Young male comics out there,

290
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,180
young female comics is plenty of
information out there for you now about

291
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,710
watching out for creepy guys.

292
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,160
But I don't think there's anything
out there for young male comics.

293
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,590
I will tell you this,
okay.

294
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,510
If you're going to go out and meet a
crowd afterwards, when middle aged women,

295
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,500
you can tell they've had too much wine
beyond the fact that they're sort of

296
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:39,030
teetering on their high heels shoes with
their old feet sticking out of them,

297
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,780
just looked for the great teeth.
All right.

298
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:45,720
And a little bit too much
makeup and then that, you know,

299
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,100
they got the girls out a little bit.
Just fucking watch yourself. Okay.

300
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,150
Cause that's the,
uh,

301
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:56,151
that's the old cheerleader who is not
aging well and is freaking out that guys

302
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:59,370
don't find her attractive anymore.
And I'm telling you,

303
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,610
they're going to come up to you Eric,
you know,

304
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,490
Covey of junk.
That's all I'm going to say.

305
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,900
Dude.
I hit a woman,

306
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:14,580
licked my neck one time and I'll tell
you worst than the touch of her tongue,

307
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,470
her old ass, disgusting wine
breath tongue on my fucking neck.

308
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,450
Worse than that was, I felt her
breath right before the eagle landed.

309
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,280
I will, uh Oh gee, oh and
forget about gay guys.

310
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:33,420
Jesus Christ. I got to do another
half podcast on that one. We've,

311
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,020
we're just talking about
sexual misconduct. Um,

312
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,620
I always wanted to rub your chest.
The fuck did you just do

313
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,310
I remember what time it is. The thing
about a guy when it happens to a guy,

314
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:54,300
it's just funny just for the simple
fact that, you know, generally speaking,

315
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,600
you can overpower whoever the
fuck is coming at you. I'm not a,

316
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,830
I'm not a little boy,

317
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,770
so I get why nobody gives a
shit when this happens to a guy.

318
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,340
I get it.
Um,

319
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,310
I remember I was dating this absolutely
lovely woman, beautiful woman.

320
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,180
She danced on Broadway.
She was such a sweet town.

321
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,400
I loved him to death and I completely
fucked it up cause I was an angry young

322
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:20,490
man. So I'm sorry to her. Right.

323
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,090
So she was dancing in this
thing called Broadway bears,

324
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,190
which was like,
they used to do this thing to raise money.

325
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:33,330
It was like a burlesque show. So it
wasn't like this creepy titty bar thing.

326
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:37,410
It was just, uh, you know, if
you ever go to a burlesque show,

327
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,400
which my wife took me to one to see
that Dita von Teese. I was just like,

328
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,900
are you fucking kidding me? She's going
to take me down here to go to go see,

329
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:50,170
basically go to a rated PG 13 strip club.

330
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,940
I have the coolest wife ever.

331
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:55,060
And then I got down there and I think I
was the only straight guy there and it

332
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:59,690
was like mostly gay guys, right?

333
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,470
And uh, that's what this
Broadway bears thing was. It,

334
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,350
it wasn't like the creepy who'd is five?

335
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,530
So it's actually better if
there's a bunch of gay dude sick.

336
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:12,140
Cause I always did that whole,
I feel like Hooters strip clubs,

337
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,760
titty bars and all that shit.
It's just like,

338
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,020
that's something that's like fascinating
when you're like in your 20s I think.

339
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,750
And then somewhere, you
know, if you're progressing,

340
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,140
if you're maturing at some
point it just becomes gross.

341
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:27,710
Or at the very least like this
is fucking stupid. You know,

342
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,750
I want to go out and get laid.

343
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:34,110
I'm going to sit here looking at naked
women who aren't going to fuck me.

344
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,410
You know, this is stupid
while losing a ton of money,

345
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,010
paying for watered down drinks went,
now I don't want to eat in here.

346
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,000
You were in the sex industry, get away
from me. I want to order some food. Right?

347
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,680
So I go down to this Broadway
bears thing right? And, uh,

348
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,650
you know,
there's all these fucking lyrics,

349
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:55,710
there's all these smoking hot
women doing their dances and stuff.

350
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,410
And then there's all these shredded dudes.

351
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:59,610
So all the gay guys are
going nuts about the dude's.

352
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,460
And I'm looking at all these women
going like, oh my God. Right.

353
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:06,360
Fucking dance or legs. They were
incredible. Right? Oh, by the way,

354
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:10,320
they also were really talented.
All right,

355
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,900
so the fucking show ends.

356
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,660
Okay.

357
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,800
And I'm waiting for my girlfriend at the
time to come out and this fucking out

358
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:23,560
of nowhere, this guy came up and just
smack me on the ass. And it wasn't like,

359
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,660
like, it was like if you were
playing football, it was good game,

360
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:30,210
but at that place it was, it, this guy
wanted to fucking hook up me. Dude,

361
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,520
he hit me so hard,

362
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:36,521
like I almost fucking got whiplash and
I fucking turned around and I can't say

363
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:39,370
what I said to the guy.
Um,

364
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,830
but I made it clear to him that I
wasn't gay and I'll never forget,

365
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,130
he just like put his hands
up and was like backing away.

366
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:46,790
Yeah.

367
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,610
Edelman where he put his hands up
the dude at these fucking guns.

368
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:53,750
And I was just like, you know, I don't
know what this guy's thinking right now,

369
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,370
but if he wanted to do something,

370
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:59,870
I don't know if there's anything I
could do about it and never forget is,

371
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,240
is big hairy gay arms just going,
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I just fucking,

372
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,560
no, you didn't even talk like that.
I'm doing like the hacky gave voice.

373
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:13,130
He had just like a regular dude voice.
And um,

374
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,700
I'll do, I got a zillion of those
fucking zillion of those fucking stories.

375
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,230
If we're talking sexual misconduct
here. And um, and you know,

376
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:27,231
it's funny is the reason I stopped going
out after my shows wasn't all of those

377
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:33,681
fucking witches of Eastwick drunk bitches
coming up to me doing God knows what,

378
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,880
right.
Just crossing all kinds of fucking lines.

379
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,340
Like literally like you're
a cartoon character.

380
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,620
What made me finally stop was that time
that guy went to take the camera to take

381
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:50,290
the picture of his girlfriend or wife
and a loaded nine millimeter felon.

382
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,770
You Proud?

383
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,870
Yeah.

384
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,260
And it was right on the ground. And I
should have kicked it away. You know,

385
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,430
all the episodes is Saskia a hot,
shy watched. I did. And I just froze.

386
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,400
I pointed at the gun and I
went, Dude, what the fuck?

387
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,970
And I let them bend down and pick
it up and I just stood there.

388
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,010
I've never felt more white in my life,
you know what I mean?

389
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:17,900
Just classic Culdesac like, Hey, frank
d I, I believe you dropped your pistol.

390
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,000
Thanks, Bill blows my
fucking brains out. Oh,

391
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:27,560
you hear that? That's my alarm. I
get up a little early. So anyways,

392
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:28,080
people,

393
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,510
I think it's a great thing that all of
this stuff is coming out because there's

394
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,930
no way that women should
have to be tolerating this.

395
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:37,490
They've tolerated it way too long.

396
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:41,000
But can we stop short here of like,

397
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:42,890
um,

398
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,390
then trying to literally destroy
everybody around the fucking person,

399
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,970
um, over social media and no
burden of proof whatsoever.

400
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,770
These are like real people that
you're going after. Okay. You know?

401
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,480
Yeah.

402
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,450
These people that are around, these
people that have done horrible things,

403
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:06,680
they have wives, they have kids, they have
families, they have mortgages. You know,

404
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,830
and just to just fucking just Willy Nilly,
oh,

405
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,900
somebody just said this on Twitter.

406
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:16,901
It has to be true and just pile on and
blow on the ashes and try to turn it into

407
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:19,130
fuck a fucking inferno.

408
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,993
MMM.

409
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,010
It's also not right.

410
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,453
Okay.

411
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,630
And,
uh,

412
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,140
I feel really bad for my manager and what
the hell he's going through right now.

413
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:34,040
I really do.

414
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,963
MMM.

415
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,860
And I'm not going to be one of these
fucking people and I hate how this,

416
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:42,010
this whole fucking day and it don't
say anything, man. It's not worth it.

417
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:42,700
Don't say thing.

418
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,760
So I'm just going to lead this guy
who's been a friend to me for fucking 11

419
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,370
years,
guided me through my career.

420
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,550
My career went to the fucking
stratosphere with this gun.

421
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,880
I'm just going to leave them twisting
in the wind. Go Fuck Yourself. They,

422
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:55,960
Becky's a great guy.

423
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,973
MMM.

424
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,640
Anyways, plowing ahead.
What do we got here? Uh,

425
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,500
but blah, blah, blah. Let's read a little
bit. Uh, no, I, you know what I missed?

426
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,334
I missed the,

427
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,260
I missed a formula one race in it
sounded like it was amazing evidence.

428
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,810
I don't know how Lewis Hamilton ended up,
uh,

429
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,490
starting in last place, but he worked
his way all the way up to first,

430
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:26,340
which I have never seen somebody
must have crashed because, uh,

431
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,910
I dunno the way Max for staffing
was running during the last race.

432
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:33,000
Once somebody gets out in front,
you know,

433
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,350
when they're driving
through the clean air,

434
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:36,900
there was that little thing I know
about aerodynamics and racing.

435
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:38,340
No one can never catch him,
so,

436
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,450
okay.

437
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,450
They must have had a brilliant strategy
plus like slash else that was plush plus

438
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,020
and slash plash.
Um,

439
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,030
somebody's car must
have broken down or uh,

440
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,690
they must've been an accident or
something. I have no idea. But, uh,

441
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,690
can somebody say, I know you guys
have sent me this link before.

442
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:02,610
Can somebody try and find a, or
send me the link to where, um,

443
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,200
where I can rewatch the races.
Um,

444
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,070
the replay of him because
Brazil is that brand.

445
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:13,860
When did you see fucking the Mercedes
Benz team got robbed at gunpoint?

446
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,350
Lewis Hamilton wasn't there and,
but he's quote was basically,

447
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,480
this happens every time we come down here.

448
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,430
How bad is that for tourism in Brazil?
You know what I mean?

449
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,860
Every time we come down here,
the Illuminati sport gets fucking robbed.

450
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,940
Can we do something about security?
Um,

451
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,760
you know, thank God. Like, you know,
if I was like the president of Brazil,

452
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,880
I actually wouldn't be too nervous
because Brazil has arguably the most

453
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:51,060
beautiful women in the world down there.
You know what I mean?

454
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,410
And that will keep people coming despite
the fact that even the Mercedes Benz

455
00:27:55,411 --> 00:28:00,411
Formula One team gets robbed at gunpoint
and they weren't there on vacation.

456
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,370
They came down there with the entire
sport and somebody still finally got

457
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,950
through. I guess when you got a a pistol,
you don't really need a laminate. The,

458
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,770
uh, can we see her credentials?
Yeah. Yeah. Right here buddy. Okay.

459
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,580
Lewis Hamilton's over there and I believe
he's still has his diamond earring and

460
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,070
have added, um, all right, let's

00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,770
feel free to improvise.

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,020
Jesus Christ a soft,
that's what they just wrote there.

492

I love me on these cause I love

also soft, flexible waistband,

495
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,030
three times softer than cotton.

496
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,920
Cotton just takes a beating during
these, these, these fucking, you know,

497
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,980
these reeds,
they're always getting trashed.

that's [inaudible] dot com slash burr.

507
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,770
All right. Dollar Shave Club. Um,

508
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,690
as soon as I heard dollar shave club
had stuff other than their razors,

509
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,100
I was sold. Evidentaly why do they
always try to write what I'm thinking?

510
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,810
All right. I actually think that they're
really smart. Like why stop there?

511
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,240
They get it.
Guys want to shit,

512
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:39,490
shower and shave and they're
giving them everything to do it.

513
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,380
But with it right at the store,

514
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:44,650
there are too many options and you can't
tell the difference between any of them.

515
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,600
Then if you have any question,

516
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,620
the clerk usually doesn't
know the difference either
or can't really help you.

517
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,010
Since they are not experts on products,
just like their razors,

518
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:58,810
everything is super high quality and
left me looking and feeling amazing

519
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:03,040
evidently from premium ingredients
to sophisticated fence,

520
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,010
sophisticated sense.
You know like before you put it on,

521
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,480
everybody thinks you're a moron.

522
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,760
Then all of a sudden you put on
their fucking body spray though.

523
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,400
Did you go to Grad School?

524
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Dollar Shave Club is changing the game
status set to new members for only $5 to

525
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,110

also receive their executive razor,

530

which includes their premium, weighty
handle and focus set of cartridges.

531
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,190
By the way,
when you get a razor,

532
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:49,990
okay,

533
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,640
that as a weighty handle, do not pull it
down and drag it across your face, okay?

534
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,900
You just let it,

535
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,740
you just lightly hold it and you let
gravity pull it down across your face.

536
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,830
That's, that's the way you
do it. All right? Trust me,
if you do it the other way,

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,710
you're going to cut your face if
you do it the way I just said,

538
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:07,000
you're going to get the smoothest shave.

539

558
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,860
Just like that cool chick up the
street that doesn't want to be in a

559
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:19,694
relationship.

560
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,470
I use stamps.com because anytime I
send out my fucking posters, you know,

561
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,820
and I want to go out there and be a,

562
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,610
have some sexual misconduct with some
women who are far too old to be acting in

563
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,740
that way.
I send them out

564
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,430
through stamps.com do it.
I've actually been telling his story of,

565
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,490
by the letter of the law of something
that happened to me last year,

566
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:46,820
which was sexual assault,
which was by a woman.

567
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,820
But it's a lady and no one gives a shit.
Um,

568
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,230
I've come out and see my fucking
standup set. There you go.

569
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:59,180
I'm teasing sexual assault here.
I'm just turning it into a bit.

570
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,020
Um,
uh,

571
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,450
yeah,
and it's a really funny fucking story.

572

All right, 35 minutes. All right,
so the f one of the other, uh,

581
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,980
two reasons why I'm here in
New York. Okay. Reasons. I

582
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,690
did the west side comedy club,
Bam,

583
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,730
a on Saturday night I did a Michael J.

584
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,410
Fox is charity,
the uh,

585
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,590
the Fox Foundation.
I did a benefit for them.

586
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,300
One of the coolest gigs I've
ever got to do in my life. I, uh,

587
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,930
I show up, right? First of all,
it's Michael J. Fox, right?

588
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,230
I mean that guy's comedic timing.
You know,

589
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:09,120
like when they say somebody has like a
perfect pitch when they go to sing or

590
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:10,770
whatever. I always felt like, you know,

591
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,000
grew up watching him on family ties and
of course all the back to the future

592
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:19,680
movies. Um, and I just
piss, timing was just like,

593
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,190
was impeccable. Right. And it
may makes it really, really easy.

594
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:27,420
But just as a fan of comedy and
everything, I always loved the guy. So I,

595
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:30,840
I realized I was going to get to meet
him and I show up to the Gig and I'm

596
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:33,510
always nervous whenever I have to
do a benefit cause it's, you know,

597
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:36,420
it's a benefit. People going
to be in this, you know,

598
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,880
they're going to be in a certain
mindset or it's just like, you know,

599
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
wow, I'm really lucky that
you know, I'm healthy,

600
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:48,150
I have my family
Blahblahblahblahblah and other,

601
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:51,310
these other people are going through
this really difficult thing. These are,

602
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,180
there's a sense of like
guilt that you feel, um,

603
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,820
just all of that type.

604
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:00,870
It just puts the crowd in a certain mood
where then all of a sudden they go from

605
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:04,320
laughing to everything that
you say is just like, ah,

606
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,780
oh boom.

607
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,770
You know, those are the sounds. I
usually hear it benefits. So I was,

608
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,490
I'm always a little apprehensive and in
my head I'm sitting there going like,

609
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,343
all right,

610
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,170
how can I

611
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,700
navigate this situation?
Cause there's what I want to talk about.

612
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,970
And then there's what I should talk
about just to get through this. Right?

613
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,500
So I show up in the form of the first
people I saw was Eugene Mirman who hadn't

614
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:32,630
seen in a while and I was so relieved to
see another comedian. I was just like,

615
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:35,590
God, thank God. So we both would just
sort of laugh and talking about how,

616
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,990
all right, it's a benefit. How
is this? What's going to happen?

617
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,330
How's this one going to go down?

618
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,130
Hopefully this is going to be good.
And as I was talking to him,

619
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:49,720
I heard this amazing band playing in the
background was like, it sounded so good.

620
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:52,790
I'm like, is that live? That's unreal.
But we were back in the green room.

621
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:55,040
I was like, I got to check them
out and raised. I went to go out.

622
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,460
This guy comes walking up,

623
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,990
bye. Goes, hey bill burr. I don't, he
was like, ah, you know, uh, you know,

624
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:05,680
I've seen your stuff, man. You funny. I
said, oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

625
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:07,870
I got look at you. You're all
dressed all sharp. I'm like,

626
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,070
are you going up tonight?

627
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,580
Uh, he goes, yeah. I go, what
do you, what do you do? You

628
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,340
meeting? He goes, die. Cause I play a
little guitar. You know, I love musicians.

629
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:19,070
I'm like, Holy Shit Man. You play in
a band. That's fucking great. Right?

630
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,590
It turned out that guy was Brad Paisley.

631
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,180
I'm old. I don't know who the kids
are. Right. I have no fucking idea.

632
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,680
He went on in the end and was one of the
greatest annotators I've seen in a long

633
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:36,100
fucking time. Absolutely.
Goes, I play a little

634
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,690
guitar, right? Shreds.
Absolutely shreds on guitar.

635
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,230
Amazing voice.
I said to him after,

636
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:47,770
cause I felt like an asshole that I didn't
know who he was, but I'm also, I'm old.

637
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,770
You know what I mean? We 50
next year, right? I loved,

638
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,070
and I'm loving turning 50 now. This is
when you start to have excuses. I'm 50,

639
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:58,040
I don't know things. Um, I
said to him, I said, you know,

640
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:02,200
I love about you country guys. All
you guys, he can play. You know,

641
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:04,530
I'm not into all the country music,
but they can,

642
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,590
they can fucking play and they can sing.
And it reminds me of hair metal.

643
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,780
As much as people trashed
me for listening to that,

644
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,340
those guys could play and they could
sing. They could, they could do it live.

645
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,230
We'll do it. Lie, fuck it. Right? So
anyways, I'm hearing all this band.

646
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,260
So I, uh, I go, I gotta go
check these guys out, right?

647
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,910
I have to like the third song or it's,
so I go to walk out there

648
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,990
to see the,
um,

649
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,080
to see the band playing and I looked
at it and I'm looking at the drummer,

650
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,470
this is giant like,
you know,

651
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,440
banquet hall room and I'm just looking
at the drama and I just fucking staring

652
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,900
at him for like five seconds.
It disbelief.

653
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,590
And I look at the woman next to me
who was working for the foundation.

654
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,570
I was like, is that Steve
Jordan? She goes, yeah. He's
like really good. I'm like,

655
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:55,480
really good. He's one of the greatest
fucking drummers of all time.

656
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,890
This is like a bucket list for me
to ever see this guy play live.

657
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,100
I can't believe I couldn't believe it.
My jaw was on the ground.

658
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:07,450
Like you got to understand like I, I been
listening to Steve Jordan's since like,

659
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,030
I guess when I first started watching
Letterman and I didn't even realize at

660
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,190
that point that he played on
those blues brothers albums.

661
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,030
Then I discovered those,

662
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:18,700
I even bought the second blues
brothers album made in America.

663
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,270
Then nobody bought. I have all of
that shit. All of his Keith Richards,

664
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:26,590
expensive wine. Oh Shit. I watched him
on the leg with the Letterman band. Um,

665
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,830
I go on youtube,
there's a fusion album that he put out

666
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,370
the fuck was the name of
that band that you can't,

667
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,660
I can't find the album anywhere
where he's really young.

668
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,060
Um,
playing on,

669
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:44,920
on that one a way busier than he
plays on a lot of other stuff. Right.

670
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:46,960
Through all the John Mayer stuff.
And I was always thinking, okay,

671
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:51,070
when John Mayer comes to town with his
trio, I'm definitely gonna go see that.

672
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:53,950
And I'll finally get to see Steve
Jordan playing live, you know,

673
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,320
switching out the snares and all of that,
that whole,

674
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,220
all that whole fits his whole thing that
he does that it's just so incredible.

675
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,500
But every time John
Mayor would come to la,

676
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,480
I would always be on the
road and I'd always miss it.

677
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,670
So I actually got to see him
play. And, um, so anyways,

678
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm sitting there and at the
banquet thing and I meet Michael J.

679
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,540
Fox and he's just like the nicest
guy ever. Him and his wife,

680
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,220
just a couple of sweethearts,
you know.

681
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,100
Well just one of those
amazing couples too, you know,

682
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,770
both good looking people and then they,
they formed,

683
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:28,770
when they get together they form an even
more amazing person, you know? And I'm,

684
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,230
I'm sitting there and like, I'm literally
nervous. Like I'm a brand new comic.

685
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:37,080
Whenever I get to one of, I do benefits,
I get like that nervous cause like I've,

686
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:41,960
I've had some that have not gone well.
I've done some Christmas parties.

687
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,550
The reason why I don't do Christmas
parties, I don't do private gigs,

688
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:47,811
you know,

689
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:52,811
which are basically rich people
or rich companies or something.

690
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,700
Uh,
get to yeah,

691
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,480
gather and they will literally hire
anyone from like fucking you too,

692
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,480
all the way down to some no name comic.

693
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:07,170
Like I was back when I used to do those
fucking things and you would go up there

694
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:09,060
and nobody would know
that there was a show.

695
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,200
And the last one I did.

696
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,093
Yeah.

697
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,870
Like they had me go up.
It was in like a restaurant.

698
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,360
These people had rented out the restaurant
and everybody was eating and talking

699
00:42:21,361 --> 00:42:22,980
and I went up there and I was,

700
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,880
no one was listening and I got defensive.

701
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,490
So my already angry material back then.

702
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:33,240
It was coming off even angrier and people
just literally stopped eating or just

703
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:37,510
sort of staring down at their plates.
And um,

704
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,340
I tried every trick that I knew in the
book to turn it around and I couldn't do

705
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:48,020
it and I just fucking bombed. I
ruined their dinner. I ruined,

706
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:49,360
they're not at least that part of it.

707
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,610
And I just walked out of there
with my age and at the time,

708
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,670
and God bless him, he had to listen
to me, walked 12 blocks with them,

709
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,440
with absolutely absolute Tourette's,
just going like,

710
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,100
I am never fucking doing one
of those fucking things again.

711
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,020
Who the fuck bring somebody up when
everybody's fucking [inaudible] like I did

712
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:15,300
that.
I was going,

713
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,170
Casey case him and I suppose to go on
and talk about a fucker dog dying, right.

714
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:23,280
I went into that mode,
you know, but by the end,

715
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:27,780
after 12 blocks, I, by the end of it, we
were both laughing and I was just like,

716
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:31,140
should we given them money back? You
know, that was like, fuck, I feel bad,

717
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,590
but this is a real reason why I was
flipping out. You know, I was embarrassed.

718
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,760
And then I also felt like I
stole money cause I just wasn't,

719
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,710
I wasn't the guy for that Gig.

720
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,900
It should have been like somebody
like a who was happy with themselves.

721
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,700
All right. So anyways, let's
get on with the, uh, not off.

722
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:55,650
I'll finish telling the
story. So anyways, uh,

723
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,970
fortunately the great Dennis leary was,

724
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:02,971
was hosting this event and he went up
and immediately turned it into a comedy

725
00:44:03,751 --> 00:44:08,380
show. You know, he was up there doing
what he does and he dropped, you know,

726
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,490
a couple of f bombs.
And then with every joke he told,

727
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:16,110
I got more and more and more and more
relaxed. And I was like, ah, thank God.

728
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,110
And then, uh, I went
up on stage and I just,

729
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,340
I just fucking went off and,
uh,

730
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,590
told all these, I just, I dunno, I,

731
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,500
I did all those stories telling all those
fucking stories of all the shit that

732
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,460
women have done to me.

733
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,730
And at first people didn't want to
laugh and then they just started laugh.

734
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,350
Cause you know, sexual misconduct,
like I said to a guy, I'm, I'm,

735
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,960
and I'm agreeing with this. It's kind
of funny. It's not right, but it is,

736
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:43,794
it's funny.

737
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,173
MMM.

738
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,440
And at first they were like,
what the fuck?

739
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:52,860
And then they just sort of went with it
and then all the rest of my shit just

740
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:53,460
flowed.

741
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,480
And I ended up having one of my favorite
sets I've had in such a long time.

742
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,310
And then in the end I got to watch,
uh,

743
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,460
this new great musician that I did,

744
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:08,390
wasn't aware of Brad Paisley
playing with Steve Jordan's band.

745
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,230
And um, and then in the
end they brought Michael J.

746
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,960
Fox out and they all played Johnny be
good. I mean, it was just, it was, I was,

747
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,920
I was just standing there like going, how
the fuck is this? My life was amazing.

748
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,523
Um,

749
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:23,730
okay.

750
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,511
Then I just end up having,

751
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:26,660
then it just turned out it was
also the New York comedy festival.

752
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:29,000
So all these guys were in town.
I got to run into Brant.

753
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,540
Brian Regan who just played
Carnegie Hall hanging out with him.

754
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:36,710
I just had like the best,
I had the best fucking night and uh,

755
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,520
and the Great New York run here continues
where tomorrow I'm going to be on

756
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:43,700
inside the NFL. I don't know what I'm
going to be talking about. A God knows.

757
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:47,660
I haven't watched nearly as much NFL
football is, I would have liked this year.

758
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,980
I just got so busy with the cartoon and
my little acting Gig there. Oh, Bill,

759
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:56,460
what do you think? You're an actor
now. Every once in a while I am. Um,

760
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,130
all right,
my screen went dark here.

761
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,480
Let's type in the fucking
pass where the password.

762
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,590
Uh, all right, let's, uh, let's
read some of your questions here.

763
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:12,660
All right. Not enough women or gays at
the cellar table. Oh boy. Here we go.

764
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:17,310
Oh, read Dick, Billy. All that controversy
in stand standup comedy. He goes,

765
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:20,820
I was hoping to get your take on an
article I came across on Facebook called

766
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,180
tear down the boys club
that protected Louis Ck.

767
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,560
That's that witch hunt thing that I'm
saying like we had fucking meetings every

768
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,350
week. All right, what are we going to do
here is, hey mom, I'm going to find rrr,

769
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:35,430
you know, and how everybody
else, the second that God,

770
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,900
evidently everybody else on the other
side, the second that Gawker, uh,

771
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,190
article came out,
you know,

772
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:45,060
immediately took a criminal justice
course and just became some gum shoe and

773
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:48,960
went out and bought a giant magnifying
glass and walked around looking for clues.

774
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:52,381
All right.

775
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:56,310
It's written by a gay comic who figures
basically going after Louis wasn't

776
00:46:56,311 --> 00:47:00,960
enough. So he is trying to go after his
peers also. Yeah, the witch hunt, uh,

777
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,460
the author cries about a certain table
at the comedy cellar where elite comics

778
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,300
like Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld sit.
Um,

779
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,030
okay.

780
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,680
Like when the table came about,
by the way,

781
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:16,800
Jerry Seinfeld was still doing Seinfeld,
you know what I mean?

782
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,390
I don't know if they actually
had a place called the table. Uh,

783
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,170
when I first started going to the
comedy cellar, there wasn't a table.

784
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,100
Comics just went upstairs and they sat
all over the place. And I am convinced

785
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,100
that the reason why the table was
started was because of Patrice,

786
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,620
because portrays was so loud and so funny
and he was just all over the upstairs.

787
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:46,270
They were trying to somehow contain
him. He was like, Jordan, you know,

788
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,360
you're not going to stop him.
Let's just see if we can contain them.

789
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,930
So I think they just tried
to get us all in, sit at,

790
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:56,920
sit it in one seated in one area so
they could at least be like, okay,

791
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:00,580
sit down and fold your fucking hands
and listen to the teacher. Right.

792
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,660
Um, that's how I remember
it. Anyway, so he goes,

793
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:09,310
he also has never even tried to perform
it. The Co at the cellar himself,

794
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,940
it's kind of like a fourth grader crying
to the teacher because the cool kids

795
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:17,470
won't hang out with him. The article
implies that by not speaking up about it,

796
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:21,700
the seller comics were somehow protecting
Louis even though they were just

797
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:25,060
rumors until recently.
Also the owner of the cellar,

798
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,480
where are we fucking scream at dark?
Sorry, I'll see you on his salary.

799
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,610
He had some great things
to say in the comments.

800
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,450
Here's the link to the article and go
fuck yourself. Yeah, I read it. And um,

801
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,820
you know, to be honest with
you, considering this guy's
also a fellow comedian,

802
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,890
I feel bad that that was his perception.

803
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:45,910
I feel filled up yet that that was his
perception of what the table was because

804
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,590
um, you know, the table was like,

805
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,430
uh,
I didn't even know how to explain it.

806
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:59,380
Like that was something like the level
of pounding that you had to take.

807
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:05,580
You had to go there and just basically
get ripped to shreds and then what

808
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:10,900
everybody at the table wanted to do.
And it wasn't even,

809
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:15,670
it wasn't doing it to just be mean.
It was just,

810
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,930
I don't, it was just this comedian thing.
So you'd sit down and like you already,

811
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,910
you'd sit down with like whatever you
were hung up about with yourself and they

812
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:28,630
would give another 40 things about you
physically that you didn't even notice

813
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:32,530
that you should also be self
conscious about. However, in the end,

814
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,610
all they wanted you to do was come
back at them and trash them back.

815
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:40,930
And if you did urn regardless,
all right.

816
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,940
And there was some epic fucking

817
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,120
back and forths at that table.
You know,

818
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,680
people definitely got
mad sometimes, but, uh,

819
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,750
the table wasn't like what a lot of people
who didn't go to it think it was like

820
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:58,510
this big bullying thing.

821
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:01,450
It was also this amazing thing where like,
uh,

822
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,190
I listened to Jewish people
and Arab comics going at it,

823
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:10,360
talking about the Middle East.
I'd listened to Patrice and, uh,

824
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,250
you know, Manny dorming,
um, their debates,

825
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,070
Colin Quinn was there and
if I remember correctly,

826
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:21,400
tough crowd came out of those
conversations at the table.

827
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,100
And if you watched tough crowd,

828
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:28,430
it'd be these comedians talking about
these deep issues trashing each other.

829
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,800
And um, I always felt this,
that the table was inclusive.

830
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,920
As long as you are willing,
you had to,

831
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,990
he had to fucking walk the gauntlet.

832
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:41,390
You just had to fucking do
and you had to survive it.

833
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,443
MMM.

834
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,290
And then if you did,

835
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:50,400
you actually became a better comedian
because once you got in at the table,

836
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,150
then there was this thing, you could not
sit at the table. You'd come in and be,

837
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:54,511
hey,
bill,

838
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:56,980
come when they wanted you to sit at the
table because they wanted you to trash

839
00:50:56,981 --> 00:51:00,090
you. And then they also wanted you
to trash him back. But you know,

840
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,800
I wasn't even part of the elite crew.
I wasn't funny enough,

841
00:51:04,801 --> 00:51:09,390
I just wasn't like the,
the, the, as far as,

842
00:51:09,391 --> 00:51:10,260
this is just my,

843
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,380
my perception of it was the
table was Patrice Norton Voss,

844
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,030
Keith Robinson,
Collin Quinn,

845
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,360
and later on, Kevin
Hart, Kevin Hart. Right.

846
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,740
And even he was sort of like a,
just like a rookie.

847
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:36,110
But he also made it so fast. He didn't
have time to fucking stay there. So, um,

848
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:37,610
those were the,

849
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:42,170
that was like the Mount Rushmore of the
table and when you showed up and they

850
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:47,060
will all there and somebody had something
on you like that time, you know,

851
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:50,900
I for 24 hours said I would do the stand
up on a bus on the weight of a world

852
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:53,090
series game to get a world series ticket.

853
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:54,680
And I never even ended up doing the Gig.

854
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,190
I took a headlining set pounding
that is still legendary.

855
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:03,020
They told the fucking story on
Opie and Anthony,

856
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,820
I believe Kevin Hart and them all told
the story, man, I got fucking destroyed,

857
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,310
destroyed. So this guy like suggesting
that it was all, like everybody was like,

858
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,680
there was this team of people, it
wasn't, it was fucking cannibalistic.

859
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,700
All right. Everything that
they said, an opening,

860
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:25,280
Anthea was 100% true except for the fact
that I did the Gig because I didn't do

861
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:25,700
the Gig.

862
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,380
I actually gave the Gig to somebody
else and I w with a vow of silence.

863
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:30,711
I said,

864
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:33,920
I will never tell anybody that you did
this gig because I don't want you to go

865
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:35,000
through what I just went through.

866
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,603
MMM.

867
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:41,180
I think the guy who did the Gig actually
might've said that he was the one who

868
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:42,290
did the Gig all these years later.

869
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,540
But I still had them not saying
shit who it was. So anyways,

870
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,570
once you got in at the table,

871
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,650
then you would go downstairs to
go do your set and one night they,

872
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,290
everybody at the table be like, you know
what, we're watching your set tonight.

873
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,410
And you'd be like, Oh fuck.
And you would go downstairs,

874
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,270
you'd go on stage and the crowd couldn't
see all these fucking asshole comics.

875
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:07,610
I remember they'd all be backlit standing
in the hallway. Patrice is big, dumb,

876
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:08,480
stupid head.

877
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,000
And you'd have to go up there and like
just commit to your jokes as they were

878
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:17,180
all standing there
making faces of disgust,

879
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,490
heckling, making noises. And one
time I told a joke and it went good.

880
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:27,090
And as I was telling the joke, I had the
nerve to actually try to say something.

881
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,070
Image,
Joe and Patrice were just go,

882
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,570
just do that fucking noise and then
they would all crack up laughing.

883
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,200
Then the crowd would laugh like what
the fuck and get a sense of like other

884
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,910
comics are laughing at this guy.

885
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,570
Should we be laughing at him and
not respect him as a human being?

886
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,200
And then you would just start
bombing and I never forget.

887
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:51,201
I remember Kevin Hart went down stairs
and he went up as a 20 year old comic and

888
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:55,830
survived it and was barely affected.
I mean,

889
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,800
I know and then looking at all
the stuff that he's doing now,

890
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,100
like you really saw what he was made up.
It was a great thing.

891
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,160
The seller table is not what this person
perceived it to be and I feel bad that

892
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:10,500
that person, because having a fed Gig,
I'd comic, that would have been great.

893
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:12,090
They would've been a whole other angle.

894
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,680
It was actually a really inclusive thing.

895
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,070
It's just a lot of people weren't tough
enough to get through it and that's the

896
00:54:19,071 --> 00:54:21,380
truth. And it took me, like I said,

897
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,560
like a half dozen attempts because I was
not a mentally strong person back then.

898
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,370
And um, but if you see what came out
of it, Colin Quinn's tough crowd,

899
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,290
that was one of the most inclusive shows
of all time as far as like, he gave

900
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,590
almost like two and a half generations
of standup comics, a TV credit,

901
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:43,720
a lot of them, their
first TV credit. Yeah.

902
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,313
MMM.

903
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,260
So I dunno what,
I'm not,

904
00:54:47,261 --> 00:54:50,120
what someone's going to sit down and
watch tough probably who's mainly white

905
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,220
males will blah, blah, blah,
Blah and all that fucking shit.

906
00:54:52,221 --> 00:54:55,730
So I don't know that there's no way
to win this type of stuff, but um,

907
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,810
I can tell you that I, I don't agree
with this person's perception of it,

908
00:54:59,811 --> 00:55:02,780
but I don't have any anger towards that
person for writing that if that's what

909
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:05,420
they feel, think it was. But, uh,

910
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,240
it's a little melodramatic
burn the table down like this,

911
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:15,620
these meetings going on and we're all
sitting there trying to hold back his,

912
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,060
his career or whatever.
I mean I don't,

913
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:22,610
I don't fucking all I remember
as far as like Trans Comics,

914
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,040
I just remembered there was,
I don't know what the proper term was,

915
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:29,360
but there was a guy who dresses like a
woman who went on stage and went by the

916
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:31,910
name.
She went by the name of Sharon needles.

917
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,570
Okay.

918
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,430
And she used to go up at the Boston
comedy club and she was fucking hilarious.

919
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:40,740
And last time I looked her up,
I believe she was still doing shows.

920
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,570
I think she just got out of the standup
scene. But nobody, I don't know.

921
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:48,010
There's no comics going, girl,

922
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,500
what the fuck is his
fucking person doing here?

923
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,300
Like this all comic, Oh, comedy
is is if you're fucking funny.

924
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,990
Other comics that are going to laugh
and you get their respect and you're in.

925
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,813
MMM.

926
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,640
Uh, you know, everybody has
a different fucking road,

927
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:09,740
but everybody's just sitting
there going like, just, I
dunno what, what there, it's,

928
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,510
everybody's looking out their
own head and it becomes,

929
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:17,511
their experience is fact in truth in
anybody else's experience is bullshit or

930
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:23,680
something like that. So all I'm
doing here is I'm telling my of,

931
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,420
that's how I perceived it. And, um,
I just remember for the longest time,

932
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,254
like we would,

933
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,290
I'm a one night we fucking
were outside the comedy cellar.

934
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:39,100
We trashed each other for so fucking long.
And it was so god damn funny,

935
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:44,101
it was so late in the night that this
woman in an apartment above the comedy

936
00:56:44,351 --> 00:56:48,910
cellar poured water down onto us
to get us to shut the fuck up.

937
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,070
And uh, going back, you know,

938
00:56:57,071 --> 00:57:00,670
like a lot of moments like that
in life. I wish I could have, um,

939
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,813
yeah,

940
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,190
I wish I could have realized how
amazing that was during that time.

941
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:08,540
Cause that's as far as I was
concerned, that table, this,

942
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:12,450
this table that this guy
wants to burn down that died.

943
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,080
The table died when Manny died
because he was the creator of it.

944
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,320
And, um, he was the,

945
00:57:22,321 --> 00:57:27,321
one of the great conversationalists
that I ever met and he was so God damn

946
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:30,760
funny.
And um,

947
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,270
okay.

948
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:36,770
And what I loved about him was he
wasn't a malicious guy as much as I got,

949
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:39,410
I used to fucking argue with that
guy. You know what I mean? I was just,

950
00:57:39,411 --> 00:57:43,750
I was a young, angry man and I
used to argue with that guy and,

951
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:47,030
and he was always the next
day it was always over.

952
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,950
And I actually kind of learned from him,

953
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,140
I learned from him and Bobby Kelly how
to squash in argument where like how

954
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,600
you'd be like the next day just,
you know,

955
00:57:56,601 --> 00:57:57,950
cause I didn't grow up
in a family like that.

956
00:57:57,951 --> 00:58:00,950
It was just basically you didn't talk
about it and then you didn't talk for

957
00:58:00,951 --> 00:58:03,530
three days and then fucking
four days later you say, hey,

958
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:05,820
you see the soldiers giving
was it was good, good.

959
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,740
And then everything was
lingering. Um, those two people,

960
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:14,240
I learned how to have a functional
end to an argument. So, um, yeah,

961
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,410
I don't know what that shits about,

962
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:18,620
but it's unfortunate that that person
feels that way about it, but you know,

963
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:23,290
everybody's entitled to their opinion. All
right. Uh, portrays a Billy Ray, no fun.

964
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,330
Um, after hearing you along with
so many other comics universe,

965
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:31,850
three Lord Patrice, I finally watched
elephant in the room special. Uh,

966
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:33,350
within minutes he had me in stitches.

967
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:36,590
It's so easy to see why he was so
revered within the comedy community.

968
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,520
I know you hold him both as a
comedian, as a person, the person,

969
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,080
and an incredibly high regard.

970
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,080
I would love to hear some
of your insight into him.

971
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:48,740
I recently heard that he was permanently
banned from performing at the stand in

972
00:58:48,741 --> 00:58:52,530
New York. What was that about? No, he was
never banned from the stand. The stand,

973
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:58,970
the stand came out or opened right
around when Patrice got sick. Um,

974
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,420
he wasn't banned from there anyways,

975
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,640
really big fan of the show and we'd love
to see come to Australia against soon.

976
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,660
Um, yeah, know Patrice,

977
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:12,920
Patrice was getting banned
from comedy clubs all the time.

978
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,450
All the time, but he was so fucking
good. They had to let them back get, uh,

979
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,840
it reminds of when I read this,
this miles Davis book,

980
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:27,590
and he was talking about Charlie Parker
and when he would party to much in pawn

981
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:29,390
his horn and these clubs
would kick him out,

982
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:33,980
data eventually have to fucking bring
them back in because he was the best and

983
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:37,520
Patrice was the best and you know,

984
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,840
as much as he would drive him nuts,
you wanted them around,

985
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,650
you wanted them around you.
It's like the,

986
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:48,380
like the comedy dropped by 40%,

987
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:51,950
even with all the other comics still going
there if he wasn't there and just the

988
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:56,870
fun. And then they also knew that if they
banned him that none of the comics were

989
00:59:56,871 --> 01:00:01,580
going to hang out at the clubs. We were
all going to go to where he was. Um,

990
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,390
yeah. So then they would
let them back into the club.

991
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:06,830
Okay

992
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,840
then, then they created the table.
That's, that's how I remember it.

993
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,850
That's how I thought that they let's,

994
01:00:11,851 --> 01:00:15,630
we'll have 'em all these fucking lunatics
just have him sit in the back at the

995
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:19,770
goddamn table. So then we was
sitting down and it's just, you know,

996
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,080
it was just a bunch of
dogs in a fucking pit.

997
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,140
And then that's how the trash in
the trash, it was already happening.

998
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,793
Yeah.

999
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,160
Ama One night,
you know,

1000
01:00:30,161 --> 01:00:33,640
after I took the pound in for fucking
the bus Gig that I never even did.

1001
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,680
I remember when Bobby
first shaved his head,

1002
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,030
he came in and I always respected
him for this. He came in,

1003
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:45,060
he had like a hat on and he sat down
right at the far end of the fat gay Guy

1004
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,720
Comic here,
listen to this story.

1005
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,710
He didn't shy away from the table.

1006
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,580
He fucking walked right in,
sat down,

1007
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,230
took his hat off and looked at everybody
like, all right, give it to me.

1008
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,470
Let's hear it. And fucking everybody
just, it was like a def jam.

1009
01:01:02,471 --> 01:01:05,740
Betty took his hat off and everybody
does. Ma, we went the fuck.

1010
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:11,250
He took this fucking pounding and
everyone was getting him and he was just

1011
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:14,260
sitting there taking it,
laughing and all that type of stuff.

1012
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:18,130
And I actually thought he looked good
with a shaved head. Right. And, um,

1013
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,910
what's his face? Uh, I, Oh, who sent it?

1014
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:24,730
I think it was SDSD
finally got him with one.

1015
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:30,810
I think she said, you look like David
Wells. I think that that's what she said.

1016
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:32,520
And everybody fucking died left.

1017
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:37,200
And Bobby literally just
stood up and just walked out.

1018
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,600
And I remember thinking like, I didn't
know you could do that. I don't know.

1019
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:46,920
You can block out.
I saw Keith Robinson do that one time too.

1020
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:51,570
We would trash in his clothes,
so fucking bed. It was gay.

1021
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,960
And he was trying to fight back
and he was just feeling that way,

1022
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:57,930
was going to crash over him.
He just fucking ran out the door,

1023
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,180
got in his car and drove home to Jersey.

1024
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:05,080
We kept texting him and calling him go,
and you can't do that. You can't do that.

1025
01:02:05,081 --> 01:02:09,330
He was like, Oh yeah. Well, I just
did stupid. Fucking hung up on us,

1026
01:02:09,331 --> 01:02:11,970
laughed and hung up on us.
Um,

1027
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:19,170
oh my God. I remember that
fucking time Patrice. You know,

1028
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:22,470
somehow we found out he, he, he
was home on a Saturday night.

1029
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,190
He just took like a night off. And, uh,

1030
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:30,300
Jim Norton fucking came in and said,
you know what Patrice has right now?

1031
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:35,301
He said home on a Saturday night and they
all call them up and on speakerphone,

1032
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:38,340
Patrice just picks up and he's
like, hello. And Jim's like,

1033
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,610
what the fuck are you doing home on a
Saturday night? You don't have any gigs?

1034
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,150
And Patrice just fucking roared laughing.

1035
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,410
And we all over speakerphone,
trashed him.

1036
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:54,610
He was at home getting trashed at the
table. And I just remember him lie.

1037
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:57,370
He loved every fucking second of it.
It was at the tables.

1038
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,230
One of the great things ever. So, you
know, don't listen to that guy. All right.

1039
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:05,490
I lied to my girlfriend. Um, all right.

1040
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,120
I lied to my girlfriend. Hey Bill.
I really could use some advice.

1041
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:12,420
Right now I'm an 18 year old male and
I have been with this girl for seven

1042
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:16,290
months now. I really care about
her and she makes me truly happy.

1043
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:20,850
About a year ago, I used to smoke
weed and do some drugs, other drugs,

1044
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:24,390
a lot. Uh, I used to smoke about
three or four times a week,

1045
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:26,130
but I quit a little under a year ago.

1046
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:29,460
My girlfriend is really against drug use
and has told me that she would leave me

1047
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:32,370
if I ever did it again.
Well, a couple of months ago,

1048
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:34,920
me and my girl were kind of on a break,

1049
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:37,050
not because we don't want
to be with each other,

1050
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:40,800
but because of some other shit
going on in our lives. All right.

1051
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:43,650
That's pretty vague.
A while we were on this break,

1052
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:47,240
I smoked some weed with a buddy of mine.
Um,

1053
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,460
I really regret doing so
because I know how this is,

1054
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,040
this means a lot to her.
Um,

1055
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:59,220
she is later asked me when was the last
time I did any drugs and I just lied and

1056
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:02,400
told her the last time was
when I told her I quit.

1057
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,150
I can't stop thinking about this and
I feel really bad about lying to her,

1058
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:10,710
but I am afraid she's going to leave me
or stop trusting me if I tell her now,

1059
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,790
since I had already lied about
it several times in the past.

1060
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,410
Um, all right. What do you do here? Uh,

1061
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,560
just to what you wanted to. All right. If
you can't live with it, I would tell her,

1062
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:26,730
if not, I mean, you fucking
smoke. You took a hit off a joint.

1063
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,080
If you're not going to, she
really committed and you're
not going to do it again.

1064
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,450
Is it really worth putting
you in her through this?

1065
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,660
It's kind of hard for me to give you
advice here cause I don't know what you

1066
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:39,330
broke up for. I mean, you did
it while you were broken up.

1067
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,150
It's not like you went out
and you bang some other woman,

1068
01:04:42,151 --> 01:04:46,020
you just went out and you just tuck your
head and you didn't fucking do it again.

1069
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:51,450
Um, and you know, that's it. But at
the end of the day, you know something,

1070
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:55,230
if you come clean and she's still
breaks up with the over that,

1071
01:04:55,231 --> 01:04:58,920
then you know what fucker she gives.
She can't accept you.

1072
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,460
It's not like you went out and you
started using heroin and you stole all the

1073
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:03,960
money out of her fucking purse.

1074
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,290
She can't handle one hit of a joint
and then you feel bad about it.

1075
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,250
And he can't even lie to her about it
without feeling terrible and that you have

1076
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:11,910
to tell her,

1077
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,670
but she did you tell her that the reason
why you didn't tell her because you

1078
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:16,170
care about her and you
didn't want to lose her.

1079
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,890
If she still leaves you after that,

1080
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:22,240
then you know she was going to
find something. Right. Okay.

1081
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:26,590
Jim Girl, uh, you know something. I don't
know if I have time to read all of these.

1082
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:30,460
I, I gotta I gotta fucking get
Outta here. Here. Oh, do you? Okay.

1083
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,980
This is the worst thing ever.
I'm going to try to read this quickly.

1084
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:38,040
I already read bad when I'm reading
at a normal pace here. Hey, Billy,

1085
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:40,980
cue ball. A couple of months back,
I started going to another gym,

1086
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,310
a town over for a change of scenery.
Uh,

1087
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:46,750
after a couple of weeks I've run
into this tall athletic girl.

1088
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,220
She didn't talk to anyone and had that,
I'm not trying to talk to anyone.

1089
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:53,100
Look going on because of this,
me and virtually.

1090
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:53,970
Okay.

1091
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:55,050
Because of what?

1092
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:58,710
Because of this and me virtually never
cold approaching a girl before I left her

1093
01:05:58,711 --> 01:06:02,250
alone over the next few weeks.
I noticed she would be in my area a lot.

1094
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,180
And when moving between exercises,
we would cross paths a lot. Uh,

1095
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:10,410
sounds like you're doing that fucking
whatever that workout is. Crossfit. Well,

1096
01:06:10,411 --> 01:06:14,430
you got to run down the street. You know,
look at us, everybody, we're working out.

1097
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:19,110
Hey, look at us, you know,

1098
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:23,040
leaving your gym and running around and
fucking seven 11 parking lot in coming

1099
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:26,370
back. We get it. You're working
out. Jesus Christ. All right.

1100
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:32,340
Over the next few weeks I noticed she
would be in my area a lot and when,

1101
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:37,380
all right, I already said that. Okay.
Uh, we cross path. All right. So,

1102
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,200
um, I said fuck it. And
started talking to her.

1103
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:43,260
We had a couple of good compost and I
eventually got a number. Look at you.

1104
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,300
You're in the game.
We didn't text much,

1105
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,930
which is fine because I've learned that
texting should be mainly for planning

1106
01:06:48,931 --> 01:06:49,764
meetups.

1107
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:54,660
I still try to a couple of texts
Convault's for some rapport since uh,

1108
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,380
I'd only seen it one to three times
a week, sometimes just in passing.

1109
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,180
Now the issue is every time I messaged
her, she randomly stops messaging.

1110
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,400
No, probably cause you're
bugging her at that point,

1111
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:09,510
no matter how good the conversation
was going or she's busy. Uh,

1112
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:14,511
I didn't see her for a week before I left
for vacation for another two weeks and

1113
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:16,050
no contact.

1114
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,590
It's been a week since I've been back
and I haven't seen her in the gym.

1115
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,690
Was marginally interested.

1116
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:26,050
Well she marginally interested or
did I not come on strong enough?

1117
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:30,700
Should I text her again? Oh, just
move on and wait til I see her again.

1118
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,450
Well, if you're still into
or just Texas, just say, Hey,

1119
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:37,930
I haven't seen yet the gym and with
the voice, the harm in that, you know,

1120
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,970
in this day and age,
you know,

1121
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:44,590
make sure there's a lawyer there when
you're doing that because who knows with

1122
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:49,180
the, uh, the, the, what the next
fucking thing is going to be.

1123
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,430
Um, yeah, I would just, I
would text her and just say,
hey, you know, back, you know,

1124
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,560
would you like to go out sometime?
Gives a fuck,

1125
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,600
fuck her and our cold fucking vibe.
Just say what you want to do.

1126
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:06,160
Anything she wants to do it. Go do it. If
she doesn't move on, that's it. Easy one.

1127
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,680
All right. But I wouldn't question
yourself, you know, fuck all that.

1128
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:14,610
Don't be in your head.
Um,

1129
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,050
be like Jon Favreau in swingers. You
know, that's what I always think.

1130
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:22,390
Just never get into that fucking
mode. Just, uh, you know,

1131
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:26,020
it's normal to be nervous. Both men and
women when you're dating or whatever,

1132
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,370
men and men, women and women,
everybody included. Um,

1133
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,680
whenever you get into that,

1134
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:36,160
I would say don't ever send a text when
you were in that mode. I would sit down,

1135
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,400
relax, and just think, what do I want?

1136
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,210
I want to go on a date with this
person. Well, that's what you ask them.

1137
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,420
I would love to take you out sometime.
See me a minute.

1138
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:51,160
I'd love to take you out
sometime. Right? That's it.

1139
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,360
What's she going to say?
How dare you fucking ask me out.

1140
01:08:55,390 --> 01:09:00,250
She's either going to say yes or no. Okay.
And if she says no, who gives a fuck?

1141
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,460
You don't have any regret your asked,
but if you don't ask,

1142
01:09:03,461 --> 01:09:07,990
then you got to be like, all
right, for some gone wrong.

1143
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:09,310
This is the last one and I'm done.

1144
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:13,810
I recently visited my friend at his big
time college for his schools. Right.

1145
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:18,740
School rivalry weekend.
Um, I'm going big. Damn.

1146
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:23,020
That's what they said when I went to
Notre Dame versus a USC and they were like

1147
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:26,600
big time college football.
Uh, speaking of, uh,

1148
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:31,180
Notre Dame got a big Tam ass
kicking against Miami. Holy Shit.

1149
01:09:31,181 --> 01:09:33,160
The convicts kicking the
shit out of the fucking,

1150
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,770
I like are they still called the
Catholics and not the pedophiles?

1151
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:40,930
You know what I mean? I
mean, not everybody at the
University of Miami, you know,

1152
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:43,420
has gone to jail or been arrested.
Okay.

1153
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,250
But if you're going to call him
convicts and we got damaged,

1154
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,370
but you gotta go pedophile
with Notre Dame. Right. Um,

1155
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,430
it was a great tam and
his school was one school,

1156
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:58,860
one in at the last second and at the
last second. So the atmosphere is crazy.

1157
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,350
Later that night,
I attended a party at the fraternity.

1158
01:10:01,351 --> 01:10:04,490
He is a member of a anyway,
wage.

1159
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:09,510
We meet these two girls and decided to
tell him we were actually real real life

1160
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:14,370
brothers and we somehow tricked slash
convinced these girls into having a

1161
01:10:14,371 --> 01:10:15,204
foursome.

1162
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:20,470
How do you tell them that you're
related and that they want to do it?

1163
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,720
Yeah.

1164
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,380
Tricked is a very dangerous world
word to use right now, buddy.

1165
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,370
Uh, all right, we all go into this room.

1166
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:36,020
What do you mean trick? What do you
do? Did you do the old quarter? Hey,

1167
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:39,020
we'll make a quarter disappear. Hey,
where's the quarter as a blind you here?

1168
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:41,420
Here's my Dick.
Uh,

1169
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,800
we all go into his room and start
hooking up and since he had a large bed,

1170
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,790
we had girls on it and we're
banging them side by side,

1171
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:54,560
doggy style after what seemed like a
while, but was probably six minutes.

1172
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,380
I unfortunately released
my champagne and victory.

1173
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,700
So now it's my buddy and both the girls
in the bed and I'm just in the corner of

1174
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:04,670
the room.
I really wanted to come back in there,

1175
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,480
but I knew it would take a little
bit of time to get back up.

1176
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:12,980
So I decided to look for something
to use to start jerking off. Oh.

1177
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:18,060
I found out where it turned out to be my
buddy's context solution and applied it

1178
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:21,570
and started tugging. After a
few minutes, Olympic tugging,

1179
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:25,520
I started to feel movement and
thought I'd be back in the game. Soup.

1180
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:32,520
You're like an injured player that went
out for a play at that ball moment,

1181
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:33,660
my buddy and the two chicks,

1182
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:37,200
so he was nailing turn around and
face me and catch me jerking off.

1183
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:40,770
From their perspective. They
think of jerking off to them. Oh,

1184
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:44,190
now when in reality I'm jerking
is so I can bang the second girl,

1185
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,530
one girl sort of freaks out.

1186
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:48,250
Okay.

1187
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,370
I love that she freaks out if they have
to fucking thinking that she's having a

1188
01:11:51,371 --> 01:11:53,350
fucking force him with two brothers.

1189
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,880
One girl sort of freaks out and my buddy
screams, what the hell are you doing?

1190
01:11:59,600 --> 01:11:59,870
Okay.

1191
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,610
At that point I didn't know what to say.

1192
01:12:01,611 --> 01:12:04,730
So I ran out of the room naked and
just stood outside the door until they

1193
01:12:04,731 --> 01:12:05,211
finished.

1194
01:12:05,211 --> 01:12:09,500
Eventually the girls left and my buddies
let my buddy let me back into the room

1195
01:12:09,501 --> 01:12:14,000
where he proceeded to ask why I
was jerking off to him. Oh No.

1196
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:14,990
He goes,

1197
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:19,430
I tried to plead my case and give
rash and give a rational explanation.

1198
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:22,820
But he's continuing to be persistent that
I was jerking off to him and now he's

1199
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:27,500
being extremely distant from me and
is told all of our friends who have

1200
01:12:27,501 --> 01:12:31,460
constantly been berating me for jerking
off while my buddy bank two chicks.

1201
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:36,290
Do you have any advice on how I can
somehow spin this story? I mean,

1202
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:41,090
at the end of the day I did
get laid to, um, all right,

1203
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:44,120
here's what's hilarious about on it
that the woman gets offended. Like,

1204
01:12:44,121 --> 01:12:46,610
what are you doing? It's
like, what are you doing?

1205
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:50,930
You're having like a fucking force
them with two people that you think are

1206
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:54,330
related. Uh, and secondly,

1207
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,520
I don't know how guys do that.

1208
01:12:56,521 --> 01:12:59,290
I don't know how you could bang a
woman with your buddy next to you. Oh,

1209
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,320
so banging,
you know what I mean?

1210
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:06,300
Like how do you block out the sound of
your friend? Like, Eh, right next to you.

1211
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:06,511
I mean,

1212
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:10,890
do you look at each other at any point
and like how do you not start fucking

1213
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:15,500
laughing? I, I don't, I've
never understood that. Uh,

1214
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,330
yeah, you probably should
have gone into the bathroom.

1215
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,950
You probably shouldn't have
been looking at them. I mean,

1216
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:26,560
do what you have here is
a fucking hilarious story.

1217
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:30,730
And I, you know, in the
spirit of the table.

1218
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,253
Yeah.

1219
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,230
All right. When your friends are
giving you shit, I would just laugh.

1220
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:41,580
You just have to learn to laugh at
yourself and just be like, I swear to God,

1221
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,130
I was trying to get back
in the fucking game.

1222
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,160
Just tell the story the way you just
told it to me and think that it's fucking

1223
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:53,250
hilarious that this dude thinks
she would jerk it off to him.

1224
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,720
I would just laugh it off. Um, which
is how you get out of most shit.

1225
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,550
You know,
it's how Donald Trump became president.

1226
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:07,890
He just, it's probably a bad guy to bring
up who's out there grabbing pussies.

1227
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,040
It'd be like you said all
this shit about women. No, I,

1228
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:13,540
I said it about Rosie O'donnell.
Ah,

1229
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:16,840
well you said about other women too and
he's like, yeah, you probably right.

1230
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,860
It ends it, it's when you keep fighting
it. I would just fucking laugh it off.

1231
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,470
I know it's tough at your age,
but listen dude,

1232
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,640
if you have it in you to fucking fuck
a woman right next to your friend,

1233
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:33,010
if you, if you have the focus to do that,
I think he can get through this. Um,

1234
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,340
but dude, you got it. One hell of a
goddamn story. That's a great story. Um,

1235
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,640
so anyways, all right,
that's it. I have to,

1236
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:45,090
I've got to get on with my day
here and thanks to everybody, uh,

1237
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:50,020
who's listened to the podcast.
Thanks to the Fox Foundation,

1238
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,840
the west side comedy club.
Please go.

1239
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,630
Please go out to the kind of club and
thanks to everybody on front runner, uh,

1240
01:14:55,631 --> 01:14:58,720

that thing. I had such a great time. Oh,

1241
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:03,010
and by the way, guess what's out daddy's
home part too. I was in part one.

1242
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:06,370
You got his part too, I heard
is even better. Joe Barton,

1243
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:09,580
Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend told me
he went to go see, they said, dude,

1244
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:14,170
I fucking laughed out loud like 25 times.
Comedians don't laugh out loud ever.

1245
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:19,060
It's one of the, one of
the fucking, I dunno,

1246
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:22,330
it's one of the prices you pay as
a comedian. You stopped laughing.

1247
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,600
You just start going, oh, that
was funny. But you never laugh.

1248
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:30,760
You never laugh again. So definitely
go check that out. And uh, who knows?

1249
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:34,770
Who knows? Maybe you'll see a
familiar face and there, all right,

1250
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,240
go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
