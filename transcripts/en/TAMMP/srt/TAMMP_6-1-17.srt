1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,950
Hey, what's going on is bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:09,240
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. And I'm just checking in on you.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,720
That's right. I'm not yelling it.
I'm fucking up my voice doing that.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,030
Every God damn week I'm starting
to drink throat coat tea.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,020
I need to take care of
myself in these next,

6
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:24,021
this next chapter as I peel
off another layer of the onion,

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,380
whatever stupid artistry thing
I've just decided, you know,

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,470
a few people in my life, you know,
I'm kind of seeing it. I'm seeing it,

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,210
I'm seeing what living a certain
lifestyle leads to and I'm like,

10
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,810
you know what? I need to clean up
my act a little bit. All right,

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,370
it's time to grow. Ah, and Ah, so one
of the first things I'm going to do,

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm not cutting out the booze or
I'm just going to stop yelling.

13
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,460
I'm checking in on you. You
know, it's baby steps. You know,

14
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:54,600
when I'll gradually work towards
laying off the heroin, you know,

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,680
I like it. It helps me, helps
me go to sleep. You know,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,500
the amount of times that I always want
to take a nap when I'm standing up

17
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,820
outside in public and I just can't do
it because my mind just won't shut off.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,600
You know, that's, that's
when the heroin comes in.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,910
That's when it comes into play.
You're gonna have to listen to my phone,

20
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:15,610
Ding Dong and cause I got a phone call
coming up and I don't want to miss it

21
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:20,020
here. Um, anyways, let me see here.

22
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,010
Uh, uh, Jesus. Now I'm going
to be looking at text messages,

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,850
message messages, messages, while
I'm trying to do this podcast.

24
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,230
This is really gonna fuck with my
add here. How's your week going?

25
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,910
I'm going to tell you something, right?
All but Billy booze bag and all right.

26
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:41,650
I had, I had family in [inaudible]. Some
of you guys guessed the movie by the way.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,380
Um,
it's something you do with a car.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,270
You can't figure it out.
Now I can't help you.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,120
But what I love is now everybody
knows what the movie is,

30
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:56,560
but there's still going to
treat me like the long, long,

31
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:00,970
long trailer starring Lucille Ball.
Um,

32
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,930
why don't you guys ask me if it's every
other movie that you could do with the

33
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,940
car other than the one you notice.
How about that?

34
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,740
How about switching it up a little bit?

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,590
Is it Herbie goes to Monte Carlo?
You know,

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,150
I realize all these years I've been
using that as a reference. Like,

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,100
cause it's the one at the first or
second movie I saw, I suffer lover Benji.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,490
Then I saw Herbie goes to Monte
Carlo and my mother was just like,

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,090
my mother told me, you know, I, they're
just, those kids movies were stupid.

40
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,770
I wasn't going to take it
anymore though. So, you know,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,920
basically there wasn't
anything there for her.

42
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:34,960
And she just was looking at it like,
you know,

43
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,200
there's really nothing here for these
kids. It's a fucking talking car.

44
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,310
It's a talking dog. You know, how long
are we going to keep the lie going?

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,730
All right, the fat fuck doesn't come
down. The chimney. Dogs don't talk.

46
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,770
And the VW beetle, it's an, it's an,
it's an economical car. But you know,

47
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:55,660
at the end of the day it's not respect
itself. That's it. Let's go see stripes.

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,730
Um, anyways, uh, completely forgot
what the fuck I was gonna say. They're

49
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,320
on a fuck that I get to that.
I have no idea.

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,040
Do I need to go on burn any
to play some brain games?

51
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,840
Saturday is what the fuck was out.
Eat more healthy.

52
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know where the [inaudible] but
the family back east. I got it. I got it.

53
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,020
Rebeck right.

54
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,280
He'll be those outtakes on Casey Casey
when he flips out screaming young.

55
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:28,510
Now God damn it. I'm not fucking reading
about a fucking dog died. You know,

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,460
this is basically like those outtakes
except I don't edit them up and I also

57
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:37,480
don't have his iconic success.
Yeah. Other than that,

58
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,790
I think it's the exact same thing.
But anyways,

59
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,650
I had family come in fee and we'd kill
me and probably a quiche twice in this

60
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,100
past month. And um, I had to
take him out to the spots.

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,620
We had to drink a little toast
for the little one, a little Nini.

62
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,920
Dude, she's laughing her ass off
now. It's the greatest thing.

63
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,100
It's the greatest thing ever.
Um,

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,130
could not be in a joint
more in its June's first.

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,390
And for the first time in my life on,
someone can actually look at me and say,

66
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:11,860
happy father's Day. Right. And I
don't have to be like, oh my God.

67
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,770
In what Comedy Club did you work?

68
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,040
How old is it? Um, anyways, no, I
was never like that on the road.

69
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,450
I was a good boy, sort of. I had my
moments anyways, plowing ahead here.

70
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,350
Um, so because they came in,
I kind of got off my diet.

71
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,060
I was still doing the cardio every day,

72
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,770
so I stepped on the scale and the
unacceptable second number in my world is

73
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:43,090
eight. Okay. If it's ever a
nine, I'm telling you right now,

74
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,960
I am going to jump off a fucking building.
Um,

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
I won't do that.
I'll just buy really comfortable.

76
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll keep wearing the golf clothes that I
wear. They'll just get bigger. You know,

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,450
I'll was getting to the
John Daly line. Um, so,

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,100
uh, I'm back on it. I'm back on it.
Jumped on the scale today. One 78.8.

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,390
Still unacceptable.

80
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,710
I have been having the worst fucking
time trying to get down to my fighting

81
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,330
weight. I wanted to be one
72 by my birthday, my 49th,

82
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,180
the end of the forties. Wrapping it
up. If I was a professional athlete,

83
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,620
I would be 10 years for tired.

84
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,820
And once I was Tom Brady with my senior
we muscles or whatever the fuck he's

85
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,700
doing with his spongy muscles,
um,

86
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,270
I don't know what he's doing. Sorry,
I'm drinking the throat coat. Oh, Geez.

87
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:37,150
It's bill. You're just annoying on so many
different levels today. I apologize. Um,

88
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,860
so anyways,
so I'm just,

89
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:42,520
I'm going to try to just lay
off the booze for a little bit.

90
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,290
I'm going to San Francisco,
uh,

91
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,590
this weekend and uh,

92
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,020
I'm working with fucking my dean
off my Dean Martin Joe to Rosa.

93
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,190
Okay. So that's going to be, that's
going to be a Mulligan that night.

94
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,480
Joe.

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,400
My friendship with Joe to Rosa in his
friendship with me is one of the great

96
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,640
friendships in show business
history and it's all,

97
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,540
it's all alcohol fueled.
You know,

98
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,390
I don't think we've ever hung around
each other sober and I don't think that I

99
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,830
got to get him on the podcast.

100
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,690
I really got to get all fucking Joe to
rose or whatever. His background is,

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,760
Egyptian,
Italian.

102
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:33,761
He doesn't know that man was left at
the doorstep of a funny bone way back in

103
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,720
1977.

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,460
I believe he showed up on a
nowhere a baby. Nobody wanted,

105
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,090
he came out of the womb already
wearing those dark frame glasses.

106
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,370
Um, it's sad, but said,

107
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,410
um, anyways, plowing ahead.

108
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,630
I'm sure I'm going to hear
about that from old Joey. Um,

109
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,170
I'm guessing two drinks in they do it.

110
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:00,610
There was something I want
to talk to you about. It's,

111
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,480
I know you were just joking, but you know,
to bring that up, it's just really, um,

112
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,520
fuck him. He trashed my dog on stage.
Oh, that's coming out. Fourth drinking.

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm trying to guess where the
argument's gonna come from this weekend.

114
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:16,600
Why drink with Joe? We really don't argue
anymore. Once I discovered, fair enough,

115
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,710
you know, I grew up a little bit. He grew
up a little bit, and that's all we did.

116
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:23,740
We start to argue and then one of books
just goes, Hey, fifth, fair enough.

117
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,870
And we laugh and it just
diffuses everything. Fair enough.

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,860
Fair enough. Could stop
wars. You know what I mean?

119
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,060
This is our borderline now we think it
said, hey, fair enough. Fair enough.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,310
I understand why you would take
that, but I mean, you know.

121
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,063
Fair enough.

122
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,550
Well, you're going to give it to
us law. Yeah, I didn't say that.

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,240
Okay,

124
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,440
well then I'm going to fucking start
shooting, I think. Fair enough. Yeah.

125
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,170
That's what you feel you need to do.
It just diffuses the other guy.

126
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,480
Then the other guy standing there
going like, no, you're supposed to,

127
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,970
you supposed to get mad.
Then you get mad,

128
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:06,090
and then I get mad and then I lied to
my people and you lie to your people.

129
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,970
We dehumanize each other
that don't we start shooting.

130
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,960
Stop saying, fair enough.
All right, fair enough.

131
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,140
Anyways, anybody watched the, uh, the
penguins were still fucking predator.

132
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,100
I'll tell you something about these tcs
penguins from Pittsburgh is they know

133
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:32,960
how to fucking win a goddamn series.
Jesus Christ,

134
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,230
the predators in an o two hold for
those of you bad at math when it's best.

135
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:41,390
Four out of seven, you're down. Oh two.

136
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:44,240
That means you have to
win four of the next five.

137
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,020
All the coach isn't going to tell
you that. What's he going to say?

138
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:52,860
All right guys. All right boy, we
got to take it one game at a time.

139
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,930
Okay. Are these crossed the
hall in that Locker Room Day?

140
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:01,110
They put their escape too.
I bought it at a time.

141
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,580
Okay.
We've got to start winning the battles

142
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,000
at one period of time.

143
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,280
Do they are beating the shit out of
Sidney Crosby? This playoff series.

144
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,830
This playoff is just this,
this, this playoff run.

145
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,600
I don't know what he did to the refs,
but they had done protecting that guy.

146
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,050
Okay.

147
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,140
This slashing and they hooking them,
they're fucking hitting him in the head.

148
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:32,430
Anything that they can do. Um, I dunno.

149
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,120
I think that they, uh, they, they should
have brought a goon up or something.

150
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,893
Okay.

151
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,900
Somebody to do something.
I don't know. But anyways,

152
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:45,460
how about fucking Malkin's goal?
Absolute fucking,

153
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,260
you know, and I know
that they, uh, pulled Oh,

154
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:53,140
pito today or whatever
his fucking name is.

155
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,840
For some reason I can't remember
his goddamn named Pekka. Rina,

156
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,340
the hell's his name. She
says, I can't cock suck.

157
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:03,490
I came up with some about a dick is the,
is the Predator.

158
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,400
I fucking watched every game and
I still can't remember his name.

159
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay.

160
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,860
The fuck is his name. He's a pecker
arena. Was that the guy from San Jose?

161
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,740
Was he on San Jose then? He
went to Nashville. You don't,

162
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:18,490
once I stopped collecting cards,
you know, and I turned to scotch.

163
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,190
I just never been able to, I've never
been able to handle the names anymore.

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,570
But anyways, I don't give a
fuck who you are. Ken Dryden.

165
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,680
Patrick Wa Terry saw chuck.

166
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,410
Nobody stops that fucking puck.

167
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,120
That was an absolute filthy,
filthy fucking goal.

168
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,730
Um, so my prediction, way back
in the day, what did I say?

169
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,120
What did I say before I flip flopped
and set said audit was going to,

170
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,520
was going to win. Game
seven, before I did that,

171
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,390
I said the penguins were going to win
the whole thing. So when it happens,

172
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm going to ignore the
fact that I thought auto was
going to come back and win

173
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:59,080
game seven, cause I was questioning
the goaltending in Pittsburgh.

174
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:03,540
I'm going to ignore all of that and I'm
going to pull up Paul Versey and say,

175
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,570
dude, what did I say
dude? I called it, um,

176
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,650
just out of, uh, you know,
jealousy. I want to, uh,

177
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,710
I want to see the Predator does
tie up the series and not jealousy.

178
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,780
Just thought of like selfishness.
I want to see the, um,

179
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,580
the NHL season goes as many
games as possible, but uh,

180
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,010
they'll tell you right now the
way the penguins deploying, uh,

181
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,980
I mean I don't even see there's
Walberg the brickwork. Uh,

182
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,060
we'll see something incredible has said.
How about,

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,820
I don't know who the fuck shot that goal,
that baby face kid there.

184
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,520
I mean that was like the,
the,

185
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:46,521
the puck had ice it like there was one
little fucking just puck sized space for

186
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,290
a split second between old peck,

187
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,020
a penis there,
whatever his name is.

188
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,590
It just opened up for half a second.

189
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,900
The puck literally turned sideways like
some Matrix Shit and went in the car.

190
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,490
I remember when I, when I saw it live,
it's like how the fuck did that go in?

191
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,481
I Dunno man.

192
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:10,430
I'll tell you the hockey gods are
smiling down in Pittsburgh right now. Um,

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,320
who knows, we'll see what sorta home
home ice advantage they have. But uh,

194
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:19,130
and also the NBA playoffs not play
offs. The uh, final starts tonight.

195
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:24,131
Is that the NBA finals in the Stanley
Cup final or is it Stanley Cup finals in

196
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:28,650
the NBA final? I think
it's the NBA finals. Um,

197
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,090
every time I say something stupid, my
phone rings. That's it right there.

198
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,550
Does a little bing.
All right.

199
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:39,140
I have a call here in fucking a,
let's see,

200
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,840
10 minutes, 10 minutes. So I'm
gonna have to hit pause here.

201
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,510
It's not gonna matter to you guys
cause I'll just pick it up. You know,

202
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,650
they'll give me 10 minutes of silence.
Like I'm trying to do some artsy,

203
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,770
um, that starts tonight. Um,

204
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,310
okay.

205
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,680
I Dunno, I don't have a feeling on this
one. I want the Cavaliers to win. Um,

206
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,240
I want the capitalist to him cause I
still feel like they don't get their

207
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,074
respect.

208
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,430
People aren't talking about them like
did the defending like they are the

209
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:12,431
defending NBA champions and
[inaudible] went to the warriors.

210
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,530
I think that that's why nobody
seems to be able to talk about it.

211
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:18,200
You know what I mean? Just to be able
to see like, hey, not for nothing.

212
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,910
These guys beat those
other guys last year.

213
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,350
So I hope they keep disrespecting them
cause I always root against the pylon

214
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,400
team. You know? And I even did
it with the red sox in 2007.

215
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,640
I just, I don't even think
I watched the world series.

216
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,070
I mean obviously I was happy that we won.
Obviously.

217
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:38,360
I'd rather see us win then
the fucking Colorado Rockies.

218
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:42,380
But I was just lie, this
is, that's not competition.

219
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,240
You know, having said that,
having said that, when the, uh,

220
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,510
okay,

221
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,560
when the base, when the basketball
and hockey season ends, okay,

222
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm getting the the MLB package and I'm
watching my $210 million Red Sox who are

223
00:13:58,761 --> 00:13:59,521
in second place,

224
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:03,700
three games behind the evil empire that
has nothing but their own homegrown

225
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,553
talent.

226
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,910
And I'm going to watch that collision
course and see how that goes. Um, I,

227
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:16,911
I've learned this is what you have to do
if you're a sports fan with some fairly

228
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:22,770
big east is the baseball
is such a great sport,

229
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,930
but the problem is,
is the first,

230
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:29,670
almost the first half of the season is
the most exciting time in basketball and

231
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:33,210
hockey and your emotions as a fan.
I was so heightened,

232
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,600
even if your team is out of
it, just to watch, you know,

233
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:40,500
there's always something great
happens in the, in the final,

234
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:44,850
unless you enough the fucking ref called
38 files on one team at 15 on the other,

235
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,073
then it sucks.

236
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,040
Okay.

237
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,900
Letting it go.
Um,

238
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,090
and then all of a sudden it's
over and then you settle it.

239
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,800
Yeah. Just a bit outside on a
beautiful day for a ball game.

240
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:00,880
Yeah.

241
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I'll tell you his on base percentage is
six 45 or that he's really seeing the

242
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:09,550
ball right now. I can't be
played the game. What was
it like when you had just a,

243
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:10,810
what do you hit a zone like this?

244
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,280
Well, I'll tell you, you know when you
hit a zone like this, I mean that ball.

245
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:18,510
I mean your eyes are as big as Chris in
at. I mean it just, it's like you can't,

246
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,600
you just stick in the bad out there and
the ball's going where it wants to go.

247
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:22,950
But you know,

248
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,640
how do you, how do you try to stay
in that zone? How do you try to,

249
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,553
I try to keep it going.

250
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,150
Well, you know, it's one of those
things you can't control. You just,

251
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,590
you learn as you,

252
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:37,490
as you mature as a player to just try
to enjoy those moments and a while,

253
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:40,820
you know, your hope it goes, as
long as it can put a grouchy,

254
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:44,130
it is going to swing back to the other
way. And you just hope that that says a,

255
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,300
you know,
that the slump

256
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,190
doesn't last as long. So,
uh, you know, you could, uh,

257
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,550
keep your house in that gold dig and
horror that you met in Tulsa when you're

258
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,690
coming up in AAA that you knocked up and
you don't really love, but you like her,

259
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,960
you're hanging in there for the kid. Um,
you know, you've got to settle into that.

260
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,150
So what you need to do is,
uh,

261
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,930
what you got to just immediately,

262
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:12,610
you got to slow everything the
fuck down and what you have to do,

263
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,200
what you got to watch a day game,

264
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,070
you got to keep score
while you smoke a cigar.

265
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,270
You know, you get your lineup,
you get it all ready to go.

266
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,840
You just fucking sit there and you
like the cigar, but the third, any,

267
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,280
you know, and he'd just sit there and
you fucking maybe even on the radio,

268
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,450
listen to it on the radio and you just,
it's like sports yoga.

269
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,670
He just have to totally
just calm your mind,

270
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,940
fucking relax and then slide
into the dog days of baseball.

271
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,323
Right?

272
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,790
And then you ride that out for about six
weeks and then all of a sudden it's NFL

273
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,930
preseason. All right. And
as a pre season comes along,

274
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:55,210
you're excited about football
cause every week's exciting,

275
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:59,650
cause they only play 16 games. Right?
But baseball's also ramping up.

276
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,060
So then when September comes
along, it's like April, May,

277
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,320
June with basketball and hockey.

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,610
Cause now it's like you're so excited how
fucking NFL football, college football.

279
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,820
It's coming back. I have
a reason to live. Right.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And the baseball race is heating up
before you go in with Joe Buck and all the

281
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:22,180
great October baseball. That's
how you do it. All right,

282
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,460
so these next six weeks after the finals
are over, you know, I'm telling you,

283
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:30,220
I'll walk you through it on the podcast.
You know,

284
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:34,830
you pick a couple of alternative sports.
Maybe you watch a little Roland Garris,

285
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,130
little Wimbledon,

286
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,020
you get into Formula One,
maybe a little a Moto g

287
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,980
p right? I don't know what the
fuck you got to do. It's not,

288
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,970
it's not my business. It's
none of my business. What time
is it? Nine 55. Let's see,

289
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,040
I can read advertising

290
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,600
in five minutes.
I don't think I can do it.

291
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,060
Especially when I got to
type in my God damn password.

292
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,850
The family bag.
He sched kidding.

293
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,560
Um, all right. What do we
got here? Oh, love supreme.

294
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,550
All right,
worry Indo dean.

295
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:11,430
Don't cheat a talk about how every
man looks better on a suit. You know,

296
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:15,450
when I'm checking out of Fella, I love
boy shorts, just like the next guy.

297
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:20,010
But what really turns me on is a
nice sharp look and fell in a suit.

298
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,761
You know what I mean?

299
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:25,761
Grab him by his tie or Indochino is
making it easy to get a perfectly tailored

300
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,800
suit and an incredible price.

301
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,270
You can choose from hundreds
of top quality fabrics and
personalize your suits,

302
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,940
your fucking initials on the pocket,
uh, just the way you want it.

303
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,850
Don't you pills to whether it works,
uh,

304
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,380
whether it's for work or a wedding
or another special occasion.

305
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Indochino has suited up hundreds of
thousands of men and are now the largest

306
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:57,930
made to measure men's wear brand
in the world world, world, world.

307
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,430
Here's how it works.

308
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,320
Visit a showroom or shop
online at Indochino, I.

309
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,760
N d O, c h, I n o.com. Um,

310
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,840

if they went to China Indochino uh,

311
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,970
pick your fabric.

312
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,520
Went to the warehouse.
I picked out a fucking suit.

313
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,740
I went with three piece.
I talked to Wei am a man.

314
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,780
Um,

315
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,740

lapels to pleats to jacket linings and

326
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,390
Five. Four club. Yo,
you like a short pitch.

327
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,920
This is the five four club.
I'm kidding. Um, looking good.

328
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,660
Doesn't need to cost a fortune five
four club is revolutionizing the way men

329
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:27,340
stop at five four club.
They found a way to make a great look.

330
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,590
Great looking clothes
affordable for everyone.

331
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:34,420
Five Photo Club also understands
that your time is extremely valuable.

332
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,261
Why?

333
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:40,261
One wasted at the mall or wandering
around in stores each month.

334
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:44,710
They send you a crow,
a curated box of two to three items.

335
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,850
That just means somebody else picked
it out. I hate that word. Curated.

336
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,020
If somebody gives a shit the fuck does
this guy want tank tops aid you fucking

337
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:56,550
tank tops. Why wasted? Oh,

338
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,280
what the fuck am I handpicked? Match
the current season and your style? Oh,

339
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:03,850

This is from Montreal. Quebec.

340
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,590
All right, I'm back. I'm
in between interviews.

341
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,540
I mean between fucking interviews here.

342
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,700
I got around the wrong fucking headphones.
All right, here we got back back.

343
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,740
I got another interview and four
minutes with the fee. The big east.

344
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,693
Um,
all right,

345
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,140
let's put the fuck was I talking
about trying to type in my password?

346
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,940
This is a mess. Why would I do this
before I hit fucking set it? Yeah.

347
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:40,900
There we go. There we go. Oh

348
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,040
Five four club.

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,310

for over 15 years and shipped over a

350
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:48,490

Paul and Mark Walberg use five four club.

352

don't also, if you don't, that's okay.

356
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,590

knees. It's a fact of life. You get $120.

All right,

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,510
see so everybody see so you
know I've had funny feelings.

376
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,690
I've gotten funny looks,
I've eaten,

377
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,080
I've even eaten funny smelling Sushi.
But let me tell you,

378
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,920
none of those are as funny
as CSO streaming library
of standup television and

379
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,720
original content,
especially not the Sushi.

380
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,560
Why would they try to write comedy for us?
Let me do a quick rewrite of this.

381
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,550
You know,
I've had a funny feeling in my gut.

382
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,490
I've gone down on a funny smell in Twat.

383
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,383
Get Out.

384
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,970
I been in a parking lot late at night
and felt funny like, you know, is,

385
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,520
is someone gonna fucking cut me up.

386
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:05,521
But nothing compares to watch and a
fucking six feet under run on a CSO.

387
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,560
All right,
maybe I should go with this shit next,

388
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:13,770
please mention the talking points below.

Why won't you work for
me? You know, it's funny.

424
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:34,320
If somebody has enough time at some point,

the fucking splice together every time
I'm trying to fucking put together my

426
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:41,130
password yet, by the way, tiger woods,

427
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,010
tiger woods
blue is 0.0 the dude was on pills.

428
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,080
You know what I mean?
The level of shit that that guy's getting,

429
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:54,380
that guy sacrificed his fucking
body to become great. Okay.

430
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:57,830
Now his body's breaking down and
everybody's blaming it on the fact that he

431
00:26:57,831 --> 00:27:01,010
cheated on his lay right,
and that's what did him in

432
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,490
his laser focus. He couldn't block out
the fat I the first two years. Yeah,

433
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:11,570
I'm sure bugged. But I mean, at
some point you move on, right?

434
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,270
His body blade said
from the very beginning,

435
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,060
they said the way he swings the club,
his body's gonna break down at some point.

436
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:20,630
So now look at him. Now look at him.
You know, he's trying to come back.

437
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,220
He's on all these painkillers.

438
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,780
He wants to win another one probably
before he hangs it up and goes to the, uh,

439
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,630
the senior tour.
He's doing what he has to do.

440
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,680
These fucking drugs that you can get
nowadays are completely out of control.

441
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:36,860
When I was a kid, when a drug came
out, bear or any of this shit,

442
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,650
they didn't have 9,000 side effects.

443
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,740
What happened was people used to
be in the pharmaceutical industry,

444
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:46,640
got into the fucking FDA and they're
the ones who police to pharmaceutical

445
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:50,700
companies. And those cons
just waved everything around
that the third bass coast,

446
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:53,240
it dead, lost his vision, right?

447
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,880
So then they let opiates
end of the fucking world.

448
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:59,240
Now you've got a goddamn heroin epidemic.
Okay.

449
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,960
And now tiger woods is taken too many of
those fucking things and he pulls over

450
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:05,960
to the side of the road and everybody's
saying it's because he did the fucking

451
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:10,380
blonde hair, blue eyed woman, whoever
he is, a saint who took his fucking his,

452
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,030
his master's money,
bought a giant house,

453
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,740
not the fucking thing down
to buy something else. Where
did all that material go?

454
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,170
Where did all those fucking
gold plated toilets go?

455
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:25,690
They went right into the fucking ocean,
you know, but she's a victim. Oh,

456
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:30,160
give me a break. That's it
for the podcast. Signing
off. Not fucking with you.

457
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,710
I'm just trying to energy my way
through the last bit of this. Uh,

458
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,720
what else do I have here to talk about?
Oh, you know, he has a great new bits,

459
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,320
a new bit I brought,
his name is Charlie,

460
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Charlie Watts drummer for the rolling
stones as a great new book out that it's

461
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,540
just a drummer's that influenced him.

462
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:53,260
And if you're a drummer and you're
into that shit because he's a,

463
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:54,640
I guess a jazz drummer at heart.

464
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:57,670
He talked about all these
fucking great drummers that I've,

465
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:01,450
I've heard most of the names and didn't
know enough about them and the fact that

466
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:05,200
he could break down their styles
and what they did has made me a,

467
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,620
I was already listening to a lot of that
shit through some of my drum lessons,

468
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,710
but really just trying to listen to the
shit that he's saying. It's a great book.

469
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,000
Um, let me, let me look it up here. I'm
going to fucking hype his book here.

470
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,570
You know, we've been trying to get Charlie
Watson this podcast for a long time.

471
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,850
I know he doesn't do a
lot of interviews and uh,

472
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,280
but I know he'd want to come on my
podcast. I'm joking. Charlie watts book.

473
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,280
Let's see what we got here.
Jolly.

474
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,830
You know the fucking Internet works
in like two rooms in my fucking house.

475
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,920
I spent all this money like can you give
me the nuclear level fucking Internet

476
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,650
so I can send out,
beat out my neighbors and you know,

477
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,560
it works for a little
while then that's it.

478
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,760
Well was sown. Shelly watch 10 things
you didn't know about. Shelly Watch.

479
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,240
Why no books about Charlie Watch,
you know,

480
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:02,220
I'm usually good about
front Charlie watts books,

481
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,440
drummers influence book.
You know,

482
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,510
I nailed the John Daly
search the last time.

483
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,850
Okay,

484
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,010
come on for fuck sakes. Oh Charlie, watch
David drama. So it did come up, dude.

485
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,920
He can get it for 12 bucks,
$12 and 37 cents. Um,

486
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,550
whiplash, the film that puts the
drummer in the limelight. I did.

487
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:26,440
I ever tell you guys how much
I fucking hated that movie.

488
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,730
I just hated watching somebody getting
berated. It's just like fucking quit.

489
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,920
Go join another band.

490
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:37,040
Why would you sit there and taking that
level of shit from the guy and then not

491
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,550
to mention the kids fucking technique.
I,

492
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,050
you had to look away when he
was fucking playing real fast.

493
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:45,290
He's making those faces. You could just
feel the guy's forums taken up. This guy,

494
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,350
this guy's going to have carpal tunnel
trying to please this complete cunt.

495
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,110
You know,
and I got to tell you,

496
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:59,111
the best drums from that year was not
in that movie is great as the drums were

497
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:03,140
the best fucking drums. And some of the
best drummers I've heard in a movie,

498
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:08,140
a mainstream moving a long fucking
time. Was that Michael Keaton movie? Um,

499
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,770
what the fuck was that movie where he
was the former superhero? The bird.

500
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,311
Do you not long.

501
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:16,700
I watched that movie before I realized
that was him in the costume talking to

502
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:21,290
himself. Spoiler alert.
All right, Michael Keaton.

503
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:27,180
I'm just going to write bird.
Fuck you spell his name.

504
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:30,070
I've only been watching his movies for
30 fucking years. Built Jesus Christ.

505
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,610
Michael Keaton,
bird bird man.

506
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,080
Yo Birdman five fo.
Um,

507
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,850
who the fuck is the drummer in that?
I know I talked about that before.

508
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:45,210
The drums in that movie
are fucking incredible.

509
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,580
It's like,

510
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,520
okay,

511
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,090
like that. That's what just a whole
other level of drumming would.

512
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:55,870
That guy is like,
he's playing like moods.

513
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,730
They supposed to just play a 90
million miles an hour all over the kid.

514
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:04,680
That guy is, he's, he's piece creating
peaks and valleys. I mean that was like a,

515
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,160
that was literally a movie score
just done with drums. I mean,

516
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:12,400
how many people can have that level of
talent? I can tell you right now. I know.

517
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:13,234
I don't,

518
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,050
I already knew I didn't in for the last
three weeks because I've been so damn

519
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:21,670
busy. I've just been playing like,
you know, not on a real drum kit,

520
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,840
you know, a little practice pad kit that
I was playing on and I thought I was,

521
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:26,111
you know,

522
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,220
I thought I was doing something and
then I went down and I played on a real

523
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:34,540
fucking kitten and Jesus
Christ, everything that you
think he could, you can,

524
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:39,200
you can do drops by like 50 bps.
You know,

525
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,080
it'd be basically like if you would
just jogging on a treadmill being like,

526
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:45,470
wow man, I can run a seven minute mile.
Then he'd go out to run down the street.

527
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,920
You know, when you forgot about hills and
shit and all of a sudden, you know, you,

528
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:52,730
you can't run a seven minute mile anymore.
Even if it was flat,

529
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,760
flat level. Okay. He'd
be, if it was flat level,

530
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:58,550
all of a sudden you run like a fucking
11 minute mile. That's what I was like,

531
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:03,500
it was extremely fucking
disheartening. And, um, I'm doing the,

532
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:08,150
uh, the comedy jam this weekend up
in San Francisco for cluster fest,

533
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,720
which is just completely
like one of the biggest,

534
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,690
I don't know how they afforded to,
to,

535
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,450
to get all of those comedians
and bands and all of that.

536
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:18,860
They must've had a lot of ad money.

537
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,420
Somebody is doing something to
establish that comedy festivals on.

538
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,610
We're going to go fucking,
you know,

539
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,320
nine zillion dollars in the
hole to start it out. But uh,

540
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,390
you might want to go this year
because they're going big. Um,

541
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,420
oh, I had moments forgot
before I sign off here.

542
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,950
Thank you to everybody who
has been watching season
two of F is for family. Um,

543
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,740
got nothing but great reviews. You know,
there's always a couple of cunty once.

544
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:45,290
What are you going to do?
But overall you guys not only like it,

545
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,690
but you're saying you think it's
even better than the first season,

546
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,030
which for the amount of work that we put
in, um, to hear that kind of feedback,

547
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,760
you know, I know I'm a jerk a lot.
That really means a lot to me.

548
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:58,100
So thank you guys for
not only watching it.

549
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,890
Thank you for the people that took the
time to let me know how much you enjoyed

550
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,430
it. Please let other people know about
it. The more the people know about it,

551
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:07,880
the more people watch it and the better
chance we have of possibly getting a

552
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:12,770
third season. Um, and that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

553
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,340
Have a great weekend.

554

a bit of music from Andrew Feminists and

I don't know what. All right,

558
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,080

All right,

00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,260
I'll talk to you on Monday,

560
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,573
coming back.

561
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,623
Oh,

562
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,360
all right. Hey, this is
the longest fucking revenge
story I think I've ever read.

563
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,960
Let me see if I can, uh,
see if I can fucking just,

564
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,510
I'm going to blow my, read that one next
week when I have the energy. All right.

565
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:54,740
Questions? All right, Bill.
Uh, I have a question for you.

566
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:57,530
I was hoping you might be able
to shine some insight on this.

567
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,670
I have this great friend
that that's a girl mistake.

568
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,260
Um,

569
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,850
and we get along great and we have never
had any sort of sexual tension walking

570
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:12,851
up or interest despite
her being attractive.

571
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,690
Okay.

572
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,270
All right, dude. Right there. You're
either gay or you're, or you're an idiot.

573
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,980
And I'm not trying,
I'm giving you some tough love here.

574
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,910
That's a fucking stupid
situation to be involved in.

575
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:23,840
Okay.

576
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,490
That's stupid.
All right.

577
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:29,090
Unless you're using her to attract
other females to get you fucking late.

578
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,880
Let's see if this is the case.
I will continue reading.

579
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,450
So she has this smoking hot
friend. Oh, there we go.

580
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,680
That I had met a few times and
always flirted with. But uh,

581
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,930
but it's just been overall friendly.

582
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,160
So this checks calls me up one night
and I'm at the bar at like midnight and

583
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:49,340
asked if I want to stay up drinking
with her and she'd come pick me up.

584
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,600
So obviously I agree. Thanks. Go very
good. And we have a few drinks and flirt.

585
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,320
And when I make my move, she gets
all upset. Like I should have known.

586
00:36:57,321 --> 00:36:58,790
She just wants to be friends.

587
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:03,680
When she calls me up at midnight to say
to stay up drinking with her alone after

588
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:08,180
the incident, the bitch still has the
balls to slow to ask to sleep over.

589
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:09,781
Uh,

590
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:13,560
since then I have noticed all of friends
are trying to be my friend when all I

591
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:17,640
want to do is rail the shit out of them.
Bill, I was hoping you could, you should,

592
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,160
you could shine some light on the
situation and help me out. Yeah, dude,

593
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,000
never have a friend as a,
as a female,

594
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,250
you know,
you always gotta be

595
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,160
fucking him. That's the only
reason to be around him, you know?

596
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,210
I know that sounds really
sexist, but you know, I, I just,

597
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,570
I'm speaking from me.
There's no fucking point

598
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,250
in hanging out with that
level of frustration if you're
not having sex with them.

599
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,950
And if there are actually like a good
friend and that's the one that you should,

600
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,600
uh,
I mean that's the ultimate,

601
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:59,150
if you're banging them and
they're also a great friend,

602
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:03,110
that's the one you marry cause you got a
connection there. Right. But if you just,

603
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,860
I mean they're using you
as like a live teddy bear.

604
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,140
Okay.

605
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,730
And um, yeah, the next time they call up,

606
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:17,690
just be like, no, I'm, I, I'm not, I can't
hang out tonight. What are you doing?

607
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:19,430
I'm going to go out and try
to get some ass tonight.

608
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:23,450
I know I'm not getting any from you and
it's frustrating because you're hot and

609
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:27,390
I want to bend you over every piece
of fucking furniture in my apartment.

610
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,380
[inaudible] I can't believe you
said that. Yeah. Well I just did.

611
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,030
Are you going to come over here and
fuck me? Well then great. I have to,

612
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,120
why are you being so mean? I'm not
being mean, I'm being honest. Okay.

613
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,610
Do you have any times I've jerked off
to you. It's fucking, and it's annoying

614
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,720
that you just, you just, I'm telling
you, like that's a little aggressive,

615
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,030
but that's what you have to start doing.

616
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,200
You just have to be straightforward
and honest and don't do it.

617
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,560
Like I just said it, do it, do it
how you can do it and pull it off.

618
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:58,810
And you just say it like that and
just be like, Hey, I want to go out.

619
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,880
I want to try to get laid tonight.
All right.

620
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,770
And I go out with you and
you're not fucking me.

621
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:05,440
And then other girls see me with you
and they think that I am fucking you,

622
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:09,400
which I'm not. And I ended up
going home, a dry humping my futon,

623
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,560
you know, and it's really fucking
with myself to steam. Okay.

624
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,080
So that's it. So basically he
ready. You say you say that,

625
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,280
um, if I had a sack your cock,
you know, I hang out with me. Yes.

626
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,370
That is what I'm saying. That's what I'm
saying. Your conversations are awful,

627
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,700
you know, I'm sure they're interesting
to other females, but not to me.

628
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,410
I don't want it to,
I don't want to talk about that shit.

629
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,010
I could give a shit about the hills,
the Osi,

630
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,550
the ocean or whatever the
fuck I was stupid. Show you
what? I don't give a fuck.

631
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,010
I don't give a fuck. I
want to fuck you. Okay.

632
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,870
It's world's Ed, right day
in artist. You have a seat.

633
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:51,690
Well watched the world series of poker.
When you go all in, that's what you do.

634
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,340
Just say what the fuck you want to do.

635
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,380
You push all your chips in and you
stand up and you start walking around.

636
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:01,380
You wait for that next car to drop.
Steve. What the fuck happens? Yeah,

637
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:05,460
dude, that's my advice. Get
out of that whole circle of EA.

638
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:10,070
He's like a big teddy bear.
Fuck that. Fuck Dad. All right.

639
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,150
United Teddy Bear. Well, you are one right
now. You've got to stop being that guy.

640
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:19,100
So fuck all of them. Go. Uh, where
your guy friends, what are they doing?

641
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:21,230
Go hang out with them.
Go get a fucking wing man.

642
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,070
Get yourself back in the game and uh,
go out there and talk some shit.

643
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,340
Hit on some girl you
don't give a fuck about.

644
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:32,090
So you can practice not giving a fuck
and just say a bunch of shit that you

645
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:35,750
would never say to some girl
that you gave a shit about, eh,

646
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,860
because you don't give a fuck if the
girl says no, start with that, you know,

647
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,360
always wear a condom. And uh, and
that's it. That's what I would do.

648
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,520
That's what I should've done.
I didn't,

649
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,000
I just have that knowledge
now cause I'm fucking, uh,

650
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,560
and I have been the funeral psalm.
I was never the front,

651
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,070
but I was definitely the Douche
bag. I was definitely the, the uh,

652
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,000
not even pussy whipped wasn't even pussy.
What does just,

653
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,040
I couldn't fucking speak up for myself.

654
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,480
I was afraid of having a confrontation
and then by the time I had the final

655
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:07,160
confrontation, I was like, ah, I know.

656
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:10,850
It was like fucking a year with
the shit and we broke up. Um,

657
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,050
but that's a whole nother thing.

658
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,520
[inaudible]

659
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,650
[inaudible] up everybody.
It's bill bar.

660
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:47,310
This is the Monday morning podcasts and
I'm recording for the third time this

661
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:47,820
week.

662
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,820
Praying and hoping against hope that g
CAS will actually upload this one because

663
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:57,870
I've already spent 90 minutes doing
podcasts this week. So anyways,

664
00:41:57,871 --> 00:42:00,480
if you're hearing this,
it means I successfully uploaded it.

665
00:42:00,481 --> 00:42:01,920
So there's no sense complaining,

666
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:07,150
unlike the rest of the people in my
fucking life. You know you have it.

667
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,520
Just have one of those weeks where
everyone's just bitching at you.

668
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,350
That's what I got.
You know,

669
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,780
that's what I'm dealing with right now.

670
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,430
Like today's my girlfriend's birthday
and she's, she was fucking pissed at me.

671
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:23,080
She went absolutely psycho
on me this morning. You know,

672
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,880
it had nothing to do with me. Had
nothing to fucking do with me. You know,

673
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,200
I gave her a piece of cake last night,
right at midnight,

674
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,800
sang her happy birthday because
technically it was a birthday.

675
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,800
I gave her a pre birthday slice of cake
and then I gave her a bag of Fritos with

676
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:43,160
a little bow on it. Right.
Just being a silly jackass.

677
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,510
Like that's all you're getting
for your birthday. Right.

678
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,960
And everything was going great.
I was a big sweetheart.

679
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,500
And then I woke up this morning and made
the mistake of telling her that I had

680
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:54,090
made a dinner reservation yet.

681
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,320
And then she starts flipping out acting
like I'm just throwing her God damn

682
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:03,940
birthday together when I gave her a pre
birthday fucking slice of birthday cake,

683
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,390
you know,
starts flipping out.

684
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,150
I don't know why she was flipping
out. It's like, it's fucking Tuesday.

685
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,950
It's a Tuesday. It's not a holiday.
This who the fuck is going out tonight?

686
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,240
June 2nd. Oh Shit. Was it
Cinco de Mayo? You know,

687
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,560
is it a fuss? I'm fucking New Zealand
holiday that I don't know about.

688
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,680
There's going to be plenty of fucking
reservations and lo and behold,

689
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,580
after she flips out, you
know, screaming at me. Right?

690
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,210
So all my neighbors think that I'm
beating her. Women love doing that Shit.

691
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,250
They just put on this big fucking show.
Right? And then afterwards they just guy,

692
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:45,830
I'm sorry I got a little crazy.
I don't know.

693
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,850
I think just he don't hate
me, dare you. You forgive me.

694
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,220
And they do that shit. Right. Meanwhile,

695
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,260
you know your neighbors
don't hear that part.

696
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,980
They don't hear the part where they sort
of say really quietly that they flipped

697
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:03,100
out for no fucking reason. You know,
all they heard was to scream and yell.

698
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,620
And so now I'm going to get the looks
today I'm going to go down to the garage.

699
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,581
You know,

700
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:10,450
like it's the 1920s like I should become
walking out with like a fucking wife

701
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:14,240
beater, you know, as I
reattach the belt to my pants.

702
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,330
So this is what happens, right. I ended
up calling up this fucking restaurant,

703
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:26,840
is this not one of the nicest
steak houses out here in la?

704
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,860
I call him up. I said, hey,
I'd like a reservation for
two people. Hang. Okay sir,

705
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:35,640
what time would you like? I
said, how about eight? Ah,
can't do anything at eight.

706
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,960
How about eight 30 and I said, you know
what sweetheart, that would be perfect.

707
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,940
And she said, okay, and that was it.

708
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,910
That's all I had to fucking do.
But for some reason,

709
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,160
because I didn't do that
before her birthday,

710
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:55,160
that means that I don't give a fuck.
That's how fucking nuts women are.

711
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,160
She absolutely, she actually
flipped out on me. Okay.

712
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,870
At 10 o'clock in the
morning on her birthday,

713
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,380
she didn't even give me a chance to fuck
the day up. She did a preemptive strike,

714
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,460
even though I gave her a pre birthday
slice of cake, I sang happy birthday.

715
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,110
I made a shutter arise, I put, I put out
the lights, I lit a candle. I came in,

716
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:19,990
I sang happy birthday and
I gave her a bag of Fritos,

717
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:23,380
which is fucking ridiculous and silly.
It was great.

718
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,300
And tonight she's getting the real
gift, if you know what I mean. Oh. Um,

719
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:32,403
you know,

720
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,860
so it's one of those deals
where I'm laying in bed and
then all of a sudden she,

721
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:43,420
ah, it's just fucking ridiculous,
you know? But I didn't back down.

722
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,000
I didn't back down. I, you know,
actually when she really got mad,

723
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:49,300
why is she started flipping out is
because she, when she was screaming at me,

724
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,480
I was laughing.
You know,

725
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,150
I don't know if any other guy out
there has that problem you ever had.

726
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,040
Like when your girlfriend
starts yelling at you,

727
00:45:57,041 --> 00:46:01,540
you're first instinct is just to
start laughing. I don't know why.

728
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,210
Every time my girl yells at me,

729
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:07,140
I instantly feel like I'm in
school again and I'm like,

730
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,400
and in second grade and I'm
getting yelled at and it's just,

731
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,380
and my friends are laughing at me.
That's, that's what I feel like.

732
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:17,080
I feel ridiculous. Okay.
I guess that's what it is.

733
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:19,750
When when a woman yells at me,
I always feel ridiculous.

734
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,100
You don't want a guy yells at me.
I get mad because I think, oh fuck,

735
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:27,910
this guy's going to beat the shit out of
me. So you got to get into that energy.

736
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,400
But when a girl,
a woman is just sitting there,

737
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,640
what are you supposed to do? You know,
I'm not going to yell back at you.

738
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,570
You're a woman.
I don't want to feel like a bully.

739
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,850
We're not going to get physical.
You're a woman.

740
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,950
You know it's stupid.

741
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:52,480
Stop yelling that fucking high pitch
voice. You sound like a fucking,

742
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,900
he's all like Mickey
Mouse. Sit Down, relax,

743
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,550
collect your thoughts. Make a list. If
you have to tell me why you're upset,

744
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,471
you know,

745
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:06,320
but don't just sit there fucking yelling
at me like you just took a hit off a

746
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:09,290
helium balloon because
it just sounds hilarious,

747
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,490
especially when I haven't done anything
wrong and I got a great fucking gift

748
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:14,030
this year.

749
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,150
That's what was killing me that actually
I actually had that moment during the

750
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:22,770
fight where I said, you want your gift,
fine, and I went out and I pull it out.

751
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,590
It's already wrapped with a bow on it.
You know,

752
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,380
sitting there acting like I'm not fucking
prepared. There's your fucking present.

753
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,900
Bam wrapped with a fucking bow on it.

754
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,560
Jesus,
everybody giving me Shit.

755
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,880
I remember last week when I called that
woman a douchebag remembered the Douche

756
00:47:38,881 --> 00:47:42,370
bag of the week last week because
she was giving me shit. Once again,

757
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,020
a female surprise,

758
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:49,021
surprise was giving me shit that when
I read the underrated overrated or the

759
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:52,930
questions people have,
I wouldn't say what sex they were.

760
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,640
And she somehow found out a
way to kind of, I don't know,

761
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,270
make me look like I was some chauvinist
that I guess she felt if it was a good

762
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:04,810
question,
I credited a guy and uh,

763
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,640
you know, it's a free podcast. All right,

764
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:15,040
stop being so fucking cunty.
So she became Douche bag of the week.

765
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,610
So evidently she didn't like it.
And what does she do?

766
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,290
She sends me an email, his
email, she sends me a bill.

767
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,690
It's nice that you named
me Douche bag of the week.

768
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,320
I don't really give a shit because
I always mean what I write.

769
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,950
I don't even know what that means
cause I always mean what I write.

770
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,110
I'll really one of the
rest of us just faking it.

771
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,190
We're just joking around but not
you yourself fucking serious.

772
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,540
It's anyways, evidently this psycho. This
is a new segment. This is cy. I can't,

773
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,380
I can't figure out this is a love letter
of the week or psycho or the week.

774
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,740
I don't know. You guys name it. I
don't give a shit. So anyway, she goes,

775
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:53,800
I don't really give a shit because I
always mean what I write and it seems

776
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:58,330
you're just talking shit about two
things that I wrote that seemed bitchy.

777
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,330
Now I was talking about your entire email.
Don't try to knock it down. All right,

778
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,490
continuing here. She goes,
call me. [inaudible] but I
really don't give a fuck.

779
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,180
You've read a lot of my
comments previously and
agreed with them or had a good

780
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,170
response to them.

781
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,320
I'm literally fixing her sentences because
she doesn't know how to write here.

782
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,370
But it's nice that you, uh, we'll consider
telling the gender of the person who,

783
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,130
uh,
who the comments are from.

784
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,570
And I know you have a shitload of
people who listen to your podcast,

785
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,960
but I got you some more since my friends
who heard the podcast thought it was

786
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:31,420
fucking hilarious and then
they started listening to you.

787
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,320
So you really should be thanking me.
Isn't this just typical?

788
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,420
This is just all going to be
a woman bashing this week.

789
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:42,010
Isn't this just typical of a fucking
female? You know what I mean?

790
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,270
She's getting something every week,
every week that is free.

791
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,690
And she still found a way
to bitch about it. Okay.

792
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:52,690
And then when I call her
out for being a douchebag,

793
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,490
now she's actually trying to make
me feel guilty. You know, I just,

794
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,910
you know, you call me a Douche bag,
you know, whatever. I mean, he's just,

795
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:03,490
even though I got a whole bunch
of friends to listen to you,

796
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:07,960
I mean probably shouldn't be thanking me,
but you know, I thought, okay, shut up.

797
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,650
Just Shit. I swear to God. Why? Why
can't you just slap women? You know,

798
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,090
back in the day, how great
did that feel? You know,

799
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,950
you have on the wife Beater,

800
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,260
the wind blowing through your
armpit hair has you just crack.

801
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,320
I know it's evil. I don't give a fuck.
Fuck all you guys. I don't give a shit.

802
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,720
This is the rest of her email. Okay.
Before you think I'm an asshole.

803
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,860
This is what she wrote. This is
actually so psychotic. It's hilarious.

804
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,480
She writes and yeah,

805
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:39,320
I do know that the name shows up on
the email even if I don't sign it,

806
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,880
but you just make it seem like you
that much of a retard to notice.

807
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,650
That's literally what she wrote.

808
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,720
And then she wrote your over 40 and
have the vocabulary of a seventh grader.

809
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:54,950
Your is spelled y, o u. R. All right,

810
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:59,660
for you morons out there,
your y o u r is possessive,

811
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,350
meaning like that's your shirt.
Okay.

812
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:08,270
If you're saying your over
40 that's you are. Okay.

813
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,980
So that means if you're gonna say your,

814
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:13,940
it's an apostrophe Wyo you a
pause to free our [inaudible].

815
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,760
So if you're a dumb fuck like this woman,

816
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,910
if you don't know the next time you go
to write your just stop and see if you

817
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,140
are would still fit.
All right?

818
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:31,460
Like your over 40 you are over 40 okay.
Right there.

819
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:36,461
You know you got to use the apostrophe
as as opposed to saying you're over 40 so

820
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:42,350
what is over do I own over you?
Dumb fuck.

821
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,250
But I do have the vocabulary of a
seventh grader, but you know something,

822
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:49,040
you have the fucking vocabulary
for a third grader. All right?

823
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,030
You're over 40 and you have the
vocabulary of a seventh grader.

824
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:57,320
You can't recognize real words.
How hilarious is this?

825
00:51:57,321 --> 00:52:00,230
And she's misspelling stuff.
You started when you read,

826
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,330
and I hope your dog outlives you

827
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:09,220
and you die lonely because of your
inability to commit and therefore never

828
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:12,230
achieve the comedic fame
of the Great George Carlin.

829
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,130
So Simon says,
go fuck yourself.

830
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,670
Since it sounds like you
have major brain damage.

831
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,500
All right sweetheart, I'm really going
to try to help you out here, okay?

832
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:28,100
If you hope that my dog outlives me,
and then you say,

833
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:33,020
and then I die lonely. Okay. If
I'm going to die before my dog,

834
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,380
mathematically the fucking
dog is still gonna be there.

835
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:39,890
So how am I going to be lonely?
You know,

836
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,790
the dog would have to die first or
run away. So what you should say is,

837
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:44,780
I hope you dug out lives.

838
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,830
You then runs away and then you died
by yourself as opposed to saying,

839
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,320
I hope your dog outlives you
when you die. Lonely. Now,

840
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:55,130
I would die before my dog and be sitting
there licking my face and my last few

841
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:56,150
pathetic moments,

842
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,680
and then evidently because of my
inability to commit to a relationship,

843
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,530
I'll never achieve the comedic
fame of George Carlin. Oh,

844
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:04,610
that totally makes sense.

845
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,670
It has nothing to do with the fact that
I wasn't blessed with his gifts as a

846
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:08,960
comedian.
You know,

847
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,140
all you have to do to be as good as
George Carlin is just commit to a

848
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:16,550
relationship to some psycho
fucking chick like you. All right,

849
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,170
lady. These are podcasts. These are
jokes. When I call somebody a Douchebag,

850
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,050
I'm just fucking around, so don't
take it seriously. But if you want to,

851
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,380
you and your friends can
go fuck yourselves and go
listen to another podcast.

852
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:33,130
All right. Stop trying to
threaten me. Like you're going
to take podcasts. Listen,

853
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,520
listeners away. I don't
give a shit. This is free.

854
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,920
What are you guys going to take
away advertising dollars from me?

855
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:40,020
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck you and your friends.

856
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,640
I hope you're all listening together.
Fuck all of you. Look around the room,

857
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,750
look into each one of your eyes.
I'm saying fuck all of you.

858
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,840
You know what's funny is your friends
are probably laughing at you right now

859
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:56,400
going, you know what she is? She has
kind of a cunt. She really is like that.

860
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:59,280
She does have a tendency, I know I
shouldn't use that word, but I'm serious.

861
00:53:59,310 --> 00:53:59,760
She has,

862
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,960
she can be real counties sometimes and
she has a tendency to exaggerate things

863
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:07,620
that aren't really happening. In
fact here, hair here. All right,

864
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,710
so that's the first hate mail. So I
figured, you know, why don't I seek out,

865
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:14,160
I'll try to find some other hate mail.
Here's one that I got on youtube.

866
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:19,500
This is a nice one. Um, basically I, uh,

867
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,440
there's a clip on there from
me from about eight years ago,

868
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:25,380
which he'll obviously notice cause I'm
skinnier and have a full head of hair.

869
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,840
And I'm doing this bit about joining
the military, saying how, you know,

870
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:33,990
when you watch the commercials for the
military, it makes you want to join.

871
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,140
You know, they make it look like
everybody gets their own jet.

872
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,160
Everybody's driving a tank.
Everyone's doing some top gun shit.

873
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:44,700
Everyone's having a, uh, you
know, you're a fucking navy seal.

874
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:49,050
You get your face painted
and you're clinging to that
raft and you coming up out

875
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:52,920
of the water like fucking Rambo
disappearing into the mud and shit.

876
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,290
That's what they make you look like.
Right?

877
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,860
But what they don't show is all
the other jobs that you, you know,

878
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,790
you go in there and you think you're
going to be like, you know, Tom Cruise,

879
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,630
oh my God, my dog just
farted. Jesus Christ, Cleo.

880
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,540
You know?
Could you at least like,

881
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,760
you won't kills me about this
dog when it farts, is it,

882
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:15,270
it doesn't even have the decency that
fucking kind of make a face like, yeah,

883
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:18,120
that was me. Sorry about
that. She doesn't lays here.

884
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,220
Good Lord. Least it's silent. You know,

885
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:24,760
it's the worst is when
you have a dog that far.

886
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:28,210
It's like a person ever
been over somebody's house
and the dogs and the corner

887
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:32,940
and they just go like
it. Just like really.

888
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,070
Anyways, so that was the bit, so
the bid is, yeah, you, you, you,

889
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,410
you see the commercial and you
sign up, you thinking, yeah,

890
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:44,340
I'm going to be like Tom Cruise in top
gun and then you show up and he ended up

891
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,200
being that guy.
You know when the jet takes off,

892
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:49,830
you just like point in the same direction
that the jets going or they give you

893
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:54,330
those, those orange glow sticks from a
rave. You know when the plane comes in,

894
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:58,380
you're that guy, you put the air
in the tires on the jet, you know,

895
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,470
you join the next thing you know you're
standing there with like a camouflage

896
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:05,730
weed whacker going week gave me hack.
Hack, hack. Yeah. That was the joke. Okay.

897
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,193
Simple joke.

898
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,130
I actually did the joke at a military
base and I also did it at one of the VA

899
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:14,670
hospitals and in fucking killed,
you know what I mean?

900
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,590
So this guy of course has to
go all Fox News on Youtube.

901
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:22,680
And this is what he writes is
actually kind of funny. He writes,

902
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:27,681
you grateful bitch and then he puts in
quotes if you're dumb enough to join the

903
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,500
military. Dot. Dot. Dot,

904
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:34,660
which is classic of somebody who wants
to take a joke seriously is they don't

905
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:38,140
write, the whole joke is they
just take not even a sentence.

906
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,860
They just take a part of a
sentence. Okay. So he writes,

907
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:44,320
if you're dumb enough to join
the military dot, dot, dot.

908
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:48,130
And then he writes in capital
letters. Fact, fact is,

909
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,200
if it wasn't for the bravery
of the American servicemen
and the American spirit

910
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,570
throughout history,
I like the American spirit.

911
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:59,900
What do you mean chicks who go to
a fucking bake sale? Um, anyways,

912
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,090
you wouldn't even get,

913
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,230
you wouldn't even have the right to mock
those sacrifices which have been made

914
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:07,840
for you.
And if you did,

915
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,480
you would probably be doing it in German.

916
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,920
So respect your American servicemen
because it is him in which you owe your

917
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:19,921
freedoms to take to that what people came,

918
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:20,891
you know,

919
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,070
half the time people think I'm a moron
cause people can't even write a sentence

920
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,340
because it is him in which
you owe your freedoms too,

921
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,070
that you take so foolishly for granted.

922
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:35,250
That's word for word or appreciate
the sacrifices of other you coward.

923
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:41,410
Uh, you know, at what point did I
make fun of servicemen? I didn't,

924
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,730
I was making fun of the how fucking
whatever. You know something.

925
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:47,620
If you guys want to take joke seriously,

926
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,250
I don't give a fuck and I am really sick
of that hacky thing where someone goes,

927
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:53,890
you know,
and they did it for you and if you didn't,

928
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,020
you'd be speaking German right now.
That's how dumb people are.

929
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:00,700
You know,

930
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,750
they're just used to say that you'd be
speaking German right now is a hacky

931
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:08,290
fucking reference. You just saying that
because you heard someone else say it.

932
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:13,090
You know, why wouldn't I be
speaking like I was from England?

933
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,910
Why wouldn't I be speaking
Spanish right now? You know,

934
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:19,090
we did fight other countries,
Mexican American war.

935
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:23,050
How come that one never gets brought up?
How can I wouldn't be speaking Korean.

936
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,210
I mean, granted they weren't over
here, but you know what I'm saying?

937
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:30,740
I'm so sick of fucking idiots who speak
in sound bites like I everyone who like

938
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,840
makes fun of France.
Yeah,

939
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:37,810
we fool conceived jurors and were to you
full can Poussey's read a history book.

940
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,740
We were paying them back for saving
our ass with England. You'd dumb fucks.

941
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,190
So now we're even all
right. Whatever. Look at me.

942
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:47,320
I'm getting all upset here cause
people are morons. All right, let's,

943
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:51,190
let's move on to, you know, let's, let's
get to some information here for the week.

944
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,870
All right. Um, last week I was
at, Oh, here's it going out.

945
00:58:54,871 --> 00:58:59,560
Last week I was at teasing firefighters
and I was talking about how, uh, you know,

946
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:02,380
20 trucks show up to every fire.
Why does that happen?

947
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:06,550
How much of those trucks costs?
And a volunteer firefighter wrote in,

948
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,070
he said a up it up. A, Ah, I, yes.

949
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:13,930
How much a fire trucks cost fire engines,
which put the water out.

950
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,130
Uh Oh wait, put the water on fire
engines, which put water out.

951
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,620
I think I'm dyslexic.
Um,

952
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,010
typically run between
300,000 and $600,000.

953
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:30,540
Fire trucks also called ladder trucks
run between 400,000 in 800,000.

954
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:36,020
The two main differences between the
low and high numbers is the make of the

955
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:37,820
truck and the equipment.

956
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:41,540
It comes with a fire engine
with all the hoses at and on.

957
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:45,800
And the breathing apparatus is more
expensive than without. All right.

958
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:49,100
Well here's a question I have with for
you. You say the make of the truck.

959
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,200
So, uh, I guess what Mack
truck, that's a reputable bank.

960
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,250
Reputable brand as opposed to what?

961
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,030
A high and a fire truck.
I guess that that's what it is.

962
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,610
I don't even know what the fuck
they are. But anyways, you asked us,

963
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:08,460
you asked why so many pieces of
apparatus show up to a call. Uh,

964
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,510
there are a few reasons for this.
Sometimes it's manpower and my case,

965
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:15,560
we have three fire companies
consisting of six pieces of apparatus.

966
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,670
Since we volunteer, they may not be
enough volunteers in town at any one time.

967
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,640
So all three companies get banged out,
banged out,

968
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:25,310
equals called out in firefighting terms.

969
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,890
Typically at least four
pieces show up for a call.

970
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,030
This allows us to have all the
equipment we need at the scene.

971
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,170
Sometimes you just never know what you're
going to need. All right, fair enough.

972
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,070
Uh, but perhaps the best
reason this is great here,

973
01:00:39,071 --> 01:00:43,040
but perhaps the best reason
is that sometimes we are
called for what amounts to

974
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:46,490
be in the end. Absolutely
nothing. About six months ago,

975
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:51,290
my pager went off your
pager. Jesus Christ. Dude,

976
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,360
is your firetruck pulled by a couple of
horses? Who the fuck still has a picture?

977
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,480
I know he's going right back around.

978
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:02,930
Should we would special fork in nine
11 page or for firemen? All right.

979
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:06,600
I'm a moron. I get it. All right. About
six months ago, my pager went off for a,

980
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:11,620
for a working house fire at 2:00
AM I jumped awake and flew down.

981
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,960
Uh, to the firehouse. We got on the
scene, we saw no smoke or flames in,

982
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,620
uh,
in speaking with the residents,

983
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:23,570
they had just woke up and saw a reflection
in their mirror that they thought was

984
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:24,404
a fire.

985
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,860
So here's all six of our apparatus showing
up for absolutely nothing or the time

986
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:34,430
we called for the,
for lightening hit lightening,

987
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:36,530
hitting a house on a clear summer night,

988
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,950
the woman heard something and thought
it was lightening hitting her house.

989
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,150
People are fucking idiots all over.
Hope that helps.

990
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,050
And even though I am a firefighter,
you're firefighter jokes were funny. See,

991
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:52,100
there's a cool guy. He see
there, sweetheart. Even
though he's a firefighter,

992
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,640
he sees the joke. He realizes I'm just
telling jokes are right. There you go.

993
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:59,750
People how we learned something this week.
All right,

994
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,510
you want to learn something else then I'm
going to wrap up this fucking podcast.

995
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,130
I know it's really short this week,
but at WWE,

996
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,020
I don't understand what the point of me
keep babbling for fucking 50 minutes.

997
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:12,440
If G CAS won't upload,
the files are a,

998
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:15,190
here's some computer tips for the week.
Uh,

999
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,320
here's some computer tips on
web searching. All right, Bill,

1000
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:21,600
when you want to find that,
uh,

1001
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,100
that you are Google it. What?
That makes no sense. All right?

1002
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:31,101
When you Google use the plus and the
minus signs to find the shit you want to,

1003
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:34,111
this is how it works.

1004
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:39,111
If you want to search something
with a plus in front of it,

1005
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,660
then it will have to contain the word.

1006
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,200
And if you want to put a minus in front
of it that were removed the word from

1007
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:46,681
the listing.

1008
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:50,670
So basically put the plus in front
of the word that you're searching,

1009
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:55,050
that you want to find an a minus in
front of the one that you don't want.

1010
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:55,890
For example,

1011
01:02:56,010 --> 01:03:00,960
I want to see how many sites have bill
burr on it while limit while eliminating

1012
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:03,810
bill burr from, uh, from the search.

1013
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,100
So you would Google the plus sign,
plus my name bill,

1014
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,240
then the plus sign,

1015
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,920
and then you write burr
minus bill [inaudible] dot
com and the results, we'll,

1016
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:14,371
uh,

1017
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:18,680
we'll show sites that can have content
with bill burr on it and not include bill

1018
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:23,370
bird.com. Huh? Isn't that interesting.
I didn't know that shit. And he said,

1019
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:27,180
I'm listed on seven hundred thousand
seven hundred six thousand web pages,

1020
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:29,160
not including my website.

1021
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,170
706,000 websites have my name on it and
I still can't sell out the third show on

1022
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:38,840
Saturday night. What the fuck
is going on? All right. Um,

1023
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:41,550
if you find some shit out, like, uh,

1024
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,350
if you want to find some
shit out like to do to you,

1025
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,790
I can't read what you guys, right?
If you want to find some shit out,

1026
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:55,440
like to you do when you are on what?

1027
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,560
I can't even paraphrase that.

1028
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:06,050
If you want to find some shit out like
two you do now like you do when you're on

1029
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:11,640
the podcast. All right? You had
an extra word in there, dude.

1030
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:16,530
If you want to find some shit out like
you do when you're on the podcast,

1031
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:20,040
use the above option, the plus, minus, or,

1032
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,390
or use quotes.
All right?

1033
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:28,650
You wanted to find the names of
female serial killers a few weeks ago.

1034
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:33,630
Just put quotes around a phrase and it
will only show sites that contain all

1035
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:35,520
phrases. Okay, I get it. You know,

1036
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:37,680
like you guys ever go to search
something and you'll like,

1037
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:41,930
you'll just write female serial
killers and then a bunch of uh, hits.

1038
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:46,020
We'll come out and you'll have a bunch
that just say female and a bunch of that

1039
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:49,350
we'll just say cereal and other ones
just say killers or whatever. Yeah,

1040
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:53,130
I guess if you put quotes around it that
puts it all together. You know what?

1041
01:04:53,131 --> 01:04:57,540
That's very helpful. I know this part
of the, the podcast isn't that funny,

1042
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:01,410
but God dammit, we, we, you know, we
got to learn something here. All right.

1043
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:04,590
I should have got some water here. My
fucking mouth is dry as hell. All right,

1044
01:05:04,591 --> 01:05:08,430
let's wrap up the podcast here. Uh, this
is the, a serial killer topic. Bill.

1045
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,620
If you want to be a serial killer,
uh,

1046
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:13,170
and use the best weapon
you have to use ice.

1047
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,800
If you stab someone with an icicle
or beat someone to death with ice,

1048
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,990
then it melts and you have no
murder weapon or fingerprints,

1049
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:24,240
no DNA or fingerprint problems.
Oh yeah. That guy who, uh,

1050
01:05:24,241 --> 01:05:28,180
that talked about tracking you down with
the type of soil where it was located

1051
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:32,590
and the type of wood used and all
that shit is exactly that bullshit.

1052
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:37,330
They watch too many shows. CSI does
not do that shit. I know, Dude.

1053
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:39,850
We all knew he was just fucking around.
He was making fun of how,

1054
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:44,410
when you watch those shows. Um, all
right, what else did we get here?

1055
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:49,300
Question a bill. You say that you
play the drums. Um, if you could,

1056
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:53,410
uh, play the drums in any band living
or dead for one show, one night,

1057
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:54,970
only in any city in the world,

1058
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:59,590
who would you play and in what city?

1059
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,050
Fuck.
Um,

1060
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,930
Jesus Christ.
It would either be led Zeppelin.

1061
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,910
You know what's funny is I
think I would have a better,

1062
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,590
better chance faking one John Bonham does.

1063
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:19,210
Then what Phil Rudd does and ACDC foot
fill red does is so fucking difficult.

1064
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:22,960
If you play drums to just sit
there and go boom, crack, boom,

1065
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:27,880
cracked for fucking two hours straight.
Um, yeah, I think I would play,

1066
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:28,930
I would play with led Zeppelin.

1067
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,440
I do it in England at Royal
Albert Hall and a I would,

1068
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:37,120
and I would play on that, that the Ludwig,
uh, that maple drum kit that he played,

1069
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:38,710
either that or his green sparkle kit.

1070
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,100
I don't like the Vista Vista
light kit he had or the, uh,

1071
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:44,680
the stainless steel when I liked
the first two ones that he had.

1072
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:48,790
I play on either one of those and somehow
I would sound as good as can I, can I,

1073
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,780
can I have that as part of the fantasy
that I would actually sound as good as he

1074
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:55,990
would sound, you know,
that's what I would do.

1075
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,410
Um, and then I'd get fucking some
1969 croupy pussy afterwards.

1076
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:06,070
All right, next question, Bill.
Um, would you rather be respected,

1077
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,250
be respected comedian who
never makes it really big?

1078
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,970
Like so and so and so and so? I'm
not going to name the names. Uh,

1079
01:07:12,971 --> 01:07:15,790
he named two people who are
millionaires playing theaters,

1080
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,520
but I guess who can still
walk down the street, he said,

1081
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:22,600
or would you rather be a one trick
pony, like a blah, blah, blah?

1082
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:27,630
Who has written a one catchphrase to
fame and fortune and as more cash than he

1083
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:30,750
can ever spend.
I Dunno,

1084
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,760
I'd much rather be respected by
my peers without a fucking doubt.

1085
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:38,500
Without a doubt. I would, uh, you know,

1086
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,750
you can become a really big comedian
and not necessarily be super like,

1087
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,480
that's the great thing about
entertainment as you, it's easy to become,

1088
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:51,850
I can't say it's easy, but you can become
a millionaire and still not be famous.

1089
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:56,530
You know what I'm saying? And I
always use this, this example,

1090
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,660
like that Sitcom Caroline in the city,

1091
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:03,930
they actually made it to syndication and
the entire cast could walk by me on a

1092
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:08,140
walking down the street and I wouldn't
recognize any of them. So I would,

1093
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,020
you know, Dude, you're a millionaire.
How much fucking money do you need?

1094
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,930
And I also think the more I look
at these people being super,

1095
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:17,990
super famous is I just doesn't
look like a good time to me.

1096
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,290
You know,
I think I would,

1097
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,650
I want to be a millionaire
who has notoriety,

1098
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:29,570
which means maybe two, three times
a month, somebody goes a year.

1099
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:33,050
That comedian, I really like what
you do and the Yay, thanks a lot.

1100
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:36,210
Then I go back to eat my omelet.
I'd rather do that then fucking, uh,

1101
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,490
I dunno. You know, I don't,

1102
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,760
I don't ever want to fucking have to
step out of a limo with no panties on.

1103
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,653
You know what I mean?

1104
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:49,210
Just so I can maintain fame
at that fucking level when
you think that would just

1105
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,320
anything that, that would
be miserable. I mean,

1106
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:55,100
other than when you're at the fucking
Celtics game and you have court side seats

1107
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:57,740
in that moment, that's fucking
awesome. You know what I mean?

1108
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,590
I've always used this analogy,

1109
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:03,800
but it's someday at some point you're
going to have to fucking blow out a

1110
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:08,150
bathroom in public and you don't want
to be famous at that point. You know?

1111
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,170
You just want to be like, dude, you can't,

1112
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:14,690
for some fucking guy just blew.
You don't want a bill.

1113
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:16,550
Berge just blew out the bathroom.

1114
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:23,450
They literally put a fucking name to it.
It's brutal. Um, all right. Overrated.

1115
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,620
Underrated. Really quickly. Overrated
beer with the lime already in it. No joke.

1116
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:31,100
It just tastes fucking gross.
Um,

1117
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:36,530
what else do I got here? I'm sorry, this
is really fucking unraveling here. I just,

1118
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:40,040
I, I, I've done, I've done this too many
times is fucking week. I don't know.

1119
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:45,080
I lost my passion. Like if Pau
Gasol was doing a fucking podcast,

1120
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:47,270
this is what it would sound
like right now. You know,

1121
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:50,420
and I'd be thumping my chest acting like
I'm giving you entertainment right now

1122
01:09:50,421 --> 01:09:53,180
and I'm not, you know, that's what
I'm going to end with this week.

1123
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,750
What do we got here? I'm 28 minutes in.
Good. I'll keep it under 30 minutes.

1124
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,340
I'm going to end with this prediction.

1125
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:01,880
I think Orlando is going to beat the
Lakers and I think they're going to beat

1126
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:06,140
him in six games because, uh, they don't
have anybody to stop. Dwight Howard.

1127
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:10,280
And I think Turco Lou is, uh, I dunno.

1128
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:13,070
I think that guy's going to get enough
points and then they got that other guy.

1129
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:16,250
Then the number two or is he the point
guard? I don't know shit about basketball.

1130
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,390
I just fucking hate the Lakers.

1131
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:21,710
So I'm going to go out on a limb
here with no money down or nothing.

1132
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:22,910
I'm not going out on a limb.
I just,

1133
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:27,560
I just think I got a feeling I
got to fucking feeling all right.

1134
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:32,240
I think Van van Gundy's going to, ouch.
He's going to out coach Phil Jackson.

1135
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,820
Phil Jackson, he's making home
videos with his girlfriend,

1136
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:36,240
his new hot young girlfriend on the,

1137
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:40,370
on his way to the staples center every
night. They're soft, they're fucking soft.

1138
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:43,610
All they have is Colby Colby
[inaudible] the shit. I Love Colby.

1139
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:45,500
But I think his teammates
are scared of him.

1140
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:48,890
I think they're scared to fuck up around
them. They're scared to disappoint him.

1141
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,640
Uh, and they just get freaked out
and they just pass him the ball.

1142
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:56,750
That's what I think's going to happen.
Pog Saul gets the most quietest,

1143
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:01,580
15 fucking rebounds and the quietest 20
points a game. I think he's going to,

1144
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,280
he's going to take a fucking Dwight
Howard elbow to his bearded chops sometime

1145
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,260
in game two and the Orlando
is going to win game two.

1146
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,140
They get three in a row in Orlando.

1147
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:14,580
They're going to win two out of three
and then they're going to come back and

1148
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:17,280
they're going to beat the heartless
Lakers in the staple center. Game Six.

1149
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:19,830
What the fuck do you guys think
about that? Huh? You liked that one?

1150
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,140
You know, what do you guys think about
the two, three, two playoff format?

1151
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:28,020
I think it's bullshit.
I think the,

1152
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:32,940
they give the advantage to the weaker
team because the Lakers should have home

1153
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:36,410
court. Right? And I don't think
they do with a two, three,

1154
01:11:36,411 --> 01:11:39,260
two format because when it's two,
three,

1155
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:44,190
two the pressure is on the home
team for the first two games.

1156
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:46,260
Right. If it was two, two, one, one,

1157
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:49,860
one like they used to do back in the
back in the day you open the first two

1158
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:50,610
games.

1159
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:55,080
The pressure is our on our Lando
to steal one now when it's two,

1160
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:56,910
three to the pressures on the Lakers,

1161
01:11:56,911 --> 01:12:01,000
they have to win both of those
fucking games. They can't go one,

1162
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:03,940
one and then path to play three
fucking games in Orlando. Right.

1163
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:07,810
My outta my mind.
And this is this all get boring.

1164
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:10,510
Well I don't give a fuck cause
this is my third one this week.

1165
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,710
Listen to my goddamn mouth
is dry. Um, so anyways,

1166
01:12:14,711 --> 01:12:17,890
I might do another podcast this week
cause I might have a very special

1167
01:12:17,891 --> 01:12:21,400
announcement of something that I might
be doing next week that might be on

1168
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:25,940
television. How do you like that? I'm
leaving you with a little cliffhanger. Um,

1169
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:29,580
and with that I don't have any gigs until,
uh,

1170
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:34,490
the third week in July when I'm going
to be at the comedy works in Denver. Um,

1171
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:36,560
why is that?
Um,

1172
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:41,620
I booked a very small part
in a very big movie and um,

1173
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,090
I don't know, I'm shooting
like five, six days on it,

1174
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:45,840
but they had to clear out my spa,

1175
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:50,680
my schedule because they're working
around famous people schedule.

1176
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:55,460
So I'm low man. On the totem pole.
So, uh, I gladly cleared out my Spec,

1177
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,100
my schedule. So, uh,

1178
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,200
I'll let you know what the name of the
movie is and all that type of shit. Wow.

1179
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:04,250
When in fact, I know that I haven't been
cut out of it. How's that? All right.

1180
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:09,290
And that's the very short, very succinct
Monday morning podcast this week,

1181
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:13,520
the third fucking time I'm praying to
God that this thing is going to actually

1182
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:15,980
get published. All right.
You guys have a good weekend.

1183
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:20,480
Thanks everybody who came
out to the Improv a couple
of weekends ago out here in

1184
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:22,700

That's it. Take it easy.

1185
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,520
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1186
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:17,990
