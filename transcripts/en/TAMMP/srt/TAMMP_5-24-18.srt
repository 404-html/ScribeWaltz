1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,300
All right.
What's going on?

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:06,030
I got a couple of reads here before
we start the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,820
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast where I just check in on you. Um,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,320
and then I do an interview so I don't want
to interrupt the interview. All right.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,060
Um,
basically becoming Chai Lee rose.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,610
All right. Quip everybody.
The truth is, most of us,

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,210
most of us are brushing our teeth wrong,

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,480
not for long enough and forget
to change our brush on time.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,400
That's because most brands focus on
selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

10
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:40,290
brushing but not quip. So, Hey Dan,

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,710
what makes quip so different?
Men? Well, for starters,

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,750
quip is an electric toothbrush.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
That's a fraction of the cost of bulkier
brushes while still packing just the

14
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:54,600
right amount of vibrations to help
clean your teeth. Ladies, keep it clean.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,610
Quip, builts quips built in at
cheese. If the text messages here,

16
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,530
quip bill quips built in timer.
Fuck helps you clean for the dentist.

17
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:09,531
Recommended two minutes with guided
pulses that reminds you when to switch

18
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,330
sides.
Next,

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,310
gotta get one of these.
How does it remind you or at boring?

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,700
Uh, next quips subscription
plans are for your health,

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,680
not just convenience.

22
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:30,240
They deliver new brush heads on a
dentist recommended schedule every three

23
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:34,650
months for just $5, including
free shipping. Worldwide.

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,890
Quip also comes with a mount that suctions
right to your mirror and unstick to

25
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,600
use as a cover for

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,980
hygenic travel wherever you
take your teeth. Oh yeah.
You gotta cover your brush.

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,220
Jesus. And finally, everyone loves quip.

28
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,380
They were named on Oprah's O is,
I love this

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,950
named one of Time's best inventions.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,930
And is the first subscription electric
toothbrush accepted by the American

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,090
dental association,
not the United Kingdom Dental Association.

32
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,750
That's huge.

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,570
Anybody can get their recommendation
because evidently they were asleep at the

34
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:16,530
wheel, but the American
dental association plus there,

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,640
they back there.

36
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,670
They're backed by a network of over 20,000
dentists and hygienists and hundreds

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,580
of thousands of happy brushers.
Uh, use quip everyday.

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,100

48
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,540
God,
I'm stupid for small business.

49
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,390
Okay,

50
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,130
so if she for small businesses,

51
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,260
okay,

52
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,160
it's a plural business businesses.

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,660
Okay,

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,200
I started a couple of businesses. You'd
never get a second date. You got to say,

55
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,810
I'm an entrepreneur. It
gets look, sit across.

56
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,030
There was spaghetti hanging on
your mouth. Go. And I said, well,

57
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,260
what am I doing since high school,

58
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:30,840
while I started a couple
of small businesses as a,

59
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,220
they help regular people get their
businesses running and thriving with just

60
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:39,780
about everything. You need to
make an I an idea real these days.

61
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,130
That means do it yourself websites.
I can't believe it figured out.

62
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:46,560
Diy email,
social tools,

63
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:51,561
and even a business phone app for your
apple or Android may just for a small

64
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:56,190
business. It says check them
out. They'll do right by you.

65
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,220
Well, there's no links or anything
that she said. I emailed you too.

66
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,050
This is a two parter. Have you
buddy? All right, here we go.

67
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Where's the rest of this? Oh,
that's it. They'll do right
by you. Oh yeah. Go Daddy.

68
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,960
Go daddy.com go daddy.

69
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,730
You could do it buddy.

70
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,840
Um, all right, that's it. Now,

71
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,010
why don't we listen to the interview here
with the one and only Danica Patrick.

72
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,013
All

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,790
right,

74
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,790
you ready? All right.
Hey, what's going on?

75
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,290
It's Bill Byrd is time for the Thursday,
Thursday afternoon, just before Friday,

76
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,650
Monday morning podcast. And I'm just
checking in on you. Who's phone is that?

77
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,720
Is that my phone? Um, I believe it or not.

78
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:05,580
I am at the Indianapolis Motor speedway
here. And uh, what is it? Bloomington. No,

79
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,690
Indianapolis, Indiana and play
Indiana speedway, Indiana.

80
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,460
And I have a very special guest,
a lovely lady coming to the podcast,

81
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:19,170
the one and only Danica Patrick. Thanks.
What's going on? You know, just uh,

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,210
taking in the sights and sounds.
Hey,

83
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:25,710
I used to work in a dental office with
my dad by the way. Lovely dentition. Oh,

84
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,560
right out of the gate.
Fantastic.

85
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,330
I don't know why I've been doing the
Invisalign by the way, which I think is a,

86
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:36,780
uh, it's a great thing.
Kind of straightened out my
teeth down on the bottom,

87
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,900
but they make it seem like they're like,
hey you,

88
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,120
you're just going to wear it for like
three months and then you have like this

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,770
night guard thing and I'm
finding that it isn't,

90
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:47,460
you kind of have to wear these things
for the rest of the time or else you go

91
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:50,610
right back to have him like snaggle tooth.
So it's kind of annoying.

92
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,920
So they basically get you there.

93
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:56,850
Like you get so happy with your new
smile and then they lock you in because

94
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,040
they're, you're on the, well, it

95
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,530
must be your fault that your
teeth don't stay like this guests,

96
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,600
you're going to have to wear them
forever and they're going to,

97
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:06,370
and then I'm going to owe this guy money,
money, money, money. The whole time. I,

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,540
I should have known. I
screwed up. So anyways,

99
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,110
I don't think you have probably some what?
Straight teeth.

100
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,040
Oh, money. Yeah. I got a little
bit of money. I go out there,

101
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:20,630
I tell him my shit jokes or whatever.
We just went around the track in a,

102
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,590
uh, I was saying this, this, this
Camaro, the color of my pubes.

103
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,940
It was a little wimpy that it was a,
a, a, a, a convertible. They know the,

104
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:33,500
do you feel like that was slowing
you down rather put the top down.

105
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,280
It should be great. We could put
on some jewel, you know? Yeah.

106
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,020
The Sarah McLaughlin, I'm just
rolling around in the, you know,

107
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,350
40 miles an hour.

108
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,850
I've done that one of the time and I was
really nervous with the other person.

109
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,120
But you have like this steely calm
where you were cruising around.

110
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:54,640
You just sort of like, you
know, I'm trying to make my
stupid, you know, you know,

111
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,930
I'm a dancing monkey.
I'm trying to think my clown jokes.

112
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:01,931
And you're just looking
over like distracting was
riding distracting as in you

113
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:06,610
were sort of finding yourself like
feeling and seeing and anticipating and

114
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:09,200
getting nervous at any point?
Or were you just like rolling?

115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,130
Like there was a couple of times you came
close to the wall and I was feeling my

116
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,880
face getting pulled in towards the wall
that I was kind of like, all right.

117
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,320
I just kept thinking,
you know,

118
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,460
she's done this a zillion times and she
has to work on Sunday so she doesn't

119
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,360
want to wreck this thing.

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,330
And then I was of course also thinking
there's really no rollbar this is just

121
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:31,280
sort of a very feminine, very
fancy high quality seatbelts. Hey,

122
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,970
how come in Indy car? Like I noticed
this year in, in, in a Formula One,

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,420
they have that ridiculous thing that's
now it looks like it's in their,

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,680
in their line of sight.
Um,

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,060
that little halo thing that
they have going around them,

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,350
they're testing the halo, just, you
know, being exposed as dangerous. Right.

127
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,620
So right there,
you know,

128
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,370
there have been drivers killed
through things hitting them, um,

129
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,290
rash parts of the car. Yeah. You
never think that you think, oh,

130
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,870
I gotta actually the cars
have a little wicker on the

131
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,090
front of the cockpit where it opens up
right in front of the steering wheel,

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,970
obviously have to be able to
get in. Um, so it's clear,

133
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:12,380
it's like a plexiglass piece. Um,
and that's what I'm looking through.

134
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,570
Basically when I'm looking
down the front straightaway,

135
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,150
I'm looking at cars just
before I get into the corner.

136
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,120
I'd say I'm maybe look a little past
it to the, to the left when I'm,

137
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,290
when I'm getting into the corner.

138
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,650
But for the most part I'm
looking through it and that,

139
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,820
that thing gets so many like chips
and bugs and all kinds of stuff.

140
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:32,720
Like I feel like I'm, you know,
drunk by the end I'm like,

141
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,120
I can't see what's going on.

142
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,900
What's the scariest thing like accident
you've been in like that you must at

143
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:39,410
this point,
the,

144
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,230
as long as you've been doing it had like
a wheel or like I would just think of a

145
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,790
lug nut going, you know, 2000, two, one
at miles an hour coming at you. I mean,

146
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,910
that's got to be
terrifying. Um, let's see.

147
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,390
My first accident in
Indycar was really big. Um,

148
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,020
I ended up going in an ambulance to the
hospital, like, you know, full speed.

149
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,380
And I kept asking the
nurses how if it looked bad.

150
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,440
Apparently I was obsessed with the
idea of like, I'm a, I'm alive,

151
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,420
but it looked really gruesome cool.

152
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,470
And they reminded me that I
had asked them three times now.

153
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,730
And so I didn't realize that because
I was being a little forgetful.

154
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,100
Are you saying like,
did you look bad?

155
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,240
No. Did the accident look bad?
Like what's happened to the car?

156
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:26,830
Did it look like catastrophic?
Was it exciting? Was it, you know,

157
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,010
did it look like, are
you shocked? I'm here?

158
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,200
You know what I realized when I,
when I came here,

159
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:36,370
I went to this race and 95 and 96
I was telling you, and you know,

160
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:39,430
I'm not going to lie. You want to
see an accident? You want to see it.

161
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,020
You probably,
it's probably really annoying.

162
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,050
That's like somebody going to a comedy
club and wanting to see somebody bombed.

163
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,250
But,
uh,

164
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,850
what you don't realize is you think
you want it to be right in front of you

165
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,360
cause you're not thinking of the physics
that like I saw a guy hit the wall

166
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,190
right in front of me,
just really know what this tires,

167
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,530
but it's just like he
hit it there and all the,

168
00:09:56,531 --> 00:10:00,250
all the action was like immediately
a quarter mile down the track.

169
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,850
So you want it to happen like a
half mile up the track or whatever,

170
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,110
however far if you're really going to
see all the, uh, all of the action.

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,630
I feel bad saying that to you.
But I did eat.

172
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,790
I mean you want to see an amazing race.
You want to see,

173
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,690
last thing you want to see
accidents. Um, you know,

174
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:18,524
it's a,

175
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,940
that's why I used to watch
chips back in the day.

176
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,070
It wasn't for the banter
between paunch and John.

177
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:26,910
It was for like the giant pile up.
I'm probably dating myself.

178
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,260
You probably don't even
remember that show.

179
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,740
I think that show came up probably before
you were born. It is the little tool,

180
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:32,610
but I have heard of it.

181
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,210
You know what's great about that is they
always have like these freeway pileups

182
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,870
and that would go on for like a minute
and then in the end there was always the

183
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,650
guy that was somehow got air
and went over the top of it.

184
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,130
And if you listen to the sound effects,
he was still on the gas pedal,

185
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,980
which was the funnies. You'd think
you'd hit the brakes at that point

186
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,490
in the air. They, it was in the air. You
know what I had ended up learning with um,

187
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,240
stock car racing cause I
did that for seven years.

188
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,700
Was that the best thing to
do if you were about to,

189
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,310
if you were spinning out or
anything was happening was just mad.

190
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,620
It keep the wheels straight
and keep it floored.

191
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,220
Is Out mad at means.

192
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,880
Oh Matt it put it down to the foot
of down pedal to the metal. Yeah.

193
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,460
What does that like when you drive driving
that fast? Everybody's spending out,

194
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,810
all you see is smoke and you just
hope you're hitting the whole.

195
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,900
Yeah, I mean it's like poking hope, you
know, you're just hoping that they clear,

196
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,550
they clear away and the right, they're
like, you know when they, when cars crash,

197
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,060
especially stock cars and
when there's lots of them. Um,

198
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,770
cause the pileups in stock,

199
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:33,770
car racing tend to be a little bit
bigger than an Indy car racing. But he,

200
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,010
but either way,
generally the cars,

201
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,610
you don't know where they're going to
go there. Like football's bouncing,

202
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,240
you throw it and it hits
the ground. You're like God,
which toys are going to go?

203
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,300
And that's how it feels when you're like
trying to decide where to go based on

204
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:46,781
the car.

205
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:50,020
Like there was a car that crashed in
front of me and practice and it hit the

206
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,700
right outside wall on the right.

207
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:55,360
And then I wasn't sure if it was going
to cut across the track somehow right in

208
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,000
front of me. So I just kinda
waited, waited, waited, waited.

209
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:01,360
And then as soon as you
think you're clear, you just
gun it and you just get by.

210
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:05,070
I miscalculate again, if
they had you miked up, if I
heard you on TV or you just,

211
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,790
you just going fuck,

212
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,680
actually that's exactly what I'm
thinking before anything happens is fun.

213
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,300
It is. It is. Hey, so uh, what's the most,

214
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,010
I'm just jump around here as far as like,

215
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,760
I know you've probably got a lot of shit
for being a woman, you know, in this,

216
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,820
you know, this is a gas where
I was, was stock car was a,

217
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,930
I'm just picturing them being more
sexist because I'm a northerner.

218
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,420
Probably like when you showed up with,
they're like,

219
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:32,470
what are you going to do here?

220
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:35,820
Darlin you're going to ride around in
the pace car. Did you get a lot of,

221
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,870
I did get people that said to me like,

222
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,900
how are you going to handle
these big cars? You know,

223
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:45,520
and I'm like a lot easier because
they have power steering. Yeah.

224
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,970
Plus you're hot, but they're
not harder to drive physically.

225
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:52,840
They're much less physical to drive.
Was it like one of those Hollywood movies?

226
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,930
Did some guy like say a bunch of sexist
stuff to you and then you beat him and

227
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:59,190
then the end he had to walk up and be
like, [inaudible] said a bunch of sexist.

228
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,870
I would beat him. You would
in some way, maybe verbally,

229
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,490
but probably start verbally and then I
don't think it would escalate to anything

230
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,510
physical, but I would verbally abuse
them. No. Did that ever happen?

231
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,910
Maybe I don't want you to name names.
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about,

232
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:23,080
do you remember a quote? Do you
remember a quote, which was what did,

233
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,500
what did you say? Remember there
was a quote a long time back from a,

234
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,270
you've got an f one hat on.
Um,

235
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,600
Bernie Ecclestone's said that
women should be wearing like white,

236
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:35,320
like appliances and be in the
kitchen or something like that. Oh,

237
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,900
he said that I was stupid.

238
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,670
He's asking, I'm married. It's always,
I think all that stuff's funny, but,

239
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,350
but what it does,
it's drama.

240
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:50,950
Then you go out and you beat the
person and you prove them wrong. Right.

241
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,760
I don't really take it that personally.
I just don't. It's interesting.

242
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:59,320
It creates some drama on something. Talk
about, but I don't take it personally.

243
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,690
So now you're going to a,

244
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,400
and I'm really jealous about
this is you're going to retire.

245
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,920
I think that's awesome. I know. I think
it's awesome too. I'm super excited.

246
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:11,090
I'm like, you know, I there,

247
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,880
I don't know how it feels for you when
you walk out on stage or free do this

248
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:18,760
with me or I don't know how you
feel when you interview somebody,

249
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,160
but like I'm just excited
to be gone from that stress.

250
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,770
Like I, I'm excited to have, I'm excited.

251
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,630
I'm excited for less polarizing
sort of emotions of, you know,

252
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
so,
so happy and so,

253
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,680
so scared or so mad or so sad,
but you can die doing what you do.

254
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,050
Like my job is the most fun job ever.

255
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:45,050
It's just getting there because all
I think is if I retired I would be,

256
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,250
I would never go to lax ever
again and that's amazing.

257
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,260
I would never have to
connect through Heathrow,

258
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,040
which is one of the
worst experiences I ever

259
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,060
had.
I had to get off,

260
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,620
go get my bag that I checked
and then like get on a bus.

261
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,440
There was like three forms of
transportation to get to a whole,

262
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,380
the whole other side of the airport. And
I just, ever since then I was just like,

263
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,470
I'm never, why do they kiss one
of the kiss? We're standing,

264
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,080
we're right on the finish line is
these tourists, they're kissing.

265
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,980
That's the thing you do after you win
the races. Kissed the bricks. Oh you do?

266
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah, I don't, you know, everybody's
looking at it and then watch,

267
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,470
he's gonna walk across it.
You know,

268
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,840
he went to the men's room
today will autograph it too.

269
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,780
They're probably autographing it
right now. Oh, you can sign it.

270
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,930
I guess you guys just wear it off
after like three laps here. Really?

271
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,190
And they leave with the dream
that it's still there someday.

272
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,800
If you ever go to that race, you're
going to see my name right down there.

273
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,520
Um, so yeah, like uh,
she ran over my name.

274
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,890
How often do you like beat
yourself up after racist?
Oh, what'd you, I should say?

275
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,800
Okay,

276
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,230
Matt. Every one of them
for the most part. Yeah.

277
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,690
I mean you're always thinking about
what you could've done better.

278
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,010
I feel like that's the nature of a
competitive mind of someone very driven.

279
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,270
Like I'm not just

280
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,590
what's, what's the worst as far
as like as far as racing goes,

281
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,640
I would think you're leading with like
two laps to go and then somebody gets

282
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:05,100
around you,
you run out of gas.

283
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,510
Running out of gas is
not your fault really.

284
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,330
So I would say that's the lesser of them.

285
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,780
Unless they told you to say to you guy go,
when you run out of gas,

286
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:17,860
does he just leave the whole thing?
Does he immediately get fired? I mean,

287
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:22,240
I feel like I could do that
fueled and you know, pull the,

288
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,560
pull the fuel fueling hose out
too soon and didn't get it full.

289
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:29,020
Something like that.
It would be him.

290
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,760
Now if it was your engineers not putting
enough in or not take into account what

291
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:36,730
was going on and not telling you
to save more, then it was them.

292
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,480
If they told you to save fuel
and you didn't, then it was you.

293
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,870
So it could be a series of,
of um,

294
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,840
Stan, what after the race is like, it's
like, all right, there's a giant finger,

295
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,680
where are we going to point it

296
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,450
a little bit? Yeah, a little bit.
I think there's always, you know,

297
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:56,380
given the fact that the driver has the
most amount of decisions to make come

298
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:01,381
race time with passing and restarts and
nailing pitstops getting into your pit

299
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,110
box while getting out of it, you
know, all pit out, just you name it.

300
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,520
Like there's so many different things.

301
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,610
The driver has the most amount of
things that could be their fault.

302
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,700
I would say that generally before the
race it's probably a little bit more on

303
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:16,720
the team. Um, you know, preparing the
car and then of course working on it,

304
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,980
engineering it and making sure the changes
are good and I'm getting the balance

305
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:24,840
right for race day and anticipating the,
the weather conditions and you know,

306
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,390
how that will affect the car
aerodynamically. So, um, those,

307
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,570
those decisions become theirs.
But then in the race, you know,

308
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,970
the driver has a little bit
more weight on the shoulders.

309
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,330
What would you have to do and
the pit crew to get fired.

310
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,460
Um, like how many times can you screw up
so that guy short fuels, you're right.

311
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh, he probably not going to
get fired till after the race,

312
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,220
but actually that's not true. There are,
there are times where, um, pit crews,

313
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:53,490
let's say somebody falls out of the race
or sometimes there'll be the middle of

314
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:55,980
the race. I think I've seen this before
with like Jimmy Johnson or something,

315
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,390
you know, um, they'll swap pit crews in
the middle of the race and just be like,

316
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:04,700
you know what, we need your picker
of you can take ours. Really? Yeah.

317
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,370
Just switch with different
drivers, different, different guys.

318
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:11,940
Changing the tires for the four
different driver. It doesn't matter.

319
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,270
Tires or tire. Sorry. Oh, so anytime we
watch or I see somebody run out of gas,

320
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:19,620
the fuel guys fired. If it's
his fault, probably not. But um,

321
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,930
you know, it's probably a little
like baseball. Yeah. You can only,

322
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,420
you can only can give up so many home
runs before you're going to go back down

323
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:31,020
to the minors. Yeah. There's only so
many strikes you get against yourself.

324
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,900
All right, so you're, you're
going to retire after this race.

325
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,500
And then you mentioned you have a,
you have your own line of wine.

326
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,120
Is that what you say? I have my own,
uh, my own label. I'd make my own wine.

327
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,060
I make a jungle juice.
No,

328
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm a big drinker and a big drinker.
No, when I'm a couple of bottles down,

329
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:52,200
before you get out there on the track,
just take the edge off, loosen up.

330
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,870
I can't imagine, I don't even want to
take like a Tylenol before I go out,

331
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,470
let alone it seems you just going around
in that rental car. Who's kidding? Who?

332
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:04,740
Glorified rental car? We just went around
like that. That would be, you know,

333
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,950
you said you were going twice
as fast as this. Uh, you know,

334
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,270
we're going half the speed
of what I'm doing and car.

335
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,560
So it seems like it's a
pretty terrifying sport. Yeah.

336
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,120
Probably don't want to be drunk. Yeah,
I would think that. Yeah. I make wine.

337
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,710
So I bought a, I bought a
property in Napa Valley in 2009.

338
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,800
Smart and,
uh,

339
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,320
just dirt and then planted a
vineyard and it wasn't a vineyard.

340
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:32,340
You started from scratch, from scratch.
How do you figure out how to do that? Uh,

341
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:36,240
I had a lot of help from, um, who
was my friend at that point in time.

342
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,680
I'm a wine maker. He is my
wine maker. I'm now, so,

343
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,380
um, you know, I met him at a,

344
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,760
it really goes back to why I started
that falling out on the grapes enough.

345
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,400
No, no, he's still my
winemaker. It's all good.

346
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,660
I met him back in 2006 on
a vacation there and um,

347
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,860
he worked at Contessa at
that point only and uh,

348
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,960
he was, um, you know, he, he was
just having to be there that day.

349
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,460
It was during sort of
the end of crush period.

350
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:10,740
So it was November time and it was a cool,
nice, beautiful morning. And you know,

351
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,770
the valley's got a little bit
of fog in it and you know,

352
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:18,420
it's kind of pulling back down into,
towards San Francisco, into the bay. And,

353
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:18,960
you know,

354
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,580
I'm sitting there on this beautiful
grassy knoll overlooking the vineyard,

355
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,350
rose pedals leading out to
this place. Oh yeah. It's,

356
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,260
it's a, it's not going to get
real funny though, unfortunately.

357
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:32,880
It's going to get more serious.

358
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,470
[inaudible] pensive high pressure
system moving down. Yeah. So,

359
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:41,100
um, I just stood there and I
thought, man, this is just so cool.

360
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:44,640
Like how amazing would it be to
have something like this someday?

361
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,920
And that I in my mind thought

362
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,610
it was wood, most of what, $50 million.
I don't know. What do I need to do this?

363
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,570
And I thought, I don't have
that kind of money yet. And, um,

364
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,830
and then I really believe that
I was like, look, I'm, I'm,

365
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,100
I might have $50 million someday to
be able to do this. But, um, but I,

366
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:05,080
I started slow,

367
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:10,081
so went back a couple years later and
looked at some properties and Aaron Pot is

368
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:15,430
to my winemakers name. Aaron
kind of helped pick it. Yup. So

369
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,650
it's illegal, isn't it? Okay.

370
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,190
That's too many people
grow it in your state.

371
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,790
Then you have too much product and then
you can't ship it out because then it

372
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,980
becomes a federal offense once
you go across state lines.

373
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,600
Why do you know so much about this? I
don't know. I'm not really a pot smoker.

374
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,140
I'll do it occasionally. Like when I'm not
drinking I'll, I just, I just get bored.

375
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,681
I just don't,
I,

376
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:46,681
I what I like about drinking as I
feel like I earn getting buzzed.

377
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,440
We're, you know, drinking whiskey so he
got to get it down. You know what I mean?

378
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,140
Give me another one where just
like a man at the end, you're like,

379
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:57,650
I drank all that whiskey. It's not even
that. It's just like, I feel like, uh,

380
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,380
like weed smoking.

381
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,130
It's just like getting fucked up
with like training wheels on it.

382
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:04,270
It's like you don't have to
worry you just a couple of puffs.

383
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:05,590
Especially now with the stuff that,

384
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,560
I mean I don't know what the old stuff
was like cause I never tried it to like

385
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,900
my late thirties and um,
all the tests it just puts me,

386
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:16,450
they'd take two puffs and then you just
kind of like the two seconds I'm like,

387
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,480
oh is kinda cool. And then I just fall
asleep. We're booze. Um, I don't know.

388
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:25,130
A bit of a slower process. You can
kind of enjoy the growing, the,

389
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,440
the escalation of the buzz too. And I
also know where it's going. I know, okay,

390
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,510
if we controllable,
if I have three of these,

391
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,390
I know kind of where I'm going to be at,
how fast I drink them.

392
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,720
And it's not like you take one sip and
that's one. It's the whole drink. If many,

393
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:41,560
many sips of enjoyment, you can have a
whole conversation instead of patriot.

394
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,240
I love pass and then all of a
sudden you're like, wait, yeah.

395
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,770
You see and stuff now they, it's,
it's too, you just sit there.

396
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
I remember from high school basing out,
right isn't that,

397
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,310
I don't know what it's called.
I thought basically was smoking like coke.

398
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:58,390
All I know is I got a buddy of mine
and my drugs. I've never done drugs.

399
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,010
You can tell. He can tell you still
got the glow look at me. I look like,

400
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:06,640
Oh cook a curmudgeon. I got
a buddy of mine, he's like a,

401
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:11,200
he's a year older than me and he actually
kind of stopped smoking weed cause

402
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:13,540
he's just like, dude, I miss the
old stuff. You know what I mean?

403
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,430
You just sort of smoked it.
You felt alright. He goes,

404
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:17,500
now it's just like you take two hits you,
you're like tripping.

405
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,750
And I think that's just because there's
so many people grown it now and they got

406
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:26,210
to have, there's be like more intense
and stronger than the next. Yeah.

407
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,590
I don't know.

408
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,010
All I know is this just a big thing was
[inaudible] somebody needs to make the

409
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:33,700
Pinot noir of weed then you know it was
that was that is that you're a little

410
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:34,780
lighter or something.

411
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:39,781
You can sort of smoke all evening maybe
or sporadically through the evening.

412
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,080
That's smart. It's a lighter red wine.
You just sold the hell out of that to me.

413
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,070
You know what, my wife
wants to go up there. So

414
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,180
like, what's the difference
between a, a Cabernet, Cabernet,

415
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,900
Cabernet and hello? Marillo.
Well, you know, ruined Merlow.

416
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,440
Who's that guy who played pig vomit in,
uh,

417
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,830
in the Howard stern where I can
never remember people's names. Uh,

418
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,770
I don't remember if he had the same
name as the guy who ran a league.

419
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,700
I can't remember his name,
but remember he said he was in that movie.

420
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:10,900
It's like I am not drinking
Merlow sideways. Yeah. I
don't remember their names. I,

421
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,380
uh, there's Paul,
Giovanni, Giovanni. Yeah.

422
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,870
So everybody who didn't know shit about
wine like me, I was thinking like, oh,

423
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:22,270
Merlow is like this. That's like drinking,
drinking any fucking Merlo. Yeah, yeah,

424
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:24,110
yeah.
So for this time,

425
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,180
literally affected sales of Marlow and
Tina. No, I went up, peanut oil went up,

426
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,230
what is your f you like a
[inaudible] cab and make a cab.

427
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,230
And then we decided last year to
use the cab to make a Rosacea,

428
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,470
which turned out amazing. Um, we
sold out of that really fast. Um,

429
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:45,980
so luckily we're gonna be able to make
more next year than we did this year.

430
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,600
And then I have a 70 old blog coming
out as well that I purchased grapes for

431
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,170
that one. And from Knight's
Valley. So. And what is, uh,
what's the name of your won?

432
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,040
Uh, it's a Latin word. So every time I say
it for the first time, people are like,

433
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:02,470
what? Um, but it's not that hard. It's
a, the name of the wine is called Somnia,

434
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,490
which means dream in Latin.
Um,

435
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,720
because I told you about my little
dream about like having a owning,

436
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,250
of owning the quintessence.

437
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,720
Someday write something like I'd love
to have a winery and I'd love to be able

438
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,740
to do this whole experience and own it
and make it, and yeah, it was my dream.

439
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,730
And so it's a Latin word for dream.
So like insomnia or I get extreme.

440
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,880
You make can be one on my winery.

441
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,120
You can just pop by mine and you know,

442
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:31,160
we'll be happy to ship
to you whenever you like.

443
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,780
Maybe I'll just do it in my back yard.

444
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,110
I'll have a couple of bushes of grapes
and it'll just make my own wine.

445
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,420
Just podcast.

446
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,510
I got to figure out how I got to figure
out a way where I don't have to go to

447
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:44,420
the fucking airport every six days.

448
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,650
There's gotta be some kind of technology
where you can see someone somewhere

449
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:53,090
else. I know you talked to them. I
know, but you can't do that. Well,

450
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:58,091
we couldn't have written
around Indianapolis Motor
speedway at half race pace if

451
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,750
you weren't here. So if you want the
experiences and you want the connection,

452
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:05,870
I appreciate you going
the extra weight mile.

453
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,220
Then I did that and I'm horrible at
math. Power, all the extra 1200 miles.

454
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,680
There you go. Oh, from la? Yeah,
whatever. I took the red eye,

455
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,170
I took the still counts. Those miles
still count. What are these are punishing?

456
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,850
What other sports? Sleep or on a, on
a red eye. Can you sleep on airplanes?

457
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,470
Yeah, I can. I do,

458
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:28,040
but usually you want to get the
window seat so you don't get that tap,

459
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,290
like someone's got to go
up and go to the bathroom.

460
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:34,970
But I had the ILS snippy me by the
way. You got a weak bladder. I liked,

461
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:37,190
I just drink a lot of water.
Speaking of, it's a great idea.

462
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,990
You drink a lot of waterway cause
it's really good for you. Oh, okay.

463
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,760
That wasn't challenging. It was
just asking, you've got this weight.

464
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,580
I wasn't trying to pass you. I
work out a lot, so I do a lot.

465
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,950
And then you work out a lot. Is that
what you do? What else do you do? Um,

466
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,790
I sweat and race cars and uh,

467
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,520
you don't want to go just generally a
sweaty person. You're not one of those.

468
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,310
I'm not a, you don't do that. Uh, what
does that stupid thing with Crumb Yoga?

469
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,410
No, the people where they
got to run down the street.

470
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:08,190
So you know that they're working
out. What do you call that? Fitbit.

471
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,060
What do you call it?
Shit.

472
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,800
It's a new kind of working out where you
run down the street, like a garage door.

473
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,220
They have it open and they're making
all kinds of noise. And then crossfit.

474
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,370
I do that. Well, can you ask
me what are you gonna run down?

475
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,680
Run down the street. Well, because you
needed to accomplish your 400 meter run.

476
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,090
That's part of your workout,
don't you?

477
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,720
Don't you just trying to run by people
sitting down eating brunch to make them

478
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:34,300
feel guilty. Cause every time I sit
down I get a little eggs. Cheese,

479
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,310
Huh? If you had gotten done with your
workout already and we're at breakfast,

480
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,920
you'd be thinking to yourself,
I've already done that.

481
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,620
But instead you're feeling guilty.
Yeah.

482
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,110
But I would want the person to
know that as they ran by me.

483
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:47,790
It's a little self reflection moment.

484
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,850
You see somebody working out and it
reflects back to you that you're not,

485
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
I think he blamed the victim.
One of us is blaming the victim.

486
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,180
One of us is being a jerk here right now.
And I have to,

487
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,390
only thing that makes me gets me,

488
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,150
I feel guilty when I see somebody
working out thinking to myself,

489
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,960
I could do a two a day.
Right. And I do two a days as
often as I can, but I'm like,

490
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:07,120
man, I wish I had more time to
work out. What do you, uh, what is,

491
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,810
what is your workout crossfit mostly?
Um,

492
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,540
I do a cross between jumping
jacks, you know, the,

493
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,120
the way that the classes
are usually structured,

494
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:22,600
they're an hour and the beginning is
some kind of a warm up, some kind of, um,

495
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,520
just shake it out some kind of
maybe a gymnastics move. Um,

496
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,920
and there's pipe position. I already
can't do this workout. Um, uh,

497
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,510
then there's usually an
Olympic lift that you work on,

498
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,300
so deadlift cleans that we got to like
squat all the way down to put a press

499
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,640
back squat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

500
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,640
Just [inaudible] driver side.

501
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:49,110
Then there's the actual workout
part and the workout is between,

502
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,423
oh Jeez.

503
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,630
Anywhere from like five or
seven minutes to 25 minutes.

504
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,850
That's pretty much what the workouts are.
In crossfit,

505
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:59,910
they usually range around the 12 to 15.

506
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:04,200
Why would a regular person like me ever
want to put that kind of weight up over

507
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,950
my head, squatting down, blowing out
my knees and then trying to blast up.

508
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:12,951
Like what is that gonna do for me is don't
you want to kind of like take it easy

509
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:18,650
on your body? Well, I mean
[inaudible] athlete, I get, you know,

510
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:22,190
um, uh, weights and um,

511
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,820
impact on some level does actually
strengthen your bones. Who said that?

512
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:30,600
The people who make the weights because
you got to look to see where it comes

513
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,180
from because like in my lifetime,
eggs have been good for you.

514
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:37,140
Bad for you and then fruit bad for
you. Yeah. So I feel like cigarettes,

515
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:40,260
I did you watch what the health
that I watched that and I'm like,

516
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,690
I'm just going to die tomorrow. Oh yeah.
As far as everything that's in our food,

517
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,690
right. Oh God. And I told you sugar
wasn't bad in that one. They're like, no,

518
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,310
eggs are like smoking. And you
know, sugar is just fine. I'm like,

519
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:55,660
I'm so confused.
Who is putting this shit out there?

520
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,900
That's confusing me. I, that's
why you have to read both sides.

521
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,690
They were sugar is good
for you. No Way. Shooters,

522
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,610
I would've died 10 years ago. Are you
two eggs every morning? I love eggs.

523
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,703
Yeah.

524
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,400
They taste too good to be bad.
What's sent a bunch of skill too good.

525
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:13,620
When I have animal meat,
so I can't imagine how that's bad.

526
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:17,420
It's a byproduct of the sun. If it's not
made by the sun, you shouldn't eat it.

527
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:22,070
I do stand by. That sounds good to me.
I'd have to sit down and work that out.

528
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,470
Like, I mean in animals,
a byproduct of the sun,

529
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:29,450
they eat the grass that's grown by the
sun. Vegetables made by the sun. Fruits.

530
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,740
Now is your, your uh, you know by,

531
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,620
for the most part is your a or
your cheerios made by the sun.

532
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,720
I love true risk with any refined, but
I put a, I put bananas on top of it.

533
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,700
Made by the sun.
That's better.

534
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,270
That's maybe go for the whole banana
and maybe some almond butter with it.

535
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,123
Oh boy.

536
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,160
It just literally
yesterday. Oh, it's that.

537
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:58,150
I would definitely want to add to that.

538
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,570
You pasty fat,
fuck or not.

539
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,310
You are pasty but you're not,

540
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,920
you're not the other one because
I'm turning 50 next month,

541
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:10,340
so I sit at least I got, I got, uh, I
got to get myself in good shape here.

542
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,780
You look good. You look like you're in
shape, so don't, don't, don't look good.

543
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:17,240
And then you looked away when you look
good and you just sorta look down.

544
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:20,410
You don't have to look down. And
I was like, you look good. Um,

545
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,140
so I get on the airplane tomorrow with
a bunch of people headed to New York to

546
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:28,580
do media day for the Indy 500. You have
to leave here and then come back. Yeah,

547
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,220
well actually that was
Monday night. Gosh, sorry.

548
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,200
That was Monday night after practice we
went and so there's food on the airplane

549
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,970
and so we're kind of like handing
it out, you know, here, here, here,

550
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,580
those lazy bastards come out here.

551
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,710
They don't have to leave
where the Superbowl is, right.

552
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,260
Actually every driver went there.

553
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,360
There were like one or two
drivers in each location,

554
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:55,361
but up there was like 34 drivers out
in America doing media Promo Fund,

555
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,500
spread it out on TV. You
know, it's not going to leave
the state here. Right? Yeah,

556
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,400
yeah, that's true. Well, look, yeah, there
was a lot of local TV done, I'm sure. Um,

557
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,260
so anyway, uh, I get on that,

558
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:09,200
we get on the plane where Dan in the food
out and then they're handing out like

559
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:11,600
the dressings and the bread rolls
and they're like, anyone want Brad?

560
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:15,030
And I'm like, I look back
and I'm like, you know,

561
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,530
there's absolutely nothing in that.
The,

562
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:19,440
the nothing in that food that's
going to help you. There's zero.

563
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:22,470
It's like no nutrition. It's nothing.
Other drivers or, no, I told them,

564
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,110
well there was, they weren't, there
weren't any other drivers. They were just,

565
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,690
it was a few guys, few
girls on the plane. No,

566
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:31,830
it's just people from Nascar or people
from Indy car, my people, whatever.

567
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,800
So anyway, um, yeah, so anyway,

568
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,830
I told the girls that get in
their bread rolls. I was like,

569
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,430
there's nothing in that that's going
to help you. Nothing is going to,

570
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:43,760
so you were talking about coming into
your kitchen and critiquing your food and

571
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,880
whatever else this is, this is what
I would do. So anyway, I told them,

572
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,540
I went on a long diatribe
of all the things that I,

573
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,770
all my opinions and thoughts and feelings
and they didn't, and you know what?

574
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,870
They didn't eat it. They
didn't need it. There you go.

575
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,480
When we started talking
about Chia pudding in,

576
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,060
somebody had it for breakfast the next
day and they were very excited and I was

577
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:06,920
like, I'm so proud of you. Well, it's
Chia seeds mixed with some kind of a,

578
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:11,330
of a milk of sorts. So Chia seeds are the
little tiny little balls. And when they,

579
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,050
when they come in contact with the liquid,
the outs that they puff up,

580
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:19,940
almost like a chia pet, like a
chia pet. Um, but like, um, like a,

581
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,610
I'm trying to think tapioca
kind of thing where they,

582
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,080
they get like a little gel membrane around
the outside of the seed and I'm so it

583
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:31,500
becomes more like pudding or just felt
like it was on the $10,000 pyramid.

584
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,470
All these clues and it
wasn't going to guess okay.

585
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:36,620
This thing and I did it
kind of makes itself bigger.

586
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,020
She just add is it a
grain liquid and it uh,

587
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,110
it's not a grain. It's sound absolutely
discussed putting Chia seeds.

588
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,160
I hate porter.
It's just like,

589
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:54,440
it's like it was going to be something
in a quit halfway before it got there.

590
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,800
It just feels like it is kind of
boring until you put stuff with it.

591
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,490
Like fruits and you know, Granola
crunchy things. I'm a whole,

592
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,250
I'm a big fan of the, obviously my
life is filled with just dualities of,

593
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,900
you know, super stressful, super relaxed.

594
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,700
Like there's me meditating and then
there's me going 235 miles an hour. Um,

595
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,380
and then like food wise, I like sweet and
salty, combined, crunchy, creamy combined.

596
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,150
So you hate, that. Drives me
nuts. You know the, I wasn't,

597
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,210
I was telling the story of Darryl's
wouldn't want like a salted caramel ice

598
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,370
cream. What's wrong with you? No,

599
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:31,250
and I don't want like a Karmic says
who would want assaulted ice cream?

600
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:34,830
Salted caramel ice cream. Yeah,
exactly. It's just because they like you

601
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,680
because I'm going to give
them salt, salted ice cream,
salted caramel ice cream.

602
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:44,520
It's part of, it's, that's
like a generation gap thing.
Like I went in to get a, uh,

603
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,500
an ice cream the other day.

604
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,330
I was in San Francisco and it's one
of these artists in place. Oh sure.

605
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,770
Like pistachio, goat
cheese, whatever they had,

606
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:54,230
they had chocolate rose pedal
or something. I was like,

607
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,230
what happened to just
chocolate? What, what is that?

608
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,160
There's no way they put rose petals
in there. That's good. Yeah, they do.

609
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:03,410
They have a rosewater mist
and all kinds of things.

610
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:07,460
You can extract the oil from rose petals.
It's very expensive,

611
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:09,620
so I bet it was the most expensive ones.
Why did you pick it?

612
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,420
I know I ordered mint chocolate chip.

613
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,180
I could just have a mint chocolate chip
and they go, no, it's not in season.

614
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,340
It's not in season. Yeah,
you're making ice cream here.

615
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:24,110
You're killing anybody that's ever grown.
Men knows that that never dies. Oh.

616
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:24,944
So it's always,

617
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,180
we'd all creeds and I'm pretty
sure chocolate chips don't ever go.

618
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:33,500
I don't even have a season other than all
the time. So I needed you then put the,

619
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,930
your your knowledge, I mean a
little earpiece to say that to him.

620
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,100
So I just went to Walgreens and I walked

621
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,130
in and they had a pint of the mint stuff
and I just bought that and I didn't

622
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:44,580
think what killed me was I didn't want
to eat the whole pint, but now I had to,

623
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:47,400
cause I bought it, you know,
and I was telling not to waste

624
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,890
Mama, I'm with you. I don't
like to waste food either.

625
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:53,680
It was really killing me to leave
food on the airplane last night.

626
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:57,850
And I was like, maybe I'll eat the
salad. Never mind. I'll just leave it.

627
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,680
You just give it to the drug dogs
as you walk out of the airport.

628
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,530
That's what I do. Oh, I pet them. That's
what I do. They still scare the shit out.

629
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:07,550
I don't have any drugs on
me, so I'm confident and I
can go pet. I don't either.

630
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:10,890
But what if the dog's having a bad day?
What if it was to just to, it just,

631
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,270
you know, it messed up. Then all of
a sudden it starts staring at you.

632
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:17,270
Whatever the hell it does. Well, when
it's really mad at won't stare at you.

633
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,540
Have you ever raced in
Singapore? No. All right.

634
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,910
I did a Gig in Singapore and
that's where like they, you know,

635
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,320
they put people to death all the time.

636
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,310
I have never been so terrified
walking through customs.

637
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,890
Like I made sure I look through my
bag like a thousand. I don't even,

638
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:33,950
I don't even do drugs. But like you
get like the death penalty over there.

639
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,970
I think you'd be able to
get just something abroad
like where you get locked,

640
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:41,660
docked up abroad. Yeah. That made me
not want to travel. Seriously. Yeah.

641
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,150
But people kept doing dumb shit.
You get the most,

642
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,890
see what the ocean really,
um,

643
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,530
sharing my feelings. No, the
ocean. Um, let's dive deeper.

644
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,990
I would say yeah,
the ocean.

645
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,890
The ocean is my number one fear of
falling overboard and just sitting there

646
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,000
without a sharp object where I could
just stab myself in the neck before the

647
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:08,000
sharks get there and then kind of
go under and bleed out real fast.

648
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,140
Well yeah cause I was sitting
there looking at it at Hawaii.

649
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,460
Well, I mean what? I don't think it
would sting as much as a tiger shark.

650
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:18,830
Cause they come up and they take a
bite out of you to see if your edible,

651
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,790
cause they're like, what the fuck kind
of fishes that. Then they take a bite.

652
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:25,400
I don't know. It wasn't that bad. Kind of
out here in the middle of nowhere. Right.

653
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,400
I think I'll go back in for the second
and you're just sitting there and your

654
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:30,740
heads above the water. You
take three bites, you know,

655
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:33,770
if you don't want to eat something. So it
does. I can see what you're saying here.

656
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,450
Yeah. No, it's just, it's
absolutely scared of sharks.

657
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,860
I'm scared of sharks.

658
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,910
I'm scared of that aloneness
of just being out there.

659
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,820
So do you not like being alone period?

660
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,130
Like are you one of those people that
always going to have a buddy around?

661
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:53,450
I'm a total loner. I love being alone. I
like drinking alone. That's cool. Yeah,

662
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,730
no,
I actually drink

663
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,890
Glenn. You know what, I drank
alone by myself after qualifying.

664
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:04,340
I had a good qualifying weekend, you
know, come back. It's been seven years.

665
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:06,860
I qualified seventh,
like as just pretty good.

666
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,890
So I went home and everybody wanted to
go out and do and stuff and I'm like,

667
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,480
I just, you know, like, no.

668
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:15,230
And I tried to see if somebody wanted
to go and then they didn't text me back,

669
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:15,891
so I was like,
you know what?

670
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:20,100
So I sat by myself and drank a
glass of my own Somnia wine cause I,

671
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,160
and then I said to my parents afterwards,
cause I'm,

672
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,050
I'm staying at my parents' house.
So, uh, which was just funny. Um,

673
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,960
I said, uh, Hey, I, uh, I took
some of your wine. Um, but I,

674
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,010
I did one that I took one, at least that
I could replace for you. So I alone, I

675
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,490
know, I know the feeling. Sometimes
it's just relaxing. It's nice.

676
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,740
It gets a little weird when
you go to the second glass.

677
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm not going to lie to you.
Yeah. You're kind of like, wait,

678
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:48,460
what am I doing this for?
You start feeling like you're
in barfly. Um, my buddy,

679
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,610
uh, de Rosa was telling me that he
goes, I love drinking a lot. He made he,

680
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,550
Joe Rosa made it. Okay. So
if he's listening and I want
to thank him, but uh, oh,

681
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,170
getting back to my diet, I
didn't, I didn't get to tell
you this guy, Dean del Rey,

682
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,800
uh, you should have seen him
like maybe three years ago.

683
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,090
He looked like he had been like
the stereotypical, like a cop.

684
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,650
That's what he looked like he'd been,
you know,

685
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,390
just sitting in a cruiser eating bad food,
Tacos and donuts and all of that.

686
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,070
And uh,
he got diagnosed.

687
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,610
Is having like the diabetes that you
can get rid of whatever type that is.

688
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,700
And he just had one. Yeah.
He went on like this.

689
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,130
He actually listened to the doctor.
He read up on nutrition and a,

690
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,490
he lost all of this weight.
He doesn't even look like the same person.

691
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:33,510
He went from like almost 200 pounds
and he's a little shorter than my,

692
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,280
I am a one was five 10 sometimes I lie,

693
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,650
I lie on my driver's license because
I'm five, nine and three quarters.

694
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:39,970
I've got to bump it
up. Right. That's okay.

695
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,090
I'm five one and a half and I'd write
that if I could. Yeah. What do you,

696
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,460
what are you saying? Any driver's
license? I five one I think

697
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,410
I'd rather be if I'm going to be short
and I love it real short. Go ahead.

698
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,990
Alright. I'll say fun. He looks
better. He lost a bunch of weight.

699
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,290
He looks amazing and then now he's
done a bunch of us comics on the Diet,

700
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,140
so what?
Every morning I basically,

701
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:02,920
I'll have like steel cut oats
and then a couple eggs over easy,

702
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:04,240
whichever Denley you're going to kill me.

703
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,570
Then in between I'll have
like a is z Keel toast,

704
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,060
which is the devil is the way it tastes.

705
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:14,560
But you just put almond butter and that's
all right. And then uh, then Keenan,

706
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,950
Keenan was the Shit Ma and I say keen
wa I was to say nuclear Kikino Ah,

707
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,570
I say all the grains.
It has a lot of protein and fiber in it.

708
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,270
It's actually a seat.
It's not a grain.

709
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,950
You want to five bucks cause I brought
it up. Let's look it up. What do you say?

710
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:34,360
Look it. Look it up. Tell me,

711
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,840
I want to know because I
think it's a seed in my diet.

712
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,680
I am missing everything
has been been free.

713
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:46,570
And so if this turns out to be a
seed and not a grain, I don't know,

714
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:51,090
even though it's called the
mother of grains. Oh it is.

715
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,900
Listen, once your podcast, once a podcast,

716
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,460
I make a complete ass of myself and I
think that this is going to be okay.

717
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,170
Well we got like six people in here.

718
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,230
They can probably look up whether
or not keen was a grain or a seed.

719
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,540
What's the verdict?
It's a seed.

720
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,560
Bam Patrick.

721
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,160
I'll check Dan and crisp singles.
I swear to God,

722
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,800
somebody give me some milk here that
I can drink for that victory. Um,

723
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,740
look at that. No Way.
I just blew your mind.

724
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,410
I wish you guys could see the look
on her face right now. I love it.

725
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,830
I need to see. I love it. What the
hell? Hey, the proof's in the pudding.

726
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,220
That's a callback sweetheart was
cedar grain keen. Wa is a seed

727
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,900
that harvested from the species
of a plant called goosefoot.

728
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:42,690
He'd a part of a part of a group of pseudo
cereals making it neither our grain,

729
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,420
neither a serial nor grain and
closely related to spinach and beets.

730
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:54,650
Then to cereals or grains.
Holy Shit. That's it.

731
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,170
I'm going to have, I'm going to have mind
blown back on the train. I mean, look,

732
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,600
I think you need a glass of
wine right now. Oh my God. I do.

733
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:07,490
I need a glass of wine and some, you
know, the peanut and a war of marijuana.

734
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,520
Apparently. I gotta be honest
with you. I think this is,

735
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,760
I've been doing this podcast for uh,
coming up on 11 years.

736
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,340
I think this is the first time
anybody's ever learned anything.

737
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,850
This is like a legendary moment.

738
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,050
I know you have one before this airs.

739
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,870
Can you like lay in some triumphant
music in the background and there's no

740
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:30,170
production quality. But this
is all this says, well listen,

741
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,580
I know you have to get back to racing.

742
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,500
I cannot even begin to tell you what
an as far as like a fan of racing it.

743
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,740
Like what a thrill that was.

744
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,620
Every time we went down the straight away
and I saw whatever you call that thing

745
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,070
where they show the leaders and all
that. The tree there. I mean this is a,

746
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,020
it's incredible.
Thank you so much for doing that.

747
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,370
I'm definitely going to get
some of your wine. Can people,

748
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,390
you've got a website where they
can order it. Somnia wine.com.

749
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:55,460
You got to spell it for my listeners.
So em and I u M it's phonetic.

750
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:59,630
It's just a weird word. Some neat. Um,
he really didn't spell it for them.

751
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:05,120
On the front of the bottle, on the front
of the bottle there is the, the, the,

752
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:09,800
the breakdown like syllable by syllable
is underneath the words so that people

753
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:13,070
can, can find out some to get, I'm going
to definitely going to get some of that.

754
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,550
And what should I go with? What do
you think? Get the peanuts cab? No,

755
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't make it. I don't really
like Fino actually. Okay.

756
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,800
I'll get the Rosedale cause I love
a rosy in the, no bonk, you know,

757
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,980
wrapped round it all off.
You've got, you know, summer,

758
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,130
Spring and fall and winter covered.

759
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,170
I'll drink them all by myself in my hotel
room tonight. All right. Danica Patrick,

760
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:40,730
everybody, uh, about to retire driving
her last race. I'm so happy for you.

761
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,930
You know that you, you're, you're doing
what you want to do. Yeah. That's awesome.

762
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,720
I got relaxed listening
to your retirement plan,

763
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,010
hosting the SBS and I'm hosting the SBS
told me all the keys to the kingdom for

764
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:55,020
that one. Yeah. Having
never hosted in award shows.

765
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,710
You said make sure you drink
before you go out there,

766
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,060
but the camera for yourself
take a shot at James. So if I,

767
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:07,061
if I fall or if I just completely
lose my train of thought.

768
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,960
Um, basically if I end up saying boom,
goes the dynamite, it's because I'm drunk.

769
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,980
There you go. Just relax,
smile. Have a good time.

770
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,150
Make Fun of yourself. If a joke bombs,
make fun of the fact that it bombed.

771
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:23,000
Just be, be in the mall. You're going
to be great. You're going to be great.

772
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,200
And at some point I hope, ah, me
and my wife can get up. What does,

773
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:28,700
what does the name of the wine?
I'm a booze guy.

774
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,150
Somnia Napa Valley.

775
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,230
That's where the wine is. Everybody. All
right, thanks for listening to podcast.

776
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:37,621
Hang in there.

777
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:40,530
We've got a little love a little music
here and then we'll have a half hour of

778
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:42,990
greatest hits from the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

779
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:45,400
Monday morning podcast earlier my life.

780
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,620
So anyways,
I go,

781
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,800
I go to the airport and I'm taking
the red eye, taking this 10 55 flight.

782
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:11,580
No one fucking stop. Cause
that's how I do it. All right,

783
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,880
I'm on a good plane.

784
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,600
Why would I want to get off it and switch
and roll the dice and get on another

785
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:20,920
one? You know, let's
just fucking get there.

786
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,430
When it, when I drive up to San Francisco,
I don't pull over and fucking, uh,

787
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,070
Burbank and then get hit new, another
cup. We get it bill. All right.

788
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,840
Okay.

789
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,140
So I get on the fucking
plane, right? I use my miles,

790
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:37,840
bumped myself up like a fancy
person. You know, maybe,

791
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,700
maybe I invented the cheesecake factory.

792
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:42,340
People are thinking and then they
see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no,

793
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,380
he didn't vent that cheese cake factory.
Um,

794
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,250
and I go to go to sit down in my
seat and I go to set my bag down.

795
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,640
I was going to set it
down right in front of me.

796
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:54,050
And the nice fellow sit next to me,
he goes,

797
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,370
why don't you stick it in
the middle of this room?

798
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,350
And he moved his bag out of
the way. I'm like, all right,

799
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:58,850
this guy's a solid dude or whatever.

800
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,750
And then all of a sudden the waitress
comes by a stewardess, whatever.

801
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,710
She comes by, flight attendant, whatever
the fuck you supposed to call him,

802
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:11,690
she comes up and she, uh, could I get you
juggling to Drake? And I was like, yeah,

803
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,700
can I get out? Let me get a water please.
I said, no, ice what? However you make it,

804
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,000
stop acting like it's a fucking
Martini. It's war, right?

805
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:24,780
Just give me a water
with ice. Thank you. Um,

806
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,380
and the, the guy next to me, he orders
it doers. Neat. No, I, no nothing.

807
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:36,060
Just put it in there. So they bring our
drinks. All right. And I'm really thirsty.

808
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,240
So I start sucking mine down
and he just throws his back.

809
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,100
Like it's nothing like fucking John Wayne
right before he's going to turn around

810
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,660
and beat up three guys, three
mustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right?

811
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,180
So, um, I'm just sitting there and
everybody's getting on the flight and now,

812
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,510
and I'm looking around at the passengers,
you know,

813
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,840
fucking doing whatever I'm doing.
And all of a sudden the guy next to me,

814
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,170
Mr doers goes to me. Uh, he
goes, excuse me? He goes,

815
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,210
are you afraid to fly? And I
looked at it, I was like, why?

816
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,290
He goes, are you afraid
to fly? And I go, no,

817
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,660
no, I'm not. And he goes, because all
right, but you know, it's, he goes,

818
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:23,290
it's okay. It's okay to tell
me if you're afraid to fly.

819
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,220
And it's immediately getting weird. And
I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

820
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,520
And then I'm thinking in my
head, wait, is he afraid to fly?

821
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,580
And that's why he's drinking
the way he just drank.

822
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,210
And now he's hoping that I'm going
to be afraid to fly. So he, you know,

823
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,530
he just wants to open up. That's what
I'm thinking. And I get, I'm like, yeah,

824
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:46,760
no,
I'm not afraid to fly.

825
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,770
Yeah.

826
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:51,860
And he won't leave it alone. He goes, all
right, cause you know, you're, you're,

827
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,760
you're fidgeting,
you're looking around at other passengers.

828
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:57,160
Okay.

829
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,690
And I'm sitting there looking at it like,
is this guy fucking serious? And I go,

830
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,590
no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly.
So now I'm like, fuck this guy.

831
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,930
I'm not talking this guy for the rest
of the flight. This guy's weird man.

832
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,760
It's like a 30.
Just get paint a picture.

833
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:14,140
He's like 32 year old winery in shape,
but like,

834
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:18,940
why are we white dude, he's got a
skully cap on with fucking glasses.

835
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,630
Um,
you know,

836
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,053
and uh,

837
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:26,850
okay.

838
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:27,820
He goes,
uh,

839
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,350
like there's like a minute of silence
and people still getting on the plane and

840
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:33,990
then he goes, hey, sorry
about that. So we, we just,

841
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:38,160
we just got off on the wrong foot. He's
like, my name's So-and-so. He goes,

842
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:42,870
what's your name? And then I'm thinking
in my head like, what's my name?

843
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,010
My name is frank.

844
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,820
I wanted to give him like a by just
some reason I just wanted it's bill.

845
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,100
And he goes, oh, hey bill
Nico's nice to meet you.

846
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:54,750
So we shake hands and I'm just looking at,
I don't have any poker face.

847
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:56,910
I'm looking at the guy like,
what the fuck is your problem?

848
00:48:56,911 --> 00:48:59,880
I'm not even trying to not,
I'm not trying to be pleasant.

849
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:04,140
I'm already done with this guy. So then
the guy goes, oh, hey bill. He goes,

850
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,750
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?
Right?

851
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:08,760
Like he's fucking interrogating me and I,

852
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,200
okay.

853
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,210
I'm like,
is this going to fucking serious?

854
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,780
And I start doing the
math in my head going,

855
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:17,760
when is this guy like an air marshal or
something? And I'm like, no he's not.

856
00:49:17,761 --> 00:49:21,060
He's fucking slamming bows over here.
Fuck this guy.

857
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,180
So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I
don't have to answer your questions.

858
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,590
That's it. And I just look
straight forward. He goes, okay,

859
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,910
now I'm concerned. Okay, I am
concerned and I'm looking at,

860
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:43,110
I'm like concerned about what he
goes, you're fidgeting your, you,

861
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:45,960
you have issues with other
passengers and blah blah blah blah.

862
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:49,170
He's such a Peyton like, like, dislike.
He's been, I don't know what the fuck,

863
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:53,910
like psychologically breaking me down.
All right, so now at this, by this point,

864
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:58,911
they've closed the fucking the door to
the fuselage and we're starting to taxi.

865
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,650
And I just finally look
at the guy and I go,

866
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,500
yeah,

867
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,050
I go, you know, I came up
with the five one point.

868
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,860
I literally stick my hand out cause he
kept saying I was nervous and I stick my

869
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:18,230
hand right in front of his
face and I hold it level. Oh,

870
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:22,060
that's what I did the first time. Yeah.
I hold it level. I go, I'm not nervous.

871
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,600
And he goes, well, anybody can do that.
And that's when I was like, fuck this guy.

872
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:29,240
I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry, the
story up. Then Denny Denny came back,

873
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:33,440
got my name. Now he's going, why are
you going to Indianapolis? And I find,

874
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:38,300
look at them. I say, listen pal, I'm
drinking waters. You're drinking doers.

875
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,560
Okay, there's no issue over here.
And then he goes, it wasn't doers.

876
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:46,130
What she gave me wasn't doers really.
What was it? Some sort of spy juice.

877
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,650
You fucking jerk off this point.

878
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:53,450
I want to punch him right through his
fucking stupid wirey glasses. Right?

879
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,220
So he's going like you
looking around hostels.

880
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,620
And I said something that just ticked
him off. I was just sad, dude. I go,

881
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:04,100
I don't have to answer your questions. All
right, leave me alone. And then he goes,

882
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:06,350
uh, he goes to egos. He
starts going like, okay,

883
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:10,100
now I am really concerned right now. He
goes, why are you going to Indianapolis?

884
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,690
And I just look at him, you
know, when I stopped doing,

885
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,970
I start doing like this Ryan Gosling,

886
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,470
you know that little smirk that fucking
Mona Lisa smile he has is he smirks his

887
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:22,250
way through all this fucking movies.
I do go. I go full on Ryan Gosling.

888
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,390
Now I'm not talking to this guy and I
just keep looking at him and I give him

889
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:30,110
that little half a smirk and I
just shake my head. That's my game.

890
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:32,230
Now this is Mike.

891
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,570
It's like if you're going to be a Dick
Right now with your fucking delusional

892
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:37,910
authority, right? That
you're going to say like,

893
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,420
we're in fucking Guantanamo and
you're going to waterboard me. Ah,

894
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,510
there's no water, there's
no board. Go Fuck Yourself.

895
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,870
Here's my smart and I'm just going to
shake my head at you like you're a fucking

896
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:51,650
pathetic human being. This is what I'm
doing, right? And this is the funny thing.

897
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,680
I'm such a Dick. All they have to
say to the guys, I'm a comedian,

898
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,250
I'm going to do a sold out show there
and that would make them back off,

899
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,060
but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this
guy. I want to see where this is going.

900
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,990
So now he's all fucking amped up
and he starts droppingF , you know,

901
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,350
you see saying the f word, he's sitting
there going, if you don't, he goes,

902
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,230
if you don't fucking answer my question
right fucking now I'm going to hit that

903
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:15,110
call button was sitting in a taxi
and down the fucking getting in line,

904
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,560
I'm going to fucking hit
this fucking button if you
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

905
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,060
And I'm just fucking
Mona Lisa smile smirking,

906
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,530
just shaking my head like you
are a fucking retard, right?

907
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,230
So now he sees saying the f word so much.

908
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,370
The lay who sitting in front
of me diagonally in front,
right in front of him,

909
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:35,330
turns around and looks at us and
now my heart's racing. I'm like,

910
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:37,910
where's this going?
This is going to be great.

911
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,830
I am a hundred percent fucking innocent.

912
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,860
This guy's drunk and I think
he's going to hit that button

913
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,240
and he's going to hit that button.
What's going to happen, right?

914
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,900
I want to see what the pilot looks like.
Let's see where the fuck this is going,

915
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,700
right? So he goes, if you fuck you,

916
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,160
he starts me such bringing
his hand up to the button. Go,

917
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,650
I'm going to hit that button.
You don't have to go fucking do it.

918
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,470
I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there
smirking, and I'm thinking in my head,

919
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:02,960
go ahead and hit the fucking button.
Let's see what happens.

920
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,850
Let's see what happens, right? So finally,

921
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,940
now he wants to hit the button
and he can't fucking find it,

922
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,540
and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't
find it either. I was looking up there,

923
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:14,030
I half wanted to hit it myself.
Then he finally,

924
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:18,680
he finally finds it and he hits it right?
And now I'm just like,

925
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:22,900
Holy Shit. What's going to happen? And
he's sitting there going, yeah, Huh?

926
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,500
You want to fucking play this game and
you want to fucking play this game.

927
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,090
And I'm surprised.

928
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:31,080
I mean it took like fucking like 30
seconds before a flight attendant,

929
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,250
the one who gave him the booze,
which evidently wasn't booze comes over.

930
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,970
And at this point we're like doing
that shit where we're behind the plane,

931
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,350
we're almost ready to take off,

932
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,080
like we're pulling up and
then stop and pull it up.

933
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,330
Then stopping as planes are
taken off. So she goes, yeah,

934
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:47,160
what's the problem over
here? And he goes, ah,

935
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,220
I'm not comfortable to fly with
this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting,

936
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,020
he's looking around at
other fucking people.

937
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,700
Blahblahblahblahblah he's
doing all this thing right.

938
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:57,180
And then the stewardess looks at me and
I'm just sitting there fucking my little

939
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,990
smart, just shaking my head that just
looking at just shaking my head. Like,

940
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,320
this guy's out of his fucking mind.
I don't say a word.

941
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,500
And this guy goes on and on and on about
his fucking psycho babble about having

942
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,630
this security risk.

943
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,550
So she goes to, so she goes, okay. Um,

944
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,470
any other passengers?
Have you noticed anything?

945
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:21,360
She talks to anybody first class,
this

946
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,160
is there. Anybody notice
anything odd about this guy?

947
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,040
And The lady who was sitting
right in front of the dude,

948
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:36,090
Dagley's from me turns around. She goes,
yeah, I've been listening to this guy,

949
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,400
bright berating this other passenger.

950
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:43,110
She's on my side and I haven't said
a fucking word. This is a great,

951
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,990
and I'm just sitting there smirking.
Then they'll let it,

952
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,380
it sucks for me and I shrug my shoulders
like, I don't know what to tell you.

953
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,900
So finally she said, sir,
do you have anything to add
to this? I just said, look,

954
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,880
I'm just a guy trying to go to
Indianapolis. This guy over here,

955
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:03,180
he starts slamming his doors. I kind of
felt like a rat when I said that. I go,

956
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:06,180
he's slamming his doors. Next thing you
know he's dropping the f bomb to me.

957
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,840
Then I'm thinking, oh fuck.
I just said bomb, right.

958
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,620
Fortunately nothing happens.
So now another fucking,

959
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,310
the male stewardess comes over right
now. He's going like, what's going on?

960
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,300
And the captain of the fucking,
now at this point, we've
pulled over in the plane,

961
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:26,301
has stopped 250 people trying to get to
Indianapolis and jerk off over here who

962
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:32,130
can't hold his fucking alcohol, who
just watched a person of interest every,

963
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:36,480
every August. Evidently I have no
fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped,

964
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,460
is fucking jerk off,

965
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,900
has stopped the plane
interrogating a Goddamn comedian.

966
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,920
Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and
like he works for the CIA, right?

967
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,600
So now we're just sitting there

968
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,720
and the captain is up front in the plane,

969
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,770
like saying to the storage
is going basically relaying,

970
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:00,660
do I really have to
fucking come back there?

971
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,050
This is the last flight of the night.
Is there really a God damn problem?

972
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,370
And that was the vibe. And they finally
said to the doe, sit next to me,

973
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,410
are you going to be okay to fly with him?

974
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,680
And at that point it appeased his fucking
ego that he was somehow in control.

975
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:20,700
And he goes like, you know what? Okay,
it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine.

976
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,190
It'll be fine. So they go, okay,

977
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,790
so now the plane's going
again and now what?

978
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,430
Now we fucking come around and
he's sitting there fucking,

979
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:34,210
he's in my ear and at this point I am lat,
like to fucking laugh.

980
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:38,020
He had me doing the podcast. That's what
I'm doing. And he's sitting there going,

981
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:41,310
I, he goes, you know what? I'm glad.
I'm glad you, I hope you fucking do.

982
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,700
I hope you fucking try something.

983
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:44,560
I'll be fucking try
something one more up there.

984
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:45,940
I really hope you fucking try something.

985
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,290
And I'm just fucking like gut
and laughing. Shake him at like,

986
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:53,650
what are you going to fucking do to me?
What are you gonna do to me?

987
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,460
How are you gonna Punch me in the face?
You fucking wire jackass.

988
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:02,620
You get fucking glasses on.
You know that's a federal offense.

989
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,800
You're going to go to jail if you do that
or something. I don't know what, right.

990
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,610
So I'm just in a fucking laughing
at the guy going, I actually,

991
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:14,170
at one point I put my fucking little
eye pillow thing on. Do you know like

992
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:18,370
going to sleep? Oh, I had that out too.
When the stewardess was talking to me,

993
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,860
I was like,
putting it on is this total mind fuck.

994
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,880
Like I don't know what this guy is.
I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis.

995
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,430
I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got,

996
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,690
I got my fucking thing on, right as
he's sitting there threatening me,

997
00:57:31,691 --> 00:57:34,090
just I was going with total passive
aggressive. It's like, dude,

998
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,340
I'm so not concerned with
you. I'm literally putting
a blindfold on. All right,

999
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:44,430
so this fucking guy, he
starts going, he goes,

1000
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:47,090
hey. He goes, you think you
fucking one this, you do, you
fucking won this. He goes,

1001
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:49,430
my, you know, my dad is my
dad. He started seeing his dad,

1002
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:53,180
some major CEO in Indianapolis. Doesn't
sound like a fucking made up story.

1003
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:56,110
I swear to God, this is all true.
He Goes, Mike, my dad is some,

1004
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,200
a major CEO in Indianapolis and
I will have you fucking arrested.

1005
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,670
And The lady turns around again,

1006
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,880
how have you fucking arrested the second
we get on the ground? I'm thinking like,

1007
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,570
for what? For what? Sitting here,

1008
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,650
you fucking loser. Learn how to
hold your alcohol. All right?

1009
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:16,550
And he starts describing the view. Then
I'm going to have, when I go to jail,

1010
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:19,700
like some fucking law and order
episode. Oh, you're going to love it.

1011
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,670
You'll be able to see Lucas
oil field and by by the bar.

1012
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,840
And I'm just sitting there cracking up
laughing and then there's this pause,

1013
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:31,610
right? And I'm thinking finally he finally
shut the fuck up. It's like a three,

1014
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:34,700
four minute pause. He finally just gave
up because I wasn't giving them anything.

1015
00:58:34,701 --> 00:58:38,390
I was just laughing and shaking my head.
I was being a dick to him.

1016
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:39,860
I was cause I was enjoying it.

1017
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,800
And then there was like a three minute
pause and then all of a sudden he just

1018
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:46,470
goes,
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

1019
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,200
So we're like 20 minutes into the flight
and am I going to be honest, he's,

1020
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:02,201
my adrenaline was so going during all
of that because I knew I didn't do

1021
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,261
anything wrong,

1022
00:59:03,261 --> 00:59:07,040
but I thought we were literally going to
go back and it was going to be fucking

1023
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,870
cops there. And if like, if, if, if,

1024
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:14,290
if the fucking stewardess or the pilot
asked me who I am and where I'm going,

1025
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:19,940
I'm going to tell them I respect your
authority. You're just some Jay, I don't,

1026
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:24,350
you don't have any authority.
I don't have to answer your questions.

1027
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,780
It was pro was one of the most

1028
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,690
fun experiences I've ever
had with another human being.

1029
00:59:31,691 --> 00:59:35,170
Like when somebody thinks that they
have power and you know, they don't,

1030
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,920
and all they can do is try just keep
bluffing and raising their voice and start

1031
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:43,970
cursing at you.
And if you just start laughing at them,

1032
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:48,650
the look on their face
is fucking priceless. So

1033
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:53,780
the last thing he said, he said, why are
you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right?

1034
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:57,920
And I fucking started howling,
just fucking holding my stomach,

1035
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:58,910
shaking my head

1036
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,410
and with my fucking eye
pillow thing on right.

1037
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,870
And I know I'm going to get a ton of
shit that I wear one of those eye,

1038
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,230
they're fucking underrated.

1039
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:12,590
Get the one at Brookstone where it's
literally a pillow. I'm telling you,

1040
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,980
you could fall asleep 12 noon
facing the sun. It's awesome.

1041
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,490
So anyways, like after he asked me
what, what, you know where you're going,

1042
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,510
Bill,
you like there was like a 10 minute,

1043
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:28,370
like probably 10 minutes had gone by and
I can't fucking sleep because it's so

1044
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:31,640
fun. And to me I can't wait to
tell the story. Every comic I know,

1045
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,170
I can't wait to try it on stage to
see if it's funny or whatever. Uh,

1046
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,530
so finally I just like fuck it.
Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I

1047
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,170
yeah,

1048
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,780
bring up my eye pillow and I like,

1049
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:46,900
I got to look at the guy cause I know
he's fucking staring at me waiting for me

1050
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:49,720
to do something right.
So I lifted it up,

1051
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:54,100
I get my fucking Mona Lisa smile going
and I look over at the guy and dude,

1052
01:00:54,101 --> 01:00:56,140
he is fucking passed out.

1053
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,640
He looked like he got shot.

1054
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:07,010
He was sitting there like his head was
just hanging straight down and anytime

1055
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:08,540
the plane move like his head was,

1056
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:13,130
I mean he got knocked out for
the rest of the fucking flight.

1057
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:19,010
All fucking uh, what's Matt
Damon's character? Jack Ryan.

1058
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:22,340
Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here is just,
you know,

1059
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,440
the sky marshal the fucking booze bag
and God knows what else he was on.

1060
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:32,120
He was just completely out passed out
for the rest of the fucking flight.

1061
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,770
And this is what I want you to dick. I am.
I was having so much fun with this guy.

1062
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:38,240
I start,
I can't sleep.

1063
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:44,230
So I start slamming waters because I want
to have to get up and take a piss just

1064
01:01:44,751 --> 01:01:48,710
to see if this guy's going to freak out
because this security risk is getting up

1065
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,120
and there's,
the joke was on me,

1066
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:54,170
he never regained consciousness and
then I really had to take a Piss,

1067
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:55,760
but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

1068
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:59,330
I was holding it because I wanted to
make sure he was awake when I got up

1069
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,200
because I was going to give them a little
smirk and then I was going to get up,

1070
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,970
see, hit the call button
again. Um, but he did,

1071
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,930
he didn't wake up till
we hit the ground and um,

1072
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,560
and it's funny. Then he woke up
and it was like four hours later.

1073
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:18,560
So now he had kind of slip off
whatever the fuck this guy was on.

1074
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,060
And I'm sitting there smart and wait
for the guy who started talking him,

1075
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,470
he won't look at me and I,

1076
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,860
and I think at that point
he kind of fucking realize
that maybe he got a little,

1077
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:31,830
uh,
a little extra little too patriotic.

1078
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,160
So we stop,

1079
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,130
we stopped at the gate and
everything and we're going to get up.

1080
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:39,450
So I grabbed my shit.

1081
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,410
I get up and I'm just kinda looking
at him and he won't look at me.

1082
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:47,940
And then the lady who was sitting in front
of me had this big smile on her face.

1083
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:50,760
She goes, hi. She goes, how you doing?
I don't want good. I go that. I go,

1084
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:52,860
that was an interesting one.
And I said it really loud.

1085
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:56,820
So the guy heard and he
didn't say anything and to,

1086
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,830
this is what he did to try to save face.

1087
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,910
His pillow was kind of stuck behind this
kind of stuck behind his shoulder and

1088
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:06,480
like a weird place. So he was
frustrated with it. So he,

1089
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:10,080
he ripped it out from behind him and
kind of threw it down on the floor when

1090
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,620
he tried to do some caveman grunt
to try to still have some sort of a,

1091
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,500
I don't know what. So, so that was
my flight to Indianapolis people.

1092
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:27,480
Um, you know what, how, how far
into the fucking clock has diary?

1093
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:29,670
That was a long thing.
It was a long fucking story here.
