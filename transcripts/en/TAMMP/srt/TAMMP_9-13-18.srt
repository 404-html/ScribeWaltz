1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,050
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Barn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:07,600
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast, and I

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,250
just checking in on you.
Just checking in to see how you're doing,

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,260
man. Shit, by the way, I'm

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,980
also checking in specifically if
they can fucking still hear me.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,720
Anybody who stuck around in
North Carolina, Virginia,
wherever else. The Carolinas,

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,420
the CACA.
Lackeys.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,350
Okay,

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,580
I fucking going anywhere. God Damn and
I got a fucking fast boat. All right.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,380
Oh,
that turn.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,300
I took the fucking camper off
the back of my camp or special.

12
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:46,240
I welded it to my fucking bass boat.
I am good to go. I'm like, yeah,

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,720
to see a fucking gate or
come along my way. All right.

14
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:53,260
I'll have a feast and a new pair
of fucking shoes, water moccasin.

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,310
I'll make you into a fucking
belt. Bring it on, Mother Nature.

16
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,240
You fucking bitch.
That's what a lot of people,

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,320
that's what a lot of people think.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,560
People who are not leaving despite all
of the warnings are thinking that's what

19
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,330
they think is going on.
Right?

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,620
Okay.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,820
I'll put on a pair of fucking snow shoes
and I'll walk right across the fucking

22
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:22,780
class. Oh, they're spin. And I don't
give a shit. I drink moonshine.

23
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,840
Spinning is my natural
state mother fucker.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,631
Well,

25
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,410
nature coming over here like some sort
of fucking ex wife wanting more fucking

26
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:36,980
money. Um, a lot of people think that
that's what's going on. But uh, you know,

27
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:40,610
people don't understand that what the
bankers did in the two thousands is still

28
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,480
affecting people.

29
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:44,930
And there's a lot of people who are
still upside down in a house that's never

30
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:47,930
going to be worth more than what they,
what they owe.

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,190
The American dream is over for these
people. And when you're in that situation,

32
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:53,011
you know,
uh,

33
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:56,690
that leads to driving a piece of shit
car at least to a whole bunch of shit.

34
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,430
You don't have health
insurance and all of that.

35
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:01,730
So now he's supposed to get
into your fucking, you know,

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,200
questionable car and just drive a
state away with no fucking money.

37
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,410
You know, you got kids,
you got all of this shit.

38
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:12,260
What are you going to donate nine on the
other side? People go, Whoa, well you,

39
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,300
you know, you get, you
at least should be alive.

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,413
Okay?

41
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,780
You know what I would do now
that I'm driving, driving safe,

42
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:23,080
I would just drive to a waffle house
and I would sit in the parking lot.

43
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,740
You know what would happen?
The security guard at the waffle house,

44
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,110
there's no security.
There's no security.

45
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:33,640
They just have a fee of a bat phone
to the cops at the waffle house,

46
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,040
the waffle house. They have got to have
the most fucking altercations. Any just,

47
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,960
I mean,
it's just such a wonderful place.

48
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,870
You go in there to get this delicious,
unhealthy fucking food that just,

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,410
it's comfort food, you know?
And what happens every,

50
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:55,330
I swear to God, I don't care
who the fuck you are. Black,
white, male, female, Asian,

51
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:58,660
fucking and Ron Deck. You
go in there, you're, you're,

52
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,870
you're going to get into a fight.
You're going to see a fight.

53
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,810
You're going to have to pick up your
fucking waffles and move it out of the way

54
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,970
is somebody slams down on your table.

55
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,300
Like you're in some sort of
fucking saloon in the 18 hundreds.

56
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,890
And you're telling me these people in
North Carolina lackey are supposed to

57
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:19,350
drive to that fucking
parking lot. Well, Bill,

58
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:22,400
don't you think that's better than trying
to wait it out in a hurricane? I Dunno,

59
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,290
Dude. I've never had to do that. You know,

60
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,260
fortunately I'm not in that
financial fucking position, but um,

61
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,130
you know, I just don't understand how
these fucking back has got away with that.

62
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:34,110
Joe. I understand how they did
it and they're doing it again.

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,380
But these luxury high rise apartment
buildings that they're fucking building

64
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:40,590
everywhere.
What kind of a fucking jerk off rents?

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,320
A luxury high rise apartment building.
Okay.

66
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:46,830
Don't do that by a piece of Shit House.
Okay.

67
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,480
At least at the end of living there,

68
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,940
you can sell it and get
some of your money back.

69
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,040
You may or may not make a profit,
but I'm just saying, you know,

70
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,910
all you Instagrammers, you
know, it's really interesting
that I didn't realize, uh,

71
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,160
do you know old millennials are, everybody
is looking and let myself included.

72
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,380
You. Look at college kids,
he's fucking millennials. They,

73
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,460
they can't do anything for themselves.
They're not millennials. All right.

74
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:15,450
Millennials, the first millennials,
you know what year they were born? 1980

75
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,030
okay. To 19, I think. 95.
So millennials right now,

76
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:27,031
or 22 to 38 and I imagine this some other
uninformed shitheads like me out there

77
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,480
who are 38 years old and
talking about people who are 18,

78
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,720
calling them fucking millennials
when they are not millennials,

79
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,600
but the person is saying it is actually
a fucking millennial. All right, people.

80
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,960
Now you got to know what
generation you're talking about.

81
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,680
Like, you know what's funny,
I'm actually generation x.

82
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,730
So I was after the baby boomers
and that ended in like, I dunno,

83
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,860
63 or 64 or something like that.

84
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,940
And then generation x went up to 1979.

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,540
And what's funny is I did not, I did, I,

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,790
I don't identify as Gen x.

87
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,130
No generation next to me
was the Seattle music scene.

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,280
That's when I started fucking hearing it.
Um,

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,530
I don't think, but I didn't think
the baby boomers were like, hey man,

90
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,780
we got to get out of Vietnam,
man.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Fucking baby killer man.
Right?

92
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I feel like this should be a generation
between baby boomers and generation x.

93
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,850
You know, that generation
that like Ronnie James Dio,

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,670
you know, but you know, didn't listen
to the Mamas and the Papas. Oh,

95
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:47,671
the leads are proudly supra
and this guy is great.

96
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,510
Like that shit.
Um,

97
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,490
I like to watch your Mama Cat's dance.

98
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:57,100
She had a fucking cool little
two step she used to do. Um,

99
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,230
anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about right now. I'm just saying,

100
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:03,600
you know, uh, good luck
to all of those people.

101
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:07,830
I'm coming in next week if it's not under
fucking water. I really hope it isn't.

102
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,790
And uh,
you know,

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,130
I dunno, this is crazy.
This is just fucking crazy.

104
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,780
I know we always had hurricanes and stuff,

105
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,050
but like I just hope they're not going
to keep getting worse and the sheer

106
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,740
amount of them, um, you know,

107
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,880
there's nothing worse than watching
people lose everything. Right. Um,

108
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,920
if only there was a way to fix this.

109
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,110
Mother Nature is trying right now,

110
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,170
trying with the only the quickest swiftest
fucking solution that's literally,

111
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,380
you know, metaphorically what
she's doing right now going,

112
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:52,100
I see what the problem is. I need to
drown some of these motherfuckers.

113
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,870
I need to drown a certain amount of
them. Right. But she's going to have,

114
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,090
the scary thing is she's going to have
to do way better than what she's doing

115
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,790
right now because we
always worn everybody out,

116
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:03,950
right.

117
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,620
The storms coming in and everybody
gets the fuck out of dodge.

118
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,570
So Mother Nature has gotta be walking
around just shaking her head after every

119
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:12,940
one of these things going.
I'm telling you I don't,

120
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,370
it doesn't make any fucking sense.
She's like, Mr Pink, you know,

121
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,240
telling me we've got to fucking rat.
Okay. When those alarms going off,

122
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,780
you got 15 minutes. I'm telling you, go
to the cops. They were just there, man.

123
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,410
They were just there already.
All loaded for bear.

124
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,250
Now I know. Am I right? I'm
fucking positive. You're like,

125
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:35,760
I got to watch that movie again.
Um, yeah, Mother Nature got be.

126
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,790
We got to fucking rat in the
house. Okay. So who's, uh,

127
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,620
who's Tim Roth? Terentino's.
Mr. Brown. Like Mr Shit.

128
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,970
Mr Pink, Mister Blonde. Mr. White.

129
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,130
Mr Orange.
Yeah.

130
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:56,840
She has to find out who are Mr oranges
and her mister orange is the fucking

131
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:01,790
weather channel. You know,
she's got to come in there.

132
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,080
So you like to tell jokes are giggling
like a bunch of girls in a school yard.

133
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,380
Well,
I got a job for you.

134
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,243
MMM.

135
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,300
Anyways,

136
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,133
uh,

137
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,230
I have been working out, I've been eating
right and I got to tell you guys, uh,

138
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,330
I'm in like the fucking best shape
I've been in in years and uh,

139
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,740
it is fucking unbelievable. I know
people always told me Diet, it's,

140
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,720
it's 90% died now he five to
85% to 70% die. Dude, it's,

141
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,740
it's all diet.
It's all diet.

142
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:43,741
Because like if you can go kick the shit
out of yourself and a God damned gym,

143
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,310
jump on a fucking elliptical, you jump
on elliptical and you can for an hour

144
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,400
burns 600 calories according
to that fucking computer,

145
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:57,240
which how the fuck it knows how
much burning versus somebody else.

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,320
You know what happened? So
it's an estimate. So you,

147
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,280
you've sweat all over the fucking thing.

148
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,510
You don't wipe it off because you're a
selfish cunt. You go walking out of there,

149
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,370
right.
And then later on that night,

150
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,400
all you got to have like three and a half
for Oreo cookies and you just negated

151
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,440
that workout.
Done.

152
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,490
Okay.

153
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,910
All of that fucking work
out the window and you can,

154
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,070
you can fucking got a minute and a half.

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,390
Yeah.

156
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,350
You know what it's like,
it's like every, when we,

157
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,400
whenever we put out these seasons,
F is for family.

158
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,590
It takes us like fucking 14 months to
finish them. And then people just not,

159
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,290
not saying, you know, that's
how kids watch it. Not Saying,
I don't want you to go.

160
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,500
I'm just saying. Then they
just come back like, hey man,

161
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:44,220
like what's the next season coming out?
Same thing,

162
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,690
same thing. Um, I uh, went out and I,

163
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:51,510
I'm actually like a,

164
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I am off sugar and salt to the point
I asked my wife to go out and get some

165
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,280
almond butter and she got it.

166
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,560
And I already knew there was something
going on with that where it says you

167
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,180
didn't have to stir this shit.
And I'm like,

168
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,670
this doesn't sound like the nat just
doesn't feel like the natural shit.

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,900
So I put it in this smoothie,
two tablespoons of this
shit, and I meet, I say,

170
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,190
let's just fucking sugar in this.
And after like for like a five weeks,

171
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:17,580
I've been eating like this. Like it
literally almost made my, my fucking,

172
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,880
I made like a, like a bit into
a lemon, like Jesus Christ.

173
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,090
And I never noticed that beforehand.

174
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,090
So if you're old like me

175
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,260
and you want to regain
some of your old glory,

176
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,490
you want to drive down the street
with the areas to look back.

177
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,140
You want to put the dog down,

178
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,190
you want to tell these bitches what
time it is. Um, it's all about diet.

179
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,740
Your abs are there, man. If you didn't
have a, I don't have abs. Yes you do.

180
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:52,730
If you didn't have abs, you could
not sit up in bed. You know,

181
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,780
you couldn't even roll out of bed.

182
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:58,010
You need your obliques could not roll
out of bed to go downstairs and eat a

183
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:01,280
chocolate chip muffin or whatever other
stupid thing that you're gonna do that's

184
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:05,720
gonna make you break a blood vessel.
When you fucking sit down, you know,

185
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:08,630
let's sit down that you do. When you
get really out of shape where you, you,

186
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,310
you lose,

187
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,220
you use your leg muscles and at some
point it just becomes a free fall into the

188
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:14,054
couch.

189
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,790
You'd give yourself whiplash and your
fucking head hits the table that your wife

190
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,720
just had to have that was just a
little bit higher than the couch.

191
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:31,500
You put them up, fuck right? And
then immediately what happened? What?

192
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,320
This fucking table here I
liked, I thought, look nice.

193
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,480
And now you're in a fight,
right?

194
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,050
And now you're going to work telling your
friends that you're not getting along

195
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:45,990
with your wife and what a fucking bitch
she is in all of this type of shit.

196
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,620
And when it really comes down to is
you're just, you're not eating right,

197
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,051
you're not eating right.

198
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,790
So you literally have to do a
fall into your fucking couch.

199
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,560
You get a fucking mild
concussion on the [inaudible]

200
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,810
giant end table that she
just had just had to have it.

201
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,850
And he's like,
for what?

202
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,630
I'm loving the yet and
southern accent lately,

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,970
I kind of disguises that. It's actually
my own ignorance saying it. Oh No,

204
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:17,330
I was just doing a character.
I was just doing a character.

205
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,450
Well, they got a woman doing
play by play in the NFL.

206
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,450
Oh my God. You got a big kid
then went over these women,

207
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:32,190
they don't even Lachsport.
Oh, they do. Then what a fuck.

208
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:36,390
And there are only eight people at a
w NBA game. You explain that to me?

209
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,700
No women on the car. Well,
anti feminists aren't.

210
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,420
Why aren't these feminists out
there to fucking at the God damn,

211
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,400
uh, whatever they're
called Oklahoma Twat game.

212
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:54,861
Well,

213
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:58,580
why don't you watch an episode of the
real housewives maybe figure out that's

214
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,110
why they don't show up.
Shit.

215
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,350
Okay.

216
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,550
Maybe they're three minutes. They'd be
fucking lunging over a goddamn table.

217
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,030
They ain't give me no camera, man.
There are not enough camera man. Right.

218
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,510
Break it up.
Um,

219
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,290
I went down a Randy Newman, a rabbit
hole the other night. Jesus Christ.

220
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,870
That guy's talented. Huh? And when that's,

221
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:25,240
I'm old enough to remember when that
song, yeah. Show up. People got no reason.

222
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,990
Show up. People got no reason. Job.

223
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,550
People got no reason to live.

224
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,580
And that came out and all these
shore people got mad and he was,

225
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:41,290
he was making fun of racism. The
ridiculousness of racism, right?

226
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,960
It got a little cars go beep, beep
beep. They got little voices going,

227
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,690
pee, pee, pee grubby little
hands, dirty little mind.

228
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,150
And people once again took it at face
value. But you know, having said that,

229
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,890
that song came out and then there was a
bunch of people that didn't get what it

230
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:08,390
was about and they were singing
it to short people. So I dunno,

231
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,480
it was so brilliant on so many
different levels. And I love his voice.

232
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,690
I love the piano he plays
and he's done all these,

233
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,880
all these great songs from
movies and stuff like that.

234
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:20,690
And I actually looked up to see
if he was a touring anywhere.

235
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,920
Um, there's some really great footage of
them to actually with that short people

236
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:28,190
think where he's in the studio, like
an incredible credible sense of humor,

237
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,370
you know, as most, you know,

238
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,770
geniuses that I've seen always self
deprecating and that type of stuff.

239
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,030
Um, it's really funny
how that is, you know,

240
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:44,660
people who stick just walk around like,
like they're fucking astronauts.

241
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,240
Just supreme confidence, you
know, always thinking they killed,

242
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,940
let's just no fucking
clue where it's just like,

243
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,800
it's just one of those fucking
things, you know? I Dunno,

244
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,440
that's always a red flag to me
when someone's walking around.

245
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,800
Maybe that's my own fucking thing.
Maybe that's the Boston thing,

246
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,170
like easy the kid, don't forget where
you came from. Fucking relax. Easy.

247
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,110
They're Travolta.
Um,

248
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,660
anyways. Uh, what else?

249
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:23,510
What else is there to talk about?
I've just been, yeah, I was, you know,

250
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:26,390
and it was fucking amazing.
I was watching this episode last night,

251
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,570
Sunset Strip and they
showed the Coanda pass,

252
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,770
which is where the one oh one goes
from a Hollywood into the valley.

253
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,240
And,
um,

254
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,190
there's this old bridge and they were
showing like footage of it from the 1950s

255
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:47,240
and I'd seen this before at
a car dealership that had
all these old pictures of

256
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:47,810
Hollywood.

257
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,710
And you see on the one on one between the
one on one north and one on one on one

258
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:56,711
south at the Coanda passes in between
the are railroad tracks that no longer

259
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:02,000
exist. And it's always like, you
know, they used it. They, the city,

260
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,540
believe it or not, from what you
know, the tree huggers saved me on,

261
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,980
had one of the greatest, uh,
public transportations of any city.

262
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,210
And the conspiracy theory is that the
oil company companies and a Goodyear tire

263
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,970
created a corporation and they
bought up all the street cars,

264
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,610
all the trains and all the
trolleys and all that type of shit.

265
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,450
A bought it up and just
ripped up all the tracks,

266
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,790
paved over everything and forcing
people to all have to drive.

267
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,020
So then they like,
they,

268
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,550
they would make so much fucking money
that they could buy a business as big as

269
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:45,530
that with trains who can afford
to throw out of one fucking train,

270
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,680
forget about a whole city full of them.

271
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,870
Streetcars and trolleys and all that
ripped up all the fucking tracks. I mean,

272
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:54,681
I don't know what happened,

273
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:59,090
but there's something
happened cause it may,

274
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,380
it makes no sense.

275
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,593
You know,

276
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,430
street were the best.
They know.

277
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:11,520
They still have them in like San Francisco
and want to talk about the stupid one.

278
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:14,970
We'd go up the fucking hill like you were.
I mean those old school,

279
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,620
the ones that I grew up seeing,

280
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,903
mmm,

281
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,210
I dunno, but they're actually
there. They're building a,

282
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:25,710
they are building public
transportation out here again.

283
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,380
So, uh, we shall see.

284
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,160
It's weird though because everything then
got built up like everybody had a car.

285
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,270
So,
uh,

286
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,160
like most buildings just to go from the
sidewalk to the building is I give it go

287
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:39,360
to Vegas and you're like,
oh,

288
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:43,950
I'm going to walk across the street
to this other casino in like fucking,

289
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:48,710
you know, 15 minutes later you're on your
hands and knees going like water, water.

290
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,570
Like it's like an illusion.
It looks like it's right there.

291
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,680
It's right across the street.
It is so fucking far away. Um,

292
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,800
I know the, uh, at Csus,

293
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,990
what's hilarious is you can
go from the Mirage to the, uh,

294
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,740
to Caesars and they just have this
moving air conditioned sidewalk,

295
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,690
you know, and there's just all these
fat, sweaty people on it. You know,

296
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,120
the thing should actually be
moving in the opposite direction,

297
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:18,330
should be a giant treadmill for these
people and you should have to walk on it

298
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:22,110
for 10 minutes, then it
shuts off and rolls the other
way. You should. You should,

299
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,000
you should have to earn it, you
know? Um, they've just be too much,

300
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,030
too much liability. Somebody has a
heart attack, somebody slips and falls.

301
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,940
So they don't,
they just conveyor belt.

302
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,750
You don't like cattle off
to slaughter Jesus bill.

303
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,100
Why can't you speak people who are
just fat and happy, you know, going in,

304
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:47,000
you know, wearing their favorite
loud shirt to go play some craps.

305
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,940
You know what you know, I think you
guys might have a point on this one.

306
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,580
Um, so anyways, the first
week of NFL has gone by.

307
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,070
Now you know what everybody's doing.

308
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:02,300
Everybody looks at week one and then they
just say that's who these people are.

309
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,370
The New York jets. Are they
the favorites? Any AFC aged?

310
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,760
Yeah,

311
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,750
they won one game. Um, I'll tell
you the Patriot looked good,

312
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,610
but all of a sudden a,
it came back and made it really good

313
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,440
clothes. If I was a paid for and
I would be a good chat about that.

314
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,160
I don't know about you guys. Don't you
feel like there's about three weeks in?

315
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,680
Okay.

316
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,790
You know, you can kind of start to tell
like, okay, this, this team is this,

317
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,670
this team is that. And then
there's, you know, injuries.

318
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,030
I don't know what the
fuck's going to happen,

319
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,600
but I really don't think that the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers are going to put up 48

320
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:40,580
points a week while letting up 40
or the saints going to let up 48.

321
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,950
I don't fucking know.
Right.

322
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,950
Cincinnati are going to go down by 20
every fucking week and then come roaring

323
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,900
back and fucking wait. I
don't know. Maybe they will.

324
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,030
Maybe this is what's going to happen.

325
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,073
MMM.

326
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,430
Tell you right now Cincinnati,

327
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,290
I mean if this is what we're
going to be most exciting season.

328
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,203
MMM.

329
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,790
Anyways, so I am going to, uh,

330
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,750
I'm going to be in town this
whole weekend because I have,

331
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,890
I have a bunch of big gigs coming up.
So, uh, I am touring like I used to tour,

332
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,030
so I have like one weekend off until
like towards the end of October.

333
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,500
And um, but this weekend obviously
got moved to next weekend,

334
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:32,060
which was my only weekend off.
So it Kinda worked out. And um,

335
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,560
yeah.

336
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,400
So my wife was going, hey, I got
some stuff to do Saturday afternoon.

337
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,210
Do you mind?
You know,

338
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,720
hanging out with our daughter and
blah, blah, blah. It's like, what,

339
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,550
why are you got to use?
Of course I don't.

340
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,890
Of course we have to hang with my
daughter and watch Lsu versus Auburn.

341
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,320
Are you kidding me?
This is a dream.

342
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,410
So fucking drink. Well, I ain't
going to be a dream that God,

343
00:20:57,411 --> 00:21:00,410
a God damn broad announcing
the fucking game.

344
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,650
Um, it would still be a dream. I
don't give a shit. Welcome ladies.

345
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:13,330
Welcome to the world of
broadcasting. Uh, anyways, uh,

346
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,400
yeah, I can't wait to my, we took
our daughter over to get some shots,

347
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,020
you know what I mean? Like, uh,

348
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,350
I decided to stop listening to Hollywood
celebrities and actually listen to

349
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:26,680
people in the medical field.
So my daughter is getting all the shots.

350
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:30,590
We stretched them out or whatever.
So she went there to get like her shot.

351
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:35,260
So she's been there numerous times.
And um,

352
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,250
so now like she knows when we go in there
that this is the place where she feels

353
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:42,190
that needle and stuff. So she's like
all nurse. She's like, you know,

354
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:45,700
when I used to bring my dog to
the vet, you know, same thing.

355
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:47,290
So I'm trying to make a laugh and stuff.

356
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,810
So we ended up going in there and
the woman neuros, she's great.

357
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,350
She's just real quick gets it done.
And um,

358
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,140
my daughter said her first three
words sentence after she got the shot,

359
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:03,760
like she was already
crying when we laid back,

360
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:08,380
anticipating and then she got the shot
and then she, uh, she let out this yell,

361
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,820
uh, just broke my heart and
then she looked at the nurse
and she just goes right

362
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,420
odd John,
bye bye.

363
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,230
Like it was so funny.

364
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,450
Fucking cute. And it also like
broke my heart all at the same time.

365
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,830
I picked her up and she, you know,
a little hand grabbing a handful of

366
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,990
my shirt,
like Terry O'Reilly back in the day,

367
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:32,900
but she's trying to hug me and she just
kept looking at the nursery nurse goes,

368
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:35,180
it's all okay. That's it. Yeah. All
done. And She just kept [inaudible].

369
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,180
Oh,
bye bye bye bye.

370
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,350
Was just like, it was like a
kid going, I don't, you know,

371
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,930
who the fuck away from me,
man, bye bye. Like I can't,

372
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,880
I can't even, I can't even recreate, um,

373
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,460
okay.

374
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,820
That moment. And um, it's so,

375
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,070
I was so glad that I was there as a
dad cause I gotta be honest with you.

376
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:06,460
Like I would stay out in the waiting
room because I, I could not handle,

377
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,760
I was hearing those babies crying
then I was just like, you know,

378
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,970
I don't know that I could, I can
handle, even if it's a good thing,

379
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:15,190
watching somebody on any level,

380
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:18,430
hurting my kid and I know that
they're doing it for the right thing,

381
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:22,880
but it was just like, uh,
so I went in there. MMM.

382
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,110
And I, I got through it and uh, I'm
glad I did. I was glad that I did.

383
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,680
And uh, it was, oh my God,
it was so fucking cute.

384
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,940
It was so cute. Oh, I'd done well. I buy

385
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,540
bye.

386
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,260
I just kept saying that like, like, like
I'm done with you. Get away from me.

387
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:47,330
I don't want any more of this shit.
I just can't,

388
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,250
I can't like the emotion in her voice.

389
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:52,890
I just can't put into fucking words
for whatever reason. Um, anyways,

390
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,380
let's do some advertising here.

391
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,570
Oh,

392
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,860
the week my bookie, everybody, I called
them in every week or I call in a,

393
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,470
do they have a plot?
I didn't know what the fuck does is call.

394
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,960
I'm so God damn busy. I know. I call it
a couple people and I do my pics here.

people have been asking me yeah. For
advice. Ask me what team to bet on.

397
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:19,440
The truth is, I dunno, I dunno
who's gonna win. I don't know. Shit.

398
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,210
I can't even name half the
quarterbacks in the league.

399
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,200
I keep forgetting the name of the guy in
the Texans who's fucking incredible, uh,

400
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:29,820
Watson, Dante, Derek,

448
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:28,270
You talked about the dolphins,
lot of AFC stuff.

449
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,020
And then we talked about the eagles.
We talked, we talked football people.

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,370
All right. Do you like football? Listen to

everybody who likes,

452
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,230
So why would you buy a fucking generic
mattress built for everyone else?

453
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,850

463
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,000
mattress,

464
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,620
they'll pep a little concave spot there
just for you when your belly right, uh,

465
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,690
you got a lot of chest hair
and you sleep on your stomach.

466
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,130
They even have a mattress for that.

switching to their customized
mattress from helix sleep.

Right now they're offering
up to $145 on all mattresses,

470
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:42,870

sleeper, like a plush or referred bed,

471
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,280
they've got the mattress that will
fit just right. I sleep on my back.

472
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,770
I lay the, like I'm in a coffin
occasionally on the right shoulder,

473
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,890
maybe on the left.
Never on the stomach though.

474
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,650
My back has been too fucked up to lay
on my stomach for years. For decades.

475
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,610
I lay on my stomach and then all
of a sudden I'm just like, ah,

476
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,970
turnover roll out of the bed,
got to start stretching.

477
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,250
Um, anyways, get up to $125, you know,
every time I get on the floor too,

478
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,740
I think there's going to be something
under the bed. I never got over that.

479
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,910
You know, it's weird. I'm not really
a religious guy, but I definitely,

480
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,090
some of the go shit even though
I don't believe in that either.

481
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,820
You know what I do and I get on the floor
and I start thinking there's something

482
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,980
looking at me under the bed.
You know, I get over it.

483
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,750
I just give whatever's under the, under
the uh, bed, the finger, you know,

484
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,180
cause I figure if there's something
underneath there and I give it the finger,

485
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:39,210
it's going to kill me. That's
going to be over. Right.

486
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,730
And then if it doesn't do anything like
does he have enough that underneath

487
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,550
there or it's a fucking, it's a
fucking bitch. It's a pussy, right?

488
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,820
It's one of the bitch coaches. Um,
uh, whether you're a side sleeper,

489
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,090
a hot sleeper,

Yeah.

544
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:05,310
Uh, the sports gambling podcasts
was Sean Green and Ryan,

545
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,290
um, you get to listen to my pitch. She
gets to listen to my picks of the week.

546
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,250
I actually think my lock of the week was
that someone was going to say something

547
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:16,110
disparaging about the,
um,

548
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,723
okay.

549
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,720
The, uh, the female announcer
and I had thought as I can tell,

550
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:24,740
nothing really happened. You know, I was
just fun and right. The aunt of mine,

551
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:29,270
I said, good luck to everybody. What?

552
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,730
They should have a transgendered
person in that fucking do it, dude.

553
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,330
As long as it's still playing football,
I don't give a fuck. All right.

554
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,880
And as long as you know what you're
talking about, I don't know why.

555
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:40,700
I don't care what's between your legs,
what you used to have there,

556
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,630
what you attached, what's your carved
out? I don't, I don't give a fuck.

557
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,550
Just please.
For the love of God.

558
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:48,740
Know what you're talking about
and enhance the experience.

559
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,700
Don't take away from it,
right? In other words,

560
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,940
do the exact opposite of what I do
on my fucking podcast. All right,

561
00:33:55,941 --> 00:34:00,890
have a great weekend. You cunts.
Uh, let's go Lsu. Actually,

562
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,650
Randy Newman has a song called
necks where he actually a,

563
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:05,990
he's actually making fun
of northern liberals.

564
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,093
Uh,

565
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,240
when it comes to racism, how
everybody acts. Like, you know,

566
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:12,860
all the racism is down south.

567
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:15,590
It's a song you could never write today
because of the lyrics. But you know,

568
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:19,570
if you actually knew what he was
talking about, but there's this,

569
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:23,630
there's a line in there.
Got College kids at Lsu,

570
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,220
uh, go in dumb. Come out dumb too.

571
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,220
So I figured people of Alabama would
like to listen to that one, right?

572
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,320
Maybe Mississippi, it's always the state
next door. Arkansas. I've noticed like,

573
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:39,310
states always think the state next to him
was fucking stupid and they're better,

574
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,600
you know, which is why rough and
rowdy is so fucking tremendous.

575
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,930
They're the only people I've
ever seen that really exploit

576
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,460
that state to state rivalry at the level
that people really want to take it to.

577
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,271
All right,

578
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:57,540
we play football because it's illegal
to just go and beat the shit out of each

579
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:01,020
other. But with rough and rowdy, like
when they had it down in the Carolinas,

580
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:05,460
I had no idea how much people in South
Carolina and North Carolina didn't care

581
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:08,940
for one another. You know, and
literally thought because that,

582
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,650
because of that invisible line,

583
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:13,050
if you were on the other side of it
that meant that you was some sort,

584
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:15,120
yet you will less than them.
It's fucking tremendous.

585
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:19,170
So the next rough and rowdy event,
unfortunately I'm not going to be there,

586
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:20,670
but you can bet good and God damn well,

587
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:23,880
I'm going to order it and I'm going to
tape it and I'm going to get sit down

588
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:26,800
with my Miller highlights and
I'm going to watch it. Um,

589
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,270
the next one I believe is in Kentucky and,
uh,

590
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,060
it's on October 5th,
but I have a Gig in Boston that night,

591
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:35,710
so I won't be able to do it to please,

592
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,460
please on tune in j Portnoy, big cat,
almost hilarious people over there.

593
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,230
All right. That is it.
Um, enjoy your weekend.

594
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,820
You can't talk to you or

595
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,320
eh,
Eh,

596
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,850
Eh,

eh,

Join us on the line
bill burr. Bill, I know,

606
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,690
I know you said you had some
travel and to do this past Sunday,

607
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:29,570
were you able to enjoy NFL week one?

608
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,600
Yeah, I watched the,
uh, the Patriots game,

609
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,340
although Mike Direct TV was
kind of cutting in and out
for whatever reason. Um,

610
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,920
so I watched a little bit of that.

611
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:45,120
I saw a little bit of the
jets and I watched John John
Gruden's return and I was

612
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:47,520
loving the first half was
great seeing I'm there.

613
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,290
I thought it was funny when we say,
and he couldn't,

614
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,560
he wasn't gonna be able to write to these
younger kids and they got rid of all

615
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,930
the young kids.
He has like the oldest team in the NFL.

616
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:58,620
I that's either going to be a, I think I
actually, I think, I think it's going to,

617
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,270
it's kind of a genius move on his part.

618
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah. It seemed to be a bold play to kind
of do what Gordon did and obviously the

619
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:10,960
second half didn't work out. I
mean last week we hit on it. Uh,

620
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,350
I think your lot cash that the,

621
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,850
every sports announcer will be coming
out with the sky is falling down and that

622
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:21,510
certainly seems to be the case for the
Raiders. And then on the positive side,

623
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:22,344
the jets,

624
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,290
well why the rate? I mean the Raiders
play like the first half state.

625
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,840
They weren't,
they were really good rams team.

626
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,740
I mean like the Raiders had
been like, like, you know,

627
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,530
a slapstick forever. I think
week, one night that was,

628
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,840
I would be happy with that
if I was a Raiders fan.

629
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:45,040
I've even known what that second half,
they didn't look coolest.

630
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,000
I mean it's only week one. Yeah, I know.
And the jets and now like you know,

631
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,850
they're already going into,
you know,

632
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,790
whatever that USC guy
did. Yeah. They like,

633
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,600
you know what he did in week one that
Tom Brady did this first week and it's

634
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,680
just like,
you know,

635
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,820
I'm not saying that that guy isn't
going to be greater I think, but like,

636
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,840
like I don't think you really even know
what's going on until after three weeks

637
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:10,960
as far as just like, all
right. I mean look at that,

638
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:14,230
that Tampa saints game 48 40 I mean,

639
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,880
is that what they're going to be
doing each week? I don't know,

640
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,990
given up 40 or the other way around it.
This,

641
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,410
that just seems like sometimes it's
just weird games and I don't think

642
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:27,700
Stafford's going to throw five
interceptions. It just, you know,

643
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,560
it's sometimes you just have
a bad game and, uh, I dunno,

644
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:36,610
that was, that was that jets
game. It was, um, you know,

645
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,400
I mean obviously if they do that every
week they're going to be world beaters,

646
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:42,040
but I got a feeling that
they're not going to be.

647
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,920
Yeah, I agree. And just as a, as a
someone who grew up as the jet says,

648
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:51,630
like the little brother
team just listening them,
Chan, j e t s jet, Cha Cha,

649
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,130
it's like calm down one win.

650
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,460
And that the worst heartache of
the week so far is the, you know,

651
00:39:56,461 --> 00:40:01,140
Brett farbs first pass in the NFL was an
interception too. It's like calm down,

652
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:03,990
calm down there. The
judge, they're the jets.

653
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,230
There's too many channels.
They have to over hype everything.

654
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:12,120
But what the jets did was obviously
really impressive. Uh, and I, you know,

655
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm an AFC sky, so Miami one to
and then buffalo good Lord Hills.

656
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:20,190
So yeah. Plus hello. Good Lord.

657
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,740
They ever going to turn it around, but
it's only one week. Who knows? But I mean,

658
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:26,761
well,
you know,

659
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,350
it's funny that they've set out the
patriots for the first time since 2016 or

660
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:35,790
not favorites next week. And,
um, I was sick of like, what,
2016 isn't that long ago,

661
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,340
you know? Yeah. So, I mean, I guess
it is as far as like, you know,

662
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,660
being a favorite, all of
those, all of those games,

663
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:49,260
but uh, you know, they made it seem
like it was going to be a decade ago.

664
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,750
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, New
England, they came out,

665
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:56,350
they took care of business against the
Texans. It wasn't, it was a, it was Kinda,

666
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:59,020
it was, it was a weird
game. It didn't, it,

667
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,210
you never thought the
Patriots were going to lose,

668
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,660
but the spread seems like it
might come into a play at Gronk,

669
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,790
obviously looking great,

670
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:08,990
hold demos,

671
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,240
let him back in the game and then I'm
just sitting there with like six minutes

672
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:15,710
ago. Like, are they going to tie this up?
Like, how do we get into this situation?

673
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,120
All kind of like,
you know,

674
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:22,050
I was very impressed with our defense,
um,

675
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,810
you know, containment of
their quarterback. Like,

676
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,730
never can remember his fricking name
that God's not. Yeah. Yeah. Watson. Um,

677
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,280
but I, I our special teams, um,
kind of let up a lot of yards.

678
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:38,780
It seems like every time they ran it
back that got at least to the 30. Um,

679
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,430
I dunno, we shall see. But our defense
looked pretty solid. Well ain't no,

680
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,300
it's only one week

681
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,910
they finally got rid of Patricia.
We took that garbage defense to Detroit.

682
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,010
Oh Man. Yeah. I mean if you're,

683
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,170
if you're a lions fan and you watch
the super bowl and then week one Monday

684
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,150
night against the New York jets,
you can not be happy.

685
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,130
It's like you brought in
a defensive coordinator.

686
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,640
The defense sucked and you kept the
offensive coordinator cause you like the

687
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:07,790
chemistry and they looked like
horrible dog shit. So I dunno.

688
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,240
A lot of good regression angles
in the NFL for me. Exactly.

689
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,090
I mean that's when you're talking
about pet in the NFL, that's what you,

690
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,680
that's kind of what you have to do.

691
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:19,520
You have to look to opportunities
to fade some crazy outcome.

692
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,780
Like you said, Bill with the the box
putting up 48 points on the road.

693
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,770
I have a feeling Ryan Fitzpatrick
isn't going to do that week to just,

694
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,230
just gut instinct. There's a reason
he's not doing that every week. It's,

695
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,290
it's a flute.
Crazy shit happens.

696
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,590
Yeah. Yeah. That's the same
thing. Yeah, it was. Yeah,

697
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:45,310
it was definitely a weird,
it's a lot of weird games. Um,

698
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,130
but we'll also tie in from the
last time I saw tie as Lord.

699
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,610
What's funny is I,

700
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,170
one of the things I bet on this season
is there will be no tie this see I want

701
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:58,750
on it last year, the first
week of the season, Bam.

702
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,990
And of course it's the fucking browns.

703
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,660
It paid like one and a half to one. It
just seems like there's, like you said,

704
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:11,020
there's never a tie even now with only
the 10 minute over time it seems like

705
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,750
it's, and it's the NFL, they're not
going to end in a tie. Come on. Yeah.

706
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:17,530
They should switch it to the college
football rules for overtime because that's

707
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:20,170
such a more exciting
way to finish the game.

708
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:23,860
And then you never end up with
a tie. Hey, one and a half one.

709
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:26,990
Does that mean you had to be, you'd
have to bet two 50 to make a hundred no,

710
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,380
I bet a hundred and I would win one 50
plus my original bet back. So it felt,

711
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:35,500
it felt like the right,
I mean obviously it's a losing bet.

712
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:39,130
So hindsight is is what it
is. But yeah, ties are just,

713
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,680
both teams really tried to lose
the game and that's what we were,

714
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,820
we were actually out in Las Vegas
hanging out in the sports book when they

715
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:49,360
missed that field goal to end
the game and a tie and it was,

716
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,040
the sports looks great for dramatic
wins and losses, but dramatic ties.

717
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,360
It's just no one's happy. Even if you
had Cleveland plus three and a half,

718
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:02,110
you still wanted to see them hit that
field goal just to just to end the

719
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:02,800
suffering.

720
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,850
It was like we were at a strip club
and a dude walked down on stage like

721
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:10,810
everyone was just like, ah, fuck. Trying
to make sense of this. All right, well

722
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,763
this is her.

723
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,680
This is their best
start and over 14 years.

724
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:25,490
Best starts since 2004 which, oh
man, they were loving that step.

725
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,990
All right,
well let's get into some of these spreads.

726
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:32,730
Of course the spreads are brought
to you by my book, He, Daddy g,

727
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,670
the one of the safest online sports books.

728
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,690
Use the Promo Code Bill bets for
a hundred percent deposit bonus.

729
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,470
They got it all over their end game wage
during the prop builder play when and

730
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:47,130
get paid my bookie. Dot. Agee
promocode bill pets. All right.

731
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:50,880
First game to talk about
New England patriots.

732
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,480
They head into Jacksonville where
the Jaguars right now are a,

733
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,690
the pats actually our
favorite in this game.

734
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:02,280
They're a three point favorite
right now. Jack. Yeah,

735
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:07,260
jags are the home dog here. We're looking
at a rematch of the AFC championship,

736
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:11,850
although it was played in New
England and not Jacksonville Bill,

737
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:14,610
are you worried about the the
jags defense here on the road?

738
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,740
Yeah, Tom Coughlin is is
and you know obviously he,

739
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,900
she's beaten us twice in Superbowls
and every gun and the cup quickly.

740
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:26,280
He's turned that team around
everywhere and the guy goes, you know,

741
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:28,710
fright from back in the days
when he's at Boston College.

742
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,570
I'm a big fan of Tom Costs and
he's getting three points at home.

743
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,830
Jaguars defenses as good as I said,
I would take, I would take the Jag,

744
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,650
I wouldn't be afraid I would take the
Jaguars, uh, getting tiny at home.

745
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,370
Um, you know, [inaudible] I don't know,

746
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:52,050
I just think there were really
tough team and uh, we'll, we'll see.

747
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,090
We'll see. I mean, obviously
I'm rooting for the Patriots,

748
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,200
but we'll talk getting money here.

749
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,020
Yeah, exactly. You can't mess
around to keep the lights on here.

750
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,170
I would take the jaguars getting three.

751
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,780
Yeah, it does feel like that's the smart
play. I mean, you touched on it last week,

752
00:46:03,781 --> 00:46:07,380
shown on the patriots generally aren't
playing their best ball in September.

753
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,371
And guess what,

754
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:11,950
this is the biggest game on the schedule
for the jags after blowing that game in

755
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,460
New England. So, I mean, look, the paths,

756
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,800
let a Houston team that
played pretty poorly, uh,

757
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,770
get back in the game and Watson was
not himself. So I'm gonna I'll say,

758
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,800
unless Bortles completely Bortles it.
Uh,

759
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,920
I think the Jags jags are
gonna win this game. Yeah.

760
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:31,170
It and you talk about Tom Kauflin style,

761
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:34,020
the way to beat New England is the,

762
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,620
to try and get pressure on Tom Brady with
just using your defensive line and not

763
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:38,910
blitz and a bunch of guys and Yup.

764
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,800
The jags have that strong defensive
line that might be able to well my that

765
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,270
dominate the game but certainly
pressure Brady enough and uh,

766
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,390
I I think what the, the paths have
going for them is Leonard for net.

767
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,280
Looks like he's going
to be after the jags.

768
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,420
Jack's don't have a ton of
offensive weapons. Honestly,

769
00:46:57,421 --> 00:47:00,600
I think the play in this game
maybe, uh, maybe to go under,

770
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:02,460
it feels like it's going to
be a little slug match here,

771
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:06,930
but I'll take the jags catching
three and a rematch and um, yeah,

772
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:10,910
I know God hates the Jag shown.
Remember that a next step.

773
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:16,260
The under census, everybody throws
handoffs now. You know what I mean?

774
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,930
I just can't

775
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,240
or receive or past five years. I just,
I always get nervous button, the button,

776
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,860
the under funding for if you want to fade,
recency,

777
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,630
just take the under in every game.
I feel like they're there.

778
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:33,220
They're perhaps maybe an over adjustment
to the totals after that. Everything.

779
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:37,390
I mean the, the fantasy, everything, the
scoring was just off the charts. Yeah,

780
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:39,220
it is. It is tough to
bet the under, I mean,

781
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:43,030
just for the entertainment value alone
to just root against every play to

782
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:44,250
succeed.
But

783
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,330
I don't think anybody's ever
going to break Emmitt Smith, uh,

784
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,130
time rushing record. They just did. The
opportunities just aren't there anymore.

785
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,090
No.

786
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,380
Yeah, I mean it, it's, I think it's going
to be really hard for any running backs.

787
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,690
The set marks going forward.
Cause I mean,

788
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,230
half their touches are going to be passes.

789
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,260
He's going to be like tech
guy from one the most games,

790
00:48:03,261 --> 00:48:05,340
like whoever won the most
games in MLB history.

791
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,030
So it's like in the 500 it's just like,

792
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,560
it's gonna it's gonna seem that daunting.
Like if there was a different era,

793
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,920
has a head saw,
young hands over

794
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,490
or 800 starts, they're not doing that
anymore. No, they didn't. They, yeah.

795
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,610
I mean they're never going to
come even close to getting there.

796
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,190
Yeah. You pitch your whole
double header. They were men,

797
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:28,200
they were men,

798
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,280
they were men back then though they had
a stake giants cigar and called it a

799
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,860
little bit of a beer league,
you know? Let's be honest.

800
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,770
Yeah. I mean you look
at Babe Ruth, he does.

801
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,610
He does strike you as your uncle at a
softball game who can just crush it,

802
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,860
who just had a little bit
of hand eye coordination.

803
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,021
Yeah.

804
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,780
I used to play on a softball team when
I was working in a warehouse and they

805
00:48:47,781 --> 00:48:48,261
always had these,

806
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:51,920
these C's ringers would come out and
they all look built like Babe Ruth,

807
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,160
a little skinny legs,
big beer belly,

808
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,870
and they would just get up and they would
turn that torso and the thing would go

809
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:00,704
a mile.

810
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,640
Yeah. That's like, I mean that was
Cecil fielder. You know, he was,

811
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,820
he was the modern day version
of that meal. All right.

812
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,020
Next up we got the New York
giants heading down to Dallas.

813
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:14,200
Right now it's sitting at
a even minus three here.

814
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,630
Both teams started out. Oh, and one
neither. Neither looked great too.

815
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:22,450
Uh, yeah. I mean, giants
lost at home to the jags.

816
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,980
Cowboys lost on the road to the panthers.
Spill. Which way you lean in the air.

817
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:32,510
I hate this game. I know. Same here.
This game where it's just like,

818
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,970
like the cowboys at, I
dunno, duct right at home.

819
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,270
It's a deficient to,
the games are always close.

820
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,940
You can never bet against Eli,
but he like,

821
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:46,790
doesn't seem like it gets
excited until like November,

822
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,840
but they got that running deck,
Eh, Jesus. Am I going to go giants,

823
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:57,500
giants with Tom Claflin and then I'm going
to go, I think I go be like, I think,

824
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,470
you know, they beat us twice. So I mean,
I see. I got to keep it. These guys,

825
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,900
I'm going to completely different time.

826
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,890
I believe any lie, and I think, uh,

827
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,940
the Dez Bryant hangover and this whole,
whatever the hell they've done,

828
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:16,860
reef formation of the cowboys is the
hangover lasts for at least three weeks.

829
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:18,030
I'm going with the giants.

830
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,820
Kramer, I'm, I'm assuming you're going
to be back in your chance as well.

831
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:22,410
I also believe in Ely.

832
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:26,250
I appreciate all these mentions of
Tom Coughlin and the Superbowl wins.

833
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,170
And he said how excited Ryan is getting
on the other end of this. But I mean,

834
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:31,120
here, here's the thing, right? I,

835
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:33,920
I think I was talking to my dad
today and I was like, I, you know,

836
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:36,590
I actually wasn't that upset.
The giants played fine.

837
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:39,380
They played a really good team. Uh,
they played a really good defense.

838
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:42,650
More importantly, and the offensive
players got theirs. They just,

839
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,080
they were picked six
away. So, uh, but what I,

840
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:49,220
what they saw in the Dallas cowboys game
was a team that even when Kiki was out

841
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:54,140
of the game, this team struggled to do
anything. And Dac as we know, Sean Dakota,

842
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:56,600
Prescott not the best
quarterback in the NFL.

843
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,530
So Eli has historically
played well in Dallas.

844
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:03,110
I'm going to keep throwing that
out there and yeah, no, of course.

845
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,720
You take the take the giants
before it gets off of three. Yeah.

846
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,250
As much as it pains me,

847
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:11,240
I'm going to think that I'm going to
take the chance getting three points.

848
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,620
You look at the cowboys, they're
only, they got seek and that's it.

849
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:18,440
Their offensive line isn't the
dominant force that it was a name.

850
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:22,960
They have no skill positions to
help deck out, uh, on that office.

851
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:26,750
I think they're just going to have trouble
putting up points and the giants are

852
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:30,140
weaknesses. The offensive line, obviously
the jags were able to exploit that.

853
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:33,890
I don't see the cowboys being able to
get enough pressure on Eli and listen,

854
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,870
it is Sunday night, Sunday night
football. I think your Buddy Odell Ryan,

855
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,990
in spite of the fact that he has not won
a game since he went on the implements

856
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:45,680
boat trip, I think they
get a victory down in, uh,

857
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,240
down in Dallas stadium there. So I'll
take the giants plus three. I don't feel,

858
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,990
I don't feel great about it because
Dallas coming off at a loss.

859
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:54,771
Maybe they rally,

860
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:59,060
but I am just still not a believer in
Jason cared at all as a head coach.

861
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,440
I think Dakota Prescott sounds like some
country singer on one of those American

862
00:52:05,441 --> 00:52:08,320
idol shows. So true. I mean it
just, it's, it cracks me up.

863
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:11,260
His name's to Dakota vote now for Dakota.
Prescott.

864
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,280
It's the fact that he is also
Prescott. Yeah, you could.

865
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,690
You could beat Dakota something
or something. Prescott,
but did coat up Prescott.

866
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,280
That's a tough one man.

867
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,690
Just like you're just born with an
acoustic guitar and a cowboy hat.

868
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,920
Second you come out.

869
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,770
Yeah. You imagine it's
a, yeah. He's like a,

870
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:34,060
a chick with a cutoff flannel shirt with
some like short jean shorts coming out

871
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:37,630
with the acoustic guitar ready to
wow you with their latest rendition.

872
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,510
Well that's another way of looking at it.
I didn't tell him in daisy.

873
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:47,690
Well he's, he is. He is a woman in my
scenario bill, he's done. He's done.

874
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,290
Sean, let's not forget that Dak
Prescott to, sorry, Dakota's Prescott.

875
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:53,780
Favorite Song is drops
of Jupiter by train.

876
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,220
That was a little known nugget about
Dakota. That was a trivia fact. We dug up.

877
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,393
All right,

878
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,000
last game of the week that
we'll be breaking down here.

879
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:10,000
Kansas City chiefs coming off a
nice win on the road against the s,

880
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,280
the Los Angeles chargers.
Now they're heading into Pittsburgh.

881
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,200
Obviously Pittsford coming off that ugly,

882
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:18,630
ugly tie against the Cleveland
browns right now. My book,

883
00:53:18,631 --> 00:53:23,631
he has the Pittsburgh Steelers as
mine is five favorites at home.

884
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,140
Bill, which way you lean in here? You
know, I didn't see a second of that.

885
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,830
Steel is game. I don't know what,
how was Big Ben Look Looking?

886
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,810
He looked pretty like typical road.
Big Ben like through five what?

887
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:42,050
Five interceptions? Yeah, I five
interceptions turnovers maybe they know.

888
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,900
I think he, I think he through
maybe four or five pics.

889
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:48,890
They had six turnovers overall,
but he didn't look good at all.

890
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,720
I like the Steelers at home.
I don't like that number though.

891
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,560
Here's what was picked up. Perfect
number. We just sit on the fence.

892
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:58,380
Which way am I going to fall?
Uh,

893
00:53:58,381 --> 00:54:02,020
you know what I say the steel is
going to cover the CISA that chiefs,

894
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,120
the chiefs, you know what I mean? Til
they're not the chiefs. So the chiefs,

895
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,180
the Steelers as still the Steelers.
I, I mean, I just thought,

896
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:12,480
I'm just gonna be like historical bedding
here at the first couple of weeks.

897
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,820
I mean,
I don't know who anybody is at this point.

898
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,720
Well, and I think, you know, talk
about overreaction. Oh my God,

899
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:21,750
Big Ben was horrible. He's always
been on the road. Oh my God.

900
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:24,720
They timed the timer.
They tied the browns. Oh,

901
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:26,840
levy on Bell Big Ben.

902
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:31,760
He's old school. Take a hit. Like
that guy, you know, he's just,

903
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,320
you know, and he gets it done
in the big moments of the Games.

904
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:39,540
And I dunno, I, I, I believe
in that guy still. Yeah,

905
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,613
he looks like

906
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,660
he plays well in the home and at home.
And that's why I like this.

907
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:47,470
Like we're going to fade public perception
that the Steelers stink and we're

908
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:50,660
gonna fade public perception that the
chiefs are going to win the Superbowl

909
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:54,850
because, oh my God, Andy Reid
started. Well again. Uh, I mean, look,

910
00:54:54,851 --> 00:54:58,540
this is a classic fade recency
of this line opened at seven.

911
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:01,940
Sean and people have been crushing
the chief side of this. So wow,

912
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,320
let the number come down. I'm also
going to be on the Steelers, Sean.

913
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:08,680
I think this is a great kind of
fade recency both ways here. Wow.

914
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,950
I it's going to be a clean sweep are
all in agreeance and all these pics.

915
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:15,970
I love the Steelers at home
coming off a, I mean, not a loss,

916
00:55:15,971 --> 00:55:19,570
but it may as well be. Then you come
home for their home opener, you know,

917
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:23,140
they're going to bounce back and then
meanwhile you've got the chief's coming

918
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:27,850
off a huge road victory to go to the
other side of the country in Pittsburgh.

919
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,940
A home smelling himself like, come
on. Yeah. And we watched that.

920
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,970
We watched that game. Ryan, the, uh,
the chief secondary looked horrible like

921
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,370
there, hey, I don't want
to be a geography snob,

922
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:38,880
but they're not going to the
other side of the country.

923
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,730
Can't just say to Pittsburgh, that's,
you know, to just into the east coast.

924
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:49,010
I was, I was factoring in the them
going out to la, then to Kansas City,

925
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:53,470
then out to Pittsburgh. But yeah, I trash
require traveling teen plane. Come on.

926
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,330
They've got a connection in Poughkeepsie
United in the middle seat. You know,

927
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,900
I think there'll be all right.
They're going to have crib next.

928
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:02,150
They're not going to,
they're going to be dehydrated.

929
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,410
All those salty peanuts.
I just,

930
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,790
I just think it's a good
spot for Pittsburgh add home
home opener or the Kansas

931
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,380
City defense is just there.

932
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:14,470
Passing defense in particular is just
horrible and it's a passing league.

933
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,710
I just feel like Pittsburgh is going
to be able to throw all over him.

934
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,920
Anything you say with confidence has,
they're passing the stinks.

935
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,100
I'm not giving you crap here just

936
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,520
after one week. Well,
I'll give you two reasons.

937
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,320
One reason is I watched the game and I
saw that the charger's receivers were

938
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:37,321
wide open a number of times and just
dropped easy catchable balls and then two

939
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,010
other than that, other
than that, my other,

940
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:46,930
my other deeper reason is I sit next to
a chiefs fan at work and every day he

941
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:50,080
opens up his laptop and starts
reading blogs and just goes,

942
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,400
are fucking secondary fucking sucks.
So I'm kind of using that as well.

943
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,210
I'm convinced. So one year
over. All right, Bill,

944
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:05,350
do a wrap things up here.
You hit with your lock last week you were,

945
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,150
you were two and one with your picks.

946
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:10,450
The lock of course was that the
sky was falling down or that the,

947
00:57:10,451 --> 00:57:14,710
the announcers would all proclaim
the sky was falling down. Yes.

948
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,620
Hopefully we get that three and
oh this week. But what's your,

949
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:21,040
what's your lock prediction
for a NFL week too?

950
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,290
Uh,

951
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:27,290
one person tweets that women should
not be play by play announcers and by

952
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:32,520
Wednesday, well I guess it's
a, I get another two days.

953
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,050
Somebody is going to say something,

954
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,360
somebody will say something and then
it's going to become this huge thing.

955
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,200
And then I think by this time
next year all play by play.

956
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,180
People will be women. That
would be that. That is my luck.

957
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,210
Lock it up.
Doris Burke will be doing it right.

958
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,930
It's fine. The way as it, as a joke, I was
joking with my buddy going to, I go, dude,

959
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:59,580
Burt Reynolds died in the play by play
on Monday night. Football is a shemale.

960
00:57:59,581 --> 00:58:03,480
I go, it really is over. We had
a great run. So as, as a joke,

961
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,790
I actually looked up the elks
club going like, I moved.

962
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,910
Just see what the elks club,

963
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:13,620
that's a men's club or whatever and
looked it up and in 2005 first of all,

964
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:16,740
I looked it up and the picture was of
a woman. When you go to the website,

965
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,940
they sued in 2005 and one so like even
they've even infiltrated obviously the,

966
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:29,460
I mean arguably the biggest group
of jerk off men in the country.

967
00:58:29,461 --> 00:58:31,990
I mean you're literally talking to take
away like the hats with the little tasks

968
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,550
and it's hilarious. Like I looked it up.
I would never join it, but I was just,

969
00:58:35,551 --> 00:58:35,960
I just,

970
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,470
it was going to get a check out of the
fact if there was one place left where

971
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,360
you could just chill out and not
have to adjust your behavior.

972
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,460
And the old gentleman, he's over, man.

973
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,090
It was the elks club and Augusta
national and then both those have been

974
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:55,050
infiltrated. They're now no
longer all male. All right.

975
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,920
We had a hell of a Ron Dude. Yeah,
man. Really did have a hell of a run.

976
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,540
Every dynasty must come to an end.

977
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,080
Tens of thousands of years I think.

978
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:10,880
Drawing Emmett and the Herman.
The triplets.

979
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,420
Yeah. We were a three headed
monster for a long time.

980
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,510
Well, this is, a lot of people are
saying this is a rebuilding year for men.

981
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:18,321
You know,
we're,

982
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,650
we're hoping to get the number one
traffic took a lot of heat loss.

983
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:25,430
A lot of lost a lot. I took a
lot of Ellis out there. Yeah.

984
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:27,780
We're going to try to forget about
last year. And, uh, you know,

985
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,120
we're going to hit reset. We've got Jon
Gruden back. He's back at different times,

986
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,840
so much. Jon Gruden face. I
can't wait. Oh Man. It was,

987
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,380
he was loved seeing him back then.
It was so funny how like,

988
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,410
he was just kind of a different
guy in the broadcast booth.

989
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,380
And then the second he put
the headphones back on again.

990
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,620
He just wanted a break back to the
chuck you faced. I loved it. Yeah.

991
00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:52,550
The thing that was frustrating about
him as an announcer was that clearly he

992
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:55,940
thought about getting back into coaching
so he wouldn't bad mouth guys on the

993
00:59:55,941 --> 01:00:00,440
air. And he just loved everyone at,
he's a great guy. Look at this guy.

994
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,930
And then as soon as he's
got that headset on,

995
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,990
you could just see him
screaming and yelling. He was,

996
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:10,730
he was just so pissed at cars. He
got the job. He cut half the team.

997
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,230
Uh, I thought you said you love me.
I, Hey, the broadcast booth. Yeah.

998
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,870
None of the claim. Yeah. All right.

999
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,410
Well see how we do, gentlemen, uh,

1000
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,040
I'm going to get more bold with my
predictions is once, you know, hopefully,

1001
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,580
you know,
what am I actually,

1002
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:32,430
my show's got moved this weekend
because of the hurricane,

1003
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:36,450
which hopefully goes out to see a am I
supposed to work in Virginia and South

1004
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,700
Carolina. So I'm hoping
that, you know, you know,

1005
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,550
a lot of those people are probably still
upside down in their houses because the

1006
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:42,540
piece of shit bankers,

1007
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,660
so the last thing they need is a hurricane
to hit the house that's not going to

1008
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:47,220
be worth more than what they owe on it.

1009
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,080
Screwed by the insurance
companies as well. Yes. Yeah.
For the trisector. So, um,

1010
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,880
uh,
that's what I'm thinking about this week.

1011
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:55,560
I'm supposed to be there the following me,
but I,

1012
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:58,710
but the other side was I will be home
and didn't have enough time to watch the

1013
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:02,970
game. So hopefully a silver lining
in that shout out to Dakota Prescott.

1014
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,130
Love it.
All right.

1015
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:10,131
And obviously a checkout Bellbird outcome
for all the upcoming tour information.

1016
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:14,070
And of course, uh, check
out my book e. Dot.

1017
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:18,540
Ag Promo code fill beds for that a
hundred percent deposit bonus play.

1018
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,040
When I get paid my bookie that AGL?
Yeah Buddy.

1019
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,430
That's his.

1020
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,230
Hey, what's going on? It's Belper

1024
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:27,810

It's actually 10 oh one east coast time.

1025
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:32,460
I'm in New York City. This is a the
biggest week of the year for me.

1026
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:37,380
I'm back here doing press for my
new one hour special. Let it go.

1027
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:42,030
That comes out in premiers. They
switched the date on me. It is now.

1028
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,500
It's Sunday,

1029
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:48,540
September 19th at 11:00 PM so,

1030
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,930
please tune in. Please
listen, please watch.

1031
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,030
Please invite other people over.

1032
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:58,950
Why don't you have a little
fucking standup comedy
party? Don't they have those?

1033
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:01,440
They have super bowl parties.
You know,

1034
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:06,420
we invite a bunch of broads over and
they talked during the game and they shut

1035
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:09,900
up during the commercials.
I kind of liked that one.

1036
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:13,770
How much do you think that
that one Costa did? Um,

1037
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,580
anyways,
yeah.

1038
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,520
So I'm in town this week and I'm going
to be doing the opion Anthony Program,

1039
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:24,180
my fucking favorite. Um,
I'm going to be doing that.

1040
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,720
I believe I'm going to be doing
something on the versus network.

1041
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:32,820
I am going to be talking to anybody with
the microphone this week, doing my gosh,

1042
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:36,920
darndest to try and get people to
listen to my fucking podcasts. But, uh,

1043
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,320
how many podcasts see what happens when
I multitask to get people to watch my

1044
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:45,000
special.
And um,

1045
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:49,050
I'm gonna apologize for the lack of funny
up until this point already right out

1046
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:52,560
of the fucking gate just because I have
to make sure I get this information out

1047
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,660
at the beginning of the podcast.
All right,

1048
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:59,661
so my special September 19th
at 11:00 PM on comedy central.

1049
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:05,310
Um, please go ahead and watch it.
And if you want to preorder my DVD,

1050
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,860
look into your heart.

1051
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:12,390
If you want to order this thing
for an unbelievably, ridiculously,

1052
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:14,280
almost an embarrassingly low price,

1053
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:19,281
you can order the fucking thing for like
$13 in like 29 cents on amazon.com I

1054
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:24,060
don't know how the fuck they
came up with that price,

1055
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:28,260
but I got to admit I felt a
little insulted. You know,

1056
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:31,230
why don't you just fucking give it away?
amazon.com

1057
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:36,650
so there you go.
Why don't you buy to look at that?

1058
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:40,220
Because right after that it's going to
be 1999 so then if you actually go out

1059
01:04:40,221 --> 01:04:42,710
and buy two then if you come out
to my show, you'd be like, Dude,

1060
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:46,160
stop bitching about your free fucking
podcast because I actually bought two your

1061
01:04:46,161 --> 01:04:50,000
DVDs and I'll be thinking in my
head, wow, this guy dropped 40 bucks.

1062
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,620
What a good shit.

1063
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,020
And you'll be laughing because in
the back of your head you're like,

1064
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:57,230
actually I dropped 26 and change,
you know,

1065
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,830
26 and change. I mean, what can you,

1066
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:05,831
what can you get to have
for $26 I can get gum,

1067
01:05:05,931 --> 01:05:08,990
get two packs of gum. Actually
probably get a lot more than that.

1068
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,800
Of course you go to footlocker and those
fucking tee shirts you can get like,

1069
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,250
what can you get? Like, like
58 tee shirts at footlocker?

1070
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:21,280
Is that Michael Moore's next movie?
If I was Michael Moore and I was going,

1071
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:22,750
what the fuck should
out in the next movie?

1072
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:27,070
Should I make about how poor people
are sad and rich people are evil?

1073
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:31,300
I would try and find who
are the people who may, who?

1074
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,340
Oh, these people, they
make the Mug a teacher.

1075
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,580
Um,
you know,

1076
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:41,840
how do they give you fucking
like nine t shirts for $18?

1077
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,160
How do they do that?

1078
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,030
Um, you know what, this is, I'm
not even hung over, but I just,

1079
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,590
I rather than being hung over,
which I should have been,
but I wasn't, but I'm not,

1080
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:57,090
whatever I'm trying to say, I just woke
up with just weird music in my head.

1081
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,180
You have to do that. You wake
up, you drank last night,
you dot hung over. But he's,

1082
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,140
you just wake up and then you just
singing some song that you haven't even

1083
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:08,460
thought of for years. I was
just walking around my, my uh,

1084
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,540
fucking apartment here, just walking
around and going some like it hot,

1085
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,410
some like it hot bump,
bump, bump, bump, bump,

1086
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:19,680
bump up about the CPAP
and then how it goes.

1087
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,870
Feel the heat

1088
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,100
burning into the knife or the night,

1089
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,370
whatever the fuck it is.
Is that Robert Palmer?

1090
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,030
Some like it hot. Ooh. Robert Palmer.

1091
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,300
Tell us about your new sexy,
sultry,

1092
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:41,320
single with that hot Latino
beat underneath it. Well,

1093
01:06:41,321 --> 01:06:46,270
I had recently gone to Cuba and I are
inserted a fucking go Cohiba and to some

1094
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:49,120
fucking prostitutes or fish.

1095
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,770
And I was just really a overwhelmed by
the culture down there and she fucking

1096
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:57,190
hate that.
You know what I make whenever,

1097
01:06:57,191 --> 01:07:01,450
like the White Star tries to have some
sort of ethnic beat under their music and

1098
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:05,620
then they always get to talk about some
trip that they took to Swahili and how

1099
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,800
when they were sitting
there in that Walden resort,

1100
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:12,160
they somehow fuckin absorbed the culture.
You know,

1101
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,370
you guys haven't gone down
to the Caribbean, you gone
down into the Caribbean,

1102
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:19,600
however the fuck you say it. Some people
say Caribbean, some people say Caribbean,

1103
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:25,510
but to me it's,
it's all one beautiful universe.

1104
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,900
The guys went down to the
Caribbean to go scuba diving,

1105
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,830
to be nose to nose with
a fucking Barracuda.

1106
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,620
They get barracudas down there quick.

1107
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:37,020
Why don't you look it up and then send
me an email and tell me how fucking

1108
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:37,854
uninformed I

1109
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,020
actually, Barracuda are indigenous
to this Egil for Brazil.

1110
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,890
The fuck up. I can look this shit up
to, what is it? A freshwater fish?

1111
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:50,660
If you go down to like fucking Uruguay,
can you get a Barracuda Sandwich?

1112
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:54,170
You know, just to start your day
rather than, than getting like a bacon,

1113
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:55,004
egg and cheese.

1114
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,230
Did they do that and do
they use the whole fish?

1115
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,610
Because they're better than Americans
where we would just like use like just the

1116
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:06,840
best part of the fish and then the rest
we would just sort of throw out the

1117
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:07,674
window,

1118
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:12,000
just toss it back into the ocean and
it gets all hooked up with like old

1119
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:16,310
rollerblades and fucking, um, those shoes.

1120
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,070
Every guy war in the late nineties,
remember those fucking shoe.

1121
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:23,720
So slip on shoes that sorta look like
sneakers. Canada, look like shoes.

1122
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,630
Remember those? Fuck it. Thanks.
Where are all those right now?

1123
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:29,211
I'll tell you where they are.

1124
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:31,070
They're floating out in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean,

1125
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,590
getting broken down in the sunlight.
Right?

1126
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:38,390
And then some dolphin inhales it
and then you go out to Japan. Right?

1127
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:41,180
And they don't give a fuck about dolphins.
You guys see the cove?

1128
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,390
Okay.

1129
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:47,390
You know they'll fucking
Dolphin Schindler's list.

1130
01:08:48,031 --> 01:08:51,150
Basically. I couldn't eat. I just
heard what that movie was about.

1131
01:08:51,151 --> 01:08:54,240
And I fucking love animals so much that
I couldn't eat. I couldn't even know.

1132
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:57,630
Schindler's list actually had
somebody fucking decent in it,

1133
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:03,010
trying to help out those being
slaughtered. Ow. What the fuck am I?

1134
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,030
I didn't even see the goddamn movie.
All I heard was a bunch of people,

1135
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,920
they drive these dolphins
into this fucking cove and
then they just beat him to

1136
01:09:10,921 --> 01:09:13,260
death.
And it was a

1137
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:15,620
okay,

1138
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:19,080
it, it was so fun just to
hear. It was so fucking sad.

1139
01:09:19,081 --> 01:09:23,040
And then it just made me so God damn
angry that I like, you know what?

1140
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:25,330
I'm not going to fuck,
I'm not gonna, you know,

1141
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,940
I'm not gonna Watch that stuff
is what am I going to do? Oh,

1142
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:35,910
who got himself to treat at
the local Deli. This is what,

1143
01:09:35,911 --> 01:09:37,380
this is how you get out
of shape in New York,

1144
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:40,310
even though you walk around all the time
is you just walk into a Deli and you're

1145
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:42,420
like, you know what? I'm
going to start my day.

1146
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:48,720
We're on our way to the perfect place, the
perfect place. Bup, Bup, bup, bup, bup,

1147
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:52,110
bup, bup, Ba. That's another fucking song.
Just popped in my head. What is that from?

1148
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:55,050
It's the perfect place.

1149
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,170
Okay.

1150
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:01,920
Was that, that was like a
Hanna Barbera cartoon. Ron.
Our way to the perfect place.

1151
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:06,450
The perfect place. Anyways,
I'm sorry. This is like,

1152
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,880
I have weird hangovers sometimes
I don't have a headache. I just,

1153
01:10:08,881 --> 01:10:13,480
just music pops into my head.
Sound like it. Hot sound like it.

1154
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:19,500
Um, anyways, some white
guy playing yoga blocks.

1155
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:23,930
Does that sound Latino? Speaking
of Latino, I went into, well,

1156
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,580
one of these little fucking Bodega's

1157
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:32,510
[inaudible] La dawn day as,
uh,

1158
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,610
the fucking orange juicer.
Um,

1159
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,260
I was up there and I got myself an Oj and
a banana because I'm really into these

1160
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:41,310
light breakfast.
His now.

1161
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,310
I finally realized that when you wake
up and you have a lumberjack breakfast,

1162
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:48,660
that seriously, it's like I've been saying
on this podcast, it's like getting up.

1163
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:53,700
It's like if you just woke up the second
you woke up and you just sprinted 400

1164
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:57,870
yards without stretching or anything,
didn't even put on your fucking shoes.

1165
01:10:57,871 --> 01:11:01,320
He just ran down the street.
I buy, buy, buy, buy, buy on
the fucking pebbles. Right.

1166
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:05,730
That's what you're doing to your body.
That's why I started slow.

1167
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,760
I get a little fucking corn based orange
juice according to food inc it's all

1168
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:15,660
corn now. Excuse me. And then
I have a banana, you know,

1169
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,340
which is like sort of like a

1170
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,370
baby food in a phallic form.
That's what it's like.

1171
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:28,200
It's like a big fucking, uh, would
have a big yellow dick. One animal.

1172
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,840
I got fucking Porno,
Star Canary if you want it to.

1173
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:40,260
That's what it bananas like.
Right. So typical New York,
I'm trying to eat healthy.

1174
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:45,261
And then I look over and I see these
two little toasted balls to add to the

1175
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,210
fucking, the, the, the,
the canary thing, right?

1176
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:50,310
Like they lopped off
this fucking Porto nuts.

1177
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,530
And I looked at the lady and I
was like, oh, La, San your retail,

1178
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:58,830
what the fuck are those? And
she's like, oh, those are,

1179
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:02,970
those are coconut balls. And I
was like, get the fuck Outta here.

1180
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,130
And she says, I can't get the fuck outta
here. I have to work. And I said, no,

1181
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:11,580
I didn't mean it. Literally. I
meant get the fuck Outta here.

1182
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,420
Those are made out of coconut.
And she said, see? And I was like,

1183
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:23,310
I fucking love coconut, you know?
And she started laughing like,

1184
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:28,290
I never said you didn't fuck. Oh, do
you want them? And I'm like, absolutely.

1185
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:31,440
I want them to know I have him.
So I have to tell on you guys.

1186
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:35,500
I was going to begin my day with a,
you know,

1187
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:40,050
we didn't really healthy. I ended up
grabbing two sugar balls. Actually,

1188
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:44,400
the call, uh, I actually
hear the Coco Komodo

1189
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:50,520
and underneath an English macaroon
coconut. Here's the ingredients, sugar,

1190
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:51,480
coconut,

1191
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:56,320
and then in parentheses says may contain
sodium metaphor wholesale such harsh

1192
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,160
for whiteness.
I love that shit.

1193
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:03,440
Like how much did they not even research?
What the fuck is? Yeah, it might.

1194
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,940
It might,

1195
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:08,940
might have a little bit of this
met up by sulfite for whiteness.

1196
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,340
Well, the coconuts white. Why
would you need to add to that?

1197
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:18,900
Is this some coconut that you fucking
had in a warehouse for years? Egg Whites,

1198
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,930
invert sugar,
corn Syrup and salt.

1199
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,640
So for the most part it's all natural
except for the sodium metapod by said vice

1200
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:31,410
types of light for whiteness.
And I'm gonna try one. Let's see.

1201
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,270
Sweet Dreams are made of the keys.

1202
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,540
How bad his fucking Annie Lennox.

1203
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:44,130
When you think of the annals of
the fucking baddest rock chicks,

1204
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,550
we'll start with white chicks,
right? We'll move all the way around.

1205
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,310
We'll start with the baddest
white chicks of all time.

1206
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:55,340
I would say fuck an Annie Lennox
and no particular order here.

1207
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,820
If I was rolling stone,
I do an entire issue of this.

1208
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
The hundreds greatest rock chicks of
all time rolling stone really is clearly

1209
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:08,820
showing people if he haven't
been paying attention.

1210
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,680
How few people buying magazines now?

1211
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,920
Oh,
that fucking listening to discussion.

1212
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,720
It's like a donut. Oh,
it's gross. I was too much.

1213
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,270
That's fucking disgusting.
I have to take another bite.

1214
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:33,220
Cause now my sugars shot
and arise right now.

1215
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:38,200
I'm craving it. Ah Fuck Man. I
need another hit man. Oh yeah.

1216
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:42,220
Oh I stand corrected.

1217
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,820
These are fucking delicious to eat.
The first bite.

1218
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,810
Is your body going? No, don't
do it. So it tastes like shit.

1219
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:54,070
But then that sugar gets in your
veins and it's like, come on man.

1220
01:14:54,071 --> 01:14:56,920
You know you want it and
then you just keep going.

1221
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,240
Like this is really rude to be eating
on the mic. All right. Annie Lennox,

1222
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:07,390
you know, and then can't even think now.

1223
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,550
Any Linux, the chick from the
pretenders, Chrissy Hine, right

1224
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,220
Pat Benatar.

1225
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:21,760
Now that's not what I
want it. I, you know,

1226
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:25,030
I always got confused with the
chick from the runaways, Joan Jett,

1227
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:30,670
Joan jets, Shit. Um, and she's still hot.

1228
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:36,880
Damn it. Those are fucking delicious. Ah,

1229
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,440
not after a swig of Oj though, rose. Okay.

1230
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:44,700
They're really hard to chew.

1231
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,560
Wow. What am I fucking neighbors
just here. Just heard that.

1232
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:54,810
Wondering what the fuck I'm talking about?
Um,

1233
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:00,110
all right. Sorry. Sorry. You know
what? I'm actually last night.

1234
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:05,270
Um, no, finish your fucking thought
bill. If you look at rolling stone,

1235
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:10,250
they used to be this big magazine.
Just I'm talking about when you held it,

1236
01:16:10,251 --> 01:16:12,320
it was used to be like
the fucking third bigger.

1237
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,420
Now they've shrunk it down to, it's
like a third of the size it used to be.

1238
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:21,770
And now every other month they're
doing those, those list things.

1239
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:23,690
100 greatest guitarists of all time.

1240
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,720
The hundred greatest
tambourine players of all time.

1241
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,550
Right now they have the hundred greatest
Beatles songs of all time. It's like,

1242
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,990
did they even write a hundred songs?
You know,

1243
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,940
they just do that so
people can, you know, they,

1244
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:41,060
I guess people always buy those magazines
and they go, Ooh, too, fuck, oh,

1245
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:41,894
can you put,

1246
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:46,220
oh hey bulldog in front of
while my guitar gently weeps.

1247
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:51,950
And then people write notes.
Was that really worth revisiting?

1248
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:53,780
I don't think it was.
Well those are my top three,

1249
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:58,190
top three fucking white chick
rock singers of all time. And um,

1250
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,450
well considering we've been
talking so much about Latino's,

1251
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:07,070
let's go with top three Latinos
of all time, Latinos singers.

1252
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,760
And this is when my whiteness is going
to come to see if I can even name three.

1253
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,610
Uh, Salina. They did a
movie about her, Selena,

1254
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:20,150
Jennifer Lopez and um,

1255
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,280
ah, fuck. This is embarrassing.

1256
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,160
Lucille Ball.

1257
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:28,960
Okay.

1258
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,100
And Lucille Ball. Fuck you. She
was made to Ricky Ricardo, Bam.

1259
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,720
Those are your three. But she never
really sang did she? What the fuck I know.

1260
01:17:37,721 --> 01:17:42,170
I know more than that. Celine.
I don't even know any songs.

1261
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:43,004
Selena sank.

1262
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,110
Okay.

1263
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:46,060
I just know she had a psycho fan.
That's all I know.

1264
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:50,110
And then Jennifer Lopez plater oh wait,
wait.

1265
01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:53,350
The chick from Miami sound machine,
right?

1266
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,020
What songs today saying, Ooh, my Amie,

1267
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:03,430
we're fuck and taken over.
What songs did they sing?

1268
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:07,000
I saw that fucking band stunk.
Miami sound machine,

1269
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:12,840
all that fucking turquoise with all that.
That just when I pictured them,

1270
01:18:12,841 --> 01:18:15,880
I just was a bunch of
people in puffy pants.

1271
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:17,770
Okay.

1272
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:22,690
And they had like 58 people on percussion
and unlike one keyboard and then she

1273
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:24,550
was skipping around in her boots,
right?

1274
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:28,420
Isn't that wasn't it what Miami sound
machine was the fuck songs? Did they say,

1275
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:32,290
God damn it.
I used to know all of this shit.

1276
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:36,280
I can't get that Robert Palmer shit
out of my head anyways, whatever.

1277
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:37,570
So I want to learn some,
tell me,

1278
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:40,360
give me your top three Latino
fucking singers of all time.

1279
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:44,110
I know somebody already compiling a
list and getting pissed at me because I

1280
01:18:44,111 --> 01:18:45,790
don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about,

1281
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:50,950
but that's what people do on this
podcast. Mike, last week I made a,

1282
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,470
I made a reference to the Pullman
strike when I was reading about a Grover

1283
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,560
Cleveland or some shit like that
and this guy wrote, he wrote, Hey,

1284
01:18:59,561 --> 01:19:00,790
uninformed bill.

1285
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:04,900
The reason they brought the military in
during the Pullman strike was because

1286
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:08,560
the workers in quotes, he
puts, we're becoming violent,

1287
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:13,300
not because they were striking because
they were attacking the alternate workers

1288
01:19:13,301 --> 01:19:17,290
brought in to fill the void of
labour caused by the strike.

1289
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:20,350
And this is hilarious.
The guy writes down his name,

1290
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,920
marketing and business
development coordinator.

1291
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:27,300
Yet you sound like the guy who would
side with the fucking people who,

1292
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:32,740
who are underpaying. It's first of
all, why do you put workers in in uh,

1293
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:33,920
okay.

1294
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,340
In parentheses.
You know what I mean?

1295
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,960
The strike was because the
workers were becoming violent.

1296
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,930
Not because they were striking
because they were attacking the,

1297
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:47,840
the scabs they brought
into to take their jobs.

1298
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:53,060
That's part of a strike yet dumb
fuck. You know, and you know,

1299
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:54,530
I love to sir,

1300
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:57,590
is the way you're acting as though you
had even heard of the Pullman strike

1301
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:59,930
before I said it.
That's that classic Internet Shit.

1302
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:01,340
We don't have to go to
the library anymore.

1303
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:04,370
He just look up the Pullman strike and
then you read two paragraphs and then

1304
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:09,360
you're like, oh actually, you know what
the reason you're just as dumb as me sir.

1305
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:13,830
Of course they attack the scab workers
brought him cause now they're going to be

1306
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:18,330
out of out of a job. And
that was my point. And who
does the military side with?

1307
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,470
Okay.

1308
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,500
The military works for the
fucking rich people. All right.

1309
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:24,540
And if you don't fucking believe that,

1310
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,940
that I'm not going to eat
another fucking coconut ball.

1311
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,520
Okay.

1312
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:33,140
Oh, it just gets better. No, it doesn't.

1313
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:39,020
All right, that's enough of that.
Jesus Christ. Jesus. All right,

1314
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:41,160
let's talk NFL football. Everybody. Oh,

1315
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,860
before I do the FM podcast.com,
everybody, um, I made a video on there,

1316
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:47,503
um,

1317
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:51,800
where I did a little tour of the comedy
store analysis stood outside the comedy

1318
01:20:51,801 --> 01:20:54,530
store and I talk shit about some of
the people walking by down the street.

1319
01:20:54,531 --> 01:20:59,010
If you guys want to check it out, go
to the [inaudible] podcast.com. Um,

1320
01:20:59,180 --> 01:20:59,961
the official,

1321
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:04,550
the one and only the only one there
is the official fan page of the Monday

1322
01:21:04,551 --> 01:21:05,570
morning podcast.

1323
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:10,960
And I also want to thank everybody who
went out and bought the Oh gene ringtone

1324
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:14,500
last week. All right. I uh,

1325
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:18,830
was very impressed with the
amount of people that, uh,

1326
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:21,830
that debt went ahead and bought the a
ringtone. If you didn't listen last week,

1327
01:21:21,831 --> 01:21:26,360
I have a new ring tone.
It all costs us 99 cents and um,

1328
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:27,490
you know,

1329
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:31,840
that way I don't have to really charge
for the fucking podcast and it's also a,

1330
01:21:31,841 --> 01:21:32,674
um,

1331
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:33,980
yeah,

1332
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:37,970
it's not required if you want to do
what you can. If you don't, you don't,

1333
01:21:37,971 --> 01:21:41,390
it's no big deal. And uh, we have
all the instructions up there.

1334
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,660
If you have an iPhone, it goes right onto
your phone. If you have a blackberry,

1335
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,780
there's like one little thing
you have to do with something,

1336
01:21:47,781 --> 01:21:52,340
but they have all the instructions on
the m and podcast on how to upload it to

1337
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:54,720
your phone. And, um,

1338
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:55,750
okay.

1339
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:58,750
You know, we just want to thank everybody
for being patient, uh, for a couple of,

1340
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:01,300
took a couple of days to explain it to,
to get the information out there.

1341
01:22:01,301 --> 01:22:02,650
So I wanted to thank you guys,

1342
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,620
but shipping it seriously means a lot
to me that people actually went out and

1343
01:22:05,621 --> 01:22:09,790
supported the podcasts like that. So
thank you. From the bottom of my heart.

1344
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:13,750
And the gentleman who runs the [inaudible]
podcast.com. All right. And with that

1345
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,533
bump up,

1346
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,360
it's time to talk about NFL football here.
Um,

1347
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:24,260
I actually was flying on a
plane during the Patriots game,

1348
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:28,010
so I can't really talk too much about it.
Other than that, I just, I was watching,

1349
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:32,750
I actually had satellite TV on, on the, on
the plane. So I was sitting there going,

1350
01:22:32,751 --> 01:22:34,190
ah, fuck, I'm gonna miss the fucking game.

1351
01:22:34,191 --> 01:22:39,170
And then I see that they're going to have
satellite TV and I got excited. Oh boy.

1352
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:42,620
Oh boy. Right. And I fucking turn
it on and all I get, I had NBC.

1353
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,420
Okay.

1354
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,670
And then the rest were like
discovery animal planet,

1355
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,640
and then they had three ESPN.

1356
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,420
So I'm praying how I hope
and pray that I will,

1357
01:22:53,421 --> 01:22:58,010
but today I am still just
a bill. Um, fuck you.

1358
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,620
The songs are in my head
because I'm hung over.

1359
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:05,860
I'm praying that the Patriots
game was going to be NBC.

1360
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:06,220
And

1361
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,860
it turned out that not only
was the game not on NBC,

1362
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,590
they didn't even have
a football game on NBC.

1363
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:15,670
They had some fucking
infomercial on insults.

1364
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,330
So I was like, you gotta be
fucking kidding me. Right?

1365
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:24,670
You gotta be fucking kidding me. And,
uh, so then I, I just was watching ESPN.

1366
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:29,240
I was watching all the college football
games that I already watched. Uh,

1367
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,030
I think Michigan's back everybody.

1368
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:32,600
Okay.

1369
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:37,600
Hail to the victors value at
hail to the vector at Bat.

1370
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,690
Bat Bat,

1371
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:44,250
Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat,
Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat,
Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat,

1372
01:23:44,251 --> 01:23:47,450
Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat,
Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, pat.

1373
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,431
Do you wanna just sit there?

1374
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:52,990
I did three fucking college songs and
they all sound the exact fucking same hail

1375
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:56,140
to the victors. Wake up
the echoes and fucking, uh,

1376
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,550
the Fleetwood Mac Trojan band.
It's all, all the same shit.

1377
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:03,790
I'm anyways, yes, I watched
that and I watch the, uh,

1378
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:08,260
the USA basketball game against a Turkey.
That was the shit.

1379
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,590
And uh, we won that
championship. But anyways,

1380
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:14,350
I was watching the ticker and by the way,

1381
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:18,040
what's his face there is going
to be the next superstar.

1382
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,040
And I saw him when he played in Seattle
and I can't even remember his fucking

1383
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:24,040
name already cause I'm
that fucking hung over.

1384
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:26,260
Come on brain work for me

1385
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,720
because with a d I can't fucking remember,
but he was a Shitty,

1386
01:24:32,721 --> 01:24:34,870
he was hitting fall away.
Three pointers as a six,

1387
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:37,150
10 I even what position you play?
I don't know.

1388
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:40,450
I don't know shit about basketball.
All right, let's plow ahead here. Um,

1389
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:47,040
patriots won the cults lost, so I'm
excited, right? I was also excited.

1390
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:50,550
How about Detroit? How about Cleveland?
Come on, you guys. You got to admit,

1391
01:24:50,551 --> 01:24:54,670
you know, you had a little bit, uh,
I think, I think that does this, uh,

1392
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:59,250
a ray of light. I didn't see any
either one of those fucking gains,

1393
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:02,730
but I was just,
I was just watching the ticker and um,

1394
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:07,500
I saw that that dude from out play
for cow best had two touchdowns.

1395
01:25:07,501 --> 01:25:12,420
Right. And Cleveland was basically one in
the fucking game right down to the end.

1396
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:15,060
I know I'm not trying to talk down to
you guys, but I'm just saying, you know,

1397
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:18,960
whatever your beat Miami, that's got
to feel good luck. You know what?

1398
01:25:18,961 --> 01:25:20,610
The main reason why I'm
bringing this shit up is,

1399
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,850
is because I want to say the shit before
the fucking game comes out tonight.

1400
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,770
I got 50 bucks on the ravens tonight.
Straight up. I bet at straight up.

1401
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,250
Even though the jets are favored by
like six, I don't know what the line is,

1402
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:35,670
but I was like, you know what? You can
keep your fucking points there, missy.

1403
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,760
I don't give a shit.
That's how confident I am.

1404
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,290
How fucking dumb or the New York jets,

1405
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,570
what did they,
can you just,

1406
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:50,630
can somebody explain to me the strategy
of pissing off every fucking every team

1407
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:57,180
in the league? Yeah. First of all,

1408
01:25:57,181 --> 01:26:02,181
I love it being a patriots fan because
for the first time in 10 fucking years,

1409
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:07,040
nobody was talking about bill Bellacheck.
Nobody was talking about the Patriots.

1410
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:09,020
Nobody was talking about Tom Brady.
Rarely.

1411
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,760
The guy even got into a
fucking car accident and that
was barely a fucking story

1412
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:19,270
compared to the shit storm that is
going on with the New York jets.

1413
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:24,680
What? What do they doing? Let
me ask you guys a question.

1414
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:28,850
How amped up does Ray Lewis get
before a football game when,

1415
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,220
when the other team hasn't
talked shit about them?

1416
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,730
I think they're out of their
fucking minds. Ray Lewis,

1417
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,370
I put it on my Facebook page.
That's my prediction.

1418
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:42,350
He is going to rip Sanchez his
fucking head off tonight. Sanchez.

1419
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,700
This guy who everybody,

1420
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:48,701
for some reason they're forgetting the
up and down season that he had last year

1421
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,260
and they're, they're acting like
they have this proven quarterback.

1422
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:58,370
I don't get it, man. And they went out
and they drafted all, they got signed,

1423
01:26:58,371 --> 01:26:59,540
all these free agents.

1424
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:03,740
They're really reminded me of the
University of Miami when they got off the

1425
01:27:03,741 --> 01:27:06,260
plane wearing the fatigues and
they were talking all this shit.

1426
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:10,100
And then when it came down
to it, they didn't fucking
win anything. Remember that?

1427
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:11,771
Or like the,

1428
01:27:11,771 --> 01:27:15,170
the Los Angeles Lakers when they added
Gary Payton and Karl Malone and you're

1429
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:19,760
thinking, how can they not fucking,
and then they didn't, I don't,

1430
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:23,840
I don't get it that that year when the
Patriots went undefeated in the regular

1431
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,870
season and then get their asses kicked in,
in the super bowl by the giants,

1432
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:32,110
it's like the hype was so fucking
big that from November on,

1433
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:34,700
we were playing playoff games.

1434
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:38,870
Teams were coming in so fucking
amped up to kick the shit out of us.

1435
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,300
It just wore,
it wore us down.

1436
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:44,960
It was down to me while no one's
paying attention to the giants,

1437
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:49,490
to the point that giants put up like 35
points and the last week of the season

1438
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:50,324
against us.

1439
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,350
And for some reason we was still 14 point
favorites three fucking weeks later to

1440
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:58,220
this day I kicked myself for
not taking that bet. And, uh,

1441
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,680
yeah,
it was ridiculous.

1442
01:28:00,681 --> 01:28:03,110
And meanwhile the giants had
beaten Tampa Bay in Tampa Bay.

1443
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,340
They beat Dallas in Dallas.

1444
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,950
They beat Green Bay and Green Bay and
no one's paying attention to them.

1445
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,110
Then everybody sat there with
their jaws in the ground.

1446
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:12,470
They kicked this didn't even kick the
shit out of us. They just beat us like,

1447
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,333
holy fuck.

1448
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,270
How did this team that beat three awesome
teams and their own fucking building

1449
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:20,600
come in and beat us?
[inaudible] it's fucking ridiculous.

1450
01:28:20,601 --> 01:28:25,601
So the jets have started their season at
zero and zero with the whole league as

1451
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:29,690
amped up the kick the shit out of them
as people were amped up to beat the

1452
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:34,160
fucking patriots it by mid November.
All right,

1453
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:38,060
and I'm telling you right now, they are
going to have a mediocre fucking season.

1454
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:39,980
I think it's going to start
off with the loss tonight.

1455
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,390
I'm not saying that they're not going
to go nine and seven, but these guys,

1456
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:47,270
I don't know what the fucking problem is
and not to mention that now they have a

1457
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:51,590
nice little scandal here. Cover the
daily news. They says cool. Your jets,

1458
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:56,360
TV reporters, flags team
for Lewd behavior, um,

1459
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:02,340
in his saints,
reporter for Azteca TV.

1460
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,680
Where the fuck is that broadcast?
It's is at the center of a jet Brouhaha.

1461
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:14,190
Basically, if you see this girl,
she's fucking hottie right?

1462
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,240
She's got her little pass here and uh,
you know,

1463
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:21,330
she's got some Cleveland show.
Oh my God. Are you serious?

1464
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,850
They got a picture of
her edit jets practice.

1465
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,900
She's got on the tightest fucking jeans
I've ever seen in my life with the most

1466
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:34,740
perfect round ass you've ever seen.
And she's in high heels.

1467
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,181
Okay.

1468
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:39,780
And she's walking around a bunch of
football players who got that testosterone

1469
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:43,110
going with a fat shit talk and coach,
let me guess.

1470
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:47,700
Somebody said something out of
line. Oh, this is just, this is,

1471
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,740
you know what I mean?
This right here,

1472
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:51,510
and this is one of these
things where you can't say,

1473
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,470
well look how you're dressed. Cause
they go, you're blaming the victim.

1474
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:01,220
She should have a right to have three
quarters ever tents outside of her shirt

1475
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,740
with a thong going up
her fucking ass crack.

1476
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:09,741
And she should be allowed to walk into
a locker room with a bunch of football

1477
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:14,781
players and not have one out of fucking
whatever the fuck you're going to say.

1478
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:17,460
Well,
one fucking rude comic gimme a break.

1479
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:22,980
Nfl boss Roger Goodell was demanding
answers last night from jets players.

1480
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:27,130
But why don't you look at
the pictures, Roger? Huh?

1481
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:31,510
What are you a fucking unit? You don't
understand what the problem was. Uh,

1482
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:32,161
for players,

1483
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:37,161
coaches accused of subjecting of female
sports reporter to sexist locker room

1484
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:42,540
conduct, they should've just said for
subjecting her to lock a rum conduct.

1485
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,130
This is basically what happened.

1486
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:48,780
She went into a locker room and was
subjected to locker room conduct.

1487
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:49,643
Can you believe it?

1488
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:54,780
I remember last night when I went out
to a bar and I was subjected to bar room

1489
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:57,180
conduct. I couldn't
believe it. I was like,

1490
01:30:57,181 --> 01:31:02,181
what am I in a bar or something as they
prepare for their season opener tonight,

1491
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:07,170
gang green is dealing with the burgeoning
scandal over the treatment of Inez

1492
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:12,120
Saints, uh, for Azteca of
Mexico. This girl is a 10.

1493
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:15,310
She's fucking smoking gorgeous Emmy.

1494
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:19,860
You got to see the way she's dressed.
Okay.

1495
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,480
And Fuck you ladies. Fuck you. Look at
the way she's dressed. She's one of those,

1496
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:27,390
you know what's funny about the broads
out there is this is the kind of girl,

1497
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,190
right? The kind of woman that kind
of fucking who, uh, who, if you know,

1498
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:35,180
if any of these women,
you know who will listen to his podcast,

1499
01:31:35,181 --> 01:31:38,070
they're walking down the street with
their husband and this girl comes walking

1500
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:40,260
by, they immediately, they
date fucking, you know,

1501
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:43,590
in the eyes become like little
slits. Is He looking at me? You know,

1502
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:46,530
and then they're looking at their husband
and they're going to get mad at you

1503
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,260
because this other bitch goes to the gym.
You know,

1504
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:55,200
like somehow it's your fucking fault
and they fucking looking at you because

1505
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:58,320
they can't just come out and say, oh
my God, that girl is fucking gorgeous.

1506
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:02,650
I'm so jealous her, they, they
can't, they can't own that emotion.

1507
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:06,550
So then they look at you and they're
just waiting for you to glance and that

1508
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:08,140
part and that woman's direction.

1509
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:13,600
So they can blame you that just fuck
another girl is eating right and and

1510
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:17,830
fucking doing herself up right?
It's going to become your fucking fault.

1511
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:21,190
I used to do a bit about that.
Next time you, you know what?

1512
01:32:21,191 --> 01:32:22,320
Here's one for you guys on a burn.

1513
01:32:22,321 --> 01:32:24,110
A joke right here that I
never fucking recorded.

1514
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:26,680
So who gives a shit next time you're
walking down the street with your

1515
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:27,071
girlfriend,

1516
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:31,000
right in this fucking unbelievably
smoking shit comes walking up the street,

1517
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:33,520
right? And what do you got? And she
immediately just looks at you like,

1518
01:32:33,521 --> 01:32:36,610
go ahead and look at her so I can take
out my fucking hatred of this better

1519
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:39,430
looking girl and make it your fucking
fault, right? This is what you do.

1520
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:42,480
Rather than trying to look away
and having blood come out of your,

1521
01:32:42,481 --> 01:32:45,040
out of your eyes, you try not to
look at this fucking hot piece.

1522
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,360
Hey should coming up the street.

1523
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:51,250
What you do is you fucking point right
at her and whatever she's wearing,

1524
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,850
you tell your girl that she'd
looked great in that you point read.

1525
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:57,550
Then it'd be like, you know what? You'd
look great in a dress like that, right?

1526
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,360
And then immediately just a p, you
know, it, it makes their insecurity go,

1527
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:04,020
oh my God. Really? Do you think I could
get away with wearing something day?

1528
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:08,260
Totally used to girls feeling good.
You're staring at the girl's ass.

1529
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:10,960
You're talking about the cut of the dress.
It's bullshit.

1530
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,040
You're checking around without
disrespecting a woman. See right there.

1531
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:19,390
Bill burr bringing couples together.
All right, let's continue on here. Um,

1532
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,910
so this woman, 32 years old, 32 years old,

1533
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,940
still in smoking fucking shape of former
Miss Universe contestant complained.

1534
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:35,200
She was bombarded with cat calls
and boarish antics at the jets,

1535
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:40,180
New Jersey training facility to the
extent she wanted to. And in quotes said,

1536
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:43,960
cover my ears. Um, dying of embarrassment.

1537
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:46,690
This woman,
right?

1538
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:52,050
Former Miss Universe contestant who
would walk on stage with a fucking string

1539
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:56,440
bikini and high heels with a hoo ha
hanging out talking about how to save

1540
01:33:56,441 --> 01:34:00,920
Greenland or whatever is
embarrassed because she walked
around. I mean, give me a,

1541
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:05,230
you know what I mean?
This is why women stink.

1542
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:10,150
It's like, what are you
doing there? To begin with.

1543
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:13,840
It's a bunch of guys playing football.
It's like,

1544
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:18,640
and then we're cool enough to let you in
there and then everybody has to fucking

1545
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:23,380
adjust their behavior because your,
their wig scares me.

1546
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:27,910
Scares me. There's a lady
present. You know what I mean?

1547
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:32,920
And you'll wonder why you get
called a cunt. That's why.

1548
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:37,030
Right fucking there.
It's just fucking unbelievable.

1549
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,340
I would never walk into a god damn baby
shower and be, oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

1550
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:43,510
There's a guide present.

1551
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:47,590
Can we put a fucking
game on Ovia I wouldn't,

1552
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:52,600
I'd be standing in the corner going, oh
Geez, when is this Shit gonna be over?

1553
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:56,410
But I wouldn't at any point try to cock
block what anybody was fucking talking

1554
01:34:56,411 --> 01:34:58,740
about.
Go and talk about sex in the city.

1555
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,420
Talk about your favorite shoes or whatever
the fuck it is you do. I wouldn't,

1556
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:04,540
okay.

1557
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:06,820
Be covering my ears.
Dying of embarrassment.

1558
01:35:06,821 --> 01:35:09,760
If you all started talking about
my package, I'd be flattered.

1559
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,470
Um, this is some of the
more, more ignorant shit that
I've said on this podcast,

1560
01:35:15,471 --> 01:35:18,380
but I think there's a point behind this.
Let's continue with the article.

1561
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:20,063
MMM,

1562
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:23,150
good. Al. It's just said,
I'm dying of embarrassment.

1563
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:26,990
Saints tweeted in Spanish,
um,

1564
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:31,991
Goodell immediately ordered
an investigation into the
troubling in air quotes,

1565
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:36,800
allegations, which were addressed
in a team meeting last night. Uh,

1566
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:39,320
this meeting is now called to order,
uh,

1567
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:43,130
last night when that smoking hot chick
with the tight clothes came in and

1568
01:35:43,131 --> 01:35:46,100
everybody said, God Damn, look
at that fucking ass. Yeah,

1569
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:47,050
you're not allowed to do that.

1570
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:53,110
Uh, excuse me, coach. Ah,
yeah. Yes sir. Yeah, we,

1571
01:35:53,111 --> 01:35:54,910
you talking about that
girl who came in and,

1572
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,880
and Teddy's way hanging out of her
shirt? Yeah, that one. Yeah, that one.

1573
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,010
We a disrespected her.

1574
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:08,140
See, this is, this is the deal.
All right. They come down,

1575
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:12,910
they want the fucking attention. You
know what? Wait, what? What is she,

1576
01:36:12,911 --> 01:36:15,520
what is she doing in the fucking
locker room to begin with?

1577
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:20,260
You know what? She even in the locker
room, did I even, they even say that,

1578
01:36:20,261 --> 01:36:24,730
I can't remember. Didn't you see any given
Sunday? You don't remember that movie?

1579
01:36:24,731 --> 01:36:27,100
You're going to stand there and there's
gonna be some black dude with a dick

1580
01:36:27,101 --> 01:36:30,400
down to the floor. I mean, why are
you going in? I wouldn't go in there

1581
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:34,240
if I went in there,
they'd start giving me cat calls.

1582
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:39,220
Like I was that fresh fish guy when the
beginning of shots, Shawshank redemption.

1583
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:40,980
Okay.

1584
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:44,970
And I'd be dying of embarrassment too, but
I'd fucking take it. It'd be like, yeah,

1585
01:36:44,971 --> 01:36:48,960
well what the fuck did you think was
going to happen? You're a fucking pansy.

1586
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,000
And he'd come walking
into an NFL locker room.

1587
01:36:51,001 --> 01:36:53,010
They're all going to give you
shit and say you're a pussy,

1588
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:54,773
right?

1589
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:58,700
I mean, what kind of a fucking
world are we living in now?

1590
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:00,890
When a gorgeous woman wearing tight,

1591
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:05,891
ridiculous clothes is going to walk into
a fucking at a football practice and

1592
01:37:06,021 --> 01:37:09,860
she's going to get upset, that's that
she got unwanted attention. Well,

1593
01:37:09,861 --> 01:37:12,950
why don't you come there and dress
like they did in the 18 hundreds

1594
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:17,060
with one of their big hoop skirts and
they can't see you fucking thighs.

1595
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,560
This chick is fucking ridiculous.
Look,

1596
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:25,310
look at the New York Daily News and look
at the little inset picture that they

1597
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:29,540
have of her. I'm sure they did it for
a fucking reason. It's ridiculous.

1598
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,800
Look at that fucking ass. Look at,
that's the first thing I think.

1599
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:37,910
Look at that fucking ass. Jesus
Christ. And then she's holding a mic.

1600
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:41,180
It looks like a dick in her hand while
she bobbing her head up and down and she

1601
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:43,310
asked a questions.
This is like entrapment.

1602
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,140
Yeah.

1603
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:48,900
Anyways, let's fucking
continue. Um, but, but papa,

1604
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:52,580
we've had contact with the team multiple
times and are moving very aggressively

1605
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:56,160
to establish the facts.
The NFL spokesman, Greg,

1606
01:37:56,230 --> 01:38:01,230
I Hilo said jets owner woody Johnson
woke up from his coma and said,

1607
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:04,090
oh, wait, that guy none off.
That guy is actually young, uh,

1608
01:38:04,091 --> 01:38:09,000
called saints to hear his side of the
story and said that the team will take any

1609
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:12,960
appropriate steps necessary to maintain
a respectful environment for the media.

1610
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:13,471
Basically,

1611
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:18,471
this girl is now going to become a
fucking millionaire off of this lawsuit

1612
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:24,230
because she walked to an NFL practice
with her Miss Universe body with tight

1613
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:27,150
fucking clothes on. And
somebody said, God Damn,

1614
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,860
look at that fucking ass right there.
Hey mark.

1615
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:33,240
What the fuck would you do with dad?

1616
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:38,430
I fucking bedroom over fucking
table and then fucking rex. Ryan.

1617
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:41,850
I can't even see him. My fucking
my fucking stomach. So big. Huh?

1618
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:45,720
Was that a good one? Players. Do you
guys like me? I talk just like you.

1619
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:47,940
I can't wait for them
to fucking lose tonight.

1620
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,680
They're going to get their fucking asses
kicked and I can get their asses kicked

1621
01:38:52,681 --> 01:38:54,390
butt. They're going to
lose. They're going to lose,

1622
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:56,640
and then they're going to
have a short week. All right,

1623
01:38:56,790 --> 01:39:00,350
and guess who's back the
New England patriots? Huh?

1624
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:04,710
38 fucking points up
against. Oh, chose Sinco.

1625
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:10,110
Tarell Owens. Cade McNabb down.
What's the name of your quarterback?

1626
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,810
Something. Wilson. I don't even know
the name of your fucking quarterback.

1627
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:15,090
He was awesome.
And then he got hurt.

1628
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,800
He's actually a good quarterback
with the fuck's his name.

1629
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:21,060
I know it's not caving now.
Ucla fucking Heisman trophy winner.

1630
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:24,420
Classic Chicago Bear
quarterback drug draft.

1631
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:28,890
They love Kate Mcdowell and they loved
the Rex Grossman. For some reason,

1632
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:32,670
they didn't like Doug Flutie. Let's keep,
let's ship him out of there. Really,

1633
01:39:32,671 --> 01:39:35,220
you want to ship a proven winner out?
Absolutely.

1634
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:39,570
We don't want him around here
leading the team to victories.

1635
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:45,660
Where the fuck is the Goddamn
patriots game here? Oh, Carson Palmer.

1636
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:51,120
This is what I love about that man.
He was 34 50 for 345 yards. Oh,

1637
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:54,450
chose Sinco had 12 catches for 159 yards.

1638
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,580
All right.
Yet they only scored 24 fucking points.

1639
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:04,920
You know my buddy was saying it, they
getting back to that bend but don't break.

1640
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:08,610
You know, someone else was telling me
Bella check is doing the defense again,

1641
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,530
which is his fucking, that's,
that's what he does. I Dunno.

1642
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,670
I have a, I have high hopes, but you know,
it's not about the patriots this year.

1643
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:22,400
It's all about the j e t s jets, jets,
jets. Right. Running the fucking yaps.

1644
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,430
You wanted the attention. Now you
got it. Oh, I can't fucking wait.

1645
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:31,230
You guys looked up to stats of
that fucking Joe Flacco. Joe Falco,

1646
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:33,060
whatever the fuck his name is.
I didn't know what his name is.

1647
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,610
All I know is they raped us
last year in the playoffs.

1648
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:39,840
You got ray rice is going to be running
all over you fucking cunts. Huh?

1649
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:43,080
What do you think? Cause you got
that old guy from the dolphins,

1650
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:44,460
that good looking son of a bitch.

1651
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:48,750
You should be doing fucking underwear
ads like Jim Palmer. That's the guy.

1652
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,430
That's the guy that's
going to stop everybody.

1653
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:53,130
That dude has been showing
up late to practice.

1654
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:56,200
Rex Ryan is making a joke out of it
because he has such a fucking need to be

1655
01:40:56,201 --> 01:40:59,290
liked by his own God damn players.
You wait,

1656
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:03,880
you wait till the fucking wheels fall
off. All right, here's a contest I want.

1657
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:05,710
I want to introduce here.
How bout

1658
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,920
whoever guesses which week?

1659
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:13,690
Rex Ryan's going to fucking
cry first after which game.

1660
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,010
If you pick it right,

1661
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:19,390
I'm going to send you an autographed copy
of my new fucking DVD. So there you go.

1662
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:24,280
People, you got fucking 17 weeks to
pick when actually not this week,

1663
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:26,050
16 weeks.
I'm including the bye week.

1664
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:30,610
The first week he's going to start fucking
crying because somebody criticized,

1665
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:35,500
you know, somebody stole his m and m
flavored fucking ice cream. All right.

1666
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:38,710
Enough of this shit. That's
my thing. I got 50 bucks,

1667
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:42,460
50 bucks in the Ravens and I'm confident.

1668
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:47,710
I'm confident that not only I didn't
even take the spread straight up.

1669
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,840
Can you tell,
I don't know what else to talk about.

1670
01:41:49,841 --> 01:41:51,850
I just keep saying over and
over again what my bed is.

1671
01:41:51,851 --> 01:41:56,360
Let's talk about depression, shall
we? Speaking of fucking Rex Ryan, um,

1672
01:41:56,410 --> 01:42:00,700
somebody sent me a long email here
that should eat up some time. Um,

1673
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:02,410
I actually did,
I tell you guys last night,

1674
01:42:02,411 --> 01:42:06,870
we actually recorded me and to Rosa got
fucking hammered last night and we were

1675
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:10,210
like, you know, we should do, we should
go home and record a drunk, uninformed.

1676
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,430
And I'm like, well I have to do the
Monday morning podcast. He goes,

1677
01:42:12,431 --> 01:42:13,570
we'll fucking do that too.

1678
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:19,080
So last night for an hour in a half as
we sat there drinking and getting even

1679
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:26,920
more drunk, drunk, horror, whatever
the fucking word is, we recorded,

1680
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,660
we talked for at least an hour and a half.

1681
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:32,410
The record is shut off at an hour and
15 fucking minutes and you just hear us

1682
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:36,340
get progressively more and more
drunk. Uh, I listened to it.

1683
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:40,930
There's a lot of funny moments, but it's
just way too long. So I am going to,

1684
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,500
I'm going to edit it, I'm going
to dice it up and I'll, I'll,

1685
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:49,480
I'll put together a greatest hits of
it. They got that coming up, but I just,

1686
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,160
it was just too much self sabotage.

1687
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:53,080
It's like I got my special
coming out this week.

1688
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:57,790
I really had to make sure I hyped it
and I completely was not hyping it in a,

1689
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:01,360
in a great way. Uh, you know,
it was just that it was bad,

1690
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:03,620
it was bad and there was a lot of,
uh,

1691
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:09,040
embarrassing moments and you
know, I, you know, I'm just,

1692
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,980
I'm going to edit it people, that's
what I'm trying to say. All right,

1693
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:14,530
go fuck yourselves. And not
putting it all up. All right.

1694
01:43:14,531 --> 01:43:15,700
Youtube videos of the week.

1695
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:20,290
A fat kid goes insane after
getting air horn in the face.

1696
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:24,850
Try to guess what that one's about. Fat
Kid goes insane after getting air horn,

1697
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:29,620
air horn in the face. Ed,
uh, this kid, his face,

1698
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,850
he looks like, if, if precious
was a white eight year old,

1699
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:39,100
just picture that face. That's what
this kid looks like. All right.

1700
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:42,190
Here's what I'm sure everybody
saw us says face verse watermelon.

1701
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:44,080
This is somebody on the amazing race.

1702
01:43:44,081 --> 01:43:47,500
It took a sling shot and shot a
watermelon on a fucking candle up.

1703
01:43:47,501 --> 01:43:50,500
I don't know what it was, and it came
back and blast her right in the face.

1704
01:43:50,501 --> 01:43:51,980
It's absolutely hilarious.
They

1705
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,630
actually showed it on ESPN.

1706
01:43:53,631 --> 01:43:58,130
They did the top 10 funny sports moments
of the week and hers was number one.

1707
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:01,430
And you know what they
did because she's abroad.

1708
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,730
What they had to do was they put,
you know,

1709
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,830
you know when they had the list of shit
that they're going to talk about coming

1710
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:10,220
up on the right hand part of the
screen on and nowhere right before the

1711
01:44:10,221 --> 01:44:12,530
cantaloupe or watermelon
blasts her in the face,

1712
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,170
they put that up and
half censored her head.

1713
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,490
Cause I can guarantee you there
was some woman there going,

1714
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:24,290
this is going to Jeff, it's going
to um, cause violence against women.

1715
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,110
How is it going to cause
violence against women?

1716
01:44:27,111 --> 01:44:32,111
Because the way the watermelon
just slaps her in the face is Jay.

1717
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:37,910
It was self self-inflicted. That's
one of those things, once again,

1718
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:41,210
those double standard. If a guy did
that, do you think they'd censored?

1719
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:45,410
What if it came back and hit him in his
nuts and he actually lost the ability to

1720
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:50,000
have a child? They still would've shown
that completely uncensored. Wait a minute.

1721
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,130
Is this a special guests who
just walked in? Joe, I got lucky.

1722
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:58,590
I got another eight minutes. Just
sit down and help me throw it. Oh,

1723
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:02,060
don't be a fag. Get Elvia pick up
the microphone. Ladies and gentlemen,

1724
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:07,190
look who just walked in. Hey folks, Joe
to Rosa. Oh, are you? Jesus Christ. Joe,

1725
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:09,520
what are you doing here? I uh, you know,

1726
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:13,130
I'm just walking through the studio
bill or I saw you through the glass.

1727
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,300
This is like that moment when fucking
Johnny Carson and walked over to, uh,

1728
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:19,910
what's his face,
his sitcom when he was doing CPO.

1729
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:24,320
Sharkey remember that when he broke
his, uh, what's his name? Dom. Dom.

1730
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:28,400
Dom Delouis. Don Rickles. Yeah. He just
kept walking and this is very old school.

1731
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:32,420
Yeah. I just actually alluded to
them. Uh, and not even alluded.

1732
01:45:32,421 --> 01:45:34,730
I mentioned that we did a podcast.
I finally did talk to her.

1733
01:45:34,731 --> 01:45:36,200
We did a podcast last night,

1734
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:40,880
completely fucking shift faced
and a of the hour and 14 minutes.

1735
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:43,610
How much do you think is going to be
funny that we can actually chop up?

1736
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:46,670
I think at least four minutes
of it was really good.

1737
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:51,530
I think the bulk of it was funny. It,
which was at a good point about like,

1738
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:53,240
it's just a little too much all at once.

1739
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:56,330
Like you got to split it up a little bit
and it just kept meandering and then by

1740
01:45:56,331 --> 01:45:57,600
the end I was just really,

1741
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:01,160
I was really getting into your financial
businesses of some deal that you had

1742
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,680
and we were like, yeah, we don't, we
don't want that on there. Yeah. Yeah.

1743
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:08,690
Let me tell you about that concept as
business chow. It was really sloppy,

1744
01:46:08,691 --> 01:46:12,530
but dude, I got to tell you
a fucking hilarious on it
you to, I loved it. I loved,

1745
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,400
I was little. I was, I was kind of an
angry let's that whiskey shit dude bear.

1746
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:21,260
I'm a happy drunk. You know.
Don't blame them. Don't blame
the whiskey bill. No, no.

1747
01:46:21,261 --> 01:46:25,280
I'm already angry. But like when I, when
I'm fucking, when I'm sober, I keep,

1748
01:46:25,281 --> 01:46:29,120
I keep it in check for the most part, for
the most part, but when I drink whiskey,

1749
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:30,380
then I'm not, if I drink beer, you know,

1750
01:46:30,381 --> 01:46:34,050
I got my arm around people and
we'll all go down together.

1751
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:39,080
They're all singing songs. Right.
I'm good time Charlie with the beer.

1752
01:46:39,081 --> 01:46:43,190
I start drinking whiskey. Oh, it's
awful. Do. Can you finish chewing?

1753
01:46:43,191 --> 01:46:47,090
Whatever's in your mouth to fingernail
is biting my nails through the just

1754
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:51,690
checking. No, I'm sorry. No,
spit it out. You yelled at
me to get over here and shit.

1755
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:55,310
Yeah. What do you want me to
do? I want you to fucking up.

1756
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:57,010
See what happens.

1757
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,550
Why be a professional,

1758
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:06,730
you know, Joe, you look at this, you know
I was just going, I just went off on this.

1759
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,860
Can you see this woman here? She walked.
She showed up at a, at a NFL practice.

1760
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:16,210
This former Miss Universe here.
Look how she dressed at the practice.

1761
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:19,720
Oh yeah, we're can. Good. She's
hot. Well what? Yeah, and I guess,

1762
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,940
and evidently somebody
made some people made,

1763
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,940
she was subjected to cat calling Joe.
Can you imagine that?

1764
01:47:24,941 --> 01:47:25,960
You could look like that,

1765
01:47:25,961 --> 01:47:29,770
dress like that and you can't go to
an NFL practice without getting cash.

1766
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:34,390
She upset about it. Upset. She
tweeted in Spanish that she was,

1767
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:38,520
I'm dying of embarrassment.
She had to cover her ears. Yes.

1768
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:41,020
Well look, I got to say
though, she looks great,

1769
01:47:41,021 --> 01:47:42,970
but she is wearing jeans and a shirt.
It's like,

1770
01:47:42,971 --> 01:47:45,700
what the hell is she supposed to wear
something? She's in a mini skirt. Okay,

1771
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,820
Joe, she's wearing high
heels. Look at a Joe.

1772
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:51,760
How tight of those God damn jeans
righteously today, Really Gel.

1773
01:47:51,761 --> 01:47:54,650
What would you do with that
Joe? Uh, Bill, me fucking

1774
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:59,150
leave it in disappointment.
Look,

1775
01:47:59,151 --> 01:48:01,070
I'm not looking.
I'm not condoning that you shouldn't.

1776
01:48:01,071 --> 01:48:03,650
You shouldn't do that day
she was asking for it.

1777
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,220
She was though.
She is Jesus.

1778
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:13,970
What the hell she's supposed
to wear? What's he supposed
to wear? Sweat pants. Joe.

1779
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:18,350
Is it possible for those
genes to get any tighter? No,

1780
01:48:18,351 --> 01:48:21,230
but that's how chicks wear their jeans.
Chicks don't wear baggy jeans.

1781
01:48:21,231 --> 01:48:23,360
They wear tight jeans and
you know something. Joe,

1782
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:27,420
why don't you just walk back out the
door and bring in the fucking Joe Derosa

1783
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:32,030
that I know. All right. All right,
Joe. He's a no show the rock.

1784
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:33,870
I'm kidding.
What Joe,

1785
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:36,980
if I walk through central park at
three in the fucking morning dress like

1786
01:48:36,981 --> 01:48:38,290
Liberace,
singing almond,

1787
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:41,540
the money and I get the shit kicked
out of me and I get mugged, it's wrong.

1788
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:43,310
I should be able to do that,

1789
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:48,050
but do I have any sort of fucking
personal responsibility for my own fucking

1790
01:48:48,051 --> 01:48:52,420
safety? All right. You know, we'll go to
a football practice. She's got high heels,

1791
01:48:52,421 --> 01:48:52,851
shoes.
She,

1792
01:48:52,851 --> 01:48:57,851
you know what first thing that drops a
girls sex sex is down by at least 30% is

1793
01:48:58,251 --> 01:49:00,920
when they wear those flats.
Is that the worst when you,

1794
01:49:00,921 --> 01:49:03,320
when you're in a relationship and they
get so comfortable that they stopped

1795
01:49:03,321 --> 01:49:04,500
jacking their ass up?
Yeah.

1796
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,740
And they just wear the flats and
all of a sudden they look like,

1797
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,290
like they're a little clown
climbing out of a car. Yeah.

1798
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:12,650
She should have worn those. You're doing
your, you're preaching to the choir. I,

1799
01:49:12,651 --> 01:49:14,840
I'm doing a bit of doing it my bit,

1800
01:49:14,841 --> 01:49:19,260
a bit in my act right now about take
your lashes like you chose this role and

1801
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,300
the why you defending this girl. I'm
saying I'm, I'm you, you convert.

1802
01:49:23,301 --> 01:49:25,020
You convinced me.
The centerpiece,

1803
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:28,210
the center centerpiece of
the or the bid is that, uh,

1804
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:32,240
it's about this fat girl cock blocking
me with the skinny girl and doing the

1805
01:49:32,241 --> 01:49:36,080
whole angry fat girl thing. And it's
like, yeah, it's just like, you know,

1806
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:39,650
I didn't eat all the egg sandwiches
you did. That was your decision.

1807
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,940
You're going to get mad at me that I'm
not leap frogging over your hot friend to

1808
01:49:43,941 --> 01:49:46,310
get a shot of your Michelin
man body. Right. That way

1809
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,960
there's nothing wrong with
it. You're fat. That's okay.

1810
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:52,420
But take the fucking hit sometimes.
You know what I mean?

1811
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:53,620
It's not fair to everybody else.

1812
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:56,440
You're waltzing around like you're a
piece of tail. You're not, you know,

1813
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:01,240
he's sitting there like a walrus.
Sunning yourself at the bar. Yeah.

1814
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:03,410
But my whole thing too is
like, you know, I'm part Arab.

1815
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,930
If I wear a turban on an airplane,

1816
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:07,270
I gotta be ready for a couple
of people to be like, Ooh,

1817
01:50:07,271 --> 01:50:12,130
but what the fuck is going on over
here? Come from your territory, dude.

1818
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:15,250
She is. Look at, I'm not
saying that she's a bad person.

1819
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:17,590
She looks like she's fucking gorgeous.
But she doesn't.

1820
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:20,290
She doesn't look like I look at it.
Who was at the shirt she was wearing?

1821
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:25,480
That's the, this is, well that's her at
the super bowl. But is that the shot?

1822
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:28,810
The shot you showed me in the,
in the actual article was the ass shot,

1823
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:32,110
is that what she looked like
from the front? That is her.

1824
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:33,850
I mean that's not her at the practice,
but yeah,

1825
01:50:33,851 --> 01:50:36,220
that's what she thinks she's
wearing that night club top.

1826
01:50:36,221 --> 01:50:40,510
She's got like the diamonds on the tits.
Tits. Yeah. Glittery tits shirt. Yeah.

1827
01:50:40,511 --> 01:50:45,460
It's ridiculous. Glittery
Ted. I mean, look, yeah,

1828
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:50,020
you can't, you got to understand,
this is what pisses me off Joe,

1829
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:54,640
is it's NFL football. It's a guy sport.
There's a bunch of guys playing it.

1830
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:56,470
Nobody asks you to fucking come there.

1831
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,440
You inserted yourself into
that situation and this, this,

1832
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:02,500
I'm repeating myself on the podcast,
but just to hear your opinion,

1833
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,030
that's when don't you hate that one?

1834
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:06,280
If much guys hanging out and
shooting shit and we're talking,

1835
01:51:06,281 --> 01:51:09,100
then I'll send you this. Could skin
with me ski. That's a lady present.

1836
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:14,620
And then all the fun just stops and
everybody has to adjust their fucking

1837
01:51:14,621 --> 01:51:17,800
behavior because you're there.
You know what my favorite thing ever

1838
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:22,030
some hate is when,
uh,

1839
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:26,530
like a waitress will say that to a bunch
of drunk guys and there's always the

1840
01:51:26,531 --> 01:51:28,840
one 50, you know, the
waitress will go like, uh,

1841
01:51:28,841 --> 01:51:31,730
is that how you talk in
front of a lady? And, and uh,

1842
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:34,060
and then there's always one 50
year old drug that goes, well,

1843
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:38,620
why don't you show me a fucking
lady? And I'll tell you, you know,

1844
01:51:38,621 --> 01:51:43,210
it's such an old joke, but it always
gets a laugh. It always gets a laugh.

1845
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:47,350
That's just nothing. Uh, you
know, somebody was telling me, um,

1846
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:52,630
I, when I was, I was out in Denver,
they were saying that they will,

1847
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,920
they went out to go shoot
pool. Right. So shoot,

1848
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:58,930
now I remember they were shooting
pool and there was a, you know,

1849
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,210
they were kicking the shit out of these
guys and there was this group of guys

1850
01:52:01,211 --> 01:52:02,140
they had next,
right?

1851
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:05,170
And then some girl Cottey comes up
and she didn't want to fucking wait.

1852
01:52:05,171 --> 01:52:06,190
She puts her money down,

1853
01:52:06,191 --> 01:52:10,540
but she's so fucking hot that these other
ball is jackasses. They let her cut,

1854
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:14,770
right? And then she's making this big,
and then she's just such a already,

1855
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:17,740
just an arrogant fucking twat
that these guys are like, look,

1856
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:20,290
we don't want to play. We don't want to
play. You were going to play those guys,

1857
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:23,020
right? And she gets blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, giving him shit.

1858
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,310
And he goes, look, we're not playing.

1859
01:52:24,311 --> 01:52:28,240
You were playing those guys and she
took a full drink and throw it in.

1860
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:33,220
This guy's oof. So I go, well,
you can't hit on. What do you do?

1861
01:52:33,221 --> 01:52:37,110
He goes, Oh, this guy's brilliant.
He, he's a spitter. He doesn't,

1862
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:41,740
he just went, she goes, and
he was so fucking, she goes,
what are you going to do?

1863
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:44,760
And you get a hit me. He goes, no,
I'm not going to hit need. Eagles

1864
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:50,180
hit her right in the chest and it
rolled down between her titties.

1865
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:54,410
And this is the worst part. The
bouncers come over, flipping the end.

1866
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:59,050
They fucking of course go. And, and those
guys who she cut all fucking ran it at,

1867
01:52:59,051 --> 01:53:03,310
at the dude who just did
that shit. Oh, that's great.
Just immediately fuck it all.

1868
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:05,540
Yeah, because spitting on
somebody is so much worse.

1869
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,960
I'd much rather get blasted in the fid.
I even take the brain damage.

1870
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:12,710
Did you ever hear that? Do you ever
that Tony Roberts joke where he's like,

1871
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:16,720
he's like fucked up to hit a woman. I
would never hit all right. I'm bullshit.

1872
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:19,743
Okay.

1873
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:23,210
But he's like, if you put your hands
on me, I'll fucking lay out. He's all,

1874
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:27,450
that's awesome stuff. I could hit
me fine. Don't do this whole bit.

1875
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:32,370
Go see Tony Robbins. Oh wait,
I gotta finish this bit.
It's so funny, Dude. He goes,

1876
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:34,620
you see those commercials?
All right you guys.

1877
01:53:34,770 --> 01:53:38,880
Every 12 seconds a woman is hit in
this country. And he goes, he goes,

1878
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:42,360
they don't tell you how every eight
seconds there's a bitch in your face.

1879
01:53:42,361 --> 01:53:42,750
Go ahead.

1880
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:46,650
How about buy, buy, buy, buy
baby. And he goes, I warn you,

1881
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:49,710
bitch you at four seconds.

1882
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,860
Tony Robbins is one of the most
underrated comedians of all time.

1883
01:53:55,861 --> 01:54:00,210
That guy is so fucking ridiculously
talented. He's so funny. Yeah,

1884
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:03,540
I saw him on comedy central buckle.
Ridiculously talented dude.

1885
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:06,870
He's unbelievably humble.
I saw him on comedy central and he,

1886
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:09,180
I think he just starts the bit like this.

1887
01:54:09,181 --> 01:54:12,390
He just goes and it was so good because
I fucking hate Wendy Williams. He goes,

1888
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:15,990
Wendy Williams and Danny Glover
or the same motherfucking person.

1889
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,740
All right, well we got to
wrap up the podcast here. Joe,

1890
01:54:24,741 --> 01:54:28,040
with the squeaky little voice.
It really just annoyed me. Oh me,

1891
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:31,090
Oh,
oh,

1892
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:35,500
here's another youtube video to watch.
Uh, go to [inaudible] dot com, uh,

1893
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:39,490
bill dances. Classic bloopers. Joe
Actually have to show you this one.

1894
01:54:39,491 --> 01:54:44,050
This is like a guy trying to do a fishing
show and one of them, I swear to God,

1895
01:54:44,051 --> 01:54:45,880
I can't believe that it's actually true.

1896
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:49,810
He's going down the river
and in the distance,

1897
01:54:49,811 --> 01:54:53,740
the other cameraman from the two, they're
doing like a two shot the chute, right?

1898
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:58,080
The other camera, first of all is in
the shot and he's edging towards the,

1899
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:01,470
the bank to get a better shop and
it's an eight foot drop into the room.

1900
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:06,570
And that guy with the cake falls
into the fucking river and the,

1901
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:12,190
what's his face? He's one of those redneck
guys who he gets mad, but he's like a,

1902
01:55:12,191 --> 01:55:16,500
a classic dude so he doesn't curse.
So he uses like those redneck,

1903
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:17,800
I don't know what the fuck they are,

1904
01:55:17,801 --> 01:55:22,801
but he's just add dagnabbit two goes
in the water and push her on it.

1905
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:25,570
It's actually, it's
fucking hilarious. Hey,

1906
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,400
I gotta hop in the shower cause Bobby
Kelly's meeting me here in a couple of

1907
01:55:28,401 --> 01:55:33,320
[inaudible]. This is Joe. Bobby Kelly can,
he'll come walking through the door. No,

1908
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:35,860
he's going to ring the buzzer and I
gotta run. I gotta get ready here.

1909
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:40,060
So lazy boy. Oh No, it's my show.

1910
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:41,080
I tell you when we're,

1911
01:55:41,081 --> 01:55:43,560
when we were up against the heartbreak
and it's time for you to go,

1912
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,090
where are you going

1913
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:48,560
Joe? You just going to put it down? He
just going to tap out and walk out. Shower

1914
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:54,780
Jesus. All right, no
problem. Joe. To rose,

1915
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:58,350
everybody Jode Rosa has a new CD out that
I would have hiked, but he walked away.

1916
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:02,910
We'll give me the hype.
What's the hype, Joe?

1917
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:08,910
When does it come out now
Sarah? See John, if it was out,

1918
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:12,810
people would be talking about it. When
does it come out? Oh, Jesus, it's out.

1919
01:56:12,811 --> 01:56:17,360
It's called out the depression auction.
Uh, and I endorsed it. Jolene ruck I'm on.

1920
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:22,230
He did when he or eat burned a bit on
the podcast for you. Why am I yelling?

1921
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:25,740
Um, anyways, uh, I think that's going
to be the podcast for this week.

1922
01:56:25,741 --> 01:56:29,160
I'm doing a ton of media this week.
Fans of the Opie and Anthony Program.

1923
01:56:29,161 --> 01:56:33,420
I believe I'm going to be on there. Uh,
definitely tomorrow. Hopefully Wednesday.

1924
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:38,610
I'm basically going to be on that show
as many days as they'll have me because,

1925
01:56:38,611 --> 01:56:43,000
uh, I liked those sons of bitches.
Um, that's it. No, seriously,

1926
01:56:43,030 --> 01:56:44,940
if you don't listen to the
opiate Anthony Program,

1927
01:56:44,941 --> 01:56:47,850
I don't know what your problem is.
Get an XM satellite,

1928
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:51,450
whatever the Fuck Sirius XM player.

1929
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:55,550
And check those guys out. Watch a little
bit of this stuff on Youtube. They're, uh,

1930
01:56:56,230 --> 01:56:58,800
they're, they're fucking awesome. So
I'm going to be doing them this week.

1931
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:03,120
I'll probably be doing something
on versus, and um, you know what,

1932
01:57:03,121 --> 01:57:06,090
as I do them, if they're not live
and they're going to be shown later,

1933
01:57:06,091 --> 01:57:09,090
I'll just on the [inaudible] podcast,
we'll have that information up there.

1934
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:11,940
But if you didn't get the,
Oh, gee, she's ring tone,

1935
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:16,860
you can go to the [inaudible] podcast.com
and on the left hand corner you'll see

1936
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:20,040
it right there. And you just
click on o g g and you can get it,

1937
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:24,180
put it in your phone. And then whenever
the biggest company life calls you up,

1938
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:28,620
that's what your phone is going to
be saying. Oh, gee, gold beach. Um,

1939
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:32,490
if you don't, don't do it. I don't give
a fuck. I'm just happy you listening.

1940
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:36,510
All right, you guys have a great week and
a, that's my prediction. Ravens will win.

1941
01:57:37,690 --> 01:57:41,940
Um, and I dunno, jets, jets are
patriots. I gotta be honest with you.

1942
01:57:41,941 --> 01:57:43,050
Could go either direction,

1943
01:57:43,051 --> 01:57:47,760
but I'm really liking what I watched
on the ticker tape on the airplane.

1944
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:50,970
I have no fucking idea. I miss. I don't,
I can't judge the Patriots, but uh,

1945
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,850
and I think the jets
are going to get best.

1946
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:56,760
Mike go tenant six after
all that fucking Yip. Yap.

1947
01:57:56,761 --> 01:57:59,880
And they'll probably make it into
the playoffs. God knows they got,

1948
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:01,680
they got enough talent
on the fucking team,

1949
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:05,210
but I think all this shit talking is
really going to hurt him and I don't,

1950
01:58:05,230 --> 01:58:07,380
I don't think they're going to
go as far as they went last year.

1951
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:11,040
What do you think about that?
Huh? What do you think about that?

1952
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:15,360
Jets play like a jet.
What the fuck does that mean?

1953
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:17,970
You haven't won one since 1969.
What does that mean?

1954
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:22,830
Get your fans all excited and then
you shit the bed in January. What Gel?

1955
01:58:22,831 --> 01:58:25,890
That's what they do. Oh,
they haven't won since.

1956
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:29,430
We were excited that we landed on the
moon like that was going to lead to new

1957
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:31,500
real estate.
That was the last time they want Joe.

1958
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:37,080
I was six months old. Joe, six months old.

1959
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:41,390
Curt Gowdy announced the last
time that they want a super bowl.

1960
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:44,410
All right. Jim Morrison
was still alive. Joe,

1961
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:50,320
Jimi Hendrix was still putting out albums,
Joe to Rosa the last time they won.

1962
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:55,440
And this same play like a jet
all the way.

1963
01:58:56,380 --> 01:59:00,430
I liked that west side story.
That really is where we differ.

1964
01:59:00,431 --> 01:59:03,250
You're talking about the jets and I'm
singing the song that sounds like one of

1965
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:05,140
the oldest.
They're really into that old school shit.

1966
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:06,760
You know what the sad thing
about the jets are there?

1967
01:59:06,761 --> 01:59:11,140
The only professional franchise and all
four sports that actually sublet their

1968
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:13,580
stadium. Yeah, it,

1969
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:17,490
they play a giant stadium there.
You know what they are?

1970
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:21,160
Joe didn't like that fucking
loser who never moves out.

1971
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:25,840
And that window of getting married and
actually meeting somebody just closes and

1972
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:26,980
then they just say fuck it.

1973
01:59:27,370 --> 01:59:31,930
And they're just waiting for the last of
their alive parent to die so that they

1974
01:59:31,931 --> 01:59:36,500
can think they can take
over the house. Uh, podcast.

1975
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:43,570
Jesus. Joe, look at you. Come up with a
little bit of anger. Joe. You know what?

1976
01:59:43,571 --> 01:59:46,450
I hate out uninsured. Unashamed.
You are about your torso.

1977
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:55,960
I give Joe Shit because his body, he
looks like an adolescent. Will Ferrell.

1978
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:59,650
Like what picture will
Ferrel's body at 23?

1979
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,630
Joe, have you ever done a pull
up in your life? Do you like,

1980
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:10,390
do you even have those muscles now?
He left me.

1981
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:14,440
I was really going to compare him to
like the Camaro rally sport. You know,

1982
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:18,280
somebody goes out and you get the Iraq,
right? You've got the air conditioner,

1983
02:00:18,281 --> 02:00:20,800
you got the tee tops,
you get the electric windows,

1984
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:24,010
and then you had the rally sport,
which you basically had the same body,

1985
02:00:24,011 --> 02:00:26,290
but you didn't have those options.
I was going to go that route.

1986
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:28,340
Is that what you were going to do,
Bill,

1987
02:00:28,341 --> 02:00:31,330
where you're going to do it in a funny
way because the way you presented that it

1988
02:00:31,331 --> 02:00:34,730
wasn't too funny. All right, that's
the podcast for this week. Uh,

1989
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:37,360
God bless all of you guys.
Let's go ravens.

1990
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:39,790
Fuck the jets and a,

1991
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:44,791
I'm hoping this time next week that jets
are fucking oh into and if they are all

1992
02:00:45,721 --> 02:00:49,650
went, I'm telling you right now,
Rex Ryan, I am Guaran fucking team.

1993
02:00:49,651 --> 02:00:54,070
It will cry during a press conference
and he's going to be crying and his

1994
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:57,460
fucking, you know, bodies
going to be jiggling.

1995
02:00:58,650 --> 02:01:03,580
I hate the jets. I hate the jets more
than I hate the cults now, you know,

1996
02:01:03,581 --> 02:01:07,210
kind of helps it. They lost to
the Texans. But yeah, the jets,

1997
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:11,920
I want nothing more than to watch
them eat their fucking words.

1998
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:15,850
The arrogance of that fucking teeth.

1999
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:18,520
Look at that and you don't even know
how to behave when there's a lady in the

2000
02:01:18,521 --> 02:01:22,930
room. All right. Who gives a fuck?
Ravens are going to win tonight.

2001
02:01:22,931 --> 02:01:24,310
I'm going to have an extra 50 bucks in.

2002
02:01:24,311 --> 02:01:26,440
The Patriots are going to
beat him next week. All right?

2003
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:29,080
That's what my heart says. All
right, you guys have a good week.

2004
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:30,730
Please watch my special Sunday night,

2005
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:34,330
September 19th 11:00 PM okay.
