1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,130
Yeah.

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm checking in on you about
Du du Du du check in on you.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,090
Okay.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,570
Far called mad has said,

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,580
Ooh

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,930
cares if your nose is fucking Ryan.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,110
Get some fucking clean x

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,130
and have some fun and sorry.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,170
I am so sick of being sick.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,700
Just when the fuck is this going to end.

15
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:51,701
I woke up Bodu Luda I had a fucking
coffin fit at like four in the morning and

16
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:57,070
uh, you know, I was upstairs up and
vanished upstairs. You know what I mean?

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,020
Like back in the day when people had like
tuberculosis after the slum Lord stuck

18
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,470
them in some damp, dark fucking
apartment for years and years and years.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,400
And these poor fucking tenants would die
a lonely death and then they'd build a

20
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:14,401
statute statute to the fucking slum
lord or name a subway stop after him.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,730
You know, what was that one
on? Off The six, the fuck,

22
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,520
I can't remember the name of the Stop
I used to get off at all the time.

23
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,270
And walk over to the fucking store.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,280
I remember everything I saw in New
York. I just, anybody at his statue,

25
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,020
I just started looking
them up on the Internet.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,450
But it was all this shit that they did.

27
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,840
But if you went to about
page three f four, it was the
other stuff that they did.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,890
Oh yeah.
Um,

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,980
people,
if I live long enough,

30
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,060
I'm going to do a show this weekend at
the Fox theater in Atlanta, Georgia.

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,530
And then you know what I'm going to do
then following day, you know what I mean?

32
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,990
Go on to do what?

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,820
I'm getting in a fucking rental car and
I'm driving over the fucking Talladega

34
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,460
and I'm going to go watch a bunch of
fucking rednecks watching their dream cars

35
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:12,710
going around the track.
One more time.

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,430
Okay,

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,930
one more fucking top. Hey, stock
car racing going to change.

38
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:21,710
Now that Ford is fucking phasing out all
of their sedans. Did you guys see that?

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,940
They're not making any cars anymore.
They're going to still have the Mustang,

40
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,620
you know, cause what would a fucking
tourists rent when they come to la?

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,710
You got to get the Red Mustang convertible
and put the fucking top down and

42
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:37,490
drive around like a Dosha, right?
Oh, do you know you want to hear,

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,100
you want to hear some self-involved Shit.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,190
They're always talking about the
millennials. You know what I mean?

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,270
You ask a millennial, what's the top
fucking social issue out there today?

46
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:52,070
And they'd say, lack of cell
service, you know, in a tunnel. No,

47
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,340
actually they said climate change and
they're determined to tackle the issue.

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,680
That's what I just read today.

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,110
Millennials think that climate change
is the number one social issue courses.

50
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,160
And they are 100% right. God bless them
and they're determined to tackle it.

51
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,460
You know, wait till they get a
little bit of debt under their belts.

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,780
Wait to those banker cuts can scare
them out of their fucking, you know,

53
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,290
get a run on the wheel. You
know, wait til they get married.

54
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,110
Yeah. I went to that APP. And so
you start getting fucking Nag,

55
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:26,111
then your priority becomes pay enough
my fucking house and fucking redoing the

56
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:29,180
garage. So I got a place
for myself. But until then,

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,170
until that right, you saved the
polar bear. So I hope you do it.

58
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,390
I hope you stick to hope.
You keep it real man.

59
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,010
Like whenever you see an old hippie
still rocking the long fucking, you know,

60
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,650
hair,
even if he went bald,

61
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,470
still has it all gathered
in the back, you know? Um,

62
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,110
anyways, what the fuck was I going?
I was, God dammit. Bill Kia Tangent.

63
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,990
So something I was going
to talk about there.

64
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,090
What I brown was talking about
cold medicine being sick.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,460
Okay.

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,390
Led me to the cars.
Tattle dagger. Ah, fuck.

67
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,360
If I know,
I don't fucking know.

68
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,600
All I know is that I've been sick too
fucking long and I've had this fucking

69
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,280
thing started Wednesday of last week.

70
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:20,060
These are these new super colts
because everybody takes antibiotics and

71
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,070
everything, right? And rather
than killing the virus,

72
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,950
all you do is slap it around a
little pit and it toughens up.

73
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,200
You know what I mean? It's
like, oh, that, you know,

74
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,310
it starts to know your tendencies.
He leads with the left.

75
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:34,730
Fucking Jeb always follows
it with an overhand right.

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,400
He doesn't like when you crowd them in
the ring. Oh Shit. Somebody is calling me.

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,360
Oh, it's my mother, a mom.
I've told my podcasts, let
me call you right back. Yeah.

78
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,760
Uh, anyways. Um,

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,380
fuck. I don't even want I'm talking
about anymore. Oh yes or no.

80
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,180
And so I woke up at like
four in the morning,

81
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,670
just fucking hacking or
hacking away. And um, you know,

82
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,570
upstairs in the guest room,
that's where I've been, you know,

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,810
sent my wife has also sick,
you know,

84
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,970
but she gets to stay in the big bet.
Do you see how that works? You know,

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,850
with the Nice fucking master
bathroom right next door,

86
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,970
she has a fucking humidifier going.

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,790
She's got her fucking clean x with the,
uh, you know, you won't get as sore noise.

88
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,890
Knows fucking missed autumn.

89
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,970
I'm up in the fucking guest
room, you know, throw my drawer,

90
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,890
my old drum DVDs and shit, blowing
my nose with towels, toilet paper.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,160
That's how it works, you know,
and you, what do you see?

92
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:48,970
All you see is women just
constantly complaining about
the way the way men treat

93
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:53,890
women and their position in society.
Right. So this is a society, right?

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,790
What about me? What about
my existence? You know,

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,890
where's my ribbon?
Where's my Hashtag?

96
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,770
Yeah.

97
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,360
How come I can't get somebody fired?

98
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,613
You know,

99
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,030
I'd actually been winning arguments lately
with my wife. It's been good. You know,

100
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:15,940
it's cost her to kind of like,
you know,

101
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,570
do a couple things around the house
that I've been asking her to do it,

102
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,860
but I know it's going to go back the
other way. The same way. Like she goes,

103
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:23,740
so you got to watch your temper and then
for a few days I'd walk around smiling

104
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:27,610
like a lunatic before I go back to who
I am. But you know, I accept it for her.

105
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:30,940
She is all right.
That's what you have to do after awhile.

106
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah. Are you ladies out there you think
you gonna Change your man? You're not,

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,800
you're not going to change them. The best
you can hope to do is break his spirit.

108
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,634
Yeah.

109
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,283
Okay.

110
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,510
In fact, if that's what gets you off.
What about all of that shit? Yeah.

111
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,910
How about a ribbon for all
the broken men out there?

112
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,840
I don't know why I'm talking about
all of this shit. It's just fucking,

113
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:59,680
it always makes me laugh. Um, anyways,

114
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,770
how bout those bro is here we go
bro and say we'd, we go bump. Bump.

115
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,670
Wow.

116
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,260
Did I think we were going to lose that
game seven now when we started our fourth

117
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:15,370
fucking line and immediately gave
up a goddamn goal, I was like, wow,

118
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,780
that reminds me of certain,

119
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:19,570
somebody not starting to game
crying before the Superbowl.

120
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,340
The fuck are we doing right? Then
we tie it up, then we go ahead.

121
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,600
All right.

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,960
It was two to one and we scored my right
before the first fucking period ended

123
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:32,190
or something that was like, oh boy,

124
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:36,880
it's three to to look at that.
That's what I was, it was one,

125
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,290
nothing them then one,

126
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,610
one us and then they immediately fucking
scored like they always did and then we

127
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:45,850
fucking, and we went up three to two and
I'm like, okay, maybe, maybe you know,

128
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:50,170
whatever. And then they score of two
fucking goals throughout five to three.

129
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,990
This is one thing I've noticed about
the Bruins. We don't hit anybody.

130
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,740
Finally started hitting somebody in
the third period. But Jesus Christ,

131
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,540
when the other team is faster than yeah,

132
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,320
you supposed to add them
to try to slow him down,

133
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,700
given away too much fucking
space. I thought, you know,

134
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,790
I thought Anderson looks shaky in
the first period. So I was like,

135
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,070
let's pepper him with some
shots there in the second.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,240
And we barely got a shot on him.
It felt so.

137
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:21,810
I thought that allowed them to settle
down what Jesus Christ was Iraq.

138
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,530
Yeah,

139
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,830
I'll tell you, you hate to
see it. You hate to see it
with a fellow fellow ginger.

140
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,920
You know, fuck it as a
game like that, you know,

141
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,790
I guess toward Kruger was a little
bit screened, but uh, he left.

142
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,980
He let up a fucking softy. That next
one was f goal number five was a softy.

143
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:41,080
And also one of the first
three wasn't a good one either.

144
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,180
Okay.

145
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,770
Not to put it all on him. Uh, but anyways,

146
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:53,000
my condolences to fucking Toronto
may police saying, Jesus Christ,

147
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,560
you know,

148
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,840
and you got to it up to the ones that
still have the heart to fucking go down

149
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,600
the maple leaf square,
whatever the fuck they call it,

150
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:05,601
and stand there knowing that their joy
is eventually going to turn to anger

151
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,900
and then they're just going to be part
of a fucking reaction video. A bad one.

152
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,330
Okay.

153
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,580
But you have to go right as a leaf San,
you gotta go,

154
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:18,100
cause one of these times
you're going to fucking win.

155
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,360
I liked what that one guy in the leaf
said. He said, obviously it sucks,

156
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,170
but I think in the future we're going
to be a team to be reckoned with.

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,270
I always love that expression
team to be reckoned with.

158
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:31,600
They think they're going to be mmm.
You know,

159
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:33,310
full of freckles settles
down a little bit.

160
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,770
They get a little more playoff experience.
I'll tell you what the Bruins need.

161
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,890
They need a physical presence
in front of the each day.

162
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,470
You know, we still haven't made up
for fucking loot Cheech departure.

163
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,241
There's no,

164
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:54,140
we always had that runaway fucking train
that were just flat and people actually,

165
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:57,200
we used to have like three of them.
We just don't have that anymore.

166
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,880
Now we're fucking fast as shit.

167
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,750
At least I thought we were until we
played the maple leafs. Um, anyway,

168
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,480
so now the Bruins move on.
We got to Tampa Bay lightning,

169
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,890
part of that hotbed of
hockey fans down there.

170
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,640
I went to a Tampa Bay lightning game down
there, right. And went with four Shah.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,170
We were sitting there and there was,

172
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:21,880
he's a Florida northern Florida redneck
spinus some of my favorite rednecks.

173
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,250
I like rednecks, you know, uh,
there was not a fixed shit.

174
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,540
I'll fix it. Ain't going to
fit well, it'll hang off Nass.

175
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,770
Um, we would sit sitting there and
they had on the diamond vision,

176
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:38,190
they put this little baby
up there, right. You know,

177
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:40,860
they had an infant up on the screen.
The guy behind us goes, look,

178
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,290
I had a little baby.
I Dunno why.

179
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,440
They just stuck with us a
little rest of the road trip.

180
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,310
You driving over to fucking
Orlando dead silence in the car.

181
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,290
And the forest just be like a little baby.

182
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,530
Uh,
it was hilarious and also scary.

183
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Just listen to the guy cause he didn't
sound real bright and just the fact that

184
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,590
you know,
his TJ's can also make babies.

185
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,300
I just wished that like your level of
intelligence made you, oh, so like,

186
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,420
like your Iq should be
the same level as your,

187
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:17,800
a reproductive like a potency.
Is that the right word?

188
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,830
Like if you're a fucking moron,

189
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,340
it should be a half court shot that
you're going to get somebody knocked up.

190
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,900
You know,
that's not how it works.

191
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,740
Dumb people usually have like
that super just, you know,

192
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,550
let me just stand next to somebody
and they get fucking pregnant.

193
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,580
Just shooting out fucking kids.
Uh,

194
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,310
that's cause they're too dumb to plan.
You know, they just lay it on the back.

195
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,670
Well it feels good. It
feels good. Feels good.

196
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,580
Well I was my belly sticking out.
Why is my belly moving?

197
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,500
Does anybody else feel weird?

198
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,920
Are for that meal and then they just
fucking shit the kid out on a sofa.

199
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,181
I mean that happens.

200
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,660
That still happens in America out
there on the Appalachian trail.

201
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,680
God knows Hollywood and go out there
and put some cameras on it and turned it

202
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,230
into a fucking reality show.
And next thing you know,

203
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,290
we're buying it and there's
fucking little kid sewing together.

204
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,080
Tee shirts with these
fucking dope faces on it.

205
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,380
All right? And that's what's
wrong with this goddamn country.

206
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,223
MMM.

207
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,490
Jesus Christ. I love all
these people taking the bait
on that fucking Kanye West.

208
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:33,180
Shit. He obviously, he has an album
coming out. You're fucking morons. Relax.

209
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,600
Okay.

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,490
Has he lost his mind?

211
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,570
Did you learn anything with
that beyond say album? Well,

212
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:47,571
she was acting like she was all annoyed
with JC and that there were all these

213
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,350
problems at all.
What the fuck?

214
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:53,470
Everybody just starts
gossiping and everybody buys
the fucking album and they're

215
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:58,450
still together. How many fucking times
you're going to jump on the hook.

216
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,910
He's obviously recording a fucking album.
There's no more MTV.

217
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,250
Billboards are a lot of fucking money.

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,330
Why don't you just start saying some
crazy shit that makes no fucking sense.

219
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,620
Okay.

220
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,910
Yeah know. And then people
will listen to your next album.

221
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,280
Okay,

222
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm going to fucking do that.
Get my podcasts numbers up.
What the fuck can I, uh,

223
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,030
I going to just start saying
positive shit about women.

224
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:36,810
Okay.

225
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,050
You know, I think the real
problem beyond global warming,

226
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,430
then that swirl of trash
out in the Pacific Ocean,

227
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,590
even worse than Isis.

228
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,720
Okay.

229
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,240
Oh, I got a text message.
Ah, I dropped the phone.

230
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:57,320
Jesus Christ Tiki Barber. Pick
it up though. For Christ's sake.

231
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,343
Uh,

232
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,600
shut this fucking thing off.
I think the biggest problem

233
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,850
beyond Isis and isis is a major problem.
I mean,

234
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,270
they're just like the Third Reich.
The Third Reich had no planes or boats

235
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,870
or really any technology,
um,

236
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,710
is white male heterosexuals
and their micro aggression.

237
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,503
Um,

238
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,050
which is why I have decided I can't
even do this because you guys are gonna

239
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,630
fucking retweet this thing. And next
thing you know, it'd be some fucking,

240
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,450
I don't want to get involved in that. I
was going to say that I, I've decided,

241
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,840
okay,

242
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,580
no, I can't say it because everyone's
going to get all fucking upset.

243
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,590
It rhymes with man Zishan

244
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,780
that would be the ultimate right,
if you did that.

245
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,390
Okay.

246
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,220
Be Funny if you, yeah, if he did that,

247
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:06,910
like as this as a sign of solidarity
with all the pain that women have been

248
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:09,060
through that you actually,
uh,

249
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,750
went through with the sex change operation
and then everybody called you a hero

250
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:17,590
and then Diane Sawyer interviewed you
and they made you a woman of the year.

251
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,540
And then after all that cleared,

252
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,480
all these women came forward and said
you were grabbing ass and titties all

253
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:27,190
through the 90s and two thousands, then
you'd be like, well, I didn't do that.

254
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,200
That was frank.

255
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm Francis and I just feel like for me,

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,820
and then you're on the
other side of the issue.

257
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,283
MMM.

258
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,460
And they'd be like, well, isn't frank
still in there? And you could be like,

259
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:51,440
well, I left frank on that, that fucking
operating table. I never was frank.

260
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,180
Frank is my white slave name
given to me by my white parents.

261
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,610
Um, Jesus Christ. How much more time
do I have in this fucking podcast?

262
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,410
I usually like doing these sinks,
man.

263
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:07,670
But what am I fucking head is
all clogged like this? You know,

264
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,300
when I lay down in my slippers
having to podcasts with a head cold,

265
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,290
that's a day's work. People. Now I know
you guys are out there doing construction.

266
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,200
What the fuck do people do nowadays?
Everybody air quote works from home now,

267
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,470
which means they're out driving around
on the highways during the day cause and

268
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,500
fucking rush hour traffic.
You know what I mean?

269
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,280
Cause they saw something on Pinterest
that they have to go pick up to add to

270
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,400
their fucking wardrobe for their
party that night. Right? Uh,

271
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,580
we should go back to
making our own clothes.

272
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,390
You should go back to that. You make your
own clothes, you grow your own Burgers,

273
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,880
right?
You want to fucking Burger,

274
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,670
go slaughter that calf and then you
figure out how to freeze the rest of that

275
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:52,130
meter. You're going to start this
winter if they're pilgrim. Um,

276
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,100
I think to something's good,
something like that's gonna happen.

277
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,650
We're either going to regress to that
after the shit hits the fan or this

278
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,590
illuminati stuff is true.
And the robots will kill all of us.

279
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,920
And uh,
oh wow.

280
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,770
That'd be amazing in the future,
right? This, this Illuminati city,

281
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,280
everybody's dead except for
the Illuminati people. Right.

282
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,380
And the other people that they keep
making, they kept enough people, right,

283
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,470
with good genes that they
make fuck each other.

284
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:25,890
So they keep making babies and stuff that
they can use to fucking, uh, you know,

285
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,360
as almost like a parts car, you know,
for Oregon's, when they reach maturity.

286
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,410
I know this is fucked up, right? Uh,

287
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,050
sort of like Westworld meets a guy
with a head cold doing a podcast on a

288
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:41,700
Thursday. That's how it pitched
this in Hollywood. I come in,

289
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:46,240
I say hello everybody. We
do all this small talk, but
Baba Baba, Baba, you know, I,

290
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:50,520
I read the fucking room. I try to figure
out where the laughs are going to be,

291
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,880
you know,
try to block out the ice cold person.

292
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,800
That douche was just sitting there
fidgeting with their fucking pen.

293
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,050
Um, and I would, I would just pitch it.
I pitch the hell out of it. So anyways,

294
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,940
so then you have an Illuminati city.
All right.

295
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,420
And they feel like they've won,

296
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,440
but their actual actually
prisoners because the robots
have the city surrounded,

297
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,760
you know, and they still have some
robots. The older versions that are good,

298
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,050
you know, that's still work with
the people. But the latest update,

299
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,410
other one went fucking rogue
and killed a couple of the,

300
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,440
it was like the first people that
died other than the parts people

301
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,980
and like hundreds of years.

302
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,820
So they hit the fucking shield
and I got this big bubble,

303
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,370
like the Simpsons set one time,
right?

304
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:44,450
They got this big bubble over the fucking
city and they stay in there with the

305
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:47,270
older version of the robots and they're
the ones that have to try to protect him

306
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:47,731
as the fuck.

307
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:51,410
And the higher level ones are trying to
figure out how to get into the bubble.

308
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,960
And that's what it is. And it's weird
thing you'd have to root for these pieces,

309
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,803
shit,
humans.

310
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,080
So then obviously what would happen is
you'd have a really good looking parts

311
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,380
person like Ryan Gosling and he,
Hey Nia,

312
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:12,020
hi, hi. And he would,
uh, he would somehow,

313
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,630
you know, he'd bang like the hottest
Illuminati person and she believed in him.

314
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,160
And then him and one of the
lesser robots then fucking

315
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,160
to feet the next level robots while
freeing all the parts people and then

316
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:32,530
killing the Illuminati people.
There you go. And you could,

317
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,490
you could finish the story halfway
through it and then get everybody to go to

318
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,960
the second one, right? And then all you,

319
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,960
you have to do is just show up down at
comic con wherein an Obi wan Kenobi rope.

320
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,490
And I think he got $1 billion
franchise. What do you think? Yeah,

321
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,350
you liked that movie? I love it.
What would you name that movie

322
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,690
bills? Great idea for a movie. Oh, Jesus.

323
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,780
What are you doing on my phone? I
wasn't listening. I'm texting myself.

324
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:04,310
Those pictures. What pictures? The
pictures you took of me earlier.

325
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,780
That's it. Yeah. I got to get back
to our child. Oh, that's right.

326
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,480
I forgot we had a kid
come on you guys.

327
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,390
You know,
so he puts 10,000 hours into that idea.

328
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:22,680
You got yourself a good
fucking movie Boobie Boobie.

329
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,130
It's a lot of hacky shit in there.
You know,

330
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,480
it's like Westworld
meets fucking Moonraker,

331
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,860
uh, with a dash a happy days. You know,

332
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:39,861
cause at some point some I'll fucking
Ron Howard directs Ryan Gosling stars.

333
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,480
He probably wouldn't do it because
you already did blade runner.

334
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,530
Do you guys see that one?
The 20,

335
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:46,100
48 blade runner that moves
the movie was the Shit

336
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,471
I just noticed.

337
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:54,880
I probably had been coughing like
every five fucking seconds on this.

338
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:59,780
I apologize. I Apologize, but I'm not
going to take a cough drop. All right.

339
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,260
Okay.

340
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,700
Cough drops if for Socialists.

341
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,903
Okay.

342
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,160
All right. Anyway, so you know,
like when you do an interview,

343
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,080
when you got to fucking show coming up,
they go pale.

344
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,940
So what can people expect from you?
Wow.

345
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,130
What are you gonna be talking about
when I come to town? What do you what?

346
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,600
I can't fucking tell you that cause
then the jokes are going to be over.

347
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,420
Everybody's going to know what
I'm going to be talking about.

348
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:26,920
What kind of fucking question is that?

349
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,320
You sound like you're still a
great way under she'll these days,

350
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,850
I'm not angry. It's just
my, my default emotion.

351
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,560
I walk around relaxed and then
when anything happens, good or bad,

352
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:44,840
I get it and I don't. I don't, I don't
know if it's good. I don't get angry.

353
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,550
I don't know. Hey, we got
a new advertiser. Okay.

354
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:53,000
We somehow convince somebody else to get
on this sinking ship. Let's see here.

355
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,340
From the halls of Mark Tazo
Ma to the shores of Tripoli.

356
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,270
I will type my far again.
Password.

357
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,200
All right. Oh, butchers box,

358
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,480
butchers box, and we're not
talking about his wife. All right.

359
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,681
Butchers box.

360
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:21,420
Now these guys actually sent me a bag
of fucking butchered meat and I had a

361
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:25,100
steak the other day. I may
add my wife cooked it. Uh Huh.

362
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,210
Tell me I'm not running shit in my house.

363
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,960
I was actually sick and she's a sweetheart
and she cooked it and it was fucking

364
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:33,390
delicious.
It was a giant portion.

365
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:36,660
So much that I've actually saved it
for a little bit of steak and eggs.

366
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:37,620
Later on this week,

367
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,100
a butcher box delivers healthy
100% grass fed and finished beef.

368
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,780
I don't know what finished means. They
are. That means they butchered it.

369
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,180
Free Range,
organic chicken and heritage bread.

370
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:57,830
Pork directly to your
door on a monthly basis.

371
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,140
Eat like you're in the Illuminati.

372
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,260
All their products are humanely raised.

373
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,360
Okay?

374
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,931
Excuse me.

375
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:09,400
Could you come over here if you wouldn't
mind before I butcher you and never

376
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:12,160
ever given antibiotics or hormones.
There you go.

377
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,660
If you don't want your kids to hit
puberty at eight butcher blocks,

378
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,550
butcher blocks, butcher box, high
quality, healthy protein you can trust.

379
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,100
You can shake hands with these cows.

380
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,440
100% grass fed and finished beef free
range. Organic chicken. We've said this.

381
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:34,210
Heritage, bread, pork. What
does Rick flair out there?

382
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,220
That's old world pork before
they bred out all of the fat

383
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,190
and flavor to make it the
other white meat a key a.

384
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,010
This is the way they were meant to be.
I got to look up heritage bread,

385
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,050
pork. That's fascinating. Unbelievable.

386
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,740
It's like a mat and a old
car with matching numbers.

387
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,550
Unbelievable tastes is a huge difference
in taste between animals raised on

388
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,280
pasture and those fed and grain
constant in concentration,

389
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,960
animal feedlot operations. But your
box is changing that. This is great.

390
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,320
This is more and more of these
types of people. Got To love it. Um,

391
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,270
and they offer free shipping
anywhere in the, in the 48 states,

392
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:17,270
the lower 48 Alaska.
Who's kidding? Who Right?

393
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,550
You're fucking trap in
your own meat and Hawaii.

394
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:24,551
You a eat pineapples over 20% off plus
free bacon by going up free bacon by

395
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:30,980
going a butcher box.com/bar and using
the discount code. Bar B, u. R. R.

396
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,750
I tried to, Shit. I ate the shit. I
love this shit. I backed this shit.

397
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,020
Put your box.com/bar. Um, you know,

398
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,660
I've got time to go to the butcher.
Use these guys.

399
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,070
I have to look up heritage, bread, pork,

400
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,230
you know, every former president.
So he's eaten this shit right?

401
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,990
Here we go. Heritage bread, pork heritage,

402
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:02,480
swine definition.

403
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,670
It's funny when somebody uses the
word swine and it's not an insult.

404
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,930
I fucking love pigs. There's
certain animals that I, I, you know,

405
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:14,220
I like all animals,
but I fucking love pigs.

406
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:19,221
Is any cooler than a little piglet
running around deaf Alec Ducks?

407
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,200
Yeah,

408
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,960
I like piglets.
He moves freaked me out.

409
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,940
Dogs are awesome cats I respect,
but you know what I mean?

410
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,640
Okay.

411
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,341
I, you know, I,

412
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,180
there's never any like sort of like every
once in a while you meet a really cool

413
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:36,460
fucking cat. All right. Definitely.

414
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:39,490
But they got that Freddy Krueger
claws and shit. You know,

415
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,960
you turned around real quick and they
were like practicing killing, Ya know,

416
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,290
you catch them stock and you and shit.
That fucking weird.

417
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,740
Okay.

418
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,730
You wake up there on
your chest staring at you

419
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,270
like that chicken misery.
All right.

420
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:59,590
Purpose swine at been a part of the
American agricultural landscape since the

421
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,300
arrival of the new world calling us.

422
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,240
Why do they have to go
that fucking far back?

423
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,880
Yeah.

424
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,590
This is why I don't read books.

425
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,310
Moby Dick get to the fucking whale.

426
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,470
Sorry.

427
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,470
Swine indigenous to Europe were brought
with immigrants during the colonization

428
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,900
of America commercials. Fucking
things in the, the wooden ship.

429
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,590
Freaking the fuck out.
Riding over there with us.

430
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:31,140
Hairless monkeys knowing
they're going to get killed. Um,

431
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,390
and the many different types of swine.
They brought. Hep provided pork, Lard,

432
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,830
pest control in land improvement
services for centuries.

433
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,990
How to pork on a pigs, help with pest
control cause they fucking eat everything.

434
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,580
I have something else to look up.

435
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,330
This is how you lose a day on the
Internet because there's always an answer.

436
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,870
It doesn't mean it's right, but there's
always someone who some will have a page,

437
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,040
is what I think.
There's why what they do with Bar Mitzvah.

438
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,590
A modern bread associations maintained
pedigree registries of pure bred animals

439
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:08,820
for each breed that descends
from these colonial oh wow.

440
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:10,020
These are like the fucking,

441
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,590
the blue bloods of pigs as
well as later introductions.

442
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,650
A registration of animals destined to
become breeding stock is essential to the

443
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,760
longterm security of the breeds.

444
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,890
Registration validates bred status of the
animals and assures their availability

445
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:30,420
for conservation by future generations.
Many swap lines,

446
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,870
but he swines Bree swine breeds that
were once core components of regional

447
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:41,481
cultures are now in danger of
extinction as cultures of Homo Homo.

448
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,750
[inaudible] Homo.

449
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,140
Yeah.

450
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,290
Generalized, homogenized. God, I'm stupid.

451
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,560
And historic agricultural traditions
abandoned the flavors and food traditions

452
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:54,300
that revolved or,
yeah,

453
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,400
check out Monsanto for that one fucking
lunatics definition of heritage swine.

454
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,693
Okay.

455
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,110
I don't even know if it's about sat off.

456
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,690
They always said the fault
people you blame. Who knows?

457
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:10,691
Allegedly Monsanto heritage swine
must adhere to all of the following

458
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,470
one.
I ain't a true chin.

459
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,300
Genetic bread.

460
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,490
The breed is a true
genetic breed of swine.

461
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,640
That is when made it together.

462
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,450
It reproduces the breed type. All
right. I guess this is from Europe

463
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,830
to de dos. What does it
ains times? I, I don't,

464
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,480
I can't do the chairman
and dangered breed.

465
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,750
The breed is or has been endangered
as defined by the livestock cons.

466
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,170
Okay.

467
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:52,170
Conservancy and appears on or has
recovered from the con conservancies

468
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,460
conservation priority list and the
critically threatened Jesus Christ.

469
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:02,620
Long history in the U s purebreds. I
get it. It's pure bread. I like it.

470
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:04,240
They're fucking in danger
and I'm eating them.

471
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm meeting the fucking pig version
of a fucking bald eagle. Um,

472
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,010
okay.

473
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,610
What the fuck did I just, I just
shut that off and I, I wanted to,

474
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,050
what else did I want to look up?

475
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,230
Who is it? Oh, how to pigs

476
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,240
control pass population.

477
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,070
What?
He eat bugs.

478
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,170
Not how, how not how to bill. How do,

479
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,520
okay, here we go. Well,
it just says forbid.

480
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,870
Then information was forbidden.

481
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:56,390
Practical feral pig control because
feral pig population as the wild pigs.

482
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,640
Anyways. Fuck this shit. How
are their wild pigs by the way?

483
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,630
Well, those, the farmers that got
scalped by the native Americans,

484
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,250
so they just steer pigs just ran off.
Continue to fuck for centuries, you know?

485
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,113
Okay.

486
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,310
I Dunno, I don't have the
answers to these questions,

487
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,290
but I do have some bullshit I have
to do at 10 o'clock. Uh, alright.

488
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,430
That is the podcast. This
was a weird one. All right.

489
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,260
But we came up with a good movie idea.

490
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,710
We learned about heritage page and fucking
a swine from Europe and a Gopro lunch

491
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,020
and Celtics about those Celtics.

492
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,320
And I try to wrap up these Pesky fucking
Milwaukee Bucks. You know I like that.

493
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,300
One guy on Milwaukee,

494
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:49,900
he looks like a fucking like
a mid sized minuit bull.

495
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,980
Really dark skinned guy.
He hit,

496
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:56,900
he had some fucking lay up or some shit
to go up by four in the second quarter.

497
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,240
The shush the crowd.

498
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,970
Like he just hit a game winning
three does this second quarter.

499
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,420
Then they go on to lose the
game. I just don't, I tie,

500
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,840
I don't understand these kids today.

501
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,350
All right everybody have a great weekend
[inaudible] and I'll see everybody in

502
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:13,490
there.

503
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,260
Lana and I'll see you down at
the fucking race track count.

504
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,260
Come Saturday,

505
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,990
listen to the music and enjoy,
you know,

506
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:25,800
the half hour of our greatest sets
from a Thursday just before Friday.

507
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,880
Monday morning podcast, Thursday
earlier this year, possibly this decade.

508
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,890
All right,
I'll see ya.

509
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,550
Hey,
what's going on?

510
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:21,390
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

511
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,400
April 26th April,
April 26th,

512
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,233
2010 how the hell are you?

513
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,640
I'm a little late today with the podcasts
doing at three 43 Los angles is time.

514
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,750
Uh, and you probably want to like do what
the fuck you supposed to be doing these

515
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:40,010
Monday morning. That's why you
call it the Monday morning. So when

516
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,570
I come to work on Monday morning,

517
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,340
I have something to listen to rather
than focusing on the fucking job that I

518
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:50,780
hate. Well, you're right. Landless. I
am late this week, but you know what,

519
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:54,980
I was busy fucking busy this week. Uh, I,

520
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,710
I was doing shit this morning,
you know what I mean?

521
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,450
And also not to mention I am filming
this podcast for the first time ever.

522
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,810
I am allowing somebody else into the
Monday morning podcast bunker until now.

523
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:12,950
People just had to use their imagination
to wonder what the fuck does bill look

524
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:17,750
like while he does this podcast?
Is he wearing a Tuxedo,

525
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,470
maybe a dinner jacket? Is he
sitting there? You know, I'm not,

526
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:26,471
I'm in pajamas and my t shirt with my
little radio shack headphones on the exact

527
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:31,040
way that you pictured me, but I am
filming at this week, um, because, uh,

528
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:34,910
my DVD is, uh, just about complete
and now we are working on extras.

529
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,520
And I think at my last DVD I did the,
uh, I did a little short history,

530
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,200
a bunch of clubs that I loved in New York.

531
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:45,650
So you kinda got that whole background
and I figured out my me, I'll do this.

532
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,090
Maybe I'll fill in the podcast,

533
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,800
edit out the hours and
hours of unfunny moments,

534
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,650
right? See, you're going to actually
hear the whole fucking podcast,

535
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:57,530
these idiots who bought my DVD, who
are going to watch it and just be like,

536
00:33:57,531 --> 00:33:57,861
oh my God,

537
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:00,890
this is the greatest fucking thing I've
ever seen because of the wonderful world

538
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,710
of editing. So he probably thinking
like, what are you doing bill?

539
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:07,790
You filming it yourself and you're going
to edit it that, that, that does not,

540
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,440
that's not consistent with the moron
that I'm used to listening to what?

541
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:12,380
You're right.
I'm not,

542
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,240
I have the wonderfully talented
Brian Spitz is a working the camera.

543
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,160
Yep.
That was him right there.

544
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:23,270
He actually shot my failed pilot last
year on comedy central. Remember that one?

545
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,770
That was fun and we got excited then we
were like, it's going to happen. It was,

546
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:28,604
it grow with,

547
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,240
honestly, it was a great
fucking show. Wasn't it

548
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,660
ever in the history and the history
of failed pilots? I, I would say we,

549
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,420
yeah, we weren't, we
were in the, you know,

550
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,920
we just failed as opposed to just a
complete failure. It'd be like, you know,

551
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:48,730
if a patch passing grade was 60, I think
we, I think we've got about 58 on that,

552
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,730
you know, I don't know. But you
know what the weird thing is,

553
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:53,920
it's actually up on my imdv page.

554
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,260
That's what I love.
I don't know who put it up there,

555
00:34:56,261 --> 00:35:00,700
but you're not supposed to put shit
on there that isn't on TV or it wasn't

556
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:04,930
released in cinema or whatever.
And uh, I, for the life of me,

557
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:08,500
I don't know how to take it down, but
um, you'll take it care. Okay. Thank you.

558
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,740
Because people, all right, well
it was cool. Can you actually,

559
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:16,020
can you actually call IMD be okay?
Yeah, but that sounded good. I was,

560
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,210
I'm going to call those guys, I'm gonna
call that website and uh, you know,

561
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:21,130
get those guys on the phone
to see what's up. So yeah.

562
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:23,110
So if you're ever wondering
what the burn effect was,

563
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,330
that was just a working title
that we gave it to them.

564
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,420
It never aired and it won't air unless
I become hugely famous or infamous.

565
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,310
That's basically it. If I become a
huge movie star or television star,

566
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,040
you'll probably up seeing it in

567
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,873
some form.

568
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,860
Or if I go to a mall and
I just started fucking,

569
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:47,940
you know, killing puppies at the local
pet store or whatever the fuck you do.

570
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:50,460
I wouldn't say shooting because every,
everybody's done the shooting thing.

571
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:54,840
Isn't that like Hackey at this point?
You know what I mean? That's, it's like,

572
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,010
it's like if I was a comedian,

573
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,830
I went on on stage and I started
talking about airline food.

574
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,980
Basically go walking in to
a mall massacring people,

575
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,480
I think it's Hacky at this
point. You know, Yawn.

576
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,680
If I can be so bold to say I'm fucking
bored with that shit. But anyways,

577
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,490
let's get to me and my big fucking
week. Do you guys have a big week? Well,

578
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:17,880
if you didn't, let me fucking tell
you about my big week. First of all,

579
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:21,120
I don't know if I've been talking about
this on the podcast as I settle into my

580
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,990
sofa.
Um,

581
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:29,210
basically everything that identified
me as the person that I am,

582
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,650
uh, a month ago, either it was
expiring or I didn't have it,

583
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,533
you know,

584
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,520
I basically could not prove that
I existed with any sort of paper.

585
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,180
You know, my passport was
expiring my driver's license.

586
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,150
I needed to get that thing
for about fucking two years.

587
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,740
I'm not gonna lie to you when you
first move out to Los Angeles.

588
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,570
I think they give you
about six weeks to get it.

589
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,140
And I've almost been out here
for three fucking years. So, uh,

590
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,210
and my New York license was expiring.

591
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,980
I didn't have a social security
card that I could produce.

592
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,440
I had the number,
you know,

593
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,200
the Illuminati gave me a fucking
number when I was eight years old.

594
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:10,770
Let's get them on the wheel to get them
on the wheel. Let's get them in debt.

595
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,060
Are you in college? Are you making 200
bucks a week? Hey, here's a visa card.

596
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,240
We'll give you a $3,000 limit.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

597
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:21,870
Give us 25 bucks a week and just get it
up to you three grand limit and we'll

598
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:25,560
fucking own your ass. All
right, so I didn't have that.

599
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,290
What else didn't I have my and my birth
certificate, I had nothing. I had nothing.

600
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,190
So I was like a, it was like fuck,
I got to handle this shit. You know,

601
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:37,710
cause all of a sudden now I'm
doing gigs in Europe, you know,

602
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:40,920
I think I'm going to Japan
to perform for the troops.

603
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:45,540
I need pieces of papers saying I am who
I am and I have not done anything fucked

604
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,290
up. So a, in one month I
got my passport renewed,

605
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,200
I went down to the social security office,
I got that fucking thing,

606
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:53,670
I found my birth certificate.

607
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,850
And the last thing I needed
was my driver's license.

608
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,530
Say figure out the driver's license.
I mean,

609
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:02,160
that's a pain in the ass to
take the fucking test. You know,

610
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,970
you ever notice like what a pussy you
become as an adult when it comes to tests.

611
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,810
Like I think once you don't take a test
for what you're used to it as a kid,

612
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,250
people are always testing you.

613
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,700
You know where I'm in a spelling
test where I've vocabulary tests,

614
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:18,450
some bully punches in the face.
He's testing you. You know,

615
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,630
are you going to be a fucking man?
You know,

616
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:26,631
you Charles Bronson at age 12 or are you
fucking are Richie Cunningham who I was

617
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,133
and got bullied

618
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,170
and sees no reason to go back to a
fucker reunion now. It wasn't that bad.

619
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,970
You know what? I'll be honest
with you. Uh, when was it bad?

620
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,070
Maybe elementary school.
Beginning of middle school,

621
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,230
everybody hit their
growth spurt and I didn't,

622
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,700
I still had a high pitched voice in a, a
an orange Afro. That wasn't a good look.

623
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,050
That wasn't the look you wanted to
rock is the youth says. So. Anyways,

624
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:55,051
I have to take my driver's test out here
and I brought it up with a couple other

625
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,260
la Los Angelenos and
straight across the board.

626
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:03,850
Everybody was telling me like they had
horror in their eyes and how difficult

627
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:07,900
this fucking test was going. Oh my God,
dude, dude, it's dude. It's fucking hard.

628
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,110
It's fucking hard.
They kept saying that.

629
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,190
Remember I was living out here
10 years ago. I took the test.

630
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,890
It wasn't fucking hard, like don't
do it. I'm telling you, dude,

631
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:17,950
it was fucking hard and I had this
girl with this party was this,

632
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,510
have you been to the DMV on here? Oh
my God. It's not like the DMV. Anyway,

633
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:27,250
off La. It's just like if on Dale and
I kept saying, well I bended the DMV.

634
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,550
I been to it. I know it's crowded
and she just kept going now.

635
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,020
Now like you don't understand,

636
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,050
there's nothing worse than somebody
just tells me like you don't understand.

637
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,730
It's like from so many from Chicago,

638
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,270
when you try to tell him it was a cold
winter and then they got to go on about

639
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,450
fucking now you don't know what cold is
until you're standing there rubbing your

640
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:46,090
balls next to fucking Lake Michigan,
you know,

641
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,530
like it's fucking minus 20 degrees in
Boston. But still, that's my, you know,

642
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,130
my family all came from fucking the
Midwest. So anytime I had a paper,

643
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:56,470
when I bitch about the Colo, let
me tell you, you don't know cold.

644
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,420
You don't go to Chicago.
Let me tell you,

645
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,740
go to Chicago so that all those
fucking idiots and some good barbecue,

646
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:05,320
I'll do it. You don't know
barbecue? Go to fucking Texas.

647
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,420
That's where they got the bar.
Like,

648
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,450
like they're the only people
who know that shit. All right,

649
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:13,260
you got a little upset there. Don't
hold it against me. So anyways, uh,

650
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,220
[inaudible] he's telling me I
don't know what the fucking DMV is.

651
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:16,054
You know what all this does.

652
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,770
This just motivates me to pass this
fucking test and the first time so I can

653
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:24,760
just make, so I can justify me
judging all these la Douche bags,

654
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,600
like they're just mentally weak fucking
people. So I started studying the test,

655
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,490
get the book, and it's like 90 pages.
I was like, fuck, all right, whatever.

656
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,480
Break it down. I'm going to do 30
pages a day. I outlined this book,

657
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,040
Huh? What are you doing right now sitting
in your cubicle instead of working,

658
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,810
looking at your spreadsheets,
what are you doing?

659
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,150
I hear what I fucking outlined the book.

660
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I outlined the book 30 pages at a fucking
time meticulously like Tom Hanks in

661
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:55,810
that movie when he was chasing
Leonardo Dicaprio. Catch me if you can.

662
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,820
I was like that, that level
of shit. And I was, I,

663
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,710
I just, you know, fucking
broke the whole book down.

664
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,050
And then I sat there every day for 45
minutes to an hour and I went over all the

665
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:09,220
shit in two days before the test.
Saturday.

666
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,950
I actually took the sections out that I,

667
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:15,640
that I still was having problem with
and I just fucking went hardcore on that

668
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:19,090
section. Memorize that and
went through my all my outline.

669
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:22,090
I knew the whole fucking thing and
how you want to ask me some questions.

670
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,980
You want to talk about
parking near railroad tracks.

671
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,500
I got to fucking answer for you.
Seven and a half feet.

672
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,580
If you're inside a seven and a half feet,
you're fucked. 18 inches from the curb,

673
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,830
three feet from a fucking handicap ramp.

674
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,860
You know one of these fucking guys
rolling by asking you for a quarter.

675
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,700
Those guys can't get like
three feet close to those guys.

676
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:41,920
15 feet from a hydro.

677
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,420
You've got to start signaling a
hundred feet before you make a turn.

678
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,090
You get in the turning lane.
You can only drive in it for 200 feet.

679
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,560
He can't use it as a passing lane.
I had the shit down, so I'm like,

680
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:54,650
fuck all these people. I walked in there
confident. I'm talking Colby Bryan,

681
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:58,670
eight seconds left. Give me the fucking
ball. All right. I ironed my shirt.

682
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,720
I knew I was getting a picture of that
day for my license to be nothing but

683
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:07,700
success. So I walk in there, I
don't want to happen immediately.

684
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,630
I start getting fucking nervous. You
know like the first time I did Letterman.

685
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,670
All right, like the first fucking
time you do anything. I'm,

686
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:18,050
I'm fucking get nervous. I've taken
this fucker test four different times.

687
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,560
Took it in Boston, passed
it, New York passed it,

688
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:24,710
came out to la 10 years ago I passed it,
moved back to New York, passed the thing.

689
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,560
Why am I fucking nervous?
Cause he's fucking Las holes.

690
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,580
Their voices are in my head. Did it, did
you fucking hard dude, I fucking failed.

691
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,640
You know how to I forgot to mention
is they all said the same shit. Why?

692
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,310
Why they failed. It is cause
they didn't study the first time.

693
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:41,470
Cause I thought it was gonna be easy
cause they drive every day. Do you really?

694
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,110
How do you just think of how stupid that
statement is, dude, I drive every day.

695
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,040
I know how to do it.
It's those little things,

696
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,680
you know like what does a white curb meat,
you know,

697
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,780
he come up and it's painted white.
What does that mean?

698
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:58,190
Loading and unloading of passengers
or picking up mail, yellow curb,

699
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:00,500
what does that mean?
La Loading and unloading of freight.

700
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,050
If you're not in a commercial vehicle,
the driver has to stay with the car.

701
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:06,020
I studied for the Shit gimme the rock,

702
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,250
it's fucking going in and we're going
to the next round of the playoffs.

703
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:14,870
I was ready for that shit and I went
in there and I maybe there was just the

704
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:19,670
overall anxiety, the fucking place. But
I do the whole shit. First of all I do,

705
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:24,620
what I always do at the DMV is I just
blow off the line and I act like I didn't

706
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:28,040
see it and that I'm some
sorta like, you know, royalty,

707
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,100
like I'm actually staying at the embassy
for some fucking country and never

708
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:35,210
heard of.
I'm that guy.

709
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,270
You know when you stand in line and you
followed the rules and then you get up

710
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:41,200
to the fucking cashier lady
and then there's that dose.

711
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,120
He was just standing there
to the side respectively,

712
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,980
half an inch just behind your peripheral.

713
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:48,980
But you know he's there and you can't
have a pause in your conversation because

714
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:52,070
you know that asshole's going to jump in.
That's who the fuck I was. And I said,

715
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,760
Hey, I'm sorry buddy, sorry.
And I wasn't sorry. That was
me really being like, dude,

716
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:59,180
I'm interrupting you right
now. And I said, ah, I've got
to take this, uh, you know,

717
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:02,690
I had a previous, you know, a schedule
appointment, where do I go? Like, Oh,

718
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:06,350
you go around the corner, whatever. So
thank the guy. I wasn't saying thank you.

719
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,150
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

720
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:10,070
It's just trying to prevent the guy
from punching me in the face because I

721
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:13,670
deserved it. And I went over to
go take the fucking test and a,

722
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:17,600
I'm standing there and they only
got like this walled off area.

723
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,150
Okay. And that's how confident
I was. I didn't even,

724
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,260
I didn't even brush up out in the parking
lot. I was just like, bring the shit on.

725
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,600
You want me to take Lebron? I fucking
got him right. So I walk in there right?

726
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,820
And you got to wait til like only line
of like five people in there at a time.

727
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:37,500
So the first dude walks out and uh,
you know,

728
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,260
they got the black dude behind the
counter, like the host scared straight.

729
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,200
You need to get your shit
together. Kind of do, you know,

730
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,280
and I'm just sitting there going
off, fuck, here we go. Here we go.

731
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:47,971
This fucking guy,

732
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:51,330
this guy's breaking hearts all day and
he doesn't even give a fuck. Look at it.

733
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,570
Look on his face. He doesn't give a fuck
that bill Parcells look on his face,

734
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:55,020
right?

735
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,070
So there's fucking Indian dude comes up
and he and he hands him the thing and

736
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:03,810
the guy just fucking puts red all over
it and the guy fails. And then I'm like,

737
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:07,830
oh fuck the any guy. These guys are
fucking smart, right? Any guys are smart.

738
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,380
They fucking answer our phones over here.
I can't answer phones.

739
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,180
If somebody from India called me, you
know, give myself a fake Indian named,

740
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:15,540
these fucking people are smart.

741
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,190
These people were running shit until
the English fucked him over, right?

742
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,190
This guy fucking pass. But then I calmed
myself down. I'm like, wait a minute,

743
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,640
this is a second language. This is his
second language. If I went to France,

744
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,130
could I pass the driver's
test? Fuck No. All right,

745
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,510
don't compare yourself to that guy.

746
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,120
And then the next two came
up and it was a slacker.

747
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,670
This white kid who had
like tight jeans yet,

748
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:38,700
they were hanging off his ass and I just
wanted a boot him right in his fucking

749
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:43,530
taint. He passes. So it gave me hope
and I went in there, I got the test,

750
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,420
okay, I get eight hours sleep. I
took a deep breath and I'm like,

751
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:49,254
here we go.

752
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,670
I have the test right in front of me and
the first one was some bullshit about

753
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,230
what is the legal alcohol level. You
know that you can drive on it. I'm like,

754
00:45:58,231 --> 00:46:01,800
this is a fucking joke.
I'm going to ace this test and dude,

755
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,830
I'm going to tell you right
now after the first question,

756
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:09,000
it just went down fucking hill.
Listen to these questions.

757
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:11,490
I'm studying all this shit about
how close to park to a curve,

758
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,720
a curb and all that shit.
You must notify the DMV within five days.

759
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:20,100
If you sell or transfer your vehicle are
cited for a traffic violation. That's,

760
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,920
that's obviously no paint your
vehicle a different color sound like,

761
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:27,180
oh fuck, I didn't read that
part. I don't remember that part.

762
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,280
Sell or transfer your vehicle,
painted a different color. Five days,

763
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,140
sell a transfer your vehicle.

764
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:36,960
Don't you have to fucking
tell them right then I want,

765
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,550
they automatically know
with the satellites, they
won't see that transaction.

766
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:44,700
Go down in the fucking
driveway through it.

767
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:49,200
And then this is panic just like,
and I, and I, and I was like,

768
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,280
oh my God,
what the fuck?

769
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:54,030
And I got like six questions in and I
literally put the number two pencil down

770
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,420
and I whispered, yell. I went, really?

771
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,630
As I looked at the black dude when
he wasn't looking at me, of course,

772
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:03,630
totally passive aggressive and, uh, do it.

773
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,950
I'm not going to lie to
you this fucking test.

774
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:08,430
So it was brutal to fucking
brutal. And I, you know,

775
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:10,050
usually when you take
a multiple choice test,

776
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,940
it's like there's the obvious the half
right? And then the fucking ridiculous.

777
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,040
Like when you drink a glass of water,
should you a uh,

778
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,950
make sure you have
enough air in your lungs

779
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,290
before sucking down the entire glass.
And if you do run out of air,

780
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:31,000
stop drinking and inhale,
you know,

781
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,290
be smashed the glass against your
head, you know, obvious shit. Right?

782
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,380
This shit was like,
when is it legal to use a cell phone?

783
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:43,240
I have the test right here without a
hands free device while driving. Okay.

784
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,110
When is it legal to use a cell phone
without using a hands free device? Huh?

785
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,370
You got an answer a when making a
call while stopped at a red light,

786
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,860
that's obviously no,
but here's the two close ones.

787
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,490
When making a call for
emergency assistance or never,

788
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,310
when is it legal to use a cell
phone? Hands Free people, hands free,

789
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,230
hands free device and has all this shit
on TV going if he used his cell phone

790
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,030
and it's as bad as fucking
drinking and driving. And the book,

791
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:16,750
it said never and it
said you could use it to,

792
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:21,610
if for to make to make an emergency call
after you fucking pulled over and all

793
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:26,010
that bullshit. Look for somebody riding
a bike. You know, looking for an old guy,

794
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,450
one of those, try
sickles, all of that shit.

795
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,720
So this just said when making a
call for emergency assistance,

796
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,320
it didn't say you pulled over.
It didn't say you didn't pull over.

797
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:40,630
So I fucking panicked and I wrote
never got it wrong. All right,

798
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,130
let's just, that's fucking
stories taking 10 times longer.

799
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,330
How long it took me to study for
the fucking test. Long story short,

800
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,650
I'd have 18 questions. I
got 15 right. Three wrong.

801
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,330
I fucking pass the test but I owe,

802
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,770
I owe an apology to all you Los Angelenos.

803
00:48:56,771 --> 00:49:00,940
This is a hard ass fucking test. It was
difficult. I know what you're thinking.

804
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,550
Like that way you guys were all talking
shit cause you're relaxed right now.

805
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:06,130
Right?
We find another difficult one here.

806
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,070
Highways are typically most slippery.

807
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,590
This is a desert question
cause it doesn't rain out here.

808
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,350
And what happens is when it doesn't rain
for a while, oil transmission, fluid,

809
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,510
fluid, and gas all starts to coagulate.
And when it rains, it's like,

810
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,320
I can't say it's like ice, but God knows
people drive like it out here. But this,

811
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:27,870
this is the question, it says,
uh, uh, would, uh, fuck was it.

812
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,180
Highways are typically most slippery
during a heavy rainstorm in the middle of,

813
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,110
in the middle of summer.
All right. Middle of summer,

814
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,360
it's fucking dry out. You know, maybe
that's it. And then it says when it's,

815
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:43,510
when it first starts to rain
after a dry spell. Well yeah,

816
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,080
yeah, after a dry spell. Absolutely. But
the summer's dry. What the fuck writes?

817
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:53,830
And at this point, my Mike fucking heart
rate is going like 9,000 beats a second.

818
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,770
And then it says after it's
been raining for a long time,

819
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,740
if it's been raining for a long time,
the roads are wet.

820
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:01,420
It's going to still be fucking slippery.

821
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,910
But I know it has to do
with it being dry out here.

822
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,510
So I fucking broke that one
down. I'm like, all right,
it's the middle of summer.

823
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,570
It's a heavy fucking rainstorm.

824
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:15,790
Who's to say it didn't
fucking rain heavily the day
before and it already washed

825
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,110
all the guests off.
So then I get,

826
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,530
so I guessed when it first starts to
rain after a dry spell and I was fucking

827
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:24,130
right, but that's the level you had
to break this shit down. All right,

828
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:28,550
so I passed. That's it. They took
my thumb. The fucking Illuminati,

829
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,300
you know, sent that right to
the Rothschild's fucking house.

830
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,300
Do you know those sons of bitches
actually have the audacity,

831
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:39,770
the Rothschilds to have a book about
the giant fucking house they bought in

832
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:44,210
England off of all their fucking
Shylock money from the rest of us.

833
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,580
Do you believe you believe
the fucking balls of that?

834
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,230
Evidently there's something beyond
our mansion. It's called a manner.

835
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,570
That's when you have you,

836
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,010
that's when you do take like fucking
12 mansions and you put it together and

837
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:00,680
like, people don't even know
how to get to your house.

838
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,980
Like I can guarantee you
something right fucking now. Oh,

839
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,690
this is a great way to see
if they're running shit.

840
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,490
You know when you Google maps, like if
you Google map where the fuck I live?

841
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,590
Not only can you see my place,
they'll probably,

842
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:14,870
you can probably see my brand
new social security card.

843
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:18,590
No one gives a fuck about me. But if
you Google map the Rothschild's house,

844
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:23,620
I guarantee you it doesn't fucking show
up like the God Damn White House cause

845
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,010
they're running shit.
And you know what?

846
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,730
They have my thumbprint on
their fucking wall of the,

847
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,300
of their fucking nine mile wine cellar.
Does that make any sense?

848
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:34,820
Well it shouldn't because I don't read.
All right.

849
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,820
I don't fucking read anyways.

850
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,320
What else do I got going on here that
wasn't bad hot for being filmed that in

851
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:45,620
and seem to self conscious. Look at
that. Get a big nod. Eyebrows up.

852
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,150
I think it's going good.
The first filmed Monday morning podcast.

853
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,070
This is what I do.
If you've been listening to this,

854
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:54,590
I'm talking to the camera right now,
not to you go back to work.

855
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,320
You've been fucking off already
for 19 minutes and 40 seconds.

856
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,410
This is what I do every week.
I sit here in my, in my,

857
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:05,270
in my pajamas and my little footlocker
tee shirt, you know, is this foot locker?

858
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,980
I don't know what the fuck this is.
Footlocker,

859
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:12,220
like 87 t shirts for like $9 if you
ever wondered if you ever wondered,

860
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:14,720
hey,

861
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,490
did a three year old put this shirt
together or was the person at least 16 you

862
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:22,520
can never be more sure than when you go
to footlocker and you buy those fucking

863
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:25,670
tee shirts. When you get like
nine of them for eight bucks,

864
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:29,390
that's guaranteed that that's not
even child. That's like toddler,

865
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,370
toddler fucking labor.
Be funnier if I could fucking say it.

866
00:52:33,371 --> 00:52:35,990
So this is what I do every
week. Okay. Is what I do.

867
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:37,460
So if you want to listen to the podcast,

868
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,000
go to [inaudible] dot com click
on Monday morning podcasts.

869
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,570
You hate your fucking job. Hopefully
there'll be on iTunes at this point.

870
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:47,150
They will be, I'm going to talk
shit, they're going to be on iTunes.

871
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,520
You know I have like 14 listeners.

872
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:51,250
I'm trying to get it up to
15 whenever they put there.

873
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,830
Why the fuck you want from me? All
right, let's plow. Okay, I'm back.

874
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:59,660
I'm back doing the podcast. Um, all right,
let's get to the stories this week. I,

875
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:02,990
uh, that was the first story. I'm just
gonna tell some stories this week.

876
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:05,400
I got another one for
you. Um, at this point,

877
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:08,570
do you want me to pause Brian and go into
another room to give people something

878
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:12,020
visually different to look at?
Should I do that? All right,

879
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,410
let's try to hit pause here. Uh, this
is going to be really quick for you.

880
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:18,320
People listening at home. It's like,
I'm going to pause and then we're back.

881
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,300
So I'm pausing right now.
All right. Yeah, we'll,

882
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,040
we'll put bookshelves and the, okay,
we're back. We're back. We decided,

883
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:28,770
you know what, we already tried to do
this and I fucking lost the whole podcast.

884
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,910
So we're not doing it. I'm
recording right now. We just,

885
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,440
you don't need to record this.
You don't even, you know,

886
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,740
I'm not going to use this on a DVD.

887
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,220
This is just for the poor bastards
at home listening. I actually,

888
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:41,880
so that's my deal. Everybody. I'm moving
shit around my apartment right now.

889
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:42,900
This is exciting.

890
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:48,300
It's exciting to audit in an audio way
to hear the it isn't. I know it's not,

891
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,370
dude. You know what? Is there
any doctors that listen to this?

892
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,990
How fucking arrogant is that?

893
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:56,310
Like they have time between surgery
to listen to a moron like me. Well,

894
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:59,220
a lot of doctors are arrogant anyways.
They save people's lives.

895
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:02,820
They get that God complex. Just to let
you know. I'll do, that's my water.

896
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,310
All right. That's yours over there.
Okay. Just letting you know. I mean,

897
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,250
I like you when everything, all right. You
did a great job on the pilot, but let's,

898
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:12,510
let's keep it there. Um, I
fucked up the arch in my foot.

899
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,620
I did it years ago from playing drums,

900
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,970
trying to get my foot as fast as John
Bonham's having no fucking technique and

901
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:25,560
not having stretched so that that tendon
that runs from the ball of your fucking

902
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,260
foot to your heel every once in a while,

903
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,880
I fuck it up in it and it just takes
forever to heal and I don't know what I'm

904
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:36,780
supposed to do about it.
All right? I stretch.

905
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,150
I got the tennis ball
rubbing underneath it.

906
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,980
I know I'm not supposed to walk
around, but that's what I do. Okay?

907
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,420
I use my feet. A lot of
people don't, you know,

908
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:51,120
if you walk into a Mcdonald's
and you see those people,

909
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,620
that's what they use their feet for, to
walk to their car, to sit in their car.

910
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,010
And then if they don't even go in anymore,
they just drive right up.

911
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,500
So I want to know what
else can I be doing?

912
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:04,530
Is there any sort of aspirin that
I can be taking to get the fucking

913
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:07,820
inflammation down? And you
probably wondered, okay, you're,

914
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:12,110
you're probably asking me
this bill because not being
able to use your footage,

915
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,870
fucking annoying. It
goes beyond that. Dr. So,

916
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:18,900
and so I'll tell you what my problem is.

917
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,430
My problem is I'm going back east for,

918
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:27,420
for a friend of mine's daughter is
graduating college and I have to go to the

919
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:31,210
graduation and uh,
I'm getting it back,

920
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,420
get getting together with some
people I used to play drums with,

921
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:36,180
we used to jam with back in the day when
we all thought we were going to get on

922
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:38,460
MTV and be the latest hair metal band,

923
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,660
the fact that you had a red head and a
hair metal band and then he could only

924
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:48,120
grow a fucking Afro right there.

925
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,210
Should've let you know that you weren't
gonna make it. So long story short,

926
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:55,950
we're getting together and rather than
going back and playing the music we

927
00:55:55,951 --> 00:56:00,060
played in the 80s because that would
just be too sad to go back and play my

928
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:04,620
Michelle
or whatever the fuck we used to play.

929
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,480
We're like,
let's do something more contemporary.

930
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:10,380
And I've always played single bass drum
and I became a huge fan of Pantera and

931
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:11,011
shit.
So I go,

932
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:14,670
let's do cowboys from hell and it's
got this insane double bass part.

933
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,230
And the second I said that Shit,

934
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:18,870
I fucked up my foot and I haven't
been able to practice. And meanwhile,

935
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:22,950
the guitar player, the Bass Player,
they're all shredding, you know,

936
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,900
ignoring their children.
So,

937
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:29,350
and here I am going to be the foundation
of the band and my foot's fucked up.

938
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:33,700
So I need a quick remedy.
All right, I need something.

939
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,190
I need something fucking
quickly here. Uh, that,

940
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,910
is there anything that I can take
that, that will just, you know,

941
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:44,170
I don't want to take roids from my foot
coming there with my right foot twice as

942
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:47,470
big as the, uh, my left foot.
You know, I don't need that.

943
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,180
Have one big Jason Gme,

944
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,120
Roger Clemens Foot and the other one's
walking around like Willie McGee.

945
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,840
I don't need that shit. All right,
tell me, what do I take aspirin?

946
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,000
Aleve. What do I take? Come
on podcast fucking free.

947
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,250
You can hook me up a
little free medical advice.

948
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:08,650
Can you email me a prescription or
that just literally, and you're,

949
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:10,810
you're fucking days as a
doctor. All right, let's,

950
00:57:10,811 --> 00:57:13,810
let's continue on with the podcast.
As I sit here,

951
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:17,590
rolling a tennis ball underneath
my foot. Um, the next thing, oh,

952
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:19,570
here's a great story for you,
Brian. You might like this.

953
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,870
Do you know I was a hero this week?
I was actually,

954
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,380
I did something heroic.
I have never,

955
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,270
I have never done anything
heroic in my life. Okay.

956
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,200
And believe me,

957
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,550
I've walked by house fires and saw
people screaming saying there's a ladder

958
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:39,790
right there. Just put it up. And
I walked away. I walked away.

959
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,810
It's kind of like I didn't hear him.
I'm that kind of a fucking guy. Um, no,

960
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:47,110
this is the deal. It was
a Sunday. And you know,

961
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:50,320
people go to brunch on Sunday on like,
all right, fuck it. I'll go to brunch.

962
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,920
I'll go to brunch. Right? Remember that
bid? Huh? Pace $18 as fast as the Wa.

963
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,950
Is that a, this, how did that bit go?
Is that as, I thought it was pesto.

964
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:04,210
It's asparagus. I can't remember.
So we go to brunch and a, you know,

965
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:05,860
it's the usual shit.
Do you want to sit inside?

966
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:09,280
You want to sit out outside as a redhead?
I'm always going inside.

967
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,920
Let's fucking sit inside.
I got enough freckles.

968
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,710
I've had enough fucking pain in my life.
Please.

969
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,620
Let's sit inside now.
But you know,

970
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:21,920
I'm always with broads cause they always
want to go to brunch and it's fun.

971
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,030
It's fun. It's always fucking
nice when they go to brunch.

972
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:28,120
It's never raining is it? Right.
Sorry. All right, let's sit outside.

973
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,750
We sit outside and
because I'm the gentlemen,

974
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:35,710
I have to sit with my back to the
road so I can brace, you know,

975
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:39,010
and protect my girlfriend and her mom
and case a bread truck comes flying in

976
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:40,990
because the guys text
messaging or something, right?

977
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,790
So I'm sitting there and uh,

978
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,930
all of a sudden I just feel it.

979
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,950
I just feel like something's fucking
wrong and something my caveman DNA,

980
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,710
like when you get in
stocked by a saber tooth,

981
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:57,370
tiger just kicks in and something
just tells me to fucking look left.

982
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,400
And I look left and here comes this
crazy fucking lady and I'm talking crazy.

983
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,510
I'm talking shutter island.

984
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:10,600
Remember that chick that shushed
Leonardo Dicaprio set the second Leonardo

985
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,040
Dicaprio fucking reference.
There you go.

986
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,530
You remember that chick who
shushed him and shutter island?

987
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:19,630
That's what this girl looked like, except
with sort of brownish red hair. Okay?

988
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,870
It's basically one of these people who
should be getting professional help is

989
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:28,820
straight up bat shit crazy, and
there's just, this state is bankrupt,

990
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:29,990
so they just let them go.

991
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,570
They just let these fucking people go
and you don't see Sarah McLaughlin wine

992
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,760
and about these people come
out and rescue these fucking,

993
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,400
these people who are
talking to telephone poles.

994
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:43,940
It's all about the dogs with her.
Her priorities are so fucked up.

995
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,430
It's ridiculous.
I hope she sees this.

996
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,360
I am so disappointed in
you Sarah McLaughlin. Huh?

997
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,170
When are you going to grow up and stop
whining about those little pussy ass

998
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:58,760
fucking dogs? All right. That was
mean. All right, let's get back to it.

999
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,590
So she starts coming down
the street and she's like,

1000
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:04,310
she looks like she's going to
start fucking crying. Okay. Like,

1001
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,390
and it's just one of those things,
you know, you just feel it.

1002
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:09,550
This fucking person is going
to do something and I have
a feeling they're going

1003
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:13,490
to do it to me. So I, I'm, I'm
working out my shit. I'm like first,

1004
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:17,870
fortunately the chairs with these really
light wicker sorta kind of Douchey

1005
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,703
Brunchy chairs.

1006
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,160
So I was just going to grab the fucking
chair and I was going to smash her in

1007
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:26,660
the face if I didn't have time or if I
had time I was going to leap to my feet

1008
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,490
on my bad fucking foot and out like
a lion tamer, get back crazy person,

1009
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,353
right.

1010
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,880
Start whipping her with the fucking tulips
on the Nice, beautiful brunch table.

1011
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,850
That's what I was going to do.
So she doesn't lunge at me,

1012
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:45,080
but she walks by means that awful moment,
the blind spot, you know what I mean?

1013
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,690
Where she's not to my left,
she's not to my right.

1014
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:50,230
She's right behind me and she fucking
goes by me and I'm like, thank God.

1015
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:55,260
I was seriously fucking nervous
and I looked left again just to,

1016
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:58,550
you know,
I don't know why I looked left again.

1017
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:03,551
And then I see this fucking sad looking
woman slowly following the crazy person

1018
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,900
with this look on her face like she
had been wronged. I, next thing I know,

1019
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,670
next thing I fucking know,

1020
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:14,260
she's talking to the table
next to us and talking to us,

1021
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,180
talking about how that crazy
woman had just walked up to her,

1022
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,020
reached up to her sweater
and just fucking ripped.

1023
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,020
I know she had a brooch.

1024
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:28,040
She just fucking took it off her
chest and walked away with it.

1025
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:33,040
And I'm looking at the lady and she has
the lady and she has this fucking hole

1026
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:36,260
in her sweater where something
had clearly been ripped off.

1027
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,760
And for the life of me,

1028
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,900
I don't know why I
immediately just got up.

1029
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,920
I don't know why. I have no
fucking idea why there was a fight.

1030
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:46,970
I don't do this shit.

1031
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:52,630
I get up and now I'm going down the
street following the shutter island lady

1032
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,330
with no training whatsoever
in this situation.

1033
01:01:56,331 --> 01:02:00,680
I'm literally walking and now I couldn't
sit down. I couldn't get sit down. Like,

1034
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,880
I have this, this fucking
Lee Marvin, I'm going to go,

1035
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:07,010
I'm going to make shit right moment.
And then I go, you know what?

1036
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:07,661
Maybe I'll sit down.

1037
01:02:07,661 --> 01:02:10,570
I look at the biggest pussy ever and
not only my girlfriend and my mother's

1038
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:15,410
there. So I had to keep going. So now I'm
following this girl and I'm literally,

1039
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,111
I'm fine.

1040
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,270
Haven't been so fucking nervous in my
life because it would have been bad enough

1041
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:24,690
if we, if it was like a crazy
dude, a crazy guy. He's scary.

1042
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,410
But at least you know if, if, if it
gets physical, I mean, what, what,

1043
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:33,690
what are the rules in that? Do
you know Brian? What did you know?

1044
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,020
You can't hit a woman, but what if
she's crazy and she just stole a brooch?

1045
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,950
How about a jab? Just kind of get
a mitten, a face like Larry Holmes,

1046
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:45,750
so she doesn't see the overhand, right.
Anyways, I don't know what to do,

1047
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,590
so,

1048
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,860
but I can't go back to the table or I'm
going to look like a bitch in front of

1049
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:53,550
my girlfriend and my mom saw,
I'm like, fuck, why didn't
I get up? Why did I get up?

1050
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:57,360
Why didn't I, why didn't I say sit
inside? I wanted to sit inside,

1051
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,510
but I didn't want to seem like a root
prick in front of my girlfriend's mom.

1052
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,460
Like I tell her what to do.
Like she says,

1053
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:05,160
kept fucking woman
Saddam in this situation.

1054
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:08,790
So I'm walking down the street and this
is what I do. She's on the sidewalk.

1055
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:12,120
I'm literally in the
street. Okay. I'm like,

1056
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:17,310
is that circumnavigation I'm doing some
police shit where I'm staying outside of

1057
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:19,740
whatever she can throw at me scratching.
It's one of these people,

1058
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,920
you got to get like a tetanus shot if
you roll around the ground or hepatitis

1059
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:26,070
Assam Shit. So I'm like, what
am I going to do? What do I do?

1060
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:31,050
So I don't know what happened. I just
said I, I basically, I just started going,

1061
01:03:31,051 --> 01:03:35,310
hey ya. Hey Sweetheart.
Hey Sweetie. I basically,

1062
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:40,140
I think I started calling her affectionate
name from like the 1940s hey ya,

1063
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,970
fucking tall drink of water.

1064
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,680
And I finally got her attention and she
turns around and looks at me with this

1065
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:51,210
crazy look with tears in her
eyes. And I just say, uh, I, I,

1066
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,550
I think you have something that
doesn't belong to you. And meanwhile,

1067
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:57,840
there's a fucking pathetic lady who just
let her walk up to her to begin with.

1068
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:00,630
It's like he didn't see that she was
crazy. That's why I'm in this situation,

1069
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:02,130
right.
She fucking,

1070
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,030
she ends up walking up to the
girl and the h when I said,

1071
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:07,410
I think you have something
that doesn't belong to you.

1072
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:09,360
She just sort of looked at
me and like in slow motion,

1073
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,540
lifted up her left arm and she had this
green pea soup look and sweater on and

1074
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:18,930
she had the brooch pinned to like just
right around her wrist and she just held

1075
01:04:18,931 --> 01:04:22,860
it up. So at this point I'm like,
I'm not touching this bitch.

1076
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,960
So I let the, the, the fucking victim
lady with the sad puppy dog eyes,

1077
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:36,110
she comes in and I'm basically sitting
there like an NHL ref with respect for

1078
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:39,570
two goons that are about
ready to go at it. Right.

1079
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,490
And I'm just going to jump in when I
see that I can jump in to stop this,

1080
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,320
this fight that's going to happen without
getting hit myself. And uh, so anyways,

1081
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:53,130
the lady starts unpinning the
brooch and the whole time she's,

1082
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,730
she basically followed my lead by being
nice. She just kept gone. Thank you.

1083
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:59,190
I really appreciate it.
I really appreciate this.

1084
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:00,900
And she couldn't get
the fucking thing off.

1085
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,720
It was like one of those action movies
with like the clock's going down for the

1086
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:06,390
bomb and I'm sitting there going
lady and my head, I'm like,

1087
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,870
would you get that fucking brooch
off this crazy bitches arm?

1088
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,350
And I just kept looking at her right
hand cause I knew at some point she was

1089
01:05:13,351 --> 01:05:16,560
either going to gouge her eye out,
just do some crazy shit. Right?

1090
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,030
Like you know that the scrap metal that
these people put pickup and floss their

1091
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:25,120
teeth. What she was just going to stick
it right in the juggler. So finally,

1092
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:29,590
long story short, she gets the fucking
broach off and then we, we back away

1093
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,270
who's like, ah, exchange. Like we
were like, wait, we gave some money,

1094
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,480
briefcase and we got the abducted
kid back and we fucking walk away.

1095
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,820
And I'm like, Oh fuck. Thank God.

1096
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:43,630
Thank God that worked on actually walked
back to the, to the brunch. All right.

1097
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:48,580
Walk back to the brunch and I got a
fucking applause break from like all these

1098
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:51,910
people eating eggs benedict and eggs
Florentine. It was fucking awesome.

1099
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:57,700
I was a Goddamn hero this
week. People, uh, scared.

1100
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:01,080
Nervous fucking dude.
I'm tell you Brian,

1101
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:05,680
I didn't come within seven
feet of this woman. I was
literally, you know, you know,

1102
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:07,660
fucking a, the avenue out
there, I'm going to say where,

1103
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,760
cause I don't need psychos. Know
where the fuck I live. You know,

1104
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,120
like I'm anywhere near that
level of notoriety. Uh,

1105
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,830
I was literally fucking like, she's one of
that wall is over there. I'm going, hey,

1106
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:21,280
sweeter to people who didn't
know what was going on.

1107
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:24,970
They probably thought it
was some construction worker
hitting on her look in the

1108
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:29,320
fucking games on there. So,
uh, yeah, that was my week.

1109
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,770
That was my weak people. I got my
pass, my fucking driver's test,

1110
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:37,180
and I was at God damn hero.
Huh? What did you do this week?

1111
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:37,931
You know what that reminds me of?

1112
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:39,910
What was that shitty action
movie that ended that way?

1113
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,720
That started that emaciated bitch? That
fucking, uh, uh, I was going to say,

1114
01:06:43,721 --> 01:06:46,060
Brian Johnson. Brad Pitt's
dating. What's her name?

1115
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:50,440
Natasha or wrote Robin Linskey. She's
got one of those. I'm a hot girl names.

1116
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,320
What's her name?
Angelina.

1117
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:58,150
You ever seen a fucking ugly girl
named Angelina? Natasha. Brooke.

1118
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:02,780
That's like a hell of a gamble.
You just know your daughter is,

1119
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:07,420
is his fucking is going to be hot. Right?
And she's going to go for the money.

1120
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:12,570
She's going for the gold. So, uh, yeah.
What, what was that movie? She did what?

1121
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:16,150
She was the assassin and the
whole movie was kind of okay.

1122
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:18,790
And then the movie ends with
Blahblahblah and then ends. He goes,

1123
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:22,910
what the fuck did you do today?
Yeah, no, no, not Mrs Mr. Smith.

1124
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,240
That was the one after that.
Morgan Freeman was in it and they,

1125
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,780
they stayed shoot the gun in the
fucking bullet would, would go, oh,

1126
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,100
this is driving everybody on the podcast.

1127
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,710
And that's because they know the name
of it. Well, the movie basically ends.

1128
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:36,120
He goes, what the fuck did you do
today? I mean, they got pissed. Hi,

1129
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:40,090
watched the mediocre movie. I
say Meteoric York. Mediocre.

1130
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:44,170
All right, whatever. Go fuck yourselves.
Okay, this is a what, 35 minutes,

1131
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:47,950
then 35 minutes. And this is going to be,
like I said, it's gonna be a DVD extra.

1132
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,040
And if you're watching this,
I probably should've said this earlier.

1133
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:55,390
Maybe we'll do it in the wraparounds
not to talk shop. I was going to say,

1134
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:59,500
where the fuck you can go see
this, get this podcast. Um,

1135
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:02,560
but here's something new for some of
you who have actually found my podcast,

1136
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:05,590
which I love at this point, to actually
find my podcast. It's like a fucking test,

1137
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,240
really weeding out the
computer illiterate, um,

1138
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,230
of which I probably couldn't even
find my own podcast unless I, uh,

1139
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,700
if I didn't do it anyways, we
have a new fan page. Uh, it's,

1140
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,170
it's www.thempodcast.com,

1141
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,570
www.capital letters,
m,

1142
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:27,380
m p and then all lowercase podcast.com.
Uh,

1143
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:31,310
I explained that bad the MMP or all
capital letters. All right. Fuck you.

1144
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:36,020
Www dot the [inaudible]
podcast.com. Go there. Um,

1145
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,480
I definitely think there'll be
some pictures of Leonardo Dicaprio.

1146
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,510
I make references to shit. Sometimes
Times people don't know what it is.

1147
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:43,320
The movie that I couldn't
remember the name of.

1148
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,100
It's driving you nuts
that will be up there. Uh,

1149
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:49,070
and whatever else I fucking talked about.

1150
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:53,240
And as there's youtube videos
and all that type of shit, um,

1151
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,960
of which this week, you know what?
I don't have any youtube videos.

1152
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:01,750
I got to admit I was hardcore studying
for this impossibly difficult, um,

1153
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,010
test.
What else do I got?

1154
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,390
You want me to move again so we
can have something different?

1155
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:11,600
Where else would I go? I went from
the, the, the, the, the sofa. Well,

1156
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:15,680
I was going to go into another room, but
I'm so paranoid then I'm going to wear,

1157
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,380
I got to stand up here for a second.
Maybe it be, I'll be standing up here.

1158
01:09:19,381 --> 01:09:21,060
Can you get that?
Can you get that with the camera?

1159
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,500
Is this interesting to your people
at all? Oh, here's one for you.

1160
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,780
The conspiracy theory. Somebody sent
me something from, uh, from England.

1161
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,011
All right.

1162
01:09:32,011 --> 01:09:36,300
Because the 14 listeners of my podcast
of I'm going international with my

1163
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,630
failure,
um,

1164
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:43,530
was saying that in England they're
actually experimenting with, um,

1165
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:49,580
using satellite to catch speeders
satellite technology to catch speeders.

1166
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,840
Can you fucking believe that?
Somewhere in the middle of that,

1167
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:57,540
I just lost all outrage.
I knew I was fucking pissed.

1168
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:01,100
I stood up and I just realized
I was really hungry. That's,

1169
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:02,290
that's one of those things that you get,

1170
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,800
you got to understand when you're
starving to death. If you sit down,

1171
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:06,540
it doesn't feel as bad.
You know,

1172
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:09,210
if you ever watch those things when Sally
Struthers back in the day used to be

1173
01:10:09,211 --> 01:10:10,890
next to those starving
kids and what we just see,

1174
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:14,340
they were always sitting down or laying
down and you think it's because they're

1175
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:18,030
weak. It isn't. They could stand up if
they wanted to, but you just feel hungry.

1176
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:22,650
There's something about your
pancreas sort of fills up that spot.

1177
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,030
Oh fuck you. I know. I don't know
what I'm talking about. Um, all right,

1178
01:10:27,031 --> 01:10:29,470
let's skip back to conspiracy theories.
Here's a conspiracy theory.

1179
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:34,430
Somebody sent me this week, somebody sent
me this this week, my podcast in my lap,

1180
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,480
low level of radiation going into
my nuts right now. You know what?

1181
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:38,921
They should start,

1182
01:10:38,921 --> 01:10:42,290
they should make the bottom like give
you some sort of optional lead suit with

1183
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,940
these things.
You know,

1184
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,580
I think that would be a great thing
of Billy Mills was still alive.

1185
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:50,570
If you could make like some sort of
cell phone led helmet that comes in like

1186
01:10:50,571 --> 01:10:53,420
three different colors,
a manly color color,

1187
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,580
a a womanly color,

1188
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,690
and then a pattern.
There you go.

1189
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,680
And then when it becomes huge,
then you start putting sport logos on it.

1190
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,270
Then they do that with the snuggie.

1191
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:09,770
Then you could get like a red skin
snuggie for all those people who get cold

1192
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:14,340
while watching football.
Dude,

1193
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:15,001
I'm telling you man,

1194
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:17,190
that's how I'm going to parachute
out of this fucking business.

1195
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:20,460
I got to come up with some
bullshit and just, you know,

1196
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,620
I scream all the time when I do my jokes.
I don't know how,

1197
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,750
I don't know if you've
ever noticed this Brian,

1198
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:25,920
but I don't know how to write a joke.

1199
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,730
So when I do is I say fuck a lot and I
just scream it, you know? And then the,

1200
01:11:30,731 --> 01:11:33,780
the reverb of me yelling, you can't hear
that. There was no laughter afterwards.

1201
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:35,370
So I already know how to
do the Billy Mays thing.

1202
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,260
So all we can do is just come
up with some hunk of shit.

1203
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:40,680
Old People, old people.
That's where you got to go.

1204
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,970
Do you ever go on the can kill me?

1205
01:11:42,971 --> 01:11:46,600
When I went to fucking Dwayne Reed one
time and I saw that booster chair for the

1206
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:49,090
toilet seat, I was just like, fuck,

1207
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:54,920
that's brilliant. Yeah. 20
million later that said, people,

1208
01:11:54,921 --> 01:11:58,760
you start in a booster chair and you
ended a booster chair. If you're lucky,

1209
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,680
if you don't end in a booster chair,

1210
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:03,470
that means you got hit by a bus
and what would you rather do?

1211
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,121
Here's a question for you.

1212
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:09,590
Would you rather get hit by a bus at 42
bang and some of the hot ass hardest ass

1213
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:12,170
on the planet,
you know,

1214
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:17,240
or would you rather live to be
70 boost to chair on the toilet?

1215
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,360
You know, I've talked
about this before, right?

1216
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:22,730
Your old balls hanging
in the toilet water.

1217
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,310
That's why they have the booster chairs.
So you're nuts on hit the water.

1218
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:29,810
Oh my God.
Is it the eighties again?

1219
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,810
So do we fucking booze to cheers.

1220
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,750
Um, yeah, this is the podcast. Let's
get onto the next thing. Uh, all right.

1221
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,340
That was me giving you a little button
there. This is the podcast and we're out.

1222
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,720
All right, conspiracy the week. Bill, you
often talk about conspiracies. Yes I do.

1223
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:50,280
And this may or may not fall into that
category, but it definitely pisses me off.

1224
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,280
I love this guy already.
I don't know if this is a conspiracy,

1225
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:57,750
but if fucking pisses me off eyeball to
eyeball with you so far, buddy. All right.

1226
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:02,780
I get my cable and Internet
service bundled together
from Time Warner last month

1227
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:04,080
with my bill,

1228
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:09,410
I got an a in insert stating that they
were modifying their privacy policy.

1229
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,030
Basically it states timewarner reserves
the right to distribute my internet

1230
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:18,270
content with or without my consent.

1231
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,130
From my understanding,

1232
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:24,030
this could mean anything from the
searches I requested from Google to the

1233
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:28,080
websites I have been to. What rights
do we have in this country anymore?

1234
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,410
Just venting. All right,
dude. Yeah, absolutely.

1235
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,050
Basically what they've been doing the

1236
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:40,250
entire fucking time since the beginning
of the Internet is now becoming legal.

1237
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,760
So for all you people out there
who always thought like, uh,

1238
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,490
like I love when you watch like those,
those talk shows and they talk about, um,

1239
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:52,680
sexting like where you're, you're,
you're text messaging, you know,

1240
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,420
I'm going to fuck you from
behind whatever. Why that's
sexy. I even though idea,

1241
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,030
you know, do you think their
thumbs tremble but whatever,

1242
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:02,010
I'm not going to judge or like they,

1243
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:06,360
they talk about Skype sex and there'll
be like, why do these people do this?

1244
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:10,290
Why would somebody who had never done,
they always bring a psychologists on,

1245
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:13,960
right? And always have a
beard. So you know that they
majored in psychology, right?

1246
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:19,480
And then they go, they always say the
same shit and there'll be just like, well,

1247
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,520
it's the, uh, anonymity of
it. They, they feel anonymous.

1248
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:27,250
And, and in that situation,
they, they, they, they,

1249
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:30,190
they do things that they normally
wouldn't done. Well, first of all, people,

1250
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:35,290
it's not anonymous. You had dumb fucks.
It isn't, they just saying it's anonymous.

1251
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,440
They just sent it. We don't think
that they're building a file on you.

1252
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,040
So all these fucking morons who've lived
the life of the straight and narrow get

1253
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:48,640
on Skype and they stick their junk
right in the camera. You're an idiot.

1254
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:51,950
You're done. You're already
done. Because they, they're,

1255
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:55,510
they're building robots right now
to re to fucking replace all of us.

1256
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,630
And what did you then,

1257
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:59,350
but they're going to keep some of
us because somebody got an oil.

1258
01:14:59,351 --> 01:15:03,100
They're fucking robot joints.
And what did you do?

1259
01:15:03,101 --> 01:15:06,520
You stuck your Dick in the camera
yet you're processed. It's over.

1260
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:10,490
It's over. You got to take the
driver's test. I wouldn't even find,

1261
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,340
won't even study.
You're fucking finish.

1262
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:16,420
You're going to get processed just like
those people and that fucking movie with

1263
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:20,740
that guy just died. I can never remember
the name. What's the name of the,

1264
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:24,790
Patrick Swayze was in
it. Blood force. Thunder.

1265
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,360
New America. What the fuck
was it called? He'll come.

1266
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:32,860
The Russians pissing the radiator.
All that. All that hatred is gonna.

1267
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:35,800
Gonna gonna eat you up.
Keeps me warm.

1268
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,960
Remember that Ed Begley Jr was in
it. No, he wasn't the fucking, uh,

1269
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:45,940
the kid who was in Seoul, man was in
it. And he shot his friend avenge me.

1270
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:49,930
C'Mon Red Dawn. Jesus Christ.
Brian, you're a fucking director.

1271
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:55,060
Do you get that man? When you get let you
live that panic, that brain panic. Okay.

1272
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:59,100
He just got it. Okay, good. I thought it
was only me. Uh, yeah, absolutely. No,

1273
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:02,050
this people,
if you want to watch porn like porn,

1274
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:05,560
the porn industry is fucking is going
through what the music industry is going

1275
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:09,940
through right now where all of a sudden
the shit just became free. All right?

1276
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:13,180
So now everybody's fucking whacking
off on the Internet thinking nobody's

1277
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,400
watching what?
You're fucking rubbing your shit out too.

1278
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:19,510
They're all watching and they're
building a fucking file. All right.

1279
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,550
You think already,

1280
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:25,610
haven't you noticed why the president's
keep getting worse and worse and they

1281
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:29,500
keep fucking getting on their knees
and blowing the banks more and more?

1282
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,670
It's because of the Internet.

1283
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:34,270
All they got to do is break out their
internet file and show him some of the

1284
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:37,540
shit that they know that they jerked
off to. When it's fights over,

1285
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:39,370
it's fucking over.

1286
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:41,500
You got to do everything that they're
gonna say they're gonna exposure.

1287
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,250
They don't even need to take you to
Dallas anymore. That's old school.

1288
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,740
That's why Kennedy got shot in the head.
If there was an internet,

1289
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,900
he'd still be walking
around talking right now,

1290
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,020
cutting the ribbon at his fucking library,
shitting his pants.

1291
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,240
He wouldn't give the eulogy at Fed
head Ted's fucking funeral. Um,

1292
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,160
yeah. So that's, that's what I'm
saying. Okay. If you want to,

1293
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:04,060
if you want to jerk off
to something freaky,

1294
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:07,900
I would say go to a porn store and just
deal with the fact that the guy behind

1295
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:10,460
the counter is going to know what you got.
Pay Cash

1296
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,420
and walk away. It's a done deal. But
if you're going to go on the Internet

1297
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,940
and do some of the shit that you're doing,

1298
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:24,470
all you can hope now is that you're going
to get lost in the shuffle. Actually.

1299
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:27,890
You can continue to do what you're doing
as long as you never tried to effect.

1300
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,840
If you never try to effectively
effect change, you know what I mean?

1301
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,960
That's, that's when they break out
your Internet file. Other than that,

1302
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:40,160
it just goes on a fucking database.
But the second you start a movement going,

1303
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:41,150
you know what,
dude,

1304
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,290
I'm sick of paying 25 bucks in my
first bag when I get on a plane.

1305
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:47,180
If you get enough people behind you,

1306
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:51,140
United will not go to Time Warner
and be like, yeah, Russell Johnson.

1307
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:55,040
Yeah, open his file. What does he
jerk? What's the most fucked up thing?

1308
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:59,450
He's joking.
That is the end of the movement.

1309
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,810
Present Fox News will get
it and they'll just be,

1310
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:07,520
it turns out Russell Johnson jerked
off to a trainee and a magic last week.

1311
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:11,000
This was the guy who is going to
lead us. Oh, don't get me wrong.

1312
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:11,930
I'm doing Glenn Beck.

1313
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:16,860
All right, let me, Oh that
fucking guy. Jesus Christ.

1314
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,980
I respect those guys cause they were
in show business. I just wish maybe,

1315
01:18:19,981 --> 01:18:22,440
maybe they can't admit that they're
in show business. It's like wrestling.

1316
01:18:22,441 --> 01:18:24,660
For the longest time they
couldn't say that it was fake,

1317
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:28,620
but now you know at some point come on,
just say, look, we're doing fake news.

1318
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:32,130
We know, we know who's going to
win. In the end of this shit. Oh No,

1319
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,320
it's all horrible. All right, well,
how much time are we up to him?

1320
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,400
46 fucking minutes. For those of you
at home, I do 50 minutes every week.

1321
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:41,760
It's a free fucking podcast.
Admitted. You don't like your job.

1322
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,270
Maybe you don't like your wife.
Maybe you don't like yourself.

1323
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,810
You need a laugh on a Monday. I do this
for free. Out of the goodness of my heart.

1324
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:51,420
See that Brian?
I've been a hero every fucking Monday.

1325
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:56,650
Maybe that's what inspired me.
You know what?

1326
01:18:56,651 --> 01:19:00,410
It takes it away that you could tell
that I'm an I'm a piece of shit.

1327
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:03,680
Because if I was a true fucking heroin,
I wouldn't have told you that story.

1328
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,890
I wouldn't have brought it up on
the podcast. It's like a heathen.

1329
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,240
I'm praying in public right now.

1330
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:10,790
I should have just done some
heroic shit and walked away.

1331
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:14,360
That's when you're bad ass right?
Explosion. You don't even look at it.

1332
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:18,290
That's what I should've done and I didn't.
You know why?

1333
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:22,520
Because I'm a fucking coward and I'm
fucking blown away by the fact that I,

1334
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:26,660
you know, Bill, it was a check you as soon
as funny as she weighed like 70 pounds.

1335
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,980
That's the funny thing. But she was
crazy. That's, that's mental steroids.

1336
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:33,900
When you crazy, they can all of a sudden
pick you up. Do the airplane spin like

1337
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,620
sergeant slaughter. Did he do
that? He didn't do that. Did he?

1338
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:41,030
He had the fucking Cobra Clutch. All
right, let's wrap this podcast up with um,

1339
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,990
the overrated underrated segment and
this segment is people send in stuff that

1340
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:50,210
they feel is overrated or underrated.
They make a list.

1341
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,060
I comment on it and hopefully,
hopefully it's hilarious.

1342
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:57,590
I will tell you what his fucking
overrated is buying a God damn shoe rack.

1343
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,180
I, you like me or you to the point
where your feet have stopped growing.

1344
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:07,620
You don't throw out your fucking sneakers
and you got 58 of them and you got

1345
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:10,110
shoes and he got boots
and all that type of crap.

1346
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,280
I got all of that shit and they were
filling up my fucking closet and I'm like,

1347
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:16,020
all right, I got to get one
of those shoe racks. Okay,

1348
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,570
but I need one that can
hold a bunch of shoes.

1349
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:22,500
Don't look at the picture on the outside
of the box because they put fucking

1350
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:27,240
doll shoes on those goddamn racks and
it looks like you can easily fit three,

1351
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:30,990
four pairs of breasts and then you
come home one pair of timberlands and a

1352
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:33,360
fucking flip flop.
And that's a whole level.

1353
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,860
Then you can't take it back and
says whole fucking thing annoyed me.

1354
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,070
That's overrated.
Overrated is doing that.

1355
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:43,110
Just leave his sneakers on the
fucking floor. You know what?

1356
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,400
Why don't you go down to fucking, uh, I
was gonna say Grossman's go down to uh,

1357
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:51,330
the, the, the Home Depot and build
your own shoe rack for a fucking adult.

1358
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,460
I'm literally sweating in my
own apartment here. Might me,

1359
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,130
am I going to be sweaty on the podcast?
The Comey.

1360
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:01,380
Who is that cruises guy for those
people at home? Huh? Who is that guy?

1361
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:03,450
Remember that coach?
I don't remember his coach either,

1362
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:05,760
but he coached the team out in Vegas.
Some of the teeth.

1363
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:09,990
It was like an old Elmer Fudd like
if Elmer Fudd Fuck Don Zimmer.

1364
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,990
That's what he looked like. Jesus.
That was insulting. All right,

1365
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:16,500
here's one from somebody underrated.
Uh, Quincy, the show, Quincy,

1366
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:20,430
the Fonz and Sam Malone.
Get all the credit for getting the ladies.

1367
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,460
But Quincy got just as
much as any of them.

1368
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:27,900
It seemed like he had a different chicken
is on his houseboat. Every episode.

1369
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,210
He was basically a silent assassin.

1370
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:35,370
The best part of it is that he used
the word broad to refer to the ladies.

1371
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:39,030
Those were different times. They
really were. They really were.

1372
01:21:39,031 --> 01:21:42,540
Jack Klugman is Quincy. That was
like a, that was the end of an era.

1373
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:45,750
Remember that Brian, he ever hit me
like Yo, when we were growing up,

1374
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:51,020
they take the casting couch when guys
ran this fucking business and now look,

1375
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:55,320
you know what's funny is they thought if,
if they, if the ladies, if they ran it,

1376
01:21:55,860 --> 01:22:00,510
that there would be, it would be better,
but it isn't. It's just is unbalanced.

1377
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:01,560
The other fucking direction.

1378
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:06,030
Now you've got a bunch of pussies on TV
who are afraid of their wives. You know,

1379
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:07,740
Ralph Kramden used to
threatened every week.

1380
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,190
That's what I loved about
that show because they still
showed them being a moron,

1381
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:16,380
but he's still physically intimidator,
you know, like Larry Johnson,

1382
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:22,650
he had that power forward respect on
that show. That's all I'm looking for.

1383
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,100
Just show a guy in a relationship was
getting a little bit of fucking respect,

1384
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,500
you know? All right, I'm
going over my time here.

1385
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:32,160
The last thing we're going to talk
about his bad covers. I talk last week,

1386
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:37,290
uh, somebody, Mary j
Blige did a cover of a,

1387
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:42,330
a stairway to heaven and a whole
lot of love and it wasn't bad,

1388
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:45,660
but you know what I mean? I Dunno. It's
just one of those things where this some,

1389
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:49,260
some music, it's just
sacred. It's sacred to you.

1390
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:53,850
So no matter how talented somebody
is, uh, you're like, what the fuck?

1391
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:58,350
So I was talking to last really bad cover
that I heard that it just really just

1392
01:22:58,351 --> 01:23:00,270
annoyed the shit on me.
Well,

1393
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:04,260
actually I was in a gym and
somebody had remixed Ah, Shit.

1394
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:09,340
Did the remix of a sympathy for
the devil by the rolling stones.

1395
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,130
You know, and I'm gonna go out on a
limb. I think Mick Keith and the guy,

1396
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:15,160
I think they got it right the first
fucking time. These fucking assholes,

1397
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:19,570
first of all, first thing they do is
they edit out the guitar solo. Okay?

1398
01:23:19,571 --> 01:23:21,130
Take Keith Guitar Solo out.

1399
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,930
And then at one point literally
dropped out everything other than Mick,

1400
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,370
Mick Jagger's voice,

1401
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:31,120
and then had some new updated like,

1402
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:35,780
like a Casio drum beat
underneath it. It was just, ah,

1403
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,610
it's just a fucking worst Scott Damn
Song I've ever heard. Jesus Christ bill.

1404
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:43,690
How did I not make that funny? I really
bombed with that. Like I started off,

1405
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:46,540
it was decent. I got lost in the middle
of it, you know, I got freaked out.

1406
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,650
I was like, what if Mary j
actually buys this fucking DVD?

1407
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,350
I went to that arrogance space.
You know what it was.

1408
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:56,260
You know what happened there,
Brian? I cared. I cared,

1409
01:23:56,261 --> 01:24:00,870
and the whole fucking thing went away. All
right, let's see. Hit last bad cover. Um,

1410
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:03,910
this here's one from somebody,
and I know this, this, this, this.

1411
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:05,740
Actually the segment
is starting to blow up.

1412
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,570
I just didn't have time to
put everybody, so don't, uh,

1413
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,450
everybody's bad covers on there.

1414
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:14,440
I want to read these because you guys
really came up with some great ones this

1415
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:19,360
week. Um, here's when he says, all right,

1416
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:20,200
this,
the cover,

1417
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:25,230
the cover song that pissed me off the
most has to be slash in Fergie's slash in

1418
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:30,961
Fergie from the black ips featuring
that dude from Cypress Hill there they

1419
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:35,740
actually redid paradise city.
And uh,

1420
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,760
right there I was immediately
going, oh no, oh no.

1421
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:43,240
And he says all that energy and
swagger on the of the original,

1422
01:24:43,241 --> 01:24:47,380
everything that made that song a bonafide
classic is ruined in this version.

1423
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:52,860
Anyone that really holds up slash is a
god and trashes axel cannot honestly sit

1424
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:57,490
there and tell me that this song does
more to ruin guns and roses name than the

1425
01:24:57,491 --> 01:25:02,200
Chinese democracy. What a
horrible, infuriating idea.

1426
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:06,520
Please, please give this song. That's the
treatment it deserves on your podcast.

1427
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,931
I got to admit,

1428
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:12,931
I am a fucking huge is how big a fan of
I am of slash like I was right with them

1429
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:18,430
slash a snake pit. I saw velvet
revolver, anything he does,

1430
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,110
I will go fucking see.

1431
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:23,380
I remember I saw Joe Perry project and
he showed up and he played with the band.

1432
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:24,250
It was fucking awesome.

1433
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:28,840
I love slash but I got to tell you this
one that I'm not trashing slash year

1434
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:33,700
because even Dinero has made some bad
fucking movies. But uh, here it is.

1435
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:34,750
You guys want to hear a little,
I'll,

1436
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:38,140
I'll play just a little bit of this and
I'm actually not worry about slash thing

1437
01:25:38,141 --> 01:25:41,780
this cause we won't have the rights to
play this on the DVD. So here you go. Um,

1438
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:45,160
I think it's been a really
nice podcast this week. Um,

1439
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:46,300
and you should appreciate it.

1440
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,450
Especially a free podcast
from a hero such as myself.

1441
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:55,630
I just like saying it. It's so fucking
annoying. Hey, what do you do? Well,

1442
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:59,500
I'm a comedian and also I'm a hero.
I'm a fucking hero.

1443
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,753
Uh,

1444
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,650
as long as they're crazy women and
they weigh less than 70 pounds,

1445
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:09,860
I am right there to do my duty as,
as, as a, as a standup citizen.

1446
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:11,900
So here it is everybody.
Everybody have a great week.

1447
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:16,901
Thanks for listening to the podcast
and we're going to close out with the

1448
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,760
Paradise City 2.0, I'll play
a little bit of this shit. Uh,

1449
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,040
this is slash Fergie from the black eyed
peas and that guy from Cypress Hill,

1450
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:29,600
you know the, the fucking trio that
we've all been waiting for for years.

1451
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,820
They finally came together and
here's what it sounds like,

1452
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:42,410
dude. What the fuck are
ready? What the fuck already?

1453
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:47,460
[inaudible]

1454
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,480
right here. You going? Okay,
maybe they're going to save it.

1455
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:01,470
Maybe they're going to save it.

1456
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:14,400
Ah, AH, no. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1457
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:19,920
Oh my God, Dude. You ever get like
fucking embarrassed for somebody else?

1458
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:24,000
What the fuck? You know? Hey, I hate,

1459
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:27,870
I can't see why to rappers always have
to let you know who the fuck is in the

1460
01:27:27,871 --> 01:27:32,620
building. I can read the liner
notes. We'd go at slaves in the, Ha.

1461
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:34,200
I know he wrote it.

1462
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:41,020
The Duchess Fergie. Ah,
that, that, that is, yeah.

1463
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:44,440
That one didn't bug me as
much as led Zeppelin. I have
to admit like, cause when,

1464
01:27:44,441 --> 01:27:46,030
when guns and roses,
when they came out,

1465
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,440
I was like 1920 already realized I
could see myself becoming a loser.

1466
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,290
It's sent music that you love
when you had hope, you know,

1467
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,740
speaking of which is one for my,
my child.

1468
01:27:55,741 --> 01:27:59,230
Did I hope for a speedy recover for
our Bret Michaels man. Seriously, man,

1469
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:02,590
I know a lot of people, uh, may,
may or may not like fucking poison,

1470
01:28:02,591 --> 01:28:06,250
whatever you've got to hand to the guy
that he stuck around for 25 fucking years

1471
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,100
and dies in the hospital right
now. So I hope that guy, uh,

1472
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:14,770
comes out better than fucking
ever. And uh, that's it.
See, that's what a hero does.

1473
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:16,990
He brings it around to a
nice moment. That's the, uh,

1474
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:21,790
that's a podcast for this week. Please
tune in next week. Please keep all the,

1475
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:25,420
um, the questions, comments and all that
stuff coming. I really appreciate it.

1476
01:28:25,421 --> 01:28:27,610
Have a great week and a,
that's it. Take it easy.
