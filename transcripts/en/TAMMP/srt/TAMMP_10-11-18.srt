1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:09,250
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and ah,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,070
just check in.
Hey,

4
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:18,990
what's going on? How's your
week going? Is it going good?

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,220
That is good. You keeping your
head above the fucking water.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,070
Um, I'm having, it's a great way.
I'm having the best of times.

7
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm having the worst of times.
My fucking phone, my phone.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,650
I don't know what's going on with it.
Nothing on it says it needs to be updated,

9
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:41,100
but it keeps saying that it needs to be
updated and now it won't connect to my,

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,380
my wireless cell phone carrier.
Sometimes it does.

11
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,320
Sometimes it doesn't have. I'll look
at it. Oh, what is it doing now?

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,120
What is it doing now?
I can't tell if I fucking fixed it or not.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,040
You know what? These fucking assholes
at apple do these fucking assholes.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,810
Do you remember back in the day you could
opt out and not update your phone and

15
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:08,310
you could keep it forever. So
they're like, oh God forbid God.

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,770
God's a did one fucking nickel.

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,260
Those cheap fucking money grubbing
corporate cons. God for fucking bid.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,850
One fucking nickel rolls out the
window that they feel belongs,

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
rightfully belongs in their pocket.
So now where do they do now?

20
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,710
You can't opt out of the update.

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,330
Now you have to update the phone and it's
all designed to fill up your old phone,

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,600
right? So then you fucking
bring the fucking thing in

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,630
and then you've got to get
the one that like take,

24
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,340
takes a picture of your face or
whatever it does. And then now,

25
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,610
now we'll take your
old phone and two what?

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,240
Okay,

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,750
give it to the poor bastard
and Philippines that had
to fucking put the thing

28
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:53,150
together.
Here's your reward.

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,350
Okay?

30
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,470
For working in our fucking factory
for 20 fucking hours a day,

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,570
making these new iPhone 19 so we're
going to give you the old iPhone seven

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,540
way to go there, buddy. You know,
and then, and if you don't do that,

33
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,400
he just fucking throw the things out
and they end up in the fucking ocean.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,820
And like somehow these people
aren't the fucking problem.

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,990
These people are let, let's go to
the other fucking side of the world.

36
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:22,730
Blow $1 billion a fucking month fight
and 3,500 jerk offs on a fucking jungle

37
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,060
gym.

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,830
But these cunts who are polluting the
ocean have poisoned the fucking food

39
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,080
supply.
Turned it into God knows what.

40
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,110
You got nine year olds walking around
with fucking mustaches cause there's so

41
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,440
much fucking human growth hormone or
whatever the fuck they're putting in the

42
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:39,440
God damn shit,
right that they're not the problem.

43
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,350
Really.
That's all fucking isis has to do.

44
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:47,480
Just spend 300 grand on a
fucking chicken Parmesan plate.

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,263
Okay.

46
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,330
Help finance your fucking campaign.
Then they're in the clear.

47
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:55,300
That's all they need to do.
Sorry.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,590
That's how far I take it with a
fucking update on my phone. Hey Bill,

49
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,590
why don't you just give in man,
everybody's going to do it, man.

50
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,500
Go get the fucking phone with you.
You have your face recognition.

51
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,200
I've been playing like this.
Mental tennis,

52
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,480
I keep threatening to leave
apple like fuck these guys.

53
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:17,800
Cause my laptop's almost
full. My, uh, my cell phone.

54
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,970
I don't know what's going on with it.

55
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:23,730
It seems to be working when I'm
around my house. But it's hilarious,

56
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:26,070
right when I need the fucking thing,
it shuts off,

57
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:30,840
which makes me feel like the computer
can't in it is looking at my calendar. Oh,

58
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:34,910
he needs, he needs to do a radio tour.
You know the phones just like God,

59
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:36,450
I think we'll just shut down now.

60
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,550
Last night I had to call in the fucking
sports gambling podcast with Shawn Green

61
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,533
and Ryan.

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,810
Yeah.

63
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,990
All right. Which Selby be
playing on this show tonight?

64
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,171
Actually, no, I'm sorry.

65
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:54,720
I'll be playing it later on on
my podcast right before the,

66
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,810
the throwback episode would be playing
and after I'm done ranting about my

67
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,940
fucking phone,
um,

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,860
you know, I'm actually
considering leaving, but then,
you know, somebody said,

69
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:10,120
well apple actually pushed back against
the FBI, you know, on the privacy thing.

70
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,200
And it's just like, what?
Then they're also doing all
this fucking creepy shit. I,

71
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,500
you know, the worst fucking move I
ever made was getting a smartphone.

72
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,630
All right.
I should have stayed with the flip phone,

74
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,790
but now I got the smart
phone and you know,

75
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,580
it's like you're riding first class
and now you have to go back to coach.

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,370
But I'm really considering considering,
you know,

77
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,700
maybe I'll get like a second phone for
all these fucking radio tour things that

78
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,170
I have to do that I love doing.

79
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:39,560
Calling in all these great shows
that had helped me promote my shows.

80
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,580
Maybe I'll just do that because I'd never
heard of anybody talking about their

81
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,160
day of flip phone. Fucking crapping out.
Really. Does that make me a hipster?

82
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,600
If I get one of those?
Um, I dunno. You know,

83
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,250
God damn well it'd be
down the apple store.

84
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,450
Here's the iPhone 10 show
us your face. Oh, okay.

85
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm trusting you won't do
anything elicit with that.

86
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,760
Everything's above board even though
you're not concerned with polluting the

87
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:09,900
fucking environment. I mean, to be honest
with you, liked with these corporations,

88
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:12,780
like when, when, when does it
fucking stop these fucking bankers?

89
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:16,560
When does it fucking stop?
It's unreal and you can't say anything.

90
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,930
You fucking say anything.
They label you a socialist.

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,100
It's like I'm not the one polluting the
fucking oceans. I'm fine with this phone.

92
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,990
How much better does
the camera have to be?

93
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,030
Do going to be able to count the pores
on my fucking relatives faces. It's fine.

94
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,030
You did a bang up job.
How about this?

95
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,130
How about you all on the phone
and I'll fucking rented from you

96
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,880
Eric and much more forward.

97
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,530
Okay.

98
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,120
Everyday Marsh Baylor,
they better,

99
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,810
someone shows up to work.
They have the better phone.

100
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,360
It makes the others less than.
Um,

101
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,300
anyways, so that I got, I got rid of the
worst part of week, which is that shit.

102
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,330
And of course I have to

103
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,720
fly out early tomorrow morning to go
to Saginaw, Michigan, which by the way,

104
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,140
I just found out from some
of my relatives that uh,

105
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,870
my great grandparents had a house
out there like a hundred years ago.

106
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,160
So I have the address. No,
I won't be saying it. Yes,

107
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,350
I put it in my phone.
Yes.

108
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,940
Steve jobs from beyond the
grave is already fucking
in a fucking drone with his

109
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,400
spirit hovering over it so
it can capture me there.

110
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,910
Do some fucking face recognition about
the top of my head, whatever the,

111
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,340
whatever the fuck those creeps
are trying to do over there.

112
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,920
Like some of these people,

113
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,580
they literally have to put nets outside
their factory to prevent people from

114
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:43,750
leaping to their fucking deaths.
And for some reason they're not a problem.

115
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,480
Yeah.

116
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,800
It's not a fucking problem.
Look, the other fucking way.
I don't, I don't get it. Um,

117
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,333
okay.

118
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,980
Um, anyways, plowing ahead. So
I'll be in Saginaw, Michigan,

119
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,200
which I've never performed there,
so I'm very excited.

120
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,190
Okay.

121
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,023
MMM.

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,540
Okay.

123
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,390
To go there. Uh, my hour,

124
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,180
I got an hour and a half right now and
it is more than ready to be recorded.

125
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:08,730
So freckles got to figure it out when
he's going to do as next special cause.

126
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:11,290
Last night I did a private Gig,
um,

127
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,820
for this Jewish Kimmy odd and um,

128
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,500
bye. It's such a great time. I was
only supposed to do a half hour.

129
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:21,560
I felt like I was on stage for 20 minutes
and I looked down and I had done an

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,390
hour. And so then the psych, all this
is a, it's time. It's time to go.

131
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:31,040
But I had such a good time at
that fucking Gig, you know,

132
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,540
usually I don't like to perform in front
of like all like one group of people,

133
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,303
you know.

134
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay.

135
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,430
Cause everybody has the same perspective
and then it kind of closes down what

136
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:45,720
you can talk about. Um, but
this crowd last night was day,

137
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:49,080
what day were raw. They were,
they were amazing, you know,

138
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,670
as buddy of mine book the thing.

139
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,320
Okay.

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,250
And uh, we were backstage and he had
cigars and shit. It was just like my,

141
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,800
one of my favorite gigs of the year.
And um,

142
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,730
I gotta be honest with you,
like I've, I've really fucking,

143
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:06,450
I'm learning how not to get in
arguments with people, you know,

144
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:09,240
cause we were just talking about
all this shit and then he brings up,

145
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:12,770
what do you think about Israel?
I'm like, oh, I could suck, dude.

146
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,190
I'm not going to fucking
get into this with you.

147
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,920
What I think about it, I've been
waiting. What the, what do you want foot?

148
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,360
It's like everything, it starts
with a good idea. How it's executed.

149
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,370
Is that the best idea?
I don't, I don't know.

150
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,190
I think there's mistakes Beta both sides.

151
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,760
And then it's literally like trying to
talk to a sports fan where they can't see

152
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,350
anything that their team does rug.

153
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,950
So he started to get into it and
I was just like, you know what?

154
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,570
Fair enough. What do you think
about the red sox Astros?

155
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,900
Like I'm not going to get into this
fucking debate with you. You know?

156
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,213
Um,

157
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,723
okay.

158
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,080
And we avoided this huge fucking
debate on something that I have.

159
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,690
I'm not really well read on,
but the old me,

160
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:58,710
I would dove right in both fucking feet,
you know what I mean?

161
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,340
Comparing this country
with the native Americans,

162
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,520
I was prepared to do all of that,
none of which I'm well read on.

163
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,140
And I was just like,
you know what pill?

164
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Why don't you just shut the fuck up
and smoke your cigar? So I just said,

165
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,100
you know,
it's fair enough.

166
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Why am I going to get this guy all stirred
up speaking in third of a fact that I

167
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:22,260
overheard and a fucking airport and I
let it go. And it was great. You know,

168
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,240
he's another great part of my week.

169
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,270
The fucking Red Sox beat the New York
Yankees and another playoff series that's

170
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:34,970
two in a row. You know, we're on a hell
of a run. I think they beat us like, well,

171
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:38,420
I guess not the place, but you
know what I mean? They beat us up.

172
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:39,620
I think this is our century.

173
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,313
MMM.

174
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,800
All right, here's the deal. You know, but
you know me, I don't fucking rub it in.

175
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,410
All right.
I want to congratulate the Yankees on a,

176
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,180
on a hundred win season and the
direction that they are going in,

177
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,380
because those guys, they're going to
be a force and as much for Yankee fans,

178
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,200
as much as this one hurt,
um,

179
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,820
it's going to make like
those your team feeling,

180
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,480
that feeling of fucking losing, they're
not going to want to feel it again.

181
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,050
And I already thought that they
were, they were playing great. Um,

182
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,760
and I'm not going to sit there and act
like I'm a GM and I know what PC you need.

183
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,560
Uh, oh, now what to say. Now look at Lulu.

184
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,260
My fucking now my computer one fucking
start back up. All right, here we go. Um,

185
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,490
but uh,
it was just a great series and um,

186
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,840
you know,
I dunno,

187
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,930
it's just great for baseball when
those two teams come together and uh,

188
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,903
yeah.

189
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,140
Yeah. And I realized when I was watching
it that I don't hate the Yankees.

190
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,700
I mean it, how can you hate the greatest
fucking organization, 27 championships?

191
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,210
You can't get mad at that. You know
what? And I don't even hate their fans.

192
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,390
It's just that small segment
of fan that if they won,

193
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,523
you know,

194
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,720
the amount of shit that they would've
talked would have been just like, um,

195
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,570
like to just see like
in the eighth inning,

196
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,600
right when we loaded up the basis in the
clincher and that stud came out for the

197
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:17,140
Yankees and he just pitched him out
of the situation or whatever the,

198
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,280
or a lot of the situation put himself in.
I can't even remember.

199
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:20,330
It was a fucking blur.

200
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,920
And when he struck out that
dude with the bases loaded,

201
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,150
when he went to the Dugout,

202
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,720
those two fat fucks like
ringing up the last batter act.

203
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,320
Like those are the morons.
They're like, oh dope

204
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,883
Jay,

205
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,710
those fucking mouth breathing morons.

206
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,110
Those are the ones straight across the
board in sports that patriots have those

207
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,690
fans, red sox have, you know,
I'm not saying all of their fans,

208
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:53,470
they just have those fucking
people and they're the ones that,

209
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,610
um,
they're the ones that ruin it.

210
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,580
Okay.

211
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,600
You know,
like Dale,

212
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,560
those are the ones that like if I
actually sat across from him when they got

213
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,890
over the fact that I was a red sox
fan and I wanted to talk the rivalry,

214
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,420
I could never get past.

215
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,610
Yeah. Bogo, Babe Ruth though, Joe,

216
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,230
like those people, it's
just like, all right.

217
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,790
So that was the only time I felt
hate in that series. What is,

218
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,270
when I saw those fucking idiots, and
I gotta be honest with you, dude.

219
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,980
Uh, this is embarrassing to say,
but the level of mouth breather,

220
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,140
yeah.

221
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,580
When they painted the crowd in Yankee
Stadium and at Fenway Park is just

222
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:38,170
unparalleled.
It's in Philly too.

223
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,780
I don't know what it is.
You know what I mean?

224
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:41,850
Okay.

225
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,660
It goes down south. They've
got the southern bell yet
the fuck and go to old boy.

226
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,010
You go out and Midwest, you get those
people dress like Pete Carroll. You know,

227
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,800
just like how does a person
in their 20s dress like that?

228
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,810
Then you go out to the west coast,
they got their own vibe, you know?

229
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,140
Yeah.

230
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,550
And but like I'm telling the east coast
like I gotta I gotta be honest with you

231
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,710
like we do,
we have corner.

232
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,010
It's so weird cause you have some of
the smartest fucking people like Boston,

233
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,020
New York have a real similarity
there where both cities,

234
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,960
okay,

235
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,141
uh,

236
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:20,790
re really ride on the coattails of the
amount of smart people that move to the

237
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:25,270
city. You know, Boston
has, they have Harvard,

238
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,500
they got fucking Mit, they
got bu, Emerson College,

239
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,030
all these places where all these smart,

240
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:36,031
talented kids come into this
city juxtaposed to the locals

241
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,010
and New York.
You got all that bridge and tunnel,

242
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,830
all these fucking people
that move into Manhattan.

243
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:45,860
Okay.

244
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,800
You know, and really make it
what it is. And then he's dead,

245
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,580
dead. Duh. Oh,

246
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,040
these fucking morons sweatpants,
Hoodie,

247
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:05,041
fucking tad stake eat and fucking
mouth breathing mouth breathing fucking

248
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,570
morons.
Um,

249
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,930
I got a kick out of that and I am one
of those fucking morons by the way.

250
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:11,201
I'm not,

251
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm not trying to be a goddamn elitist
tier now that it moved out the fucking

252
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:19,200
phony ass Hollywood. I'm not looking
down my adorable little knows that yet.

253
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,280
No,
I am not.

254
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,100
Okay.

255
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,090
I was that guy.

256
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,480
I was a guy out the fucking outfield
who wanted to make his section laugh,

257
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:29,570
who was loud fucking drunk.
I did that. Plenty of games.

258
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,770
Okay.

259
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,120
It's gotta be some sort of security
footage out there of it. Um, anyways,

260
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,330
so sale comes in the eighth
inning and just, I mean,

261
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,100
okay,

262
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,260
for a red sox fan versus the Yankees,
I mean,

263
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:46,100
I don't think you ever get over fucking
2003 the seventh and eighth fucking

264
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:49,730
innings in and then it's just
like those innings, you know,

265
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,350
all the way back to Bucky
makes you fucking nervous and

266
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,180
he fucking just cruise right through
the eighth inning. I'm like, Oh my God,

267
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,590
we have a three run fucking lead.

268
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,410
And then I see Kimbro up and I'm
just like, don't put that guy in.

269
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,610
Yeah.

270
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,610
How about the fucking guy in the seventh
inning with the Bob Stanley Torso?

271
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,710
I don't know anybody's fucking
names anymore. I got a kid,

272
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,710
I don't have time to figure this
shit out. I was going like, oh,

273
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:17,260
this mother fucker, look at this.
How is he this out of shape?

274
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,650
Okay.

275
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,160
With all the, all the exercise videos
out there, all the fucking nutritionist.

276
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,950
I'll look at this guy.
Look at this guy.

277
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,940
He should have that fucking cop utility
belt on when he's out there pitching.

278
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,110
So anyways,
he does great fucking sales.

279
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:37,130
Shuts them down.

280
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,960
Then Kimbro comes out and what he
proceeds to load the fucking basis.

281
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:44,390
And I'm telling you,
I thought I was past it.

282
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,140
I kept telling him all I wanted to see
him do was when at once they've won it

283
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:52,040
three times coming down from three,
three Oh you know,

284
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,540
all three till till when
you know,

285
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,490
biggest comeback in baseball
history. I'm good. I,

286
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,290
I really thought that. I
believe that. And then I just,

287
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,330
the night that he came and I
could not stay in the room,

288
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,770
I want to apologize

289
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,180
to Kimbro for all the shit I
said about him in that antique.

290
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,871
Oh God.

291
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:23,310
I was out in the kitchen between pitches
and I would run and I poked my head in

292
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,730
another ball and then I would just
Tourette's walking out and my daughter was

293
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:29,070
asleep. So I'm like whispering,
she's just fucking pushed off.

294
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:33,240
Fucking strike your fucking cards.
Right? You fucking red bearded fucking,

295
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,570
what the fuck would Julie
fucking sale in there?

296
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,123
Yeah.

297
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,470
So anyways,
when that's they,

298
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,950
then it's 42 then it's fucking 40 the,

299
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,920
it's a fucking batter to make it 42 hits,
a batter with the bases loaded,

300
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,230
walks in a fucking run basically,
or whatever.

301
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:58,850
He hits a bad run in Dennis sac fly.
Now it's four to fucking three.

302
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,200
Those fat mouth breathers, I can see a
fucking freaking out the jelly bodies.

303
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,680
And then there's a slow dribbler
down to the third base line.

304
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,870
And I'm like, oh my God, this
is going to be an infield hit.

305
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,010
And then he calls the fucking dude
out and I did the most embarrassing

306
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:23,690
celebration dance.
And then they're like,

307
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:26,960
it's under review. And I'm like,
oh my God, it's this game tied.

308
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,230
Are they going to tell me that this
fucking game is tied? And then they,

309
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,220
of course they came back and said
that it wasn't, but Jesus Christ,

310
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,390
I can't believe how much I still care.
It's fucking ridiculous.

311
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:44,160
So then I texted a buddy of mine from
back in the day and I was just like,

312
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:48,060
did you ever think you'd see the red sox
drink champagne in the fucking Yankee

313
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:52,320
stadiums? You twice in your
life. This is unbelievable.

314
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,880
And then he wrote back to me,
it's dead, it's really dead.

315
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,550
All that fucking Bucky dent shit is dead.

316
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,400
And I laugh and I was like,
yeah,

317
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,970
but guys like you and me are
still going to have, you know,

318
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,220
post traumatic stress disorder from
all of those times where it wasn't.

319
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,110
And he was like laughing going, yeah. So
I think there's like this weird sort of,

320
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,313
um,

321
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,130
it's schism the word between
red sox fans right now.

322
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:27,810
There's the people that lived through it
and the people that don't know anything

323
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:31,380
but what's going on right now.
And I like being around those people.

324
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,050
The second ones,
the ones who are just thinking positive,

325
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,600
cause I actually found
myself saying positive shit.

326
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,280
He's going to strike this bomb out. Come
on now. Go ahead. Break their hearts.

327
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:42,300
They're all fucking cheering.

328
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,430
I remember when Yankee Stadium
used to get really loud,

329
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,640
I would get all fucking nervous going
out. God, they just gonna Willem in there.

330
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:52,620
What's fucking GED they're going
to do, you know? Um, so anyways,

331
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:53,760
I can't believe that we want it.

332
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,890
And I really thought that we
were going to lose that series.

333
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:00,480
And I also feel that if we fucking blue,
if we blew game four,

334
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:05,190
I didn't see us coming back when
a game five. Um, I just didn't.

335
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:08,640
So now we're under the fucking Houston
Astros who nobody is talking about for

336
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:13,380
whatever God damn reason went through
the Indians like a buzz saw and scary

337
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:16,200
Terry Francona.
Um,

338
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,100
I dunno, tell today and all of these
fucking guys, these guys are like,

339
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,080
these guys had dialed in.

340
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,080
So we will see how we do when
we need fucking price to,

341
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,550
uh,
to finally get a victory.

342
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,730
I know a lot of you guys do what's with
this we stuff, I hate people who say,

343
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:40,170
wait, well I'll tell you why I say we
because people go, if you say we won,

344
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,620
they're like, oh, you didn't win. But
if you fucking lose, it's like, yeah,

345
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:48,270
you guys suck. You know, you guys
fucking suck. You guys choked.

346
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,840
You guys fucking blew it. Right? But
then all of a sudden you win. If he say,

347
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,060
if you use the Pronoun we right,

348
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,480
can you still use that Pronoun by the way?

349
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,230
Or did somebody who wants to fucking had
the balls put on their knee and their

350
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:06,180
Dick on their ear?
Fucking we who's we?

351
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,130
Uh, me, my Dick and my balls. I'm sorry.

352
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,140
Anyways, plowing ahead. So like
I mentioned, I'm in Saginaw,

353
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:20,760
Michigan and this is all leading up
to uh,

354
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,180
my last big shows of the year.
November 7th,

355
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,100
I am going to be at Madison Square Garden.
I am going to be recording that night,

356
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,250
hopefully successfully this time to
put out a god damn album last time.

357
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,460
As you remember,

358
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
I had the set of my life and they didn't
understand what I was trying to do and

359
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,570
they only took the sound from the board.

360
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,630
So it was just me really
loud on my microphone.

361
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:48,010
Sounding ridiculously excited in front of

362
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,480
about eight people. Um,
so I'm going to try,

363
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,040
I'm going to try to fucking do that again.

364
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,610
And then after that I have three nights
at the unbelievable Chicago theater,

365
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,800
arguably the greatest marquis.

366
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,800
I think it's the greatest marquis
and a all this show business. Um,

367
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,850
and with that I would read
some advertising. There we
go. Um, oh look who's here.

368
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,900
I all me go. Oh, Amigo. Oh me.

369
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,290
Oh my go.
I'm never going to know how to say this.

370
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,480
A revolutionary toilet seat replacement.

371
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,980
Are you anal about
cleanliness in the bathroom?

372
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,710
What if I told you I could change
the way you poop? Jesus Christ.

373
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,470
Um,
have you ever really thought about poop?

374
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,590
That just sounds like a wet one coming
right out of your ass. You know,

375
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,850
it sounds like the noise it makes.

376
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,060
Have you ever really thought
about wiping with toilet paper?

377
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,380
Like really thought about it?
I'll give you a chance right now.

378
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,700
Motivate your audience. Talk about
your experience with all me. Go.

379
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:56,020
Oh my go. Ah, I haven't used it
yet. It sounds like the poor man's,

380
00:21:56,021 --> 00:22:00,310
but a choose one to two copy points
to rotate and your spot, all right,

381
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:05,050
washes you and all the right places.
You know, you take it a shit.

382
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,540
You can wipe your ass cheek all you want,

383
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,000
but that's not going to fix the problem.
Uh,

384
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,980
that cadets what they're
doing in Washington. Um,

385
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,480
that would be my campaign slogan.
I think it's time.

386
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:20,660
This country stop wiping their ass cheeks
and I got down to business with this

387
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,560
all. I liked this guy. He makes sense.

388
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,510
He talks like me adjust the
water temperature position,

389
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:32,650
pressure with movement. Feels
like you just took a shower.
I got to tell you some,

390
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,430
I've used a bad day before. It was fuck
made me laugh my ass off, no pun intended,

391
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,230
but I cannot even begin to tell you the
fresh feeling I fed afterwards, you know.

392
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,330
Anyways, it feels like you just took
a shower. It features a heated seat,

393
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,680
a nightlife, soft closing, air dry,

394
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,710
remote controlled deodorize
carbon filter eliminates odors.

395
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,820
Say Goodbye to toilet paper, save
trees, water and electricity.

396
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,230
US alone uses 36 million rolls
of toilet paper in one day.

397
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:07,780
It's quick and easy. I've come around
to these guys, you know what I mean?

398
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:11,470
Cause I know that that thing uses a
bunch of energy with the electricity.

399
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,970
And all of that type of shit.
But you know,

400
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:15,010
this is not a bunch of
paper going into the water.

401
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,660
Police says no separating that you
have to do down at the fucking Mil.

402
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,170
Whatever the hell they do anyways. Plus
you can install it and just 20 minutes.

403
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,283
Okay,

404
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,890
20 minutes. Well, if you just
have an analog toilet seat,

405
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:32,180
I mean you can put it in about fucking
two minutes, but we'll it wash your ass.

406
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,770
You know, you can't have your cake and eat
it. People, uh, do your business at Omi.

407
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:40,050
Go. Oh, Amigo. Oh my. Go, uh,

408
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,070
get $100 off on your order
when you go to m y o m I.

409
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,040
G. O d o t c o m. Slash
B u. R. R. That's Omi.

410
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,760
Go. Oh my go. Oh, am I a g o go
to all me, me, me, me, me, me.

411
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:59,930
Go. Dot Com slash Berg get a hundred
dollars off. The future's weird at first.

412
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,130
Let it be weird. Ooh, got a little
creepy there in the end. All right.

413
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,680
Legal Zoom, legal, zoom. Uh,

you know the saying time is money.
It's true.

415
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,490
Especially when you run your own business.

416
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,060
But running a successful business
involves taxes, contracts,

417
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:21,080
and a whole lot of fine print things
that eat up too much of your time. Well,

418
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:24,590
it's time to turn to legal zoom.

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,880
dude.
Um,

435
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,830
butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

436
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:36,860
organic chicken and heritage, bread, pork.

437
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,950
The greatest fucking meat I've
ever tasted in my life in my house.

438
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,400
I felt like a five star chef for those
of you don't know what heritage bread,

439
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:49,310
pork is that, that,
that is uh, that is, um,

440
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,370
pure bred pigs that they can trace
their bloodline back to Europe.

441
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,570
All right. This is, this
is like, I can't tell you.

442
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:00,200
I'm going to just kind
of compare it to fuck,

443
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:01,520
I can't do that because then
they're going to be like,

444
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:05,930
can you please not compare us to the clan?

445
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,990
Um,
yeah.

446
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,550
If you want to get racist with your pork
or it'd be a little nice if you want to

447
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,860
go Westminster with your pork.
That's I'm telling you, dude,

448
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,330
you fucking make to sear it on both sides.
Finish it in the oven in a skillet.

449
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,680
You bring it back out, a little rosemary
butter bath. Oh, if I get about it.

450
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,371
Unbelievable.

451
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:29,240
The incredible quality of butcher box
meat starts with the commitment to raising

452
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:33,650
animals humanely and free of antibiotics
and hormones before they kill them.

453
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,890
Each box comes with at least
nine to 11 pounds of meat,

454
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,130
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

455
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,470
Unless you're a gluttonous
fat fuck, you'll probably
blow through it in two days.

456
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,330
You can choose from five different box
types. All beef, beef and chicken. Ooh,

457
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,730
beef and pork mixed box.

458
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,380
We are the world custom box
lets you choose your own cuts.

459

462

Free of antibiotics,
free of hormones,

463
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,210
and humanely raised on an open
pasture before they murder them.

464
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,203
Okay.

465
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,510

You know what the one that when Peta
always shows those things about animals,

477
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,470
you don't want that really
fucking got me the other day,

478
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:58,870
I can't remember if I mentioned
this on the Monday morning podcast.

479
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,370
I was driving down to this
gig in Bridgeport and right
next to the place that I

480
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:04,204
was playing,

481
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,630
they had this sign would that showed a
cow and then it's calf and the calf was

482
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:12,850
like touching face with its with
its mother. You know what I mean?

483
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:17,530
Like this beautiful, you know,
mother kid fucking type of vibe.

484
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,150
And it said,

485
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,170
this is this caps first day
and last day with his mother.

486
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,530
Okay,

487
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,730
please stop drinking milk.
And I was like Jesus Christ.

488
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,430
You know, now I'm separating
families. You know,

489
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,290
I don't know. I don't know what's going
on with the fucking world right now, but I

490
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,090
good, uh, um, starting with
the end and the mirror.

491
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,000
MMM.

492
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,390
I'm asking him to change his freckles.

493
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,140
Those were the original lyrics. I actually
wrote that and I sent it to Michael.

494
00:28:56,141 --> 00:29:00,070
He's like, well, it seems a little
ginger specific. And I said, mark,

495
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,960
don't go southward around me

496
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,830
or I'll do something offensive to your
race if I could figure out what the fuck

497
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,664
it is.

498
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,340
Um,
yeah.

499
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,060
Okay.

500
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,570
I am, I'm working on
my temper. I am, I am,

501
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,140
I'm not going to get into arguments
about people with their fucking belief

502
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:23,260
system. I would like to fucking, you know,

503
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm not saying I'm going to
become vegetarian, but like,

504
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:30,400
I would like to really continue to promote
more companies that at least they're

505
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:34,360
saying that doing this, I hope
they're not fucking lion. And, uh,

506
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,420
I gotta be honest with you, man, I've
switched over to fucking almond milk.

507
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,650
But it's the thing about Omelets,
they take up so much goddamn water grow

508
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,350
and then, you know, there's
just too many fucking people.

509
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,040
Okay.

510
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,160
It always comes down to that.
How do we live on this planet?

511
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,420
We need to get the fucking
population Dowd right?

512
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,060
That's what we need to do.
Okay.

513
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,520
We need to stop fighting
about the goop in the ground.

514
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,360
We just stop fucking screaming and
yelling at each other. We got it.

515
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,360
It's like we have an a tug of war
when we should just fucking, I dunno,

516
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,760
you can't do it.
How do you get on the same page?

517
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:10,280
How do you get everybody to start
pulling in the same fucking direction?

518
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,770
Yeah.

519
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,950
Do you know like when they take a black
light and they go through like a fucking

520
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:18,440
hotel room to see where
all the fucking Jesus,

521
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,320
if they could come up with one of those
lights for sociopath's and I don't know

522
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,330
what you would do with those people.
I mean,

523
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,920
I think you gotta take 'em out and you
certainly can't stick them on an island

524
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:33,770
and have all of those fucking
lunatics there at the same time.

525
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,670
There's another great Scifi movie.

526
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,670
Somebody invents a Tj's
light for fucking sociopaths.

527
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,000
They weed them all out,
but this, but they're,

528
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,850
they're big flaw in their
system is their fucking liberal.

529
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,710
So they can't flip the switch
and electrocute him and
they stick them all on the

530
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:59,711
same island and then they just
create a master race of sociopaths.

531
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,030
And then there's this warlike psychotic
fucking people and then they get in

532
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,920
their God viking ships and they start
coming over to everybody else walking

533
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:14,440
around with their Beta energy
in their Birkenstocks stocks.

534
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,470
All right.

535
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,330
And of course there's
one good one over there.

536
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,610
I Dunno why some of this some sort of
fucking lefty gene. It's, it's Hollywood.

537
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,250
It's going to have to be the lefties
save and the fucking day, right? Um,

538
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,890
he gets over there and he warns him and
he has to teach all of these fucking

539
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:38,891
Bergen stocked fucking leftys how to
fight fire with fire and become warlike.

540
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,753
All right.

541
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,160
It's basically empire strikes
back meets police academy.

542
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,520
That's how I would pitch it.

543
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,380
All right.

544
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,830
With a sprinkle of the Dave Matthews band.

545
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,340
All right. That's your dumps.
Scifi movie of the week. Um,

546
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,650
all right. Now as a red
sox fan. I have one more.

547
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:11,950
I got to tip my cap one more time out.

548
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:15,410
Up on a percent respect for the
Yankees in their organization.

549
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:20,411
Do you realize that if the New York
Yankees do not win the world series next

550
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,340
year,

551
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,340
this will only be the second
decade since the 1920s that they,

552
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:32,210
that they didn't win a world series.
Do you want to stand? Let's, let's,

553
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,180
let's fucking look this up
here for a second. All right.

554
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:37,670
If you want to get jealous
as a fucking sports fan.

555
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,980
New York. Yeah. Keys. Don't you?

556
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:48,180
Was He fucking sang about New Jersey?
Frank? Just as a fuck you to New York.

557
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,430
That never thought he was good
enough until he was good enough.

558
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:55,350
Then they took him in and
sat around. Um, you know,

559
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:00,410
I wanna wake up and as city
that fucking rakes, right?

560
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,430
He's singing about Newark
and Phi Dom Bridge and tunnel

561
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,560
to noon. I will sleep. Sorry.
It had to rhyme. All right.

562
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:15,330
New York Yankee. Where the
fuck, let me hit pause.

563
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:18,380
So this doesn't take forever. All right.
Only had to put a pause for two seconds.

564
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,770
All right.
The 1920s all right.

565
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,540
1919 they get babe Ruth. Okay.
The 1920s they won three titles.

566
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:32,541

three four five 1930 to 1936
93719381939 including four in a row.

569
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,050
They want to half the fucking
world series in that decade.

570
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,050
1940s they won one,
two,

571
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:55,500

They had an off decade.

572
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,530
They only won four 1940 94319471949 and
then here come the 1950s where they won

573
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:08,180
one, two, three four, five,

574
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,620
six including five in a row.

575
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:15,621
If you count 1949 cause they already won
1949 then they won 95019511950 to 1953

576
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,200
then they won 1956 and 1958 by the way,

577
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:27,460
honorable mention to the Cleveland
Indians when they won in 1946 I believe,

578
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,580
or was it 48 I can't remember.
48 I think. All right.

579
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,750
Then the 1960s they want to 1961 1962
then the 70s they want to 1977 1978 now

580
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:45,100
granted now this is like fucking,
you know,

581
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,710
25 30 teams in the league and they're
still winning the eighties they don't win

582
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:51,544
any.

583
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,600
I'm certainly one twenties thirties
forties fifties sixties 76 fucking decades

584
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:57,994
in a row.

585
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,390
2000 they come right back and they went
390690890 nine to 2000 they when they

586
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:10,390
won in 2000 2009 they want to,
how do you count the decades by the way?

587
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,710
You count it from sometimes.
Is it 81 to 90 I don't know. I,

588
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,190
when the odometer flips, that's
how I count it. All right?

589
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,480
So they have yet to win one this decade.
So they've basically,

590
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:27,481
one of the last nine decades
they won a championship,

591
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,210
like a drought for them is
not winning in a decade.

592
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,540
It's fucking ridiculous.
It really is ridiculous.

593
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,650
And they have more titles than the
Celtics. More titles, the Lakers,

594
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,250
more titles than the fucking,

595
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,780
okay.

596
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,130
Montreal Canadians.

597
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,900
More titles than the fucking Green Bay
packers with all of their Superbowls in

598
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:50,600
all of their fucking super bowl titles
and the Pittsburgh Steelers Superbowls

599
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,020
thrown in. So there you go. And,

600
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:56,650
and I think that they're going to win
one here in the next couple of years,

601
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,080
the direction that they're going. So, uh,

602
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm very happy that we were able
to beat them. And like I said,

603
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:05,290
I don't fucking rub it in and got nothing
but respect from, that's the podcast.

604
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,310
Be sure to listen now to do my,
my fucking picks,

605
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,990
my NFL picks for the week.

606
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,300
Okay.

607
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,050
Which, uh, you know, I barely, you know,
I don't have time to pay it to. I should,

608
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,870
I really should start playing fantasy
football so I know who some of the fucking

609
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:20,940
people are in the league.
Um,

610
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,900
so I'm on the show in green and Ryan
Cramer's show the sports gambling podcast.

611
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,910
Um, and that's it. Other than that,

612
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:33,050
after that we'll have a little bit of
music and then a throwback from a podcast

613
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,040
from a Thursday gone by earlier this
year or God knows when. All right.

614
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,600
Dad said go red sox. Uh, Eh, uh,

615
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,670
go pats and all of this stupid
mouth breathing shit that I watch.

616
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,833
Okay.

617
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,113
We,

618
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,863
wow.

619
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,220
We
got to be one

620
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,140
that
bill

621
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,440
we're on. The sports gaming podcast
is brought to you by my book.

622
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:56,830
He died a g my book.
He is the leader in online sports books.

623

us on the line bill burr. Bill.

625
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,880
Your red socks just defeated the
Yankees in the alds three to one. How,

626
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,750
how excited are you for them to move on?

627
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,690
I can't believe how much I still care.

628
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,410
I was trying to lie to him cause
I didn't, I don't feel, you know,

629
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,640
the rent price was touching.

630
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:25,840
I was like you need a one tune and all
the great teams like the Yankees out and

631
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,370
I was just,
you know,

632
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:31,360
all I wanted to see him was when at
once the movie was over roll credits.

633
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:33,640
I mean what are they going
to do a chance in 2013 at me?

634
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,040
I said all of that stuff.
I couldn't believe

635
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,820
how much you know what it is.

636
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,200
It's not the Iq score
and it's not the work.

637
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,850
It's their fans.
It's what really it is

638
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,170
not even all of their fans.

639
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,820
It's those mouth breathers and
morons that those whack-a-mole fans,

640
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,670
you know the guys who like got down when
they lose and then pop their head up

641
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:57,470
when they,
when I literally have a friend,

642
00:38:57,471 --> 00:38:59,870
I'm not going to sign up front and
got a coworker, another comedian.

643
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I didn't hear from that guy since gained
three to 2014 and 2004 I didn't hear

644
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:09,710
from him again until the red sox blew
that meet with Bobby Valentine and

645
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:14,711
September in 2012 like nine years later
he popped his head up to start talking

646
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:18,110
trash. The next year we won the world
series. I haven't heard from him again.

647
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,170
I guarantee you if the Yankees won this
thing that I would have heard from.

648
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,330
That's the only time I hear from this
guy is when the Yankees beat the red sox.

649
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,020
Well yeah,
why not?

650
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,980
I mean I do agree there was a great shot
during the game last night where they

651
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:34,680
had this trio of like just
straight from the Bronx,

652
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:38,220
like slightly struck that guy out.

653
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,150
They honestly they make me,
I mean as a Yang,

654
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:45,780
I grew up in New Jersey as a Yankee Fan.
It did make me kind of question like,

655
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:48,780
man, I'm associating with these
neanderthals. Like there is,

656
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:53,550
there is a certain element
of the, the annoyance of the,
the the casual bandwagon.

657
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:54,384
Yankee.

658
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,560
One thing we have in common though,
red sox and Yankees,

659
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:03,600
the level of mouth breathing. I mean when
they, when they cut to the crowd, dude,

660
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,440
but they're was just hanging open.
It's like wholesome looking or whatever.

661
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,700
The west coast has their own vibe.
Florida in the south,

662
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:17,810
you're lucky if they even show up. Right?
But like you get to the east coast,

663
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,800
Philly, New York, Boston, and we are,
we're animals. And it's literally,

664
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,790
you can't even deny it.
We're just animal.

665
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,090
Oh.

666
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:30,050
And then as someone who's lived now
in California for about 15 years,

667
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,990
you really start to notice it.
The longer you're away from it,

668
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,990
it stops being normal. And you go back
home and you're like, oh my God, this is,

669
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,820
having said that you can get stabbed
to death at a game on the west coast.

670
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,340
Yeah. That's all. They skipped the
whole dump and the beer over your head.

671
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,350
They just don't write to
a, you know, a homicide.

672
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,830
Yeah, that's, that's the
thing. As an eagles fan, we
always get so much shit. Oh,

673
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:53,990
you guys are the worst fans.
You guys are mean.

674
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:56,780
You guys booed Santa Claus
in through Sovos. Meanwhile,

675
00:40:56,781 --> 00:41:01,781
Dodgers fans are putting guys in comas
and stabbing people died over over,

676
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:08,000
over a Dodgers game. A game that you
know, barely the city cares about.

677
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:11,330
Weapon of choice for Philadelphia
is the d cell battery and that's,

678
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,250
that's honorable. Not a, not a knife.
What's wrong? Medium. Medium security.

679
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,490
If you go to jail,
yeah.

680
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,240
Yeah.
We don't stop to know.

681
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,040
They had the jail at Eagle Eagle
stadium if they had one out here today,

682
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,940
but we'd have to be, you have
to be a prison. It was the
crime that was committed.

683
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:30,520
It wouldn't be like some,
some silly drunk and behavior.

684
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,030
Yeah. You're not getting a couple of
days. You're going for a good long time

685
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,350
and the then the Chris Dodger stadium,
you can't even tailgate.

686
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:43,640
They won't let you drink
beer in our, sorry, if you
could move on to the stadium.

687
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:44,331
Thank you.
Yeah.

688
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,330
The one time I had a couple beers in
the parking lot was playing some wiffle

689
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:47,601
ball,

690
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:51,530
assuming that's kind of what you do
before a baseball game and a guy in a golf

691
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,270
cart came up. Took my id and said I
was on the list. So I dunno what list,

692
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,400
what list I'm on it. You
know what? I should have a,

693
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,510
I should have just said, who the fuck are
you? Why would I give it? Listen, I was,

694
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,523
I was confronted

695
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,240
cop cars. Him, Doris. Yeah.

696
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,813
I don't know how

697
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,210
to work and get your degree there buddy.

698
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,200
Yeah, I don't know. How would
he will determine? Yeah,

699
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,940
it's unclear how we would detain me.

700
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,630
Put me back where the golf clubs are
supposed to be. I mean, in very unclear.

701
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,113
Oh yeah,

702
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:35,000
yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno. So that's
exciting. Brass tacks here.

703
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,890
Let's talk. Let's talk about
the national football league.

704
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,840
Of course that bill's going
to be making some pics.

705
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,740
He's on the line courtesy of my book.
He died aga,

706
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:45,870
the official online sports book
of the sports game, like podcasts,

707
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,070
a hundred percent deposit bonus
using the Promo Code bill bets.

708
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,620
First game, uh, that we
got here to select is a,

709
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,030
the eagles minus three
heading into giant stadium.

710
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,990
Nfcs doesn't look great. Eagles
and give mouth breathers. Yeah,

711
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,110
there's gonna be a lot of mouth
breathing going on. All the eagles,

712
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:08,910
two and three giants, one and for the
NFC east, not looking great bill. Uh,

713
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:10,200
which way you lean in this game?

714
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,850
I would take the giants with the points.

715
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,240
Oh, okay. I get in three. Yup.
They're a, they're the home three

716
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,110
and I'm going to, I just, you know, those
division rivalry games that they lost,

717
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:25,780
the giants lost a heartbreaker last
year. I mean, they, they should,

718
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,540
they should be to win orders. What
does it really want? I'm forced to.

719
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,450
They should be a, it was
at two and three. Yeah.

720
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:35,110
They're not as bad as their
record. And uh, I dunno, I think,

721
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:38,610
I don't know much about the egos by
imagine. After they won a Superbowl,

722
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,740
a bunch of guys in that team went out
and got that free agency money and some

723
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:42,461
coaches left.

724
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:45,820
So there's always a bit of a hangover
trying to figure out who you are after

725
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:49,330
that. Speaking is a patriots fan
considerably once so many of the century,

726
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:49,990
you know,

727
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,790
just stick with this for the party.
I mean,

728
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,610
it's not a good sign when there's
multiple book tour going for.

729
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,120
And like I read a backup
quarterback's book in the off season,

730
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:04,390
so that's maybe the, maybe the TMG did
a little ahead of themselves there.

731
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:06,050
Yeah, they're still celebrating. Yeah,

732
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,510
they're probably hanging out with the
Vatican there. Paul said that God,

733
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,220
can you believe we want
to do a beer bones?

734
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,010
I would shake uh,
Eli and the points at home.

735
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,960
Alright Kramer, I'm guessing you're
willing. You're going giants men.

736
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,520
I mean it's the same thing we've told
the defense doesn't play as well on the

737
00:44:24,521 --> 00:44:27,790
road. And Carson Wentz,
just like the doctor said,

738
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,400
he's not all the way back and the
offense is struggling. There's no magic.

739
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,170
The head coach is not,

740
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:38,670
he's that he's not having those magical
fourth down Philly Philly calls and yeah,

741
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
like bill said,
giants not as bad.

742
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:44,070
They got hosed by the rafts
and an awesome cake last week.

743
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,630
So of course I'm on the giants.

744
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,710
Home team is hit home team is called
covered every home Thursday night game.

745
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:52,380
So that, that's true.
But here's what I'll say.

746
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:57,410
Eagles 16 and four in the last 20
they have eli Manning's number also.

747
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,440
You, Brian, your giants. What are they
horrible at covering the tie down.

748
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,150
Exactly. But Zachary [inaudible], he's uh,

749
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,870
you know he's those star right
now on offense your nation, Bro.

750
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:13,680
You're reaching, no, I, I think they go
in. This is a must win for the eagles.

751
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,560
I just don't think this
giants offensive line,

752
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,650
we'll be able to keep the Eagles'
defensive line, which has been struggling.

753
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,240
Such thing as a must win for the ego.
So just one.

754
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,040
Oh, right. I know. That's the problem.

755
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:29,500
They got a free pass for the rest of
my life, but I I wear or the dog mass.

756
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,460
They're gone. They're not the dog
anymore. They're the targeted,

757
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,730
they are the road favorite

758
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,600
sending champs and they got their
feet up. Take the points. Okay.

759
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,510
Nah, I'm saying I'm saying eagles minus
three road victory. No sweat here.

760
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,320
All right, here's the, here's
an interesting one. Played
Out in Wembley Stadium,

761
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,720
the Seahawks minus three,

762
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,620
I guess technically a home game
for the Raiders. They're fine.

763
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,130
They're playing some real
football out in London. Bill. Uh,

764
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,360
which way you lean in on this game.

765
00:45:59,150 --> 00:45:59,880
Okay.

766
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,260
Well I love John Gruden but I still
don't think he's gotten his team where it

767
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,390
needs to be. And, uh,

768
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,380
Pete Carroll is a beast and I just,
you know,

769
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:13,650
I don't even think we were playing over
in Europe last time. Gruden coached.

770
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,240
He's got the oldest team in the NFL. They
going to be all cranky from the flight.

771
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,070
I Dunno. I'm thinking what's
this? See what I'm given.

772
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
Seahawks are only lane three

773
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,690
only. They don't, like
you just said, only that

774
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,250
I'm already, I'm already
tipping my hand, I guess.

775
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,510
I think, uh, yeah,

776
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:36,060
I think they're going to have problems
contained in their quarterback.

777
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,000
Gregor's lap problems containing
their ra, the quarterback. It's a,

778
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,500
I'm going to go to Seattle.

779
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,400
I mean, I just want, I want to see the,

780
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,460
I just want to see the
documentary on Gruden in London.

781
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,380
That's all John Gruden said.
Quote,

782
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:53,390
he's not a good flyer and gets anxious
on long plane rides. Interesting fact.

783
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:56,810
The Raiders, uh, they're not
flying out to London until Friday,

784
00:46:56,811 --> 00:47:01,490
which I always feel is a bad sign.
Carol, he got on the plane, uh,

785
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,790
you know, a couple of days early. So the
Seahawks are already out in London. I,

786
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:05,943
I think that's good.

787
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,110
Donny walked around. Buckingham
Palace gone. Whew. Anytime.

788
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:12,810
Anything good happen. Yes. The ric flair.

789
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,270
He is kind of scary when a,

790
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,470
when a old guy choose that much
gum and has that much energy, it's,

791
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:20,500
it's a little unsettling.

792
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,560
Okay. What's on real? He's the oldest
coach in the NFL. He looks great.

793
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,830
He looks great though.
He's like the Dick Clark or coaches.

794
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:32,020
Yeah, he's on my, he's kind of me of Jack
Lalaine. Just like an old guy. Gray hair.

795
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:35,070
Super jacked. Tons of energy.
He must be juicing. Yeah.

796
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,590
Juice in the positive way.
Teaching counts. Yeah.

797
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:43,420
Classic Classic Seattle Guy. I listen,
I know you don't want to say, uh,

798
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,550
the Seahawks, that was kind of their
Superbowl ad home against the rams.

799
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:51,020
They lost that game. That
was a tough loss. Maybe they,

800
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,710
maybe they don't get up for this game,
but I,

801
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:55,320
I just don't think this
Raiders team is right.

802
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,770
Gruden I think is having trouble
adjusting to the modern game.

803
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:01,140
He hasn't been able to fix car.

804
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,860
I just don't see the raider showing up
showing up. When's the last time you flew?

805
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:09,000
Like a nine hour flight and then you
play a game. It's 18 hours later,

806
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:10,140
but that doesn't seem right.

807
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,860
I usually have to sleep for a
solid eight to 10 hours. Seahawks.

808
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,840
My up thing is that they're,
they're avoiding London.

809
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,760
That's a good thing that could play
to their advantage. Yeah. Any of them.

810
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:26,320
I'll listen and go there and get
the Indian food. Avoid the actual,

811
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,270
yeah, avoid the food. They actually make

812
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,760
Jon Gruden with a giant
plate of bangers and mash.

813
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,180
Tired to Macedonia English breakfast.
Other than just give a couple of fried ups

814
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,380
blood pudding. Oh yeah.
Super gross sounds. It sounds
delicious. Yeah. I just, I,

815
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,810
I think there's plenty of science and
I'm sure grins not up on the science.

816
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,960
There's plenty of science on
why you want to get there early.

817
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,800
So just knowing that I love the Seahawks.
Yeah.

818
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,320
Good spot for the Seahawks.
Good matchup.

819
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,740
Final game of the three
we're picking with bill here,

820
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:05,070
the Kansas City chiefs head into New
England for Sunday night football.

821
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:08,730
Right now the pats
coming off the long rest,

822
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,410
three and a half points home favorites
against the Kansas City chiefs. Yeah.

823
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:16,060
If favor.
You know what?

824
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:21,061
This is such a weird game because the
Jaguars manhandled the Patriots and then

825
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:29,071
Kansas City played the jags like a month
later and Blake Bortles look like he

826
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,510
shouldn't even be in the NFL.

827
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,930
So it's one of those things was like when
the Patriots played the Jag was what,

828
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,360
where the Patriots not as bad
as they seemed. And the Jaguars.

829
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:42,130
Warren is good or is
Kansas City that good?

830
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:43,443
MMM.

831
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:48,290
Oh, three points at home. This is the
thing when I'm going to take the Patriots,

832
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,530
which this makes me nervous.
Yeah. I wouldn't have a
tease this game either. Um,

833
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,420
the only thing that, the only, the
thing that's tipping it is that, uh,

834
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,960
Kansas City has the worst defense.
And I,

835
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:07,190
I'm not buying last week, even though
they look solid, I'm just not buy out.

836
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:10,770
I don't know cause I don't think, God,
I don't think our defense is good.

837
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:15,530
And I was kind of making fun of how much,
you know the attach Oklahoma.

838
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:20,040
I mean the way the hyper and disco
and Grady has rings show time.

839
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:20,874
My homes.

840
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,970
I hope you realize what you just saw
it. I saw Brett five do that. 1,000.

841
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,400
Everybody relax. I think it's
cause Brady's going to leave soon.

842
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:34,080
Droop reason it's going to leave
soon and they, they, they, they're,

843
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,940
they need somebody to, uh, to step it up.

844
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:41,120
And I think that guy
will step it up. Um, uh,

845
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,180
and they also shellacked us a year ago,

846
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,730
but are there enough guys left
on the team that care? Um,

847
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,080
ready cares and he's got Adelman back
and he stepped to the guy looks to have a

848
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:58,670
few from Cleveland.
Yeah.

849
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:01,350
Good Lord. What are you, you know what?
I'm going to go with the Patriot. I can't,

850
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,820
I can't pick my just like people listen,
don't take that as advice.

851
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:05,654
That's my art talk.

852
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,610
This is a really great time to
sell the chief stock and Sean you,

853
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,680
we like to look at what the public's up
to 68% of the tickets on the chiefs and

854
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:18,120
yet this line has gone from three to
three and a half. What does that tell you?

855
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,830
[inaudible] is on the Patriots.
The Hook is there to scare you.

856
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,890
Lay the hook. Come on. This is,
this is the classic like hey,

857
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,190
any read beat the shit out of bill
Bellacheck week one last year.

858
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:32,270
You think Bella check doesn't
remember that. Yeah, I just don't see

859
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,900
there's a monster in September.
The last guy you want to run into

860
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,370
January.
He's a little tired.

861
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,790
He's kind of a monster year round.
Big Fella.

862
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,641
Oh Man.

863
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:52,641
I always crack up the Koolaid Gif of
him running through the wall or the punt

864
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:56,280
pass and kick that. They always show
of him going up against other eight,

865
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,310
nine year olds when he was eight, nine
and he was still like twice their size.

866
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,400
Listen, Andy Reid, great. Oh yeah.

867
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,080
I'll have to send you the video.
It's,

868
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,530
it's an all time classic [inaudible]
he's literally two and a half times the

869
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:14,090
size of all the other kids.
He's,

870
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,070
he's a good coach, but the pads,
they have that extra rest. Uh,

871
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,390
and I think they kind of figured
out their offense and the chiefs,

872
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,980
the defensive backfield is not right.

873
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:29,030
Like the Jag's office on the
road is way different than, uh,

874
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,840
than the pats at home. So,
uh, I think the patriots,

875
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:34,610
they covered the three and a half.
Yeah.

876
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,360
I think. How would you play a different
difference when you're on the road?

877
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,730
They're worried about some
guy dressed up like Boba Fett.

878
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:54,180
Oh my God. The face paint threw me off.
I think really what it is is uh, they,

879
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,460
they talk so much about how the snap
count makes a huge difference where the

880
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:00,740
offense that they're going up
against when they're at home,

881
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,950
they have to go on silent
count a lot and it's,

882
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,010
it's much easier to get a better jump on
the ball when you're on the road. The,

883
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,890
the crowd noise is against you and a,
I think it makes,

884
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,890
and not to mention it's those late
nights cause you're on the road,

885
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:16,880
which means you're probably dabbling in
some side action. Lawrence Taylor style,

886
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:18,500
the prostitutes coming to the hotel.

887
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,900
I don't know if you can do that
now with cell phone cameras.

888
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,120
Oh that's true. That's
true. It's a real, it's a,

889
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:28,170
it's a simpler back when lt could just,
every team has a ray Donovan.

890
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,610
I'm sure of that.
It does seem like there's,

891
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,260
there's probably some still a shenanigans
going on. Kramer close things out here.

892
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:40,380
Are you on the paths as well? Yeah,
no, I'm definitely, I think, you know,

893
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,101
I like to play,

894
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:44,270
I play against the market and I think
everyone sees the chiefs and like bill was

895
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,040
saying like Pat Ma homes can do no wrong.
Uh,

896
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:51,210
he's the greatest thing
since exactly the left kit,

897
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,160
the reaction to the
lefthanded throw was like, Yo,

898
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,210
I manning has three of
those in his career.

899
00:53:56,211 --> 00:53:57,860
Like that's not a sign of a great actress.

900
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,450
He's already a legend.

901
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,570
So, and now their comparison
comparing him to Steph curry and it's,

902
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,510
it's a little bit like no
one's willing to say it,

903
00:54:10,511 --> 00:54:13,400
but like are we just saying this
because he's light skinned all,

904
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,250
I mean it was a light skinned black
guy with curly hair and all of a sudden

905
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:19,310
they're the same play and nothing.
Nothing like Steph curry at all.

906
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:21,900
Like how was slinging 80
mile an hour fastball?

907
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,230
Football's anything shooting a three
pointer. Nothing. I, anyway, good. Sorry.

908
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,260
Good time to sell on the paths or sorry,
selling the tools.

909
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:30,760
The chiefs I'm buying in the past.

910
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,390
You could have gotten the pats to win
that division a week or two ago for like

911
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:38,700
minus 300. It's now minus 900
Sean. Oh Man. See send money.

912
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,230
Easy money every year. Oh, he's
just passing up on the paths.

913
00:54:42,231 --> 00:54:45,760
The when the division just, it's better
than any sort of stack you can invest in.

914
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,830
All right bill, before we
let you go, throw out a, uh,

915
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,780
throw it a lock for a week.
Six here in the NFL.

916
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,800
God, I didn't have a chance to
look at it so I got to go outside.

917
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,060
I don't know any, any other sort
of a lead pipe predictions that you

918
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:08,480
for this weekend patriots beat Kansas
City will then be odds on favorite to win

919
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:13,220
the Superbowl we lose to Kansas City.
They'll start asking,

920
00:55:13,221 --> 00:55:16,580
is this Brady's last year?
That's my lock.

921
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,540
Lock it up. I like it. Has
he fallen off the cliff?

922
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,160
Wouldn't be the first time
the chiefs chief's defeat
of the Patriots turned into,

923
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:26,420
is this the end for Brady's is the end.
It's got to end sometime.

924
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,070
Could this be the year? And he's
doing, he's got that trainer.

925
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:31,190
He'll be good for awhile.
Heminger Eric it

926
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,770
spongy muscle or have
you heard about that?

927
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:37,010
It's not all hard and all tight
and everything. It's like,

928
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,060
you know when you're
going to do the dishes,

929
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:42,120
you know that little sponge malleable.

930
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,660
That's Tom Brady's and go watch this dude.

931
00:55:44,661 --> 00:55:48,630
Run the 40 at the combine and tell me he's
not a better athlete at 41. Like what,

932
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:53,070
what something's going on. Come
on, something's going on. He's,

933
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,900
he's getting younger as time goes
on. But uh, yeah, have clearly the

934
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,280
Colby thing, he probably got his
blood spawn some stem cells in there,

935
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:05,760
a couple of embryos.
He uses that as a pillow or something.

936
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,800
I don't know what he's doing.
He looks amazing.

937
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,000
Sure does. All right, well, uh, Bill,

947
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,130
it's going on. It's Belper and it's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

948
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,350
October 11th, 2010. How the hell
are you? Are you doing good?

949
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,380
Well that's good.
Um,

950
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:26,590
I had all this shit that I wanted to talk
about and then I was looking at these

951
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:31,570
fucking emails and right off the
Bat I got one from Lo and behold,

952
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,400
douche bag or the fucking week.

953
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,300
Guy's name is Brad courses.
Fucking names Brad.

954
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,610
You know what else?
What?

955
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,740
What a what a mother and
father name a Douche bag baby.

956
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:49,010
Other than Brad. Yeah.
This is from Brad. Bill.

957
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:52,190
I was hoping that I could
find your podcast on Itunes,

958
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:56,510
yet another week passes by where your
fans can not listen to your show.

959
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,090
No problem with that. Right
to that. Then he goes,

960
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,510
you might want to make that
a priority sometime too.

961
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,020
I could just fucking see his bare
feet and his fucking penny loafers.

962
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:12,160
What are you leaning on my
cubicle? You fucking cunt. Really?

963
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:14,220
Do I really want to make that a priority?
You dumb.

964
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,750
Fuck you don't think I'm not
trying to contact iTunes.

965
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,310
They don't have a fucking
person who answers their phones.

966
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,360
They ignore my God damn emails. What am
I supposed to do? Go down to main street,

967
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,180
right down on main street
to the fucking mom and pop.

968
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:31,800
Fucking Mr Mrs Itunes store.
It doesn't exist. You do? Okay.

969
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,810
You might want to make that
a priority s fucking soon.

970
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,960
I want to slap you right
and your privilege.

971
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,270
Fucking Connecticut white face.

972
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,120
And I don't give a fuck if you're not
white and even not from Connecticut,

973
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:48,120
cause you should be with that fucking
tone. What a cunt con to the week.

974
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,590
Brad, go fuck yourself. All right.

975
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:55,100
I'm trying to get distinct back up on
iTunes. They're not responding to me.

976
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:58,290
What am I supposed to do?
They don't have a location.

977
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,110
This is the exact shit I've been
fucking trying to tell you guys about.

978
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:06,310
It starts with those God damn automated
machines down at the fucking grocery

979
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:08,920
store.
You siding with the fucking robots.

980
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:17,340
Some of that made sense. You know it
did. Seriously, this is the future.

981
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,840
This is what a store is going to be.

982
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,340
You're not going to be able to
get in contact with anybody.

983
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,670
You're going to have a problem and
you can basically go fuck yourself.

984
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,470
And then some other fucking nerd whose
only job is going to be fucking grease

985
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:33,020
the elbow with a fucking robot that took
his job is going to send me an email.

986
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:34,910
Tell me that I need to
make something a priority.

987
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,430
Why don't you go fuck yourself buddy.
Why don't you,

988
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:39,950
why don't you make that a priority?
Sometimes soon. All right.

989
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,990
What about FAU?
I swear to God you are.

990
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:48,680
You might want to make that
a priority sometime soon. Oh,

991
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:52,940
the fucking stuffed shirt.
Fucking hang you by your God damn tie.

992
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,870
Brad. You fucking cunt. Go Fuck Yourself.

993
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,710
I'm glad you told all your friends to
listen to it and now they can't. Huh?

994
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,020
What's that fucking with
you and your God Damn Ego.

995
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,100
Do you have a position at work?
Little fucking corner office. Brad

996
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,440
fucking moron telling
me I need to breathing.

997
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,690
You might want to make that a priority
once you tell me something fucking else

998
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:20,650
obvious. All right,
there you go. This year,

999
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:25,190
a head of steam for the week Douche
bag of the week. Good old bread.

1000
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,010
I had no idea.
Really.

1001
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,920
If it wasn't on iTunes and people
couldn't download it in anymore,

1002
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,220
like that would present some sort of
a problem and drop my listenership.

1003
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:38,180
You'd think, I don't realize
that Brad, you fucking Dick

1004
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,070
on Columbus Day.

1005
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,560
Can't believe I'm in this kind of
a fucking move on Columbus Day.

1006
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,580
You know this is a great day
in sort of white history.

1007
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,280
When that Spaniard came over here,

1008
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:56,420
who kind of look white because of his
brown hair. Did he have brown hair?

1009
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,950
Wasn't he Spanish or did he just
sail for the Spanish? I can't eat.

1010
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,400
I can't even fucking keep the
damn story straight. All right.

1011
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,940
In My fucking history book.
He had yellow hair, you know,

1012
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:12,470
and shiny teeth in a fucking,
you know,

1013
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:19,610
he was in shape. Then all of a sudden
they make a movie about him as Jerrad dip,

1014
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:21,650
not dude.
And he played them that French fuck.

1015
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,300
He played him and he didn't
even land in Florida. He lands,

1016
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,860
he leans down in the,
uh,

1017
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,770
the Caribbean starts cutting people's
hands off because they're not finding

1018
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,300
blood diamonds. So, which
was it? You know what I love?

1019
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:38,540
I love when like, when they have like
a, like a story. Everybody's going by,

1020
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,430
right about some shit that
happened fucking 500 years ago,

1021
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,370
whatever thousand years ago.
Then out of nowhere,

1022
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:51,730
there'll be a show on TV and they'll
say new evidence suggests new evidence.

1023
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:56,000
Five something from 500 years
and yet new evidence. Really?

1024
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,680
What the fuck did you find it that did
Christopher Columbus write something down

1025
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:04,070
on a cocktail napkin in a bar and
somebody finally cleaned out the fucking,

1026
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:08,030
those rubber mats that they stand on
and they found it. Oh look at this.

1027
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:13,790
Evidently he went down to the Caribbean
and chop people's hands off and for some

1028
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:18,320
reason wrote it all over this
cocktail napkin. You know,

1029
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,420
I see some, you know where we
thought the world was flat.

1030
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,540
New evidence suggest that maybe he
didn't sail off the edge of the world.

1031
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,540
Maybe his fucking boat sank in a storm.
I can see that.

1032
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:33,040
That's sort of new
evidence, but I mean, what,

1033
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,080
what sort of new evidence did you find?
Huh?

1034
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,660
Some fucking old lady used to bang,

1035
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,580
I guess when she was fucking not
even a fetus and she's still alive.

1036
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:49,950
I actually knew Christopher Columbus.
He was a murderer at son of a bitch.

1037
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,830
I don't know who the
fuck knows what happened.

1038
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,010
I just like bringing that shit up so
then people who were into that stuff can

1039
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:58,770
then send me a five page email,
you know,

1040
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,680
or the lazy ones who then just search it,

1041
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,530
find it and then paste the
link like they're an expert.

1042
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,880
I'm lashing out at everybody this week.
It's Christopher Columbus Day. Everybody,

1043
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,560
you know, and thank God he
discovered America or else
we wouldn't have been here.

1044
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,090
Think about what would have happened,

1045
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,770
what wouldn't have happened if he
didn't come over here? You know,

1046
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,900
from slavery to cheesecake factory's,

1047
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,180
none of that would have been a possibility

1048
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:35,070
if that fucking greedy son of a bitch.
They actually took a lot of balls.

1049
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:37,920
He, I think he's the first x
Gamer. You know what I mean?

1050
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,510
He just said, fine. He's that
really is. Was he a scientist?

1051
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,020
Where did Christopher Columbus get the
balls? Because I'll tell you right now,

1052
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:51,200
me being the afraid of technology
person that I am afraid of change,

1053
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,770
you know, there's no fucking
way I would've gotten that boat.

1054
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,800
There's no god damn way.

1055
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,640
I know the world's round and I
won't get on a fucking boat today.

1056
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,720
What do you think about that?

1057
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,240
Are you afraid that it's
going to sink bill? Yes, I am.

1058
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,400
That's what I'm afraid of it.

1059
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:14,880
I'm afraid I'm going to survive it and
then sit there and pray that hypothermia

1060
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:16,440
sets in in numbs me up,

1061
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:20,790
so I don't feel it when the fucking
tiger shark starts nibbling on one of my

1062
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:25,380
fucking pasty thighs.
I'm sorry guys.

1063
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:26,550
This is really fucking angry.

1064
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:30,450
That guy just really set me off where
the devacy exact fucking reason why I

1065
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:31,800
became a goddamn comedian.

1066
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,640
Cause I don't want to ever be in a
position where some douche comes over,

1067
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,840
leans over into my life and tells me
what I might want to make a fucking

1068
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:43,620
priority. You condescending? Fuck.

1069
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,910
What kind of a mouse of
a woman did you marry?

1070
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:52,110
It's probably downstairs right now making
a Voodoo doll or you and your fucking

1071
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:56,340
Docker's he fat gut hanging out.
You went to Lowe's guys.

1072
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:57,973
Huh?

1073
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,470
You always got to wear this sport coat
and no one knows how fat you are until

1074
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,610
till they have the office.

1075
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:07,020
Fucking let's go play Frisbee party and
then you show up with your fucking man.

1076
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:11,640
Tits, heart disease buddy.
That's what I wish on you.

1077
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,890
Go Fuck Yourself.
Listen to another podcast.

1078
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:16,740
You might want to make that a priority.
All right,

1079
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,320
so let's get on with the hyping
for this week. I have, um,

1080
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:27,200
I have a new show that I actually
have heaven even hyped on here. Uh,

1081
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:31,480
it's the last second. I'm going to
be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

1082
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,620
Massachusetts,

1083
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:38,490
and I am doing a comedy show actually
from my brother who was running for state

1084
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:42,490
Senate in Massachusetts.
And A,

1085
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:47,410
all proceeds will go after we
paid for the theater. And uh,

1086
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:51,680
the state tax had a though, you know, God
knows what else you got to pay, but all,

1087
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:56,020
all the proceeds are going to go towards,
uh, helping him out with his campaign.

1088
01:05:56,021 --> 01:06:00,340
So, um, that's it. All right.

1089
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:05,370
It's going to be October 20th
at the Wilbur Theater in,

1090
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,100
uh, Boston, Massachusetts.
So come on down,

1091
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,180
come on down and uh,

1092
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:16,740
watch me dance around like a
monkey for a fucking hour and uh,

1093
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,890
we'll raise some money for my brother's
campaign. There you go. There you go.

1094
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,790
You know,
you might want to make that a priority.

1095
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,100
I'm not gonna be able to get
that out of my fucking head.

1096
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,190
That's the exact reason.
That's why I worked in,

1097
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,020
that's why I worked in the warehouse.

1098
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:36,400
I never went into the carpeted area
because I saw those fucking people.

1099
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,470
They had to sit there
at that Goddamn desk.

1100
01:06:38,471 --> 01:06:42,250
And you just saw you saw the back of their
necks when you came. He said, you know,

1101
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,173
Hey Mike,

1102
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,480
he saw their shoulders come up a little
bit because they thought it was that

1103
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:50,260
cunt in the office who leans over to
tell him what they might want to make a

1104
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:53,740
fucking priority.
All right.

1105
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:59,920
Okay. I am back. Um,
let's talk NFL football.

1106
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:04,780
Everybody, let's fucking just drive
that subject into the Goddamn ground.

1107
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:09,530
Shall We? Um, now fuck that. We'll
get to that a little bit later. Um,

1108
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,700
let's talk about online
banking, shall we? I, yeah,

1109
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:14,800
but was listening to am radio this week.

1110
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,630
You know why? Cause I'm a big
fan of the fill Henry show.

1111
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:24,670
So I was listening to that and I just
woke up the next day and I still had it on

1112
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:27,550
that. And uh, you know,

1113
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:32,410
there was this one show where this
guy was as left as Fox is, right?

1114
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:34,300
And it was just,
it was completely asinine.

1115
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,710
And he was making the usual
statements that idiots make who,

1116
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,640
who hosts those shows or
listen to those shows.

1117
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,610
He started saying something
dumb about like, uh,

1118
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:49,930
you know when Republicans lie
in Washington, no one cares.

1119
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:52,170
Nobody does anything about it.
But if a Democrat lies,

1120
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,450
they just hold their feet to the fire.
You know, that dumb shit. You know,

1121
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:58,060
they can do whatever they want, but if
we do something, but they, but they,

1122
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,070
he was like, really? You don't think
that you're so far to one side that you,

1123
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,870
maybe you're,

1124
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,770
you're just a little bit clouded and your
vision keyed out really fucking notice.

1125
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,190
Like a sports fan,
you know,

1126
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,190
look a Yankee Fan,
right?

1127
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,370
Some fucking eight year old pole's
a routine fly ball into the stands.

1128
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:19,880
As long as it's a home run for your
team, you don't give a fuck. Right?

1129
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,450
Then all of a sudden if someone on
the other team is fucking around,

1130
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,250
then it's a major God damn problem.

1131
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:29,150
Like every fan I should've just picked
on the Yankee fans should I have,

1132
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,300
I'll tell you, that was an amazing victory
they had over the twins. You see that?

1133
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:34,370
They fucking swept those sons
of bitches right in, in the rug.

1134
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,170
How'd you like that? Minnesota
with the new stadium. Uh,

1135
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:40,310
what do you think that was going to make
a difference? Maybe if we play outside,

1136
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:41,660
we won't get our asses kicked.

1137
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:46,340
Do you understand that you're a mom and
pop store out there and you're going up

1138
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:48,380
against Walmart.
All right.

1139
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,510
Get your grandmother off the front
porch with a shotgun. It's fucking over.

1140
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:59,060
Um,
this is how much I don't watch baseball.

1141
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:02,780
I thought the reds were in last place
like they have been for like the last 10

1142
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:06,760
years. So it was kind of exciting
to see them in first. And you know,

1143
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,820
playing in the playoffs,

1144
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,830
although the Phillies was spanking
their fucking head. I don't know.

1145
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,270
I got a weird relationship
with Cincinnati. They'd
beat my red sox in 1975.

1146
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,900
It's one of the first memories
I have of being a sports fan.

1147
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,760
I didn't really know what was going on.

1148
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:27,350
I just remember hearing my dad
screaming at the fucking TV. Um,

1149
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:34,330
so they beat us then. But then I know
I kind of liked, I always liked, uh,

1150
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,800
I live is a big national
league fan in the 80s.

1151
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,100
I liked the astro turf people stole basis.
I thought,

1152
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,750
I thought astro turf was cool.

1153
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,580
That's how much of a child of the
70s and eighties I was. But um,

1154
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,900
I dunno now they're back
kind of rooting for them,

1155
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,440
but I had such a shitty weekend last
time I was out there and fucking Norfolk,

1156
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:59,210
Kentucky and being in downtown Cincinnati
where there was just absolutely

1157
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:04,000
nothing going on plus past 5:00 PM that
you want to be involved in. So I dunno,

1158
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:08,750
I think I'm rooting for the Phillies.
Is that my team?

1159
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,620
Obviously anybody who plays the fucking
Yankees I'm going to root against,

1160
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,430
but you know, uh, you son of a bitch.

1161
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,230
You guys want to hear me take a phone
call? Huh? Business phone call. Hello?

1162
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,880
What's going on Josh?
How are you?

1163
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,510
Do I sound odd right
now it's because I'm a,

1164
01:10:30,511 --> 01:10:32,450
I'm in the middle of doing my podcast

1165
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,640
and you're not really on the air.
You're,

1166
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,280
you're up to my ear so no
one can really hear anything.

1167
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,760
So if you want to trash these fucking
morons, then I'm morons. You know,

1168
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,170
it was just one person pissed me off,

1169
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:48,740
told me something that I need to
make a priority on my podcast.

1170
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,540
And suddenly I felt like I had a day job.

1171
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,340
You want to email me those flights and
that stuff and I'll look at it after the

1172
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:56,174
podcast.

1173
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,810
Oh, Jesus. Okay.

1174
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,740
All right. Hang on one second.
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

1175
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,540
All right, I'm back. Sorry. That's
her not to be way more important.

1176
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:21,400
I thought he was going to say, do you
want to fly to Seattle at this hour,

1177
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:25,170
this hour? Um, and he was,

1178
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:28,290
what the hell was I talking about?
God dammit.

1179
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,940
He's talking about Democrats, Republicans
at J. Habitated dad who gives a fuck.

1180
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:36,130
Let's talk about, oh, it's talking
about baseball, but basically,

1181
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:37,500
I don't even know what's
going on in there.

1182
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,340
I know Mariano Rivera Rivera's still
playing, right? He still comes out.

1183
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,280
They play a little enter Sandman. You
know, he doesn't even like that song.

1184
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,450
I'll fucking funny. Is it? Huh? Um, Bill,

1185
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:49,380
it's actually not funny.

1186
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:52,860
Kind of like the last three
minutes of this fucking
podcast. Ah, right. All right.

1187
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,010
All right, let's, let's, uh, let's
move on with some subjects here.

1188
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:00,180
Do I have anything? How
about we talk about, um,

1189
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,600
Sung about Randy Moss
getting fucking traded

1190
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,500
by the Goddamn patriots. This is, um,

1191
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,630
I dunno what the fuck I was like,
she's going to say there,

1192
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,200
I'm looking at like 15 different things
right now. People. That's what I need.

1193
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:20,040
I need to regroup. All
right. First of all,

1194
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:23,880
I had a weird week football cause
this week my team had a by, you know,

1195
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:26,650
and it's just such like a fucking,
I don't know, it's the weirdest guy.

1196
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,940
It's like that Phantom Limb
Syndrome you give, reaching forward.

1197
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,030
It's just not fucking there.
You know?

1198
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,240
I'll like when you go to a mall and you
can't remember where the fuck you parked

1199
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:38,730
and you just spend enough
God damn hour just searching,

1200
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:43,260
riding around the golf cart with
that fucking security guard.

1201
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:48,210
The alarm key. Pressy lumpy.
You'd think I'm not doing that.

1202
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,930
You think I'm not doing
that? Um, so anyways, yeah,

1203
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,370
the Patriots Traded Randy Moss.

1204
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:57,810
So I got a bunch of emails from the
happy jet fans and they're sitting there

1205
01:12:57,811 --> 01:12:58,730
going like,
Duh,

1206
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:02,340
what do they fucking morons with the
fuck would you thought they'd go fucking

1207
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:06,120
fucking Ned for?
And I think it's the obvious.

1208
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,530
I think he was a, I think he's being
a problem in the fucking locker room.

1209
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,180
Why else would you trade him?

1210
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:16,920
Why would you trade Randy Moss
for a fucking third round pick?

1211
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:17,790
Why would you do that?

1212
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:21,810
What level of a country would you have
to be in order to make that happen?

1213
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,310
And I know what a lot
of people are gonna say,

1214
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:25,390
well the Patriots are saying we
never had a fucking problem with.

1215
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,700
What do you think they're going to say?

1216
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,340
They're trying to get that out
of their fucking locker room.

1217
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,650
So I actually haven't had this big back
and forth with this dude cause I was

1218
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:42,240
trying to talk to him about like he was
trying to tell me how fucking dumb it

1219
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:46,530
was that the Patriots traded that
guy. And I'm just, it's just like,

1220
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:50,370
haven't you seen tios?
Haven't you seen Stephon Marbury is,

1221
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:53,130
you haven't seen these guys. They've
got all the talent in the fucking world,

1222
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:54,330
but they don't dare.

1223
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,580
They're not even focused on
whether they're winning or losing.

1224
01:13:56,581 --> 01:14:00,630
They're just looking at their fucking
stats and when halftime comes around,

1225
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,300
if they don't have their
fucking 15 points already,

1226
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:06,540
are there five fucking catches or
somebody else has more catches in them?

1227
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:11,480
They start acting cunty,
which affects the mood in,

1228
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:13,030
in, in the, in the goddamn locker room.

1229
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,910
So I was talking to a student about
team chemistry fucking intangibles,

1230
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,610
which he thought was ridiculous.
He's like,

1231
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:22,120
are you one of these people who talks
about intangibles? It doesn't matter.

1232
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:24,220
It's all about what you
do on the fucking field.

1233
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:30,420
Really intangibles was the reason why
I knew Peyton manning wasn't as good as

1234
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:34,360
Tom Brady when it really came down to it,

1235
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:39,760
because that guy is far as dropping back,
throwing a ball,

1236
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,030
making a completion, has
it all over. Tom Brady,

1237
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,530
he's at least 30% better
in all of those categories.

1238
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:50,080
His stats are at least 30% better.

1239
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:55,740
But the fucking intangible is what goes
on between your fucking ears when the

1240
01:14:55,901 --> 01:15:00,580
pressure is on and all of a
sudden it fucking counts in.

1241
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,430
The whole season's on the line.
What do you do?

1242
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:07,480
Do you drive your team down for a score
or do you throw a fucking pick six?

1243
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:11,710
Do you lead your team to victory or do
you lose to the eight and eight chargers?

1244
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,540
If you're frustrated,

1245
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:17,530
do you fucking hold it in and turn it
into something positive and lead your team

1246
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,030
or do you openly show it?

1247
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:22,870
Like I saw him do again yesterday
against the Kansas City chiefs.

1248
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,070
He had Peyton face,
I can't get to pull work.

1249
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,360
Yeah, why don't you a bitch again
and get a new fucking rule chain.

1250
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,650
So Kansas City can't play fucking
defense on you. Did you guys notice?

1251
01:15:35,651 --> 01:15:38,110
Kansas City has Romeo,
Carmel and Charlie Weiss.

1252
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,800
They basically have our
offensive and defensive
coordinator from back in the day.

1253
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,340
Smart sons of bitches over there and
they were doing the exact same shit that

1254
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:46,420
the patriots used to do.

1255
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,270
They just didn't have the personnel
to do it for 60 fucking minutes.

1256
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:54,220
And Peyton had the exact same fucking
look on his face that he had from o two o

1257
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:56,800
three Oh four when he couldn't
beat the fucking patriots.

1258
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,370
That sir is what I'm talking about.

1259
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:05,650
That's why people say Derek Jeter is
better than a rod despite a rods fucking

1260
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:09,880
stats. I'm telling you, Derek Jeter,

1261
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:13,630
I w you can build a team around that
can't build a team around fucking a rod.

1262
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:17,410
You know, during the moment when
he's supposed to be getting,

1263
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:18,250
you know he's supposed to,
you know,

1264
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:21,700
you don't have three game fucking losing
streak and you need the captain to step

1265
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:25,680
up. You know, say something.
Get the guys going.

1266
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:28,360
Ea Rods over in the corner
putting fucking lip balm on.

1267
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,220
It's not a Goddamn leader.

1268
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,280
He's over there staring at
himself in the fucking mirror.

1269
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,480
I Dunno the fuck are you going to
say, you know, look, this is what,

1270
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:38,314
this is how I look at it.

1271
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:43,300
If you trade a guy as good as Randy Moss
for a third round pick out of fucking

1272
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:47,470
nowhere, he did something so Kentucky
that they just said, you know what?

1273
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:51,220
It's like the lock,
the door test and a Bronx tale.

1274
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:54,370
He did something and this was
just the tip of the iceberg.

1275
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:58,450
We're fucking out and you know, didn't
you know deep in your heart patriots fan?

1276
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:03,520
Didn't you know that? Eventually it
does it ever end good with Randy?

1277
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:08,470
Has he ended well with any
team member with the Vikings?

1278
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:12,610
Yeah. I take a few plays off, you know,

1279
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,310
goes out to Oakland cause they're
like, oh, this guy's a headcase.

1280
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:19,820
We always take on head cases and then
all of a sudden they become good guys.

1281
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:22,990
He for fucking problem there. And
he did the same thing out here. So,

1282
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,630
so what are you going to do
the fuck you going to do?

1283
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:28,970
What do you think the Patriots were going
to win it if you've seen our defense,

1284
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:30,410
even though we beat the fucking dolphins,

1285
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:33,440
didn't we look like we were in a prevent
defense from the fucking first quarter

1286
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:37,360
on? So, um, I dunno,

1287
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:41,950
I'm not that fucking freaked out about
it considering when I look at the

1288
01:17:41,951 --> 01:17:44,560
receivers that we had
when we won super bowls,

1289
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,610
we didn't have a Jerry Rice level.
Yeah.

1290
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:51,900
Unless you think David Patton was that
guy, man, I don't fucking know. Whatever.

1291
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,360
We have a goddamn system.
You have to, bottom line is,

1292
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:59,540
is Randy's a fucking headcase and
the Patriots are an arrogant miserly

1293
01:17:59,581 --> 01:18:01,960
franchise.
Okay.

1294
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:04,620
So we don't tolerate
looking at week like I,

1295
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:08,890
the Patriot stole fucking tolerate you
being a cunt in the locker room. And uh,

1296
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:13,400
okay. I think he was done the second he
had that stupid fucking press conference

1297
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:14,601
saying,

1298
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:18,590
I think there's people here in New
England that don't want to see me do well.

1299
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,780
Oh Jesus Christ.

1300
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:25,390
Go take your fucking Goddamn
tampons and go to fucking Minnesota.

1301
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,300
And you know what he's going to do out
there tonight, you think? I don't know.

1302
01:18:28,301 --> 01:18:30,520
He's not going to get 180
fucking yards tonight.

1303
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:33,460
He's going to do exactly what Manny
did when he went to the Dodgers.

1304
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:37,740
He's going to try for like fucking six
weeks because he wants to pee, you know,

1305
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:40,170
show everybody.
He's not the guy that he fucking is,

1306
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:44,830
but eventually that'll all
go south. You know, Jesus.

1307
01:18:44,831 --> 01:18:48,610
What a cluster fuck tonight
is, Huh? Randy Moss in town.

1308
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,770
You got Rex Ryan,
he's talked to all that shit and uh,

1309
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,570
Brett Farve showed everybody his dick.

1310
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,403
Okay,

1311
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,750
I know what a lot of you
are probably thinking.

1312
01:19:03,751 --> 01:19:08,751
How fucking stupid do you have to
be this day and age to be famous?

1313
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,600
Take a picture of your unit and
fucking send it to somebody.

1314
01:19:12,601 --> 01:19:15,660
How fucking dumb do you have to be?
I'm telling you right now,

1315
01:19:15,661 --> 01:19:18,830
you're looking at it the wrong way.
All right?

1316
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:23,831
What you really have to see is the
level of ass that you get when you play

1317
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:29,570
quarterback for football team.
What you see in Brett Farve

1318
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,200
because my first thing was like
when he did that, I was just like,

1319
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,650
well why didn't he just fucking
verbally close the deal?

1320
01:19:38,651 --> 01:19:40,900
Why didn't he just go up,
talk some shit and make her laugh,

1321
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:45,220
get her fucking number and then
go out with her? Brett Farve,

1322
01:19:45,221 --> 01:19:48,280
I like wrangler jeans. You want
to see my Dick? I mean, like what?

1323
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:50,370
What kind of fucking gate?
And then I mean,

1324
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:54,850
it was like this guy has no fucking
game with women because he never had to.

1325
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,850
He's Jesus, like to classic. All
American fucking Dudley do right face.

1326
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,710
And he's the quarterback of the team.

1327
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:07,650
Probably from junior high on
chicks would just coming to him.

1328
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,020
Oh my God, Brad. I got
God. It's bad. Far. Brad,

1329
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,380
how did you choose? Thank you.
Thank you. Won't see my deck.

1330
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:20,820
Where's he from? Mississippi. You
can do that still in Mississippi.

1331
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:23,310
You can walk down the street and get
a deck hanging out of your overalls.

1332
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:26,250
No one gives a shit. Yeah.
Mortar Dick hanging out.

1333
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,570
You want to go fishing?
They don't give a shit

1334
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:36,690
this whole fucking career. He's been the
fucking man. And when you're the man,

1335
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,350
the fucking who is,
don't give a shit.

1336
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,470
They take, they take fucking
stampede. You. I bet.

1337
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:49,420
I bet that that was his game.
Just like fucking Ben Roethlisberger.

1338
01:20:49,421 --> 01:20:52,000
I'm starting to think that that
guy wasn't a goddamn sex offender.

1339
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:56,260
I just think he's been the quarterback.
He's been the man, so he has no game.

1340
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,100
So he just walks into a bar and he's like,

1341
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:03,630
and he just reaches over and grabs them.
Okay.

1342
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:09,750
So, uh, I don't think that those guys
are morons. I look at them the same way.

1343
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:14,040
When people look at someone who
grew up in the inner city, you know,

1344
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:17,430
and they didn't have
access to, to the, to the,

1345
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:20,550
to the good books in their
school was a fucking war zone.

1346
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,320
And if you stuck anybody in there,

1347
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,420
they also would come out and would
it be at a fucking, you know,

1348
01:21:26,421 --> 01:21:28,890
seventh grade reading level,
right?

1349
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,720
The same way with me or anybody else.
If I was the fucking man,

1350
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:37,450
if I was the quarterback from
fucking junior high on, oh,

1351
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:41,160
I'd be hanging out at Hooters
just grabbing titties.

1352
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,410
You want to see my Dick?

1353
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,420
I loved that he did that. I
loved that he did that. You know,

1354
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:52,240
cause you see him do all that shit
on TV and you like Jesus Christ.

1355
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:56,960
I couldn't hit a golf ball as far as
that guy can throw a fucking football.

1356
01:21:56,961 --> 01:21:59,810
What happened to me genetically?
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1357
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,480
And then Brett Farve does something,

1358
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:06,320
like daddy takes a picture of his
Dick and then sends it to somebody.

1359
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,620
And it's just like a,
I dunno,

1360
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,620
you know, it's just, there's something,
uh, it's just fucking hilarious.

1361
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:20,630
So evidently they're going to do these
stupid pink uniforms for the rest of the,

1362
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:25,560
I mean, how are you not aware of, of
breast cancer at this point? You know,

1363
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:32,180
Goddamn Nfl, don't you have
enough fans? Yeah, we'll,

1364
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:32,480
we'll,

1365
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,480
we'll even appeal to fucking women
with breast cancer show that we care.

1366
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,650
You know,
it's a fucking,

1367
01:22:38,651 --> 01:22:40,450
you know what to say and I
know that sounds fucking mean,

1368
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:43,810
but I'm telling you that was
how that decision was made.

1369
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,450
And I know because I
wasn't in the meeting,

1370
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,210
I just lump all corporations into the
same shit bag. That's what I do. Um,

1371
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,270
all right, here's a guy actually says a
underrated overrated this week. He said,

1372
01:22:56,271 --> 01:23:00,080
uh, he, and he's talking about
this shit shit. He was saying, um,

1373
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:04,340
over rate of breast cancer is a terrible
thing, but why does it take precedent?

1374
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:05,501
Oh,

1375
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:10,060
a over all other forms of cancer to the
point where everyone in the NFL has to

1376
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:14,290
spend a month of October looking
like they're in the heart foundation.

1377
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,520
All for the sake of breast cancer
awareness. Who isn't aware?

1378
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,450
It's the number one
killer of women were told.

1379
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:27,660
Apparently though it's actually number
seven behind 606 are the things that men

1380
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:31,360
also die of.
Well that's interesting.

1381
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:36,020
So I guess they meet, it's the number
one killer of women only. I Dunno.

1382
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:40,590
Granted men do in rare cases
also get breast cancer, but uh,

1383
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,980
it's clearly not about them.
I don't think anyone could get,

1384
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:49,390
go to go through a benefit for a man
with breast cancer without giggling a

1385
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:53,140
little. Uh, what's the number one
killer of men? I have no idea.

1386
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:56,170
No one does prostate cancer.
September is prostate,

1387
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,190
prostate cancer awareness month,
which I didn't know until I googled it.

1388
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:05,140
Prostate cancer needs the breast
cancer PR team, uh, colon cancer,

1389
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:10,390
they get a brown ribbon to quote my
friend Nate, can you think of a more,

1390
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:15,040
I don't give a shit color than Brown.
So there you go. Yeah. You know,

1391
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:16,780
I thought it was cool last
year that they did it,

1392
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:21,130
but it's like every year are they
going to be wearing pink? You know,

1393
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,010
I just, you know, with the fucking,
every given he's got a goddamn ribbon.

1394
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:32,230
You know what's funny is when they did
it last year, it actually had effect.

1395
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,820
You know, where I was just like, oh,
what the, what the fuck are they wearing?

1396
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,700
Pink for? Oh, breast cancer
awareness. And then then it's over.

1397
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:45,190
Then it's over and now you're making
jaws two and no one gives a shit, right?

1398
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:48,730
Spielberg isn't directing. It's over.
It's over. We got it. We're aware.

1399
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:52,600
We are aware of, all right.
Overrated. Uh, the Foa.

1400
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:54,970
Harris Full Hawk style.

1401
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,420
The only reason it's overrated
is because you don't,

1402
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,930
you don't have a segment on
your podcast called fucking gay.

1403
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:08,530
If you want a Mohawk, that's cool.
Just man up and do it the right way.

1404
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,090
So there you go. There you go. I
got to meet guys. You know what?

1405
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:17,440
For the last 10 minutes, I felt like I
had absolutely nothing to talk about.

1406
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,330
I don't know what's going on in my life.

1407
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:22,390
I'm thinking about buying a fucking house.
Let's talk about my life for a second.

1408
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:25,060
I'm thinking about buying a fucking
house out here and I live in a bankrupt

1409
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:30,061
state in a city that technically has no
water supply and they want about 1.2 to

1410
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:34,510
one point $4 million for anything
remotely fucking decent out here.

1411
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:38,650
And uh, um, I can't do it.

1412
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,360
I'm not, you know, it's fun.

1413
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:48,670
I'm not going to be one point
something million dollars in debt.

1414
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:52,750
I'll be on the road for the
rest of my fucking life.

1415
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:58,970
So I've been going on the Internet
and I've been looking at places, um,

1416
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,520
in the middle of nowhere,

1417
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:04,040
and I've been trying to figure out how
I can live in the middle of fucking

1418
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:09,041
nowhere without a losing my mind and be
somehow still existing in this business.

1419
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:15,620
And I realized I can't fucking do it.
You know

1420
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:20,960
how many movie stars
live in Fucking Wyoming?

1421
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,840
I know they got ranches out there,

1422
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:27,470
but they wait til they're fucking
famous before they go out there.

1423
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:31,430
I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do. God dammit.

1424
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,580
I'm a typical fucking American.

1425
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:37,400
You know what you think I want some
little ass fucking house. I don't,

1426
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:39,080
I want to fuck and spread.

1427
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,530
I want a big ass God damn house.

1428
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:47,060
I want a fucking pool inside and outside.

1429
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,450
I want a god damn.

1430
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,250
I know what I want and it's
going to be fucking ridiculous.

1431
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:00,620
But uh, you know what's
funny is you, if, if,

1432
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:05,270
whatever your job is, if it doesn't
involve you having to be there,

1433
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,090
like these people who work
from home on their computers,

1434
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:13,310
you can actually have an
MTV cribs level house.

1435
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:17,840
You just have to live in like fucking,
you know,

1436
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:22,400
the upper east corner of Montana.
You know,

1437
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:25,340
granted you're going to get attacked by
a fucking bobcat every time you go out

1438
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:26,900
to try to fucking grill a hot dog.

1439
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:34,370
Oh fuck.
What the fuck are you going to do?

1440
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:37,490
You guys want to some youtube
videos for the week yet? Well,

1441
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,950
I don't give a shit if you don't
because here they come. All right,

1442
01:27:39,951 --> 01:27:43,110
youtube a and r l gets knocked out.
Um,

1443
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:46,640
this is a referee getting
knocked out and a,

1444
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:51,560
I think it's rugby and you got to see
this because the guy who knocks out

1445
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:53,630
inadvertently knocks out the referee.

1446
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,160
Might be one of the most unathletic I
don't athletic guys I've ever seen in my

1447
01:27:58,161 --> 01:27:58,994
life.

1448
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:03,620
He looks like some guy in times square
who's trying to charge you too much for a

1449
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:08,621
fucking digital camera and
he's got a fat round face.

1450
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,260
If he had any sort of athletic ability,

1451
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:15,980
he would have been able to jump over the
ref instead of kneeing him in the back

1452
01:28:15,981 --> 01:28:16,814
of the fucking,

1453
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:24,080
when I got to tell you something,
this unathletic Douche bag,

1454
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:28,820
he knocks this ref the fuck out.
Like I'm surprised this guy didn't die.

1455
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:34,610
This fucking pudgy jackass is running
full speed and it's the most pathetic

1456
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:36,560
attempt to hurdle.

1457
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:40,540
This guy couldn't hurdle a fucking
tube sock and he's trying to hurt this

1458
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:44,980
fucking kid and he just, Ah,

1459
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,090
you know, when you know
that, you know, you know the,

1460
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,240
the form you have when your hurdle
one legs outstretched in the yellow,

1461
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:54,890
one's bent, it's the bent knee and
he's got all that fucking pudgy wait,

1462
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:57,920
come in and he just fucking knees and
right in the back of the head and that guy

1463
01:28:57,921 --> 01:29:02,670
just goes limp. Um, all right.

1464
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:05,460
This is one,
this one is actually funny and scary.

1465
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:09,960
It's called a Turkish
guy goes bananas and,

1466
01:29:09,961 --> 01:29:10,620
uh,

1467
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:15,620
I believe he screams a law and he
looks like he attempts to do that.

1468
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:17,620
You ever see those people?
Uh,

1469
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:22,140
like the break dancers or whatever the
fuck they are or dancers in general.

1470
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:25,620
And they do that thing with a
jump up in the air, like sideways,

1471
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:28,320
like a deer and sort
of do like a three 60,

1472
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:32,880
they'll almost like parallel to the
ground and then they somehow land and they

1473
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:36,980
jump up and they do it again. This guy is
basically doing that, but he's too fat,

1474
01:29:36,981 --> 01:29:38,460
not a shape.
So he's just sort of,

1475
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,830
he's just sort of rolling
around on the ground,

1476
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:49,050
but he gets his legs and his arms
out. It's a pretty, uh, he's very, uh,

1477
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:53,970
sorta Belushi esque where he's punchy,
but he's very light on his feet. Um,

1478
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:57,090
is another great one.
This is about as rock and roll as it gets.

1479
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:01,980
Swedish singer vomits during performance.
It's just phenomenal.

1480
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,420
The type of music he's singing,

1481
01:30:03,421 --> 01:30:08,040
the fact that he doesn't stop the fact
that he's singing like that death metal,

1482
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:11,130
like ordered Rah Rah Rah.
And then occasionally he'd be like,

1483
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:16,740
and then he actually is puking
as he's going. It's awesome. Um,

1484
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,480
loud car horn prank.

1485
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,720
These are all things that you can
search or you can also also go to the

1486
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:25,170
[inaudible] podcast.com and we'll
have all of these, the official,

1487
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,510
the [inaudible],
podcast.com,

1488
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,890
the official fan webpage of the Monday
morning podcast that is no longer on

1489
01:30:31,891 --> 01:30:35,730
iTunes. Okay. I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

1490
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,340
We've called these people,
we've emailed them,

1491
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:41,490
they have not gotten back
to us and they're probably,

1492
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:44,850
I'm going to get served some sort of
papers for stocking at this point.

1493
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:49,260
Cause that's what I feel like.
I feel like it was a girl that I went out.

1494
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:53,340
I had a good time. Evidently
she didn't. And um,

1495
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:58,260
you know, I went through the
whole roommate lying to me phase,

1496
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:03,000
you know. Hello? Yeah. Hey,
it's bill. Is iTunes there?

1497
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:06,750
I yeah, no. Um,

1498
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:11,280
I tunes in the shower. Oh yeah.
Dina, do you know when, when,

1499
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,730
when they're going to be
out? Oh, I dunno. It's funny.

1500
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,700
Nine minutes. Why did I say 20? Yeah,

1501
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:22,890
29 minutes.
Okay.

1502
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,170
Fucking half hour later age.
Which bill is iTunes there?

1503
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:33,900
Um, yeah, no, they're still in the shower

1504
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:38,760
but doing that for fucking
two weeks and uh, you know,

1505
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:43,710
it's that classic classic fucking
corporate shit where they have themselves

1506
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:48,390
completely insulated. We'll get back
to you if we fucking feel like it.

1507
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:53,850
Itunes, we own the tunes. Fucking cunt.

1508
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:58,590
You know, I saw, I think when I was
listening on am radio. Dot. Even,

1509
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,090
did I already talk about this or
did I start to talk about this?

1510
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:04,450
They were talking about online banking.
Okay.

1511
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,560
The shit member back in the day
when I was talking about that going,

1512
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:12,570
you have to be out of your fucking mind
to pay bills or to do any sort of online

1513
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:17,470
banking because someone's going to steal
your identity and take all the money

1514
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:21,820
out of your bank account. Well, guess
what? That's exactly what's happening.

1515
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,230
All these morons who sent me emails going,
dude,

1516
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:30,280
I don't even have to go to the post stuff.
I don't have to lick a fucking stamp.

1517
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:33,550
It's so fucking easy.
That's what I love about computers.

1518
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:37,240
Everything's so fucking easy.
And then you get raped in the ass

1519
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:42,730
and then they then, then no one ever
addresses it is that goes, hey, maybe,

1520
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:46,030
maybe back in the day it
was a little bit better.

1521
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:47,610
Like people sitting there going,
uh,

1522
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:52,030
they were talking about when I
was bitching about that. Go on.

1523
01:32:52,031 --> 01:32:53,950
I don't pay bills online.

1524
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:58,630
I'm not having all that information
online for any fucker in the world who has

1525
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,430
an ability to hack into
shit to come after my stuff.

1526
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:06,700
I just don't want that to happen. And
then these fucking morons it going well.

1527
01:33:06,701 --> 01:33:08,980
What a book to guide
you on the post office.

1528
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:15,400
Like that guy has access to the entire
fucking world down the post office.

1529
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:17,740
And even though he does
have access to my shit,

1530
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:21,460
there's actually cameras on those
people and yeah, he might get me,

1531
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:24,220
but they're going to get him.
They get those guys.

1532
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:28,060
And those guys go to fucking jail as
opposed to someone on the Internet who can

1533
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,840
look at everybody's shit once they
break into it. So I have a deadly,

1534
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:36,841
they're saying that if you are dumb
enough to bank online that they're saying

1535
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,960
don't use the same computer that uh,

1536
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,830
that you bank with tea
to do like email with.

1537
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:53,440
Cause evidently that's how they get in.
I have no idea.

1538
01:33:53,441 --> 01:33:56,830
But someone told me awhile ago that
all my information is already up on the

1539
01:33:56,831 --> 01:34:01,831
fucking Internet anyways
because my country bank put
it up there just in case I

1540
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:04,990
want to, I want to bank
on line. It's like, no,

1541
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:09,460
it's not just in case it's cause you're
phasing out fucking cash and this is the

1542
01:34:09,461 --> 01:34:11,530
direction you're taking my money.

1543
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,820
I don't know man. I have a real, I got
a real fucking problem with banks. Hey,

1544
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:22,930
what's up? What are you laughing at?
Nia is here. Everybody come on in.

1545
01:34:22,931 --> 01:34:25,720
I this has just been a
real negative podcasts.

1546
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,980
Come over here.
You just had a what?

1547
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:34,330
I just had a great conversation with
somebody. Oh yeah. Did they tell you,

1548
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,830
you know, you needed to make anything
a priority? No, they didn't. Okay.

1549
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:39,860
Who were you talking to?

1550
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,790
An actress and she was just positive
and awesome and it was great.

1551
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,640
I need to do on your phone. Can I ask
you a question? Why are you with me?

1552
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:53,260
Why am I, why are you fucking with me? I'm
fucking like this curmudgeonly old man.

1553
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:55,930
I'm sitting here going off
on online baking and I,

1554
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,270
and I realized I got halfway through it
that I really didn't have enough facts

1555
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,950
and am radio one the other day and I
felt like I knew something. I don't know.

1556
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:07,580
Why am I with you? I love
you. Jesus. Get out of here.

1557
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:12,710
Wow.
It's supposed to be funny.

1558
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:17,270
Yes. It's supposed to be funny. Oh, so
I'm supposed to say something clever.

1559
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:21,290
I think the moment passed. I think the
moment past, the moment passed. All right,

1560
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,170
well that's great. You had a
nice positive. What do you,
what are you gonna do now?

1561
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:27,770
Eat something healthy.
Okay.

1562
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:32,980
Say a load of the bobcat's.
Ah,

1563
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:37,370
she hates me right now. Nia. I thought
you were going to come over and trash me.

1564
01:35:37,371 --> 01:35:40,460
That's your job on the podcast and I
supposed to come over and tell me you love

1565
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:44,990
me. All right. You know something.

1566
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:48,440
This podcast started
out with such promise,

1567
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:53,270
kind of like Randy Moss.
You know we went 16 at, Oh,

1568
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:58,040
here we go.
We're going to fucking undefeated season.

1569
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,650
Oh fuck. 18 and one. Wow. Whatever.

1570
01:36:02,651 --> 01:36:07,610
There's next year. Tom Brady
gets his knee blown out. Fuck.

1571
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:12,710
All right, Tom Brady's coming back. We
get raped by the fucking ravens. Wait,

1572
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:14,060
this is actually a patriots thing.

1573
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:19,061
I was starting off with Randy Moss and
then Randy starts fucking pouty with is

1574
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:22,790
itchy God damn beard.
What a fucking moron.

1575
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:28,520
You know? Who knows? Maybe he'll become
a great analyst like Keyshawn Johnson.

1576
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:32,630
Keyshawn Johnson was the greatest one
I ever saw were Tampa Bay just sent him

1577
01:36:32,631 --> 01:36:36,090
home. They didn't even try to get anything
for him. They were just like, yeah,

1578
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:40,910
Kesha, why don't you just leave?
Just fucking, just go home.

1579
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:45,920
What life for the rest of the
day? No, for good. Just just go.

1580
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:50,150
And then I saw him later on that night
on ESPN and he was wearing like a USC

1581
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:55,040
Jersey and he completely could give
a fuck and a, it was just, you know,

1582
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,440
then it turned out to be a great analyst.
All right,

1583
01:36:57,441 --> 01:37:00,620
let's continue with the Youtube
Shit. A loud car. Horn prank.

1584
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,490
A woman's segway crash is a great one.

1585
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,420
If you always wanted to punch a woman
but didn't want to go to jail for it,

1586
01:37:08,421 --> 01:37:13,010
you can at least watch one. Basically
Punch herself with the floor of a hotel.

1587
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:18,290
Um, and gay hipster
fight. That's a great one.

1588
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:21,690
Gay hipster fight. Evidently
that's a got a ton of hits. Uh,

1589
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,240
let's get back to the fucking,

1590
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,750
let's just try and go with some topics
and maybe I can pull myself out of the

1591
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:29,000
mud here.
Um,

1592
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,150
this was called Dick at work bill.

1593
01:37:32,151 --> 01:37:35,500
I work with a hoarder on top of that.
Uh,

1594
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:39,500
the dude seems to pride himself on saying
deuce chilling stuff that makes your

1595
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:40,334
head shake.

1596
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,600
He's also one of those guys that throws
everyone else under the bus when he's

1597
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:47,510
called out by the manager for his mess.

1598
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,080
Example of Douche chilling sayings.
The first day,

1599
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,990
the first day we were
in our current office,

1600
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:56,580
he walks up to a group of and
sees that we're doing the,

1601
01:37:56,581 --> 01:37:59,190
getting to know you banter.
He opens up with a,

1602
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:04,140
suppose it's story from his frat days
that ended up with him naked with,

1603
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:06,040
with a Manet's jar.

1604
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:10,370
Jesus Christ example.

1605
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:14,390
I like how this guy is just really
very efficient example of under the bus

1606
01:38:14,391 --> 01:38:17,800
throwing.
Okay.

1607
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:23,130
Commencing example of under, under the
bus throwing. All right, here we go.

1608
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,340
When he was told why he has so much stuff.
MMM.

1609
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,480
When he was told why he has so much stuff,
he pointed out my friends cubicle. Oh,

1610
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:34,010
when he was asked, do you mean when he
was asked why he have so much stuff?

1611
01:38:34,011 --> 01:38:36,170
I guess in his work area,

1612
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:40,510
he pointed out my friends cubicle
that had a bunch of Batman stuff,

1613
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:43,420
tastefully decorating the desk and wall.

1614
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:48,260
Someone else had Mickey mouse
stuff, uh, in the same way,

1615
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:52,220
which he dismissed as Disneyland.
Always one of those guys.

1616
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:56,770
He's like Coby Bryan.
Well, Shaq rapes girls too.

1617
01:38:57,350 --> 01:39:01,680
Remember that fucking cunt.
MMM.

1618
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:05,650
So first of all, can we get
to your friends who have, uh,

1619
01:39:05,651 --> 01:39:09,310
I can see if a female has Mickey
mouse stuff. You know what I mean?

1620
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:13,440
That's always creepy, isn't
it? You know that the,

1621
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:15,810
the girl whose adult fully developed,

1622
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,740
gone through puberty and actually has a
car payment and still acts like they're

1623
01:39:19,741 --> 01:39:23,820
fucking eight years old. Okay. And, uh,
I always thought that that was creepy.

1624
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:26,880
You go and you go to hook up with them
and they have stuffed animals on their

1625
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:30,520
baby mania. Wookiee pookie,
right? And there was just, you,

1626
01:39:30,521 --> 01:39:34,050
you felt like a fucking pedophile.
So listen to this.

1627
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:37,790
Last week I did love line with uh,
um,

1628
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,170
Psycho Mike and Dr drew.

1629
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:44,610
I had a great time on the show and uh,

1630
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,870
I was absolutely fucking blown away.

1631
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,433
Bye.

1632
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:55,050
Just the advice Dr drew gives and how
he gets right to the root of the problem

1633
01:39:55,051 --> 01:39:57,690
and then like his Hannibal Lecter ability,

1634
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:01,890
remember the number of the fucking silence
of the lambs where he would just look

1635
01:40:01,891 --> 01:40:04,980
at somebody's shoes and could tell what
the fuck happened to them when they were

1636
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:08,540
like 11.
Like doctor drew was doing that shit.

1637
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:12,060
Like some girl called up, ah fuck
it. I might as well tell the story.

1638
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:15,840
She calls up and like, Hey, you're on
Loveline, you know what's going on?

1639
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:16,674
And then she's just saying,

1640
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:17,613
yeah,

1641
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:23,130
me really hates it.
Like you know,

1642
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,730
like really hey,
hey.

1643
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:29,620
And right off the bat he goes,
what happened to you when you were six?

1644
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:37,810
And basically figured out that right
around that she didn't admit it.

1645
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:41,890
She asked if she had ever been touched
here I'm laughing at fucking being

1646
01:40:41,891 --> 01:40:45,700
molested. I'm not laughing at the
show. I was just blown away. You know,

1647
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:47,450
he asked him, he said no, she's like,

1648
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:51,940
I like the tags, but my, my cousin,
I had to go to the trier and funding

1649
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:55,400
and I asked him, I was like, how the
fuck did you do that? And he goes,

1650
01:40:55,401 --> 01:40:59,080
when I heard her, I heard a six
year old, the way she talked,

1651
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:03,460
I heard a fucking six year
old. And sometimes when
that shit happens, you know,

1652
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:07,990
it's so overwhelming that they just is
arrested development or something is what

1653
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:11,690
he said.
So having seen that,

1654
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,630
I mean maybe I'm now the, you know,
typical moron. That's what I do.

1655
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:20,380
I stand next to a smart guy for 30
seconds and then try to rephrase what the

1656
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:23,140
fuck he just said and try
to appear smart myself.

1657
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,850
But now there's a whole new level
of being creeped out when you know,

1658
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,690
you see girls like that and uh,
yeah,

1659
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,220
that was always the vibe I felt like,
can you like, you know those, you go,

1660
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:42,480
you go into their fucking bedroom
and it's like a little girl's room

1661
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:48,010
and it's like, can you get that
fucking stuff off of your bed?

1662
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:53,690
Like the whole thing is like
pink. I mean, I dunno if I,

1663
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,120
if I'm just fucking,
you know,

1664
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,910
just connecting dots now that
don't even fucking exist.

1665
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:01,990
But now I'm looking back and all these
fucking, all these horrors that you see,

1666
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,230
uh, uh, on those, the, that,

1667
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:08,480
that dead fucking old guy to
playboy mansion who have those,

1668
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:09,710
they walk around with that,

1669
01:42:09,711 --> 01:42:13,970
those stupid fucking high
heels with the Fuzzy Pink Shit.

1670
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:17,840
The fur on it talking like they're,
they're little girls

1671
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:24,660
does. Is that what that means? Ah, it's
just, it's, it's fucking beyond creepy.

1672
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:29,350
So at this point,
because of that little moment on Loveline,

1673
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:33,430
if I saw somebody and they had like a
bunch of Mickey Mouse Shit, I would,

1674
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:37,650
I would first figure
out if, if I, I dunno,

1675
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:43,150
like what's with the Batman thing?
Yeah. What's with that guy? Okay.

1676
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,280
Has all this Batman stuff.

1677
01:42:45,281 --> 01:42:48,250
Did he get fucking diddled when he was
reading a comic book when he was nine?

1678
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:57,150
So now he has this arrested development
that now he's actually fucking at work

1679
01:42:58,450 --> 01:43:03,190
any sitting in there doing this adult job,
but in his head,

1680
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,840
just trying to block out the trauma that
happened in his head. He just says, yes,

1681
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,040
Dan Nnn, nnn, nnn.

1682
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,460
Just playing on a loop.

1683
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,720
Non fucking Stop Batman.

1684
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:20,920
You know, there's man
in there. Batman. Okay.

1685
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:25,730
Bad. That's just fucking weird to
me. Do I have anything like that?

1686
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,220
I don't. Okay. Oh, there goes that fucking
theory. All right. Plowing ahead. Um,

1687
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,490
as to the hoarding,

1688
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:39,070
his work area is ridiculous and
something of a tourist highlight.

1689
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:43,820
And when anyone visits are, uh, are
off something of a tourist highlight.

1690
01:43:43,821 --> 01:43:46,780
When anyone visits our office,
we work in a, in a four man.

1691
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:50,600
We work in four main areas and sets.
No one wants to sit with them.

1692
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:55,650
He's taken the initiative to expand his
rubbish empire over the entire area.

1693
01:43:56,070 --> 01:44:00,570
The dude as a problem since our last
supervised visor tried to make an example

1694
01:44:00,571 --> 01:44:02,070
of him by banishing him to the wall,

1695
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:06,300
to a work site with no desk and
just the locker. Lo and behold,

1696
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:11,280
word got back to us that he started
a new nest of garbage by the lockers.

1697
01:44:11,281 --> 01:44:15,780
Why don't they just fire this
guy? Okay? I don't know. Whatever.

1698
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,840
It just keeps going on and on with this
fucking guy and he's got damn trash.

1699
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,300
You know what? This reminds you
guys have a haze. Anybody at work?

1700
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,930
I used to work in this
warehouse and we were,

1701
01:44:24,931 --> 01:44:28,950
we were a bunch of fucking maniacs and
all day long, all we did was break balls.

1702
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,210
Okay?
Uh,

1703
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:34,790
I've told you this shit before because
we were basically mentally smart enough

1704
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:38,570
to work in a warehouse by the time you
went third grade, you know what I mean?

1705
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:42,650
Supposed to be 10 boxes according to the
packing list. One, two, three, four, five,

1706
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:46,670
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
There you go. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

1707
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:51,130
nine, 10, 11, 12. Sorry,
sesame street, flashback. Um,

1708
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:52,560
okay.

1709
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,280
So we used to fuck around all the time
and our manager had no control over us.

1710
01:44:56,610 --> 01:45:00,060
You know, we didn't respect him. We
knew he wasn't going to win fire.

1711
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:02,280
We wasn't going to fire us.
He didn't have the goddamn heart.

1712
01:45:02,281 --> 01:45:04,170
And at the end of the day
we got a fucking job done.

1713
01:45:04,410 --> 01:45:08,040
So he decides that were the problem is,
is that we're all too fucking young.

1714
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:09,840
There's a level of immaturity out there.

1715
01:45:09,841 --> 01:45:13,800
Cause we were all in our early twenties
that we, uh, that he should hire.

1716
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:18,470
He hired this 38 year old guy.
MMM.

1717
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:20,800
I actually remember his name,
but I'm not going to,

1718
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:25,430
I don't name names on this shit. And uh,
Jesus Christ, that fucking guys almost 60,

1719
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:30,450
he was like 38 and that was
22 fucking years ago. He's 60

1720
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:34,510
what the fuck?
So anyways,

1721
01:45:34,511 --> 01:45:39,511
this guy drove a fucking Sky Blue
Chevy cavalier station wagon,

1722
01:45:40,241 --> 01:45:44,650
four door bare bones,
factory fucking rims.

1723
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:48,790
The car was like three years old.
He had 8,000 miles on it,

1724
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:50,943
all right?

1725
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:55,270
And this guy was a Weirdo and
he had these fucking glasses,

1726
01:45:55,271 --> 01:46:00,250
these black frame glasses that nobody
wore in the eighties so we immediately

1727
01:46:00,251 --> 01:46:03,910
started calling him
woody. We'd be, hey woody,

1728
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,540
how many boxes we get over there?
And this guy was just bizarre.

1729
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,680
And he'd come home, why call me woody?
You are you trying to bring me down?

1730
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:12,770
He kept saying,
you're trying to bring me down.

1731
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:15,680
Then I already tell this fucking story.
This sounds oddly familiar to me.

1732
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:21,030
So we would just fuck with them.
We would just be like, okay,

1733
01:46:21,031 --> 01:46:24,890
at four 31 today, everybody
just start going, what do
you, what do you, what do you,

1734
01:46:24,891 --> 01:46:26,840
what are you in? That's what
we would do. He would be

1735
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:32,160
picking orders down in the,
in the warehouse area.

1736
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:34,890
And we would all be picking orders
with them. And then out of nowhere

1737
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,680
we would just start going, woody,
woody, woody, woody, woody,

1738
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:43,380
top of our fucking lungs.
I know it's fucking am as sophomores,

1739
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:48,840
but it would fit. And what? We wouldn't
say it to him, we would just fucking be,

1740
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:52,560
it was really passive aggressive cause
he already talked to management about us

1741
01:46:52,561 --> 01:46:55,940
calling him woody. So it's
like, dude, we're not calling
you. Woody would just go on

1742
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:57,260
woody, woody, woody, woody, woody,

1743
01:46:57,530 --> 01:47:01,910
look in your vicinity. So we do the
same thing and trying to bring me down.

1744
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:02,631
You're trying to break me down.

1745
01:47:02,631 --> 01:47:05,770
So eventually we haze this guy so
much that he fucking quit, right?

1746
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:08,720
He and his little Chevy cavalier
of fucking four doors, sky blue,

1747
01:47:08,721 --> 01:47:12,830
bare bone station wagon drove right out.
And the back of my head I was like,

1748
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:15,170
you know what? I've got a bad feeling
that motherfuckers coming back.

1749
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,210
It was about right around the time
when people first started going postal.

1750
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,390
So it wasn't enough that that we
actually drove this guy out of work.

1751
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:28,060
What are they fucking maniacs
I worked with somehow.

1752
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:33,150
Got The guys home phone number and the
following week he still didn't have a job

1753
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:37,180
and he picked up the
phone. He's like, hello.

1754
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:40,030
And there was 10 of us standing
around the phone and we all go,

1755
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:40,953
Ooh.

1756
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:49,010
And I always pictured him slamming the
phone down and then looking up like that

1757
01:47:49,011 --> 01:47:52,730
dude in a clockwork work orange when he
realizes the dude who came and fucking

1758
01:47:52,731 --> 01:47:56,870
kick the shit out of him and
raped his wife came back. Um,

1759
01:47:56,871 --> 01:47:58,580
that's kind of an ugly story,
isn't it?

1760
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:00,600
Yeah.

1761
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:00,810
You know,

1762
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:03,900
for as much as people sit there and they
talk about this cyber bullying and all

1763
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:06,030
this type of shit and how
fucking horrible it is,

1764
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,830
which it is obviously a,
you know,

1765
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:12,810
I don't like how everybody tries
to act like they were a victim.

1766
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:17,340
Well, I mean, weren't you a
little bit of both? Cause I,

1767
01:48:17,341 --> 01:48:19,820
I know I used to get bullied.

1768
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:25,060
Jesus Christ walking up the street
looking like fucking that kid on the, uh,

1769
01:48:25,061 --> 01:48:28,460
the family Griffith with the fuck is that?

1770
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:35,110
Hello? Andy Griffith? How did I
come up with the family Griffith?

1771
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:40,160
Ah, my fucking brain is
mush. Um, yeah, people,

1772
01:48:40,161 --> 01:48:42,470
you immediately came walking up
the street and my fucking mind,

1773
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,330
my hair was orange when I was growing up.

1774
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:48,370
I think I didn't get the shit kicked
out of me, you know, but then, you know,

1775
01:48:48,371 --> 01:48:51,400
I got a little bit bigger.
I've got a couple more freckles.

1776
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:54,580
I got got some more confidence and I
just started picking on kids who were a

1777
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,570
younger than I was.

1778
01:48:56,350 --> 01:49:00,310
So now whenever I see
those God damn stories,

1779
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:05,990
mmm. I, I just, I don't know. I,

1780
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,380
I see both sides of it.
I just see like, yeah,

1781
01:49:08,381 --> 01:49:09,580
you shouldn't have fucking done that.

1782
01:49:09,581 --> 01:49:14,330
But I don't judge the bully
because I did shit like that. No,

1783
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,390
you guys didn't do shit like that.
Yeah. Go Fuck Yourself. All right.

1784
01:49:17,391 --> 01:49:19,730
Why don't you guys, do you know what?
That's the theme of this whole podcast.

1785
01:49:19,731 --> 01:49:24,110
Every can go fuck themselves. I can
just put me off in such a goddamn movie.

1786
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:28,490
You might want to make that a
priority. Okay. Um, anyways,

1787

a half, unless I forget. Um,

1819
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:29,650
you haven't seen my specialty
yet because it was edited.

They took out two huge chunks of
material. Uh, this is my, I'm telling you,

1821

want you to fucking see it and then buy

1822
01:51:37,811 --> 01:51:42,280
tickets to my show so I can buy a big
goddamn house and have a pool inside and

1823
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:47,281
outside and then just sit there and still
be sad and depressed and realize that

1824
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:50,740
I need to work on myself. That's the
goal. People, that is definitely the goal.

1825
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:54,970
So let's hype the gigs I got this week
are coming up in the next week. Um,

in Boston, Massachusetts October 20th.

1827
01:52:00,731 --> 01:52:05,731
And all proceeds after they're done
taxing us and a pain for the theater are

1828
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:10,660
going to go, uh, to my brother's
campaign who's running for state senate.

1829
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:15,640
Uh, just to let you know. All right,
I've got to put that out there legally.

1830
01:52:15,641 --> 01:52:17,950
That's what you're going there.
That's what you're supporting.

1831
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:21,070
If you don't support his message,
please do not go.

1832
01:52:21,071 --> 01:52:24,670
I'm not trying to trick anybody. This
is all on the up and up. All right?

1833
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:29,110
And then after that, I'm going
to be an, um, October 22nd.

1834
01:52:29,111 --> 01:52:32,680
And we at the pantageous
theater in Minneapolis,

1835
01:52:32,681 --> 01:52:37,390
Minnesota on the 23rd I'm going to be
at the Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois.

1836
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:41,320
Um,
the following week,

1837
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:46,490
I have one night only at the
funny bone in Saint Louis,

1838
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:50,600
Missouri on October 30th one night,

1839
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:54,770
only October 30th at the
funny bone in Saint Louis.

1840
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:57,710
And I'm hanging around an extra day
and I'm going to go to the rams.

1841
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:02,900
How about those fucking lions? Huh?
I stayed away from him this week.

1842
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:07,320
Well that's what the fuck I was going to
talk about. You know, I did. I did my, uh,

1843
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,850
pick my three teams this week again.
All right.

1844
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:13,940
You want to know who the fuck I had?
See if I got it here.

1845
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,550
I had Atlanta first
Cleveland given three points.

1846
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,900
It's like there's no way the browns are
going to win two weeks in a row and fuck

1847
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:24,770
that man.
Genie,

1848
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:29,600
that rat cunt who sat in the goddamned
getaway car during the bank robbery and

1849
01:53:29,601 --> 01:53:34,220
then Brad and out the guys in the
bank, that fucking rat bastard. So, uh,

1850
01:53:34,221 --> 01:53:37,910
I took Atlanta. I won that game.
Then I had to four o'clock games.

1851
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:42,080
I had the Tennessee titans getting
seven points versus the cowboys.

1852
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:47,090
Right? My Buddy Paul Versey
says, he's told me, he goes,

1853
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:51,440
all Vince young does is win. And I dunno,
Tony Romo just doesn't do it for me.

1854
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:53,810
He just fails at a very,
very high level,

1855
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:57,350
throws for 300 5,400 yards
and they still somehow lose.

1856
01:53:57,350 --> 01:54:00,200
Although another one of my buddies
is telling me it's the play calling,

1857
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:01,011
it's not his fault,

1858
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:04,790
but I just felt like a seven
points was a lot of fucking points.

1859
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:08,600
So now I'm 2.0 and I'm like,
Holy Shit,

1860
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:13,070
I got to God Damn San Diego
charges getting six points first.

1861
01:54:13,071 --> 01:54:14,120
The Oakland Raiders,

1862
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:18,770
I might go three now and actually
start gambling for fucking real.

1863
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:22,340
If I can pick them like this.
This is ridiculous.

1864
01:54:22,341 --> 01:54:27,110
So San Diego has the fucking ball that
down by one point and they're run like

1865
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:29,630
Oakland's 10 yard line and
I'm just sitting there.

1866
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:34,520
I already got my arms in the air.
I'm like, worst case scenario,

1867
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:37,070
they kick a field goal,
they miss it.

1868
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:41,450
They're only down by one in Oakland
is just going to run out the clock.

1869
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:43,850
I'm going to win this. I'm getting
six points. Either fucking way.

1870
01:54:43,851 --> 01:54:46,640
San Diego kicks the Goddamn Ball.
I'm going to win by eight.

1871
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:48,890
They missed the field goal.
They run it out.

1872
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:53,690
I'll still clear my bed by five points.
And this is why I don't gamble.

1873
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:58,970
Fucking Philip Rivers goes back to pass,
brings his arm back.

1874
01:54:58,971 --> 01:55:03,470
Some defensive events slaps the fucking
ball out of his hand. It's a fumble.

1875
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:09,010
Somebody from the Raiders picks the ball
up and runs like fucking 90 yards for a

1876
01:55:09,741 --> 01:55:13,610
touchdown.
And I ended up losing the God damn bet.

1877
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:18,611
And I'm gonna tell you right now people
that right there is why I don't gamble.

1878
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,690
That's why I don't gamble.

1879
01:55:20,691 --> 01:55:24,020
So well let me see if I would
have one even if I teased it.

1880
01:55:24,021 --> 01:55:28,970
Cause if you tease it on three teen
tease, don't you get like nine points? Um,

1881
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:31,080
cause I would've wanted my
first week and I still think,

1882
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:35,390
I think I would have won.
Right. Hang on one second.

1883
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:40,550
So they ended up losing by eight points.
Yeah,

1884
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:44,370
I would've won if I teased it.
I still would have fucking one one night.

1885
01:55:44,371 --> 01:55:47,880
Don't you get nine points on a three t
teas? I should have fucking done that man.

1886
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:51,330
I would have won two out of three weeks.
All right.

1887
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:54,040
I'm going to start putting my
picks up on the, uh, the MLM,

1888
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:58,140
podcast.com so you guys can follow along.
I might even ask Versie if we'll,

1889
01:55:58,141 --> 01:56:00,240
we'll put both of ours up
and you can watch right now.

1890
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:03,630
We're both five and four for the year.
Uh,

1891
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:06,420
so I went to in one this God damn week.
And uh,

1892
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:09,270
as far as the Monday night game tonight,
who do you like?

1893
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:15,230
Who Do you like the jets or the Vikings?

1894
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:18,720
I got to go with the jets.
I just think,

1895
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:22,140
you know Brett Farve still trying
to tuck his God damn unit away.

1896
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:27,210
But I think Randy Moss,
I dunno,

1897
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:32,610
I dunno. Is Reavis back, is
he back from Reavis island?

1898
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:36,390
Fucking fag.
Randy beat me.

1899
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:40,020
Is he gonna grab for his fucking hamstring
again when fucking Randy beats him

1900
01:56:40,021 --> 01:56:43,650
again over the top when he has
no help when he's one on one.

1901
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:46,980
That was my favorite player of
the year watching Randy Moss.

1902
01:56:46,981 --> 01:56:51,570
Just skipping down the sandy
beaches of fucking Reavis island.

1903
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,800
That insecure bastard who would ever
come up with that could, you could,

1904
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:02,280
we could, when you come
to Reavis island, there's,

1905
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:07,100
there's no way to get off
unless you have a boat. Oh,

1906
01:57:07,130 --> 01:57:10,920
okay. They are Reavis. Um, anyways,

1907
01:57:10,921 --> 01:57:14,180
I think that that's the podcast
for this week. Please. Um,

1908
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:17,070
if you're in the Boston area
and you want to come down, uh,

1909
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,590
it helps support my brother's campaign.
That's a big thing.

1910
01:57:19,591 --> 01:57:21,390
This is the last second
date that we're adding.

1911
01:57:21,391 --> 01:57:24,630
So we're trying to hope we can get as
many people as we humanly possibly can.

1912
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:28,530
Um,
get down to the theater.

1913
01:57:28,531 --> 01:57:30,720
And for those of you living in Chicago,

1914
01:57:30,721 --> 01:57:33,480
there's about 50 tickets left
and same thing in Minneapolis.

1915
01:57:33,481 --> 01:57:37,260
So I want to thank everybody ahead of
time for the unbelievable fucking support.

1916
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:39,390
Uh,
isn't actually hilarious.

1917
01:57:39,391 --> 01:57:42,300
I'm playing a theater in Minneapolis next
week and I'm not picking them against

1918
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:45,660
the jets. Um, whatever.

1919
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,650
I just want to thank all you guys for
supporting me and my comedy and a,

1920
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:53,310
I wanna thank the Penn state
Nittany lions for losing this week,

1921
01:57:53,311 --> 01:57:56,490
getting their fucking asses kicked because
I'm going to be at the Columbus funny

1922
01:57:56,491 --> 01:57:59,970
bone and obviously Columbus,
Ohio on 11th,

1923
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:05,120
November 12th through the 14th and all
the Ohio state buckeyes a playing Penn

1924
01:58:05,821 --> 01:58:09,720
state and it's to be announced
but with the two losses,

1925
01:58:09,721 --> 01:58:11,070
I think it will be in the afternoon.

1926
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:14,580
I think it's official at this point that
they won't be contending for anything.

1927
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:18,450
And uh, I was really nervous at that
game was going to be at eight o'clock,

1928
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:21,990
which would mean that a,
I don't get to go to the game and B,

1929
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:25,260
no one will be at my show because
they'll all be out there going,

1930
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:29,000
oh h Oh motherfucker.
Um,

1931
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,760
and that's it. How about my Boston
Bruins? Huh? You liked that shit.

1932
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:38,240
You like that anybody can just fly to
fucking Saint Louis or Dallas and get

1933
01:58:39,211 --> 01:58:40,500
their first loss of the year.

1934
01:58:40,501 --> 01:58:45,240
It takes a real team to fly all the way
over to Prague to get your fucking ass

1935
01:58:45,241 --> 01:58:48,930
is kicked to start the
year off. Right. Um,

1936
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,960
can you explain to me why
they keep doing fucking, uh,

1937
01:58:51,961 --> 01:58:56,080
American sports over there in,
in Europe? Like they give a shit,

1938
01:58:56,081 --> 01:58:58,440
like they're going to start
buying it up like our genes,

1939
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:03,330
like every year the NFL does that fucking
God damn game and Wembley Stadium.

1940
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:08,310
Yeah. I don't, I don't, I
guess it sells out. I Dunno.

1941
01:59:08,311 --> 01:59:10,510
But if you go over there, they
don't give a fuck. They were debt.

1942
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:15,330
They were into soccer or their version
of football. Absolutely fucking, I dunno.

1943
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:18,151
Oh, Jesus. You know what?

1944
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:20,980
This is the greatest way to end this
fucking podcast right now with just like,

1945
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:24,910
uh, I came in, they, you know
what this, this, this podcast
is like march, you know,

1946
01:59:24,911 --> 01:59:28,660
in with the, in, in like a lion out like
a lamb. I'm going out like a lamb here.

1947
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,280
All right. That's it. Everybody
have a great God damn week.
I hope to see you. Uh,

1948
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:37,420
next Wednesday, October 20th at the
Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts.

1949
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:41,560
Helped my brother out. Um, and
that's it. God bless all. Yeah,

1950
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:42,460
I'll talk to you next week.

1951
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:11,630
Okay.
