1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey, what's going on is bill burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:07,670
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,030
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you,

4
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:19,900
seeing how you weeks go and what
are you doing? Are you driving home?

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,010
This podcast is a little late today. It's
flying to Nashville. You drive it home.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,390
Why don't you,
you know,

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,500
one of the things you should do is just
try to take a deep breath and just,

8
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:33,700
you don't let people in that just
makes it go by so much nicer.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,830
Be a courteous driver.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,390
Don't be a city is driver when
he always has to fucking run.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,540
You know what I mean?
I love when they do shit you rhyme stuff.

12
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,300
It's easy to remember.
They just treat you like a fucking child.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,420
Speaking of which,
speaking of which,

14
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:54,010
I just had a fucking credit card shut
off on me. Cause when I was in Europe,

15
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:58,150
I miss the fucking payment was gone
for like a month. But I came back,

16
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:01,340
I paid him right back and then, uh,
I don't what the fuck out, you know,

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,820
I left my house getting the kitchen
done, something happened, Baba Baba, boo.

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,920
I didn't get there in time and they
would just like, yeah, go fuck yourself.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,250
You miss two payments of six months.
So they're like,

20
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,910
so like if you want to reapply,
it's like I don't want to reapply,

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,990
just turn the fucking thing back on.
I sent, I gave you all the money.

22
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,480
You got it and you think you just waiting
for the check to clip and the first

23
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,060
lady said that they were going
to turn it back on, you know,

24
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:33,120
after I talked to them for like, like an
hour, not an hour. It felt like an hour.

25
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:36,860
It's probably like eight minutes. That's
an actual, it was the usual bullshit,

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,890
you know, you get on there, it's just
like, hi, who am I speaking with?

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,170
And then I always say my name and they go,
what's your zip code?

28
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,350
I tell him that and they
go, hey, what's, what's uh,

29
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:48,710
what's the name of your first gold
fish had fucking tell him that, right?

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,370
And then they go, okay,
what's the problem? I go,
well, a, the problem is this.

31
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:57,340
And I go, well, that's not my
department. I'm going to transfer you.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
And then they transfer you to
somebody else and then just go, hi,

33
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,310
who am I speaking with? It's like,
bitch, I just fucking talk. I just gave,

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,940
why did I have to give it to
the first person? Why does it,

35
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:11,500
the first person just fucking
say, what is your problem? Okay.

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,020
And then they go, oh, well
that's not my department,

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,140
so I'm not going to fucking waste any
of your time or my time getting all this

38
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:23,080
information up. By the time I get to
the person that I want to talk to,

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,800
there'll be like, yeah, who am I speaking
with? I'll be like William, you know, uh,

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,180
I, but you know, I've been
doing all right with the temper.

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,780
I've been, you know, I've been
out, I've been doing all right.

42
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:42,130
So I just told the lady, I just said,
listen, I do a lot of business with you.

43
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:42,841
But the problem is,

44
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:46,750
is I pay mine off at the end of every
month cause I don't want to pay any

45
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,870
fucking interest.
Which is why my credit is only fair.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,900
I fair credit.
Because they don't make any fucking,

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,430
they don't make the amount
of money that they want.

48
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:59,431
They want me running on that fucking
wheel until I die and I just do it.

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,640
So they punished me.
Why do I give a shit?

50
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,250
You know, so now I've got to reapply.
So I told them, I said, look,

51
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,830
I'm not doing business with
whose mastercard. I'm like,

52
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm not doing business with you guys
anymore. And the whole time, um,

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,670
I'm trying to threaten them
and puff up my chest. I'm like,

54
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,080
these people do billions and billions
of dollars with the business a month.

55
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:27,700
Did they think you think you,
they give a fuck that you paste pasty.

56
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:32,530
Freckle das is just going to go over
to the visa. I mean within five years,

57
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,300
visa is going to by mastercard
or mastercard is gonna buy,

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,880
visa will be all down to one
world. Fucking Bang. Oh my
God. In the future, Jesus,

59
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,380
can you imagine that phone call?
It's going to be ridiculous.

60
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,230
We you're going to gain,
they don't even give a fuck now.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,880
I can't imagine when it's just going
to be down to one God damn back. Um,

62
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,321
I dunno,

63
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,170
but at the end of the day it was my fuck
up and I guess they have an algorithm

64
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,220
and if you miss two of them,

65
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,370
okay.

66
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,430
Oh Jesus Christ. And now I got to
apply for a fucking credit card.

67
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,510
I don't even know how to do that.

68
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,440
Back in the day you went to
the bank and you got a forum.

69
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,670
I'm sure now it's all done online.
I'm sure I could Google it.

70
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,350
I'm sure I could make my life easy and
just fucking Google the goddamn saying,

71
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,243
but um,

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,560
okay.

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,340
I didn't want to do it. You
know, fuck it. Fuck it. You know,

74
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,150
like a Goddamn Nashville.
It's like a bike.

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,090
Maybe I could write a country song
about losing my fucking credit card.

76
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,830
I go down to one of these
honky tonks down here,

77
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,510
if that's what they really even are.
I guess they're not, are they? Um,

78
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:40,831
anyway,

79
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,300
so I stayed in this hotel in Washington
DC that actually really liked by in the

80
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,134
hotel,

81
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,540
the hotel liaison on New Jersey
Avenue and Avenue d and um,

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,580
I, I'm walking in, right? I check in and
everything's fine. Well, it wasn't fine.

83
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:59,310
The computers were down,
but the staff was just great there.

84
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:04,311
But on the wall they got this
picture of this old guy and by old,

85
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,450
I mean he's probably about
seven years older than me,

86
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:11,190
so he's really fucking open. Not like
he's not going to die soon. He's just,

87
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,240
you know, the creepy guy, Hooters, right.

88
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,620
So he's got the male pattern
baldness thing going on.

89
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,200
He shaved his head down here. I'm
just doing the best he can. You know,

90
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,400
any standing there in this trench coat,
you smoking fucking cigar. So my God,

91
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,600
that's a cool picture.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,990
Maybe they got a cigar lounge
chair or something like that.

93
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,190
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

94
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,090
So then I get the elevator and I'd go up
to my floor was staying on the fucking

95
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,700
sixth floor and uh,

96
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,610
it's just a series of
pictures of this guy.

97
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,440
I go up to the gym and it's just him
smoking the Gar is the cigar basically

98
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:45,690
trying to be the most
interesting man in the world.

99
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:49,860
It's the weirdest fucking photo shoot.
And I'm like, who the fuck is this guy?

100
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:54,510
So the guy who owned the hotel, nobody
at the fucking hotel knows who he is.

101
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,780
Then they have this giant photo of him
and it looks like he's standing outside

102
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,620
of the White House gate, like some
really official looking building.

103
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,790
And he's sitting there in his trench coat
and he's looking at his phone and this

104
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,624
is,
you know,

105
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,690
this drop dead gorgeous 20 something
standing there and like sort of a business

106
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,520
suit,
but it's like Hillary Clinton on top,

107
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:20,480
but then like a mini skirt and then she
has like high heels and she's sitting

108
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,860
there looking frustrated.
Like,

109
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:25,670
there's nothing more she wants in the
world and this man's attention and he

110
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,670
doesn't have time for it because he's
trying to figure out the fucking world.

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,200
So if anybody knows this,
somebody must ask the question.

112
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,710
Maybe it's on the Internet. Who
the fuck is that guy? And uh,

113
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,130
why didn't he run for president?
Because he would fit in tremendously.

114
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,780
But those two fucking knit weeks from
last night, by the way, I didn't,

115
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,290
I didn't watch a second of
it cause I was on the, uh,

116
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,720
I was on stage doing my last show
before I take my special tomorrow night.

117
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,300
And um,
to be honest with you,

118
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,150
the two of them discussed me
so much that I, I didn't even,

119
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:04,900
it didn't even dawn on me to
fucking watch it. And I actually,

120
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,520
I caught the end of the cubs game

121
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,690
and,
uh,

122
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,060
what, what were they up
like fucking tend to, to,

123
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,330
you know what's funny is I hate Donald
Trump, but I gotta tell you something.

124
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:18,690
His fucking hotel is the shit and uh,

125
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,410
it looks like a giant castle and I'm,
me and Bart,

126
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,980
nick went in there to drink and I was
hoping it going to be a bunch of people

127
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,020
and then talking about Trump and
I was going to fuck with them.

128
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:32,100
An actual act like I was into
Hillary, but, um, it's tremendous man.

129
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:35,310
I felt like I was on the fucking titanic.
It was absolutely beautiful.

130
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:39,990
It used to be an old post office or
something like that. So, uh, you know,

131
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,870
anyway, so I went in there
and watch the fucking, uh,

132
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,400
and there's probably some psycho
people out there like, Huh,

133
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,400
I wouldn't spend a fucking diamond.
Good, good. I'm glad you would.

134
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,060
I'm glad you would. I'm glad you
wouldn't and I'm glad you weren't there.

135
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,870
All right. There was this
Asian dude walking around
and he had like this fucking,

136
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,240
he had this sport coat on that was,
there was blue with white stars,

137
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,090
like the f the American flag.
And then his pants were like,

138
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,690
almost like what the Indiana Hoosiers
where their warmups, it's the red.

139
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:11,580
So he's dressed like the American flag.

140
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,940
And he was walking around doing this
dead on Donald Trump impression.

141
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,810
It was actually fucking funny as hell.

142
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,820
So we had a good time
hanging out there and, um,

143
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,070
I got to watch the end of the
cubs game. So now it's two, two

144
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,310
and uh,

145
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,560
I dunno,
like the fucking world series.

146
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,590
The most interesting world series is
the cubs versus the fucking Cleveland

147
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,720
Indians.
And uh,

148
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,550
I didn't want the cubs to go down three
one as much as I liked the Dodgers,

149
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:47,740
I always liked the Dodgers because I hated
the Yankees when I was a kid. And, uh,

150
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,710
we can never beat him.

151
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:52,460
So then the Dodgers would always meet him
in the world series and I watched them

152
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:56,700
lose in 77 78 and then
finally get them in 81.

153
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,100
And as I've mentioned before,
Tommy John,

154
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,640
who the surgeries named after was pitching
for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 77 78

155
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,260
loss to the Yankees.
He goes to the Yankees in 1981.

156
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:15,010
They meet the Dodgers and the Dodgers
beat the Yankees. It was like when, uh,

157
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,550
who is that guy? Uh,
what the fuck's his name?

158
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,260
Yeah.

159
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,093
Mari La.

160
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,000
He just got his 500 fucking goal in
hockey when he fucking, he was on,

161
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,070
he was on the pens and they
lost to the fucking red wings.

162
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,170
Why do I keep thinking dominant?
Kaushik is something begins with an m.

163
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,490
I'm the worst dude. The second the
fucking season's over. I forget.

164
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,470
Everybody's fun.
This is ridiculous.

165
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:44,920
This guy's like a superstar and I
haven't been able to watch any games,

166
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:49,810
although the NHL actually reached out to
me to tell me how to watch the Games on

167
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:51,210
the Internet.
And um,

168
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,550
but I was going to say the analogy would
be like when that guy played with the

169
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:54,841
finger,

170
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:59,380
was lost to the Redwings next year was
on the red wings and then lost to the

171
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:03,640
penguins. Then the next year you
went to the Black Hawks and a,

172
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,160
I remember talking about
that in the podcast. I,

173
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,950
this guy loses three different years in
the fucking finals on three different

174
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:11,470
teams three years in a row. I don't
think that that would have ever happened.

175
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,920
Jesus,
that was a long fucking way to go.

176
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,043
MMM.

177
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,730
Anyways, plowing ahead here. So
congratulations to the Cleveland Indians.

178
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,090
Holy Shit of Cavaliers
win the championship.

179
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:31,010
And now you guys are in the world series.
Just Molan down the competition.

180
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,980
You swept my Boston red sox.

181
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:37,340
Three three games to none of my
Boston Red Sox who I have not watched

182
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,770
religiously since 2010

183
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,613
mmm.

184
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,730
The tail end of the steroid and fucking
shit. I just got sick of it. Uh,

185
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:46,690
but I'm coming back though.

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,350
I always come back in October
and then they beat the Blue Jays.

187
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,560
Four games to one.
So you're going to be,

188
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,640
is could you self is is
if I was Terry Francona,

189
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,150
I do. First of all, I get
on the treadmill. All right.

190
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,800
Can you looking a little swollen? All
right. But other than that, I would want,

191
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,490
you know, I would want to play the
world series and like two days,

192
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,740
I would want to just keep
fucking moving along,

193
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,120
keep it moving rather than
everybody sitting around
fucking cooling off a little

194
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,610
bit.
So this is going to be the big battle,

195
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,510
the battle between the team that has a
one in 108 fucking years versus the team

196
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,070
that hasn't won in close to 60.

197
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,740
So I guess you're supposed to be for the
cubs. Um, it'd be great to see the cubs,

198
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,200
but also be great to see the Indians.
You know,

199
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:41,201
I had family out there when I
was growing up in Ohio and uh,

200
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,190
you don't, you know, where the cubs lost
me. I don't know if I brought this up,

201
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,780
I talked about this on uh,
the sports junkies in DC.

202
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,510
They lost me with Steve Bartman thing.
You know,

203
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,540
the way they went after that guy was the
exact same way every other fucking city

204
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:06,990
would have included Boston.
But the thing was the cubs had like that,

205
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:11,620
that fucking, you know, I dunno the, the,

206
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,140
you know, hey, let's play too.
And, you know, we just, you know,

207
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,700
you just root for where the lovable
losers they had like that thing,

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,520
like despite the fact
that they were losing,

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,760
they had this happy go lucky sort of vibe
about them and the way they went after

210
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,860
that guy, the way they put his fucking
phone number out there, I was like,

211
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,694
these guys,

212
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,060
I just a bunch of fucking animals the
same way they would have done that in

213
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:38,800
Boston, you know, lease,
we yelled at a player,

214
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,190
you know what I mean? We went
after Bill Buckner, poor bastard,

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,910
had to move to like fucking
Idaho. So anyways, let's, uh,

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,530
I'm just bullshitting here.

217
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:50,600
Let's get down to what the
fuck I need to talk about here.

218
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,260
I am in Nashville right now. I
just moved, the computer helped us,

219
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,410
isn't gonna make too much noise.
I'm doing my special tomorrow and uh,

220
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,890
I want to thank everybody who's
been coming out to my shows, uh,

221
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,600
during the writing of this,

222
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,610
not really writing the fucking
spewing it out on stage. Um,

223
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
so tomorrow night is the
big fucking thing, right?

224
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:15,881
So all week I was just almost like
wanting to just get past doing the special

225
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,070
right. Let me just set this down. I
was just looking at it with like, dude,

226
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:25,910
once I fucking do that special, I don't
have shit for the rest. I'll do comics,

227
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,680
come home with Denis leary and those guys.

228
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,900
That's my only other Gig and
I'm just fucking home. I'm
going to cook up a storm,

229
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,050
I'm going to fly helicopters,

230
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:35,340
I'm gonna to play drums and the
edit this pumpkin series. I'm,

231
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm not doing fucking
shit. And um, you know,

232
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,150
there's always a pressure whenever
you're doing a special. And, um,

233
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,590
I was kind of dreading it

234
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
and uh,

235
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,480
finally hit me last night, you know,
cause I'm never late working on my act.

236
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,760
I'm just having fun.
But this weekend was like,

237
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:59,800
I gotta get this thing down from two
hours down to about a buck, you know,

238
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,730
an hour and a half, one 20, somewhere
in there, which I was able to do,

239
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,860
but just like, my whole approach was, it
was just getting too fucking robotic. And,

240
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:13,130
um,
last night on stage I was just like,

241
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,113
Aye,

242
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,580
you never know what you're going to
say when you walk out there. I mean,

243
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:20,070
you know what you bit saw, but you
just fuck around. Just do that.

244
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,030
And I did that and I was able to kind
of get into the zone so I've never done

245
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,200
that on a special or whatever.

246
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:29,370
So I think I'm going to try at least to
be in that head space and maybe try to

247
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,140
do, um, remember to enjoy it,

248
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,150
which I know I'm going to.

249
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,680
Um,
but uh,

250
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,400
I got tonight off, I kind of
wish I did and I think, you know,

251
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,330
like I feel like the fucking Indian
soap, I don't cool off here, but um,

252
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,800
I'm really fucking psych. Matt. I'm
going to get this thing finally recorded.

253
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:52,670
I should have recorded it months ago
and it's going to be this big fucking

254
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,180
weight off of my chest.
And then I can, you know,

255
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,740
I told you my favorite thing ever.

256
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,960
My favorite thing ever is
the day after this special.

257
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:04,130
You got no jokes and I get to start it
all over again. You know what I mean?

258
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,470
It's like taking a bunch of shit to
goodwill and getting the fuck out of there

259
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,470
before you buy a bunch of more
shit that you don't need. Right.

260
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,450
And then you fucking start all over
again. Probably a bad analogy, but, um,

261
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,120
anyways,
just made a ton of noise set.

262
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,730
But I do have to touch the computer
when I go to look the shit here.

263
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,233
MMM.

264
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,400
All right.
So although even though I've watched,

265
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,080
I've watched a bunch of highlights.

266
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,703
MMM.

267
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,001
You know,

268
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:36,710
of the NHL coming up so far and what
I've realized and as Joe Barton,

269
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,020
he told me, you know, the worst thing,

270
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,470
the Bruins basically did the worst
fucking thing that you can do if you're

271
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,230
trying to rebuild your team.
All right.

272
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,190
The last two years in the row
on the last day of the season,

273
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,560
we got bounced out of the playoffs.

274
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,890
We were like the number
ninth fucking position.

275
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,840
So not only do we not get a
good draft pick, we lose out on,

276
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:03,290
I'll play off revenue money.
It just sucks.

277
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,770
And we've done it two years
in a row and you know,

278
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,830
a couple of years ago or I guess last
year when we fucking dealt everybody away

279
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,370
to clear money for the fucking salary
cap or whatever the fuck we were going to

280
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,950
do.
You know,

281
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,950
we haven't made any
fucking exciting moves.

282
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,520
It just looks like it's going
to be more the same. What?

283
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,820
We're going to be struggling
where our big three marsh,

284
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,230
Sean Sciara in Berge and Ron are
going to try to get us there again.

285
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,060
And um,

286
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,423
I don't know.

287
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,090
I,
it's less like Toronto did it.

288
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:46,091
Smart Toronto just fucking gave away the
farm shit the bed and now they've got

289
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:49,130
this Austin Matthews guy to build around.

290
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,450
Winnipeg did the same thing and now they
got this fucking guy when she looked at

291
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,560
his name and I don't even
know how to say it. Like yeah,

292
00:16:56,561 --> 00:17:00,170
I already forgot his fucking name, but
he's a monster. He had a hat trick.

293
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,110
It's like the two of them, all
of a sudden, it's just like,

294
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,990
at least the new guys that this is
this. I mean, I know it's really early,

295
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:10,540
but it's just like they are looking
like, I dunno. It's like that.

296
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,990
Another Crosby, another Lemieux,
another fucking, you know.

297
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
TEEMU Salani what happens?

298
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:20,241
Some big fucking Ovechkin goal scoring
guide that did we miss out on that guy

299
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:25,770
again? We've never had that guy. My,

300
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,750
we've never had that guy. The closest we
ever had to that guy. We had Bobby yard,

301
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,540
he was a fucking defensemen.
We've never had the,

302
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,920
the fucking guy. Wait,
Phil Esposito. I'm sorry.

303
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,300
But that was before my time.
What?

304
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,690
Since I've been watching him since Ray
Bourque had the mustache and wore number

305
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:48,610
seven and 1979, 80, 81 right around
there when I started watching.

306
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,520
We've had

307
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,960
the fucking guy.

308
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,020
Yeah.

309
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,510
Just never get the fucking guy.
I just don't understand.

310
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,590
Yeah.

311
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,430
You know,
we suck.

312
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,670
We suck it sucking at the
right time it seems so,

313
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,060
I dunno, it's going to be a,
uh, I don't know. But they,

314
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:13,380
but we do have the right coach.
So, I dunno, settling in,

315
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,480
settling into another fucking season.
We'll see how it goes. You know,

316
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,040
it looks like Montreal makes him
great fucking moves. Prices back.

317
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,730
Healthy is health. I don't
know. We'll see. We'll see.

318
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,310
I'm taking a hanging around tomorrow
night and going to that predators.

319
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,040
A penguins game with, uh, with Bart.

320
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,880
So if you're going down there,
maybe I'll see you down.

321
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,880
They get to see [inaudible] and all
that shit could be a good fucking time.

322
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,190
So I don't know how much fucking
time I've done here. Let me,

323
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,750
let me read a little
advertising. Um, all right,

324
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,710
lift everybody. You
know about Lyft, right?

325
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,760
Do you know about left?
Um,

326
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,750
it's that APP that gets you a
ride in minutes on demand 24,

327
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:00,060
seven for less than the cost of a cab.

328
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,320
Yeah.

329
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,160
Odd of, fuck did they do that? Calves are
pretty cheap, aren't they? I don't know.

330
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,840
We gotta bite him.

331
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,110
Medallian maybe that's the fucking
overhead as opposed to just have some guy

332
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:13,190
getting, hey, I'll get in the car with you
if you tried Lyft. You know what I mean?

333
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:15,860
With lifts. You just download
the APP, request a driver,

334
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:19,280
and they show up in three and a half
minutes on average. That's really fast.

335
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,640
I don't get why they can
do that in taxis camp. Uh,

336
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,470
every Lyft driver is full, fully vetted
to that 10 points. Safety Standard.

337
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,200
Oh, I take it back. This isn't like Uber.

338
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:33,110
What you fucking get in with
the former serial killer ride?

339
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,090
Is there such a thing?

340
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,640
Okay.

341
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,050
He hasn't killed in awhile.
This d they actually, oh my God,

342
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,250
they actually do a background check.

343
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,210
I'm going to use this shit including
criminal and DMV background checks.

344
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,080
You know, you'll get around quick so
you know, you'll get around quickly.

345
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,780
And safety lift drivers
are rated after every ride.

346
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,940
So only the best stick around.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,080
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude.

348
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,710
With Lyft, you can tip, uh, in the APP,

349
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:03,110
which obviously leads to happier drivers.
I mean,

350
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:06,890
nine out of 10 Lyft riders get a perfect
five star rating from the passengers.

351
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,940
It's just a better all around experience.
Bigger isn't always better lift.

352
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,530
Is it the biggest ride sharing app,

353
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:16,370
but it's the fastest growing
in the highest rated one. Um,

354
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,990
what they're talking about here is
quantity, quality over quantity. Um,

355
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,620
thanks to lift, you got an easy
way to avoid drunk driving.

356
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:27,980
You never have to bum a ride and you
never have to worry about parking.

357
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:31,970
A lot of people are actually getting
rid of their cars and relying on Lyft to

358
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:35,570
get around. And you know
what? I don't blame them.

359
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,970
Who is the I in that? Is that supposed
to be me? That's fucking nuts.

360
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,930
Maybe you could do it.
I Dunno.

361
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,380
You know what's weird is
what's great about Lyft? Yeah.

362
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,150
It gets all these drunk
drivers off the road,

363
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,460
but now everybody's texting and
driving and they're thinking,

364
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:55,970
well cause I'm sober. You know, it's a
fucking scary time up there. All right.

374
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,110
Uh, do you ever wonder
we're feeding your pet? Uh,

375
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,760
no. So it becomes a fat fuck.
I can kind of see it right?

376
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,610
Let's this gotta be a reason for this.
Sure.

377
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:44,060
Studies show feeding your pet the right
amount every day would help them live

378
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:44,660
longer.

379
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,960
But how do you know you're feeding your
pet the right amount of food each day?

380
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,780
Oh,
I see what to say.

381
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,940
Introducing hadn't at smart feed.
Oh my God.

382
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,840
These people have to advertise forever.
This is another great one. Once again,

383
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:03,580
if you missed it,
that's petnet smart.

384
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,740
Um,
the new smart phone.

385
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,250
Okay.

386
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,630
The fuck I just lost my place.

387
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,550
The new smartphone controls automatic
pet feeder that personalize your pets

388
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,090
daily calorie intake using their age,
weight,

389
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:23,240
activity level and food type.
With the pet net APP.

390
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,680
You can schedule and monitor your
pet's meals all from your smartphone,

391
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,950
meaning your pet is always fed
even when you're running late.

392
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:33,980
Stop worrying about feeding your pet
the wrong amount of food every day.

393
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,180
The petnet smart.
See Ya.

394
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,780
Okay,

395
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,260
well that's might be my favorite word
in the English language right now.

396
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:45,610
We'll feed the healthiest portions at
the right time every time automatically.

397
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,620
All right,
pets and the pet net.

398
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:54,180
Smart Feeder is the best way for you to
make sure you're feeding them the right

399
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:54,901
amount every day.

400
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:59,901
But these things are popular and since

These are there.

408
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,213
Okay.

409
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,580
You got two more.
Well,

410
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:36,310
I'm not reading those now and we can
give you a break from my fucking awful

411
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:40,500
reading out loud skills
or the lack thereof. Um,

412
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,250
so anyways, uh, I got myself
into standup special shape.

413
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,640
I'm going to keep fucking going
right through to thanksgiving.

414
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,820
Um, and as mentioned, hey,
I'm going to be doing a, um,

415
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,060
uh, a benefit. The Cam Neely, uh,

416
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,070
Dennis leary benefit, uh, in
Boston. I believe that Saturday,

417
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:09,071
November 12th tickets are on sale
and about this time next month,

418
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,120
this time next month,

419
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:15,920
the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy
benefit will be going down again.

420
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,900
I'll be announcing the lineup,
uh, in about three weeks.

421
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,910
Um, I know I got a spot coming up on
Conan O'brien, I think on November 9th.

422
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,260
And uh, one of the promotional
things is going to be that. And a,

423
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,170
it's one of my favorite
things of the year. Um,

424
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,070
I get to see all these comics that
always headlines, so I never see them.

425
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,300
And so it's become like this sort of
stand up comedy like fucking high school

426
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:45,920
reunion thing. I always get to
see his mom and Patrice is family.

427
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,390
It's just a,

428
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,790
it really is a fucking great event and a
this year I think I'm actually going to

429
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:55,970
do a little more press on it because
at first I never did any press.

430
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:56,990
It's a long story.

431
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,883
MMM.

432
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,030
As to why I didn't,

433
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,240
I didn't because I was pissed basically
because the first year we were going to

434
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,060
have a benefit in the industry was going
to put it together and it was all set

435
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:13,510
to come together. All right. And
then all of a sudden it went away,

436
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,850
which is an expression in the
entertainment business. What happened way?

437
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,060
I thought I was doing that
thing. I went away, it went away.

438
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,500
Like what the fuck does that mean?

439
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,430
Um,
and uh,

440
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,660
I'm not going to tell you the reasons
why it went away, but it was infuriating.

441
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:28,640
So I just said,
fuck this.

442
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,340
Um, and whatever. I

443
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,760
got help with the right people.
And uh,

444
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:41,170
I was so pissed that it went away the
first time that I was like, fuck this,

445
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:44,280
we don't need to advertise. And I
got Colin Quinn, I got Jim Norton,

446
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,190
I got opie and Anthony behind this bucket
thing. And I thought it was a great,

447
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:53,191
like sort of tribute in a way to Patrice
that his name alone would sell out

448
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:58,600
this, this theater, you know, the
love that people had and all of that.

449
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,990
And he was always like underground,
you know,

450
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,620
all these people that were
getting accolades, like,
oh my God, she's the best.

451
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:06,760
He's the beds and blah, blah, blah.

452
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,950
And everybody who was doing
it knew he was the best.

453
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,230
So I thought it was kind
of a cool way to do it.

454
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:13,450
But now what I'm seeing is
now that he's been gone,

455
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:17,620
unfortunately coming up on five years,
I think it's important that, uh,

456
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,340
you know, to get his name out
there and stuff like that.

457
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:25,530
So I'm just going to maybe do a little
bit of press this time around and um,

458
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,380
tell some stories and that
type of stuff about, you know,

459
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,270
how fucking truly amazing that guy was.
So before the tickets even go on sale,

460
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:37,940
once again, I want to thank
everybody. Um, you know, this, we,

461
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,290
there's people that we meet after the
show that have come almost every year.

462
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,370
A few people have come every single year.
Um,

463
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,210
and like other than paying for
the a to rent the place out,

464
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,183
mmm.

465
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,791
All the proceeds,

466
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:56,450
it's gone to his family and they've
been able to do wonderful things.

467
00:26:56,451 --> 00:27:01,340
Everything from sending a his
stepdaughter to private school and, um,

468
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,923
you know,

469
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,430
his mother has as a nice place to live
and she doesn't have to worry about

470
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:10,700
anything. So like, you know, and it's just
one of those things like I always hated,

471
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,860
I always hate it when somebody passed and
then you do like one benefit for their

472
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:18,950
surviving family members and everything.
It's like, well, here you go.

473
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,000
Here's this sack of money. Try to make
this last for another fucking 40 years.

474
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,680
Um, you know, so I don't
know. That's, that's like,

475
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,790
that's a big fucking deal.
So anyways, anyways, um,

476
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,530
I think I'm about all talked out.

477
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,023
MMM.

478
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,400
I think I've done a half hour.
I have no fucking idea.

479
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,270
If I haven't done a half hour,
I'm just going to speak to you.

480
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:45,420
The way that they did the credit card
people speak to you. It's just like, well,

481
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm sorry you confused. They said that
to me. It's like I'm not confused.

482
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,610
I'm telling you what you told me. Well,
I'm sorry. It's like you're not sorry.

483
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,430
Stop saying you're sorry.
I just started saying it back to her.

484
00:27:57,431 --> 00:28:00,300
It's like you're literally
like talking to a robot. I go,

485
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm sorry that your sorry that. I'm sorry.
Then I'm confused even though I'm not,

486
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:08,370
but maybe you are, but you're not going
to take responsibility for that. You know,

487
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,750
I was really off my game.

488
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,680
I should've like just asks to
speak to somebody above them.

489
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,640
Um,
I dunno.

490
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,080
Let me just read the last advertising
because evidently I got to spend the next

491
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,200
fucking hour trying to figure out how
to apply for a credit card online,

492
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,920
but it's, which I'm sure there's
no fucking safety risk there.

493
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,580
Probably had to go to some website and
fucking type in my social security number

494
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:35,900
and all that shit. Fuck that. Fuck
that. We should just go back to trading.

495
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,290
You know what I mean? You know, back
in the day when someone come to town,

496
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,180
and so it'd be like, Hey, is
that a turnip? And you'd be
like, wow, yes, yes it is.

497
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,640
It's like you want a pair of
boots and you'd be like, yeah,

498
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,860
I'd love a pair of boots gimme for
turnips. Ah Man, I can't give you that.

499
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,830
That's to turnips a boot.
Come on. All right, let me,

500
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,860
let me give about three and be that
guy. I'll give you three. You know,

501
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,320
these are big fucking
terms, by the way. Um,

502
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,030
if people's diets with very limited too.

503
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,060
So I think it just showed up with a
fucking turnip. Everybody was excited,

504
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,640
you know what I mean? So if he just
made that a little more modern,

505
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:13,790
it'd be like, hey man, is that an iPhone?
Yeah. All right, I'll give you my hoodie.

506
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,320
You want a hooded sweatshirt with
whatever may or may not be in the front

507
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,720
pockets, you know, you know,

508
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:25,160
there's some degenerate gambler that would
try to take that fucking what if it's

509
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:29,800
some good man? Um, anyways.
All right. Jesus Christ. Phil,

510
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,410
just read the fucking last two and put
this podcast out of its fucking misery.

511
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:37,070
I don't think I've ever been less
funny on a fucking podcast, you know?

512
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,070
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm like such a self sabotaging cons.

513
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,010
I've got this big coming up.
I

514
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,650
wasn't supposed to drink this week.
I fucking drank every night.

515
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,040
I smoked for fucking cigars.
I stayed out til three in the morning.

516
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,370
I was hanging out with Trump supporters.
I was hanging out with cigars.

517
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,500
Fucking people, you know, always I know.

518
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,110
I realized was I should have
hung out with Hillary supporters.

519
00:29:56,111 --> 00:30:00,280
They would have been more fun to
annoyed because Trump supporters,

520
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,580
they don't give a fuck. They're all
knees and elbows. You know what I mean?

521
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,850
They're too dumb to get
fucking like annoyed.

522
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,730
I wasn't even trying to do it. Actually
make great people down there that night,

523
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:16,480
but like the Hillary people are
just, oh, that would have been fun.

524
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,280
It's fun because you can, you can, you
can kick them on two different levels.

525
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,430
You can,
you can annoy them politically.

526
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,640
And then you can also be like
chauvinistically, incest, sexist.

527
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:30,160
You can just throw all of that in.
Um,

528
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,760
which always goes back to that fucking
prank I wanted to do with Patrice O'Neal

529
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:37,630
and anybody out there can
steal this if you want to. Um,

530
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,100
and the late nineties when we would
struggle and no one knew who the fuck we

531
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:46,600
were, I came so close to convincing him
to do it. And then at the last second,

532
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:49,480
he didn't want to do it.
We were going to go on to judge Judy

533
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,940
and either he was going to sue
me or I was going to sue him.

534
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:57,160
And it didn't matter because whoever won,
like whatever you need,

535
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:00,310
if they made him pay me, I just give him
the fucking money back or vice versa.

536
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,300
But we were going to go on there and we
would just going to try to see how mad

537
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:07,330
we could make her, you
know, and we would act dumb.

538
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,430
So that would feed into her fucking ego.

539
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,300
And the one thing that I knew I was
going to do but I didn't know if I could

540
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:16,540
keep a straight face was when she yelled
at me at one point I supposed to be

541
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,200
like,
Hey Ladi Ladi Ladi ladi like that alone,

542
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:24,250
she would have blown a fucking gasket and
as long as they acted like dumb enough.

543
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,020
Um, I dunno cause it was like the height
of those judge shows and just annoyed me

544
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,030
how they were always grand standing,

545
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:34,360
yelling at these fucking
simpletons you know,

546
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,060
like they were the smartest person
on the planet. It's like, you know,

547
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,390
if you were really smart and he
probably still be a judge when you,

548
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,140
well actually maybe they are smart
cause then they got out of the judicial

549
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:46,990
system and they got their
own fucking judge show.

550
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,300
But then that that would meet,

551
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,080
that would mean that fucking Dr Phil is
really smart, which I'm sure he is due.

552
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,120
Dr Phil, I swear to God, doesn't
he look like he strangles puppies?

553
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,050
He just seems like he has like
the most horrific fucking temper.

554
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:08,080
Like, he should have been one of those,
like if he ever got like an acting Gig,

555
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:10,090
like he would be like a great,

556
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:14,800
like a number sling blade when, uh,
in the end when he's in that home,

557
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,430
that insane asylum and that fucking Weirdo
I was talking to him, he would have,

558
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,130
he would have been
great. Is that, you know,

559
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,330
like I look at that guy and
I swear to God, like I just,

560
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:29,650
he probably does that Phil Spector's shit.
Remember his poor woman is, you know,

561
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:34,260
he probably sticks a gun in her mouth,
you know, cause they're on a ketchup. Um,

562
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,270
that's what he strikes me. I see.
He looks like a dirty cop to me.

563
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,900
Um, anyway, there was a little
comedy. All right. All right,

564
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,070
let's read the last few of these.
All right. Simply safe. Oh fuck.

565
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,490
I almost forgot to tell you
guys this. So I, you know,

566
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,160
I'm just sick of all the areas that I am,
that I'm in on the Internet.

567
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,870
I go to the same fucking four websites
and one of them I just got boxed out of,

568
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,010
one of them was Facebook.

569
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:09,011
I went to change my password and they
said his first security purposes,

570
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:13,520
we, we've blocked your account, we
just need some information out of you.

571
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,170
So we know what shoe
when they tried to get,

572
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
they tried to get me to give them that
my passport or my birth certificate.

573
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,530
That's like, dude, you're a social media
site. I'm not giving you this stuff.

574
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:26,270
Go Fuck Yourself. So now I'm officially
off Facebook. Um, I don't know how to get,

575
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,210
but maybe back in the day we changed your
password. They just sent you an email.

576
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,560
That was it.
And now they're trying,

577
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,990
they just keep trying to get
more information out of you.

578
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,750
Like if you notice this new thing,
if you valet a car,

579
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,570
like they go a just text us,

580
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,810
just text this number off your cell phone.

581
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,880
So then they get you cell phone number.
Um, do they have your name though?

582
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,230
I Dunno. I just don't want people
have my fucking phone up. Like,

583
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,100
I wish there would be a big backlash to
this shit where, you know, when they,

584
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,860
you walk into a rental car and they like,
how did you hear about us?

585
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:03,100
And people like, well, I was
talking to my mother, you know,

586
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:06,550
where does your mother live? Can we have
a phone number? What's your address?

587
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:09,940
And they will ask and ask
and ask until you go, hey,

588
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,420
I don't think that's any of your fucking
business. And then they go, okay.

589
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,030
And then you realize,
wait a minute.

590
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,410
So those other five things that I
just gave you, that was optional toe.

591
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,023
MMM.

592
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,840
But anyways, yeah, I'm not
on a, so I got sick of it

593
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,783
and uh,

594
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,520
on the same four or five websites,
I don't want it to Facebook.

595
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,090
I go onto youtube,
I'd be on Twitter

596
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,880
and, um, you know, football
and hockey season, nfl.com,

597
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,910
nhl.com and then one of three
porn sites when I'm on the road.

598
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,190
Right.
So Facebook has gone,

599
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:52,170
I'm done with Internet porn. I've, I've
tried quitting this, like heroin, like 50.

600
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:55,390
Like how do you not watch fucking
hot chicks banging? I mean I just,

601
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,370
how do you not fucking watch it? I never
should have opened that Pandora's box.

602
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,850
So anyways,
I'm trying to stay away from that.

603
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:07,470
So then I was thinking I need some new
fucking websites here, new places to go.

604
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:11,670
So I just looked up the top
20 in all of them. You know,

605
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:13,080
it was like Google,
youtube,

606
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:16,140
half of the ones where I was on except
the number three one. I went on that one,

607
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:18,060
it was some fucking website from China.

608
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,440
So I've actually been on their website
so I'm sure they stole a bunch of Shit

609
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,630
from me or I'm on some
sort of watch list now.

610
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,260
So my question do you guys is if you
know any decent like websites that just,

611
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,570
I know that it has some cool content
or whatever that I can go to cause I'm,

612
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,080
I dunno, I'm Kinda sick are
the ones that I'm going,

613
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,760
well I was going to say was I went
down this rabbit hole when, uh,

614
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,730
I was on youtube,

615
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,320
like I never got into punk music and I
just keep hearing like more and more like

616
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:50,640
a, like as deep as I went was like
butthole surfers, like rancid.

617
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,980
Um, I, I like those guys that like
crossed over, you know what I mean?

618
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,950
Um, into the mainstream, which I'm sure
all punk rockers are saying, but who's,

619
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,260
who's gonna fucking punk?

620
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,920
These people are applying now and this
isn't jazz and that's not real fucking

621
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:08,370
country music and all your fuck you
when you're the posters on your wall.

622
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,970
All right, I'm new to this shit. So, um,

623
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,230
I just went down this rabbit hole and
I was just kind of like, well, what's,

624
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,210
what's hardcore punk versus
regular punk, you know. Um,

625
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,430
and then,
you know,

626
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:28,320
I was watching this interview with like
one of the guitarists and rancid and he

627
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,430
brought up,
uh,

628
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,960
that he liked oi music. Like, Oh, why?
And I'm like, what the fuck is that?

629
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,350
And it was a kind of punk music. I
was like, I never heard of that shit.

630
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:43,040
And then I just looked it up and uh,

631
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,930
and I found all these fucking bands and
then it just went down this fucking,

632
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,010
I dunno, I lost like three
hours of my life. See,

633
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,640
I find this band a sham 69,

634
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,140
and they were playing live and do their
front man is fucking unbelievable.

635
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,010
Like I was watching this guy going like
this guy should be considered one of the

636
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,970
great front men through one
song. I was like, I would,

637
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,060
I would love to Bennett that fucking
show his energy was ridiculous.

638
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,433
Right.

639
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,560
And then I just started reading about
them and I might fuck this up cause I read

640
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:18,810
about a bunch of different bands,
but there was like,

641
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,220
I guess with them that style and
music for whatever they drew in,

642
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:28,290
like soccer fans or whatever.

643
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,350
Like the hooligans and then there was
some neo Nazis there and then they were

644
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,210
all fighting with each other.
And there was one night,

645
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,940
there was some big fucking brawl at one
of their shows and it was so bad at the

646
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,660
kind of almost like killed their career.
I am,

647
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,790
it might've been that band or something.

648
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:46,590
I definitely recommend like just going
on youtube and looking up all that shit

649
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:51,120
cause so much stuff that
I didn't understand about
punk music cause so many of

650
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:52,980
the punk singers could not fucking sing.

651
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,850
And it just sounded like angry karaoke
to me, like played through a fucking,

652
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,470
not like, it didn't sound
like it was in stereo. Um,

653
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,080
but all of a sudden now,
those sounds of like appealing to me.

654
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,700
So I'm kind of gravitating towards it.

655
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,180
So there's this famous picture
of Sid Sid vicious and he has a,

656
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,243
yeah,

657
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,430
he has a,
a swastika on his shirt.

658
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,420
So I stay used to always make me stay
away from the sex pistols going like,

659
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:21,910
oh man, that they will, they will,
they will like that, you know,

660
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,040
he's symmetric and all
of this type of shit.

661
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,240
White supremacists and
from what I was reading,

662
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,150
this is so fucked up.
It's kind of funny though,

663
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,900
was it had nothing really to do with the,

664
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,790
what it had to do was their parents who
are part of the World War II generation,

665
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,350
I guess rather than saying to the
children of that generation, you know,

666
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:48,130
we used to walk to school uphill
both ways. They used to say like,

667
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:51,170
I don't want to hit you a bitch.
And we defeated Hitler. Uh,

668
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,070
we won World War II when they were
like rubbing it in their face. Like,

669
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:57,070
what the fuck did you ever do when
they got sick of it? So they basically,

670
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,940
it's like if you hate your dad and he's
a red sox fan, you buy a Yankee hat.

671
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,850
So like they hated their fucking
world war two when his parents,

672
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:07,810
I guess so their reaction is that
they wore the fucking German shit.

673
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,040
Um,

674
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,120
but then what that inadvertently did is
it started to drawn out these neonazis

675
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,340
out to the show. It was, it was
fucking fascinating, you know,

676
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,710
that plaid that they were,

677
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,800
I always saw that and they put
all the pins and shit through it.

678
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,010
I guess that that was actually
someone in the royal family,

679
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,740
like that was their colors or whatever.
So then they took that.

680
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,520
So some of this shit,
they either did the exact opposite and,

681
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,270
or they just took from the aristocratic,

682
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,590
the people in power and uh,

683
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,500
put their own fucking twist on it
just to piss him off. And um, I dunno,

684
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,320
but the one band that, that I came across
that I really fucking lights was, uh,

685
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,460
was sham 69 and I'm particularly
those borstal breakout and a hurry up.

686
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:57,220
Harry was a cool fucking
song. And uh, I don't know.

687
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,960
I've tried like 900 times.

688
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:03,850
I know I missed out on black flag and
a bad brains and all of that shit.

689
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,690
I would really like, like somebody
gives me an entry level band,

690
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,370
like how are you can work my
way down from like, you know,

691
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,680
the green day level that I'm at,

692
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,070
not disrespect and green day cause I
think they're a great fucking band,

693
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:22,750
but I understand that they're super
successful and they've made a ton of money

694
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,530
so they're automatically not a
part of that scene anymore. Right.

695
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:30,250
Is that how it fucking works? I
don't fucking know. Anyways. Um,

696
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,630
I got my big shows tomorrow night.

697
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,780
I'm going to read these
last two advertising's
advertisements and that's going

698
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:37,150
to be it. And then, uh,

699
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,090
I'm going to find a sports bar a night
and I'm going to watch my Bruins is we

700
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:46,720
fucking mediocre way or our way through
another fucking season. You know,

701
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,420
I'm glad we reassigned Marshawn,
man.

702
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:54,421
I'm surprised we didn't fucking lose him
if we must have something good coming

703
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:57,220
down the pike if he stayed.
Uh,

704
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,270
cause that guy had an unbelievable season
and I missed the World Cup of hockey,

705
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:04,870
but they were saying in the hockey news
that he very easily could have been the

706
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:09,170
fucking MVP of the thing. So I'm glad.

fucking grass, that was a
fancy name for landscaping.

748
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:45,830
it's still comfortable. You
never know. Maybe they do.

Now how do you guys usually do it?
Is She writing you?

Are you on top of her as it doggy style?
Cause if that's the case,

751
00:43:51,681 --> 00:43:55,670
then we need to imprints for
knees and hands. And for couples,

00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:57,320
they customize each side of the mattress.

00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:20,150

Okay.

767
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,490
Maybe they sell it to them. You know,
try to get a little bit of money back.

768
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,110
I have no idea. All I know is this

from a podcast gone by in a month.

772
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:02,250
That isn't this one or maybe it is.
I have no fucking idea.

773
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,920
I apologize for the click sound
and now I have to shut it off.

774
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:13,200
Oh, for fuck's sakes. Come on. All
right. That's it. All right guys.

775
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,570
You have a nice weekend.
You can't.

776
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,363
MMM,

777
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,780
I'm warming up.

778
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,090
I watched that fucker game yesterday
and we lost and Nia was going to go see

779
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:38,840
lady Gaga last night and at the
last second, her friend bailed.

780
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,520
Actually the day before her friend
bailed. So she goes, do you want to go?

781
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:46,850
Would you go with me? And I was just
like, yeah, I'll fucking go to that.

782
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,680
I'll go to it. You know, I'm a comedian.

783
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,930
I need to know what the fuck's
going on in pop culture.

784
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,140
I will go to this stuff and I will
go to this thing. And she goes,

785
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:58,280
do you realize how funny is it going
to be if somebody who listens to your

786
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:01,520
podcast is at that thing and sees
you at that? And I said, yeah,

787
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:05,480
it's going to be fucking hilarious.
So I went down there and get ready to see,

788
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:09,610
you know, no, let, let's, let's tell
this in chronological ori water.

789
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:14,180
I'm watching the Patriots game over
a buddy of mine's house and I'm just

790
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:18,920
pounding beers.
I Dunno why I bought a 12 pack.

791
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:23,750
They were set up and I just felt like I
had to knock them all down and I think,

792
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:26,600
I think I had at least
seven of them if not eight.

793
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,210
I somebody else was digging into them too.
I can't fucking remember.

794
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,700
You don't one of those things where
you're not really totally hammered but you

795
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:36,370
forget your sunglasses.
You don't like that kind of level drunk.

796
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,690
So now I got to race home and uh,

797
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,320
you know, shut myself off from the
third quarter just like I'm at the game.

798
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:51,880
I just start drinking waters and eating
fucking chicken wings and shit and a

799
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,430
sober up jump in the car, drive
home, put on a shirt. Oh wait, no,

800
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:58,480
we took a cab.
That's right.

801
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,440
We ended up taking a cab over to staples
center and we miss the opening act,

802
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,440
which I'm like bonus,
cause I know I'm not going to like them.

803
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,000
And we come fucking walking into the
staple center ad right as the show starts.

804
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:16,020
And Lady Gaga comes out of a fake castle
on a horse and starts walking around

805
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:18,490
the arena and you only do that big thing.

806
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:21,520
Now they got like the big fucking half
a semi circle loop with a bunch of

807
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:25,180
fucking raven kids in the middle of it.
And um,

808
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,880
that's what started it off. And then
she sang one of her songs, it then,

809
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,743
uh,

810
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,180
then she went back into the castle and
then all of a sudden it looked like it

811
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:42,100
was a Turkey with its legs spread.
And uh,

812
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:46,210
she came out of the vagina that unzipped
it and came out of that, you know?

813
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,260
Yeah.

814
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,990
And then sang another fucking song,
you know, bunch of shredded gay guys,

815
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,140
old five, six, seven, eight,
all at the same fucking time.

816
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,900
And then she just starts spewing
this fucking self-help Horse Shit.

817
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:03,260
Okay.

818
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:07,760
You know, doing that stupid dramatic
pause to milk the crowd. She says like,

819
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:08,620
you know,

820
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,660
it's great to be here today. Lot.
They're Angelus. There is like

821
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,293
society.

822
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,530
Okay. The message out there for
anyone who's ever felt different,

823
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,640
if you feel different, no, they
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

824
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,440
All this fucking bullshit about being,
it was literally like,

825
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,440
it was like gay spinal tap
and it was honestly,

826
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,210
it was a terrible fucking show.

827
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,350
Okay,

828
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,880
terrible show. The fucking dancing was
terrible. She can sing, but she stinks.

829
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:45,690
It dancing. She's on a fucking
horse. She comes out of a vagina.

830
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,980
How many times has that been done? Why
did you come out of the vagina? Lady Gaga?

831
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,830
Let me guess.
This album was a rebirth for you.

832
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,990
You fucking hack ripping off
Madonna right left. First of all,

833
00:49:57,991 --> 00:50:02,250
she's got that one song that I've,
I don't know what Madonna's song is.

834
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:05,970
I never know I, whenever I hear it, I
start singing the other Madonna's song,

835
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,180
right?
She's ripping off Madonna right down.

836
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,590
She had a black Jesus and the
crowds eating it up. And I'll,

837
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:18,220
and at first I'm like, you
gotta be fucking, she's
doing the black Jesus thing,

838
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,850
like a prayer. Am I the only gun? I looked
around, I was like, Oh my God, I'm old.

839
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:24,973
I'm old,

840
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,360
I'm fucking old and I'm there and all I
want to do is just start trashing. Yes.

841
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,150
I want to start heckling,

842
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,060
which I did a couple of times and Nia
just gave me the look and I was like,

843
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,830
I can't ruin this for her.

844
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,550
She was going to go here with somebody
else who's going to be waving glow sticks

845
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,710
and I agreed to come here.
I can't be a cunt. So, um,

846
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,050
I'm not glad you guys sat down
after the first fucking song.

847
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,190
And uh,
it was really difficult to listen to.

848
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,890
It was really fucking annoying.

849
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,560
Way More knowing that I
thought I was going to be,

850
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,150
I thought that was gonna be all right.
You know,

851
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,680
it's still going to be on some level.
Appreciate it. This is pop shit.

852
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,290
I can try to come here and
enjoy this shit. And it was,

853
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,640
it just really wasn't a good show.

854
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,630
I can't fucking,

855
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:13,600
okay.

856
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,550
Oh with the stupid dramatic pauses.

857
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,880
Why does singers always have to look up
in the air halfway through a sentence

858
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,980
and just get another applause break.

859
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,400
I saw a band the other night in this
little fucking club and the guy was doing

860
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:30,050
that. He was like, you know,
this is the first time.

861
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,370
Then he looks up to ceiling
and it's just dead silence.

862
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,430
And then the crowd always
gives into the fucking silence.

863
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,580
I don't know if they feel uncomfortable
with and they just feel they have to

864
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:42,400
fill it up by going woo.

865
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,540
And then the guy finishes the sentence
that we'd been in Los Angeles in three

866
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:51,620
years. It's like, why couldn't
you just complete that sentence?

867
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,930
Why couldn't you just go, hey, you know,

868
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:58,830
this is the first time we've been in Los
Angeles for La for like three years and

869
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,190
we're happy to be back cause
you guys are great feds.

870
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,980
You could do that and like fucking,
what was that?

871
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,510
How long did it take me to say that? 3.5
seconds. It takes him like 30 seconds.

872
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,393
Okay.

873
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,060
Los Angeles is a city.

874
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,240
Yeah.

875
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,880
That's on the west coast of
this country and you know,

876
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:26,160
oh was fucking horrible. So
anyways, Lady Gaga is on stage.

877
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:31,260
I can't believe I have this fucking
story. I feel like I dreamed it. Um,

878
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,610
okay.

879
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,390
She just goes, she's finishes another
one, her fucking horseshit songs.

880
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:41,470
I think at that point she was like
dry humping a Yak to protest, uh,

881
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,950
some sort of Middle Eastern thing.
I don't know what the fuck was going on.

882
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,840
And by the way,

883
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,030
her drama was the shit and I really
would have enjoyed watching him,

884
00:52:51,031 --> 00:52:55,230
but he appeared to be in the dungeon
section inside the fucking castle.

885
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,310
Cause God forbid there's somebody else
out on the fucking stage taken away from

886
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:02,390
your fucking horse shit. Oh
my God. And then she has,

887
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,680
she had two plants in the crowd

888
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,940
to clear fucking plant.

889
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:11,870
She calls some fucking young gay kid
on the crowd and tells him it's okay.

890
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:14,630
And the kid starts fucking cause like,
how did you get his number?

891
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:19,580
When did you get his number?
How do they have a miked up?

892
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,440
How can I hear this guy clear as fucking
day talking into a fucking cell phone

893
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,930
that's on through the roof of
the staple center to outer space,

894
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:32,250
back down to the fucking through the
roof again to lady Gaga who's got drapes

895
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:36,990
around her fucking head.
Right. Crowds eat it up like,

896
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,470
oh my God, she's a sate look
at her reaching out. Right.

897
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,240
And then the worst part was she sitting
there dancing around and she's only a

898
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:48,720
little bit better dancer than I am and
I'm fucking horrific. So she's up there.

899
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:50,460
Yeah.

900
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,380
Um,
and then she goes,

901
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:56,130
where's that guy with the green hair and
the crowd get up on the stage, you know,

902
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:58,340
cause she's so down to earth and the dude,

903
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:02,670
the green hair dude gets up on the
fucking stage. Shortlists shredded, right.

904
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:04,050
So right there, you know, it's a plant,

905
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,540
although there were a lot of gay guys
there and gay guys are always fucking

906
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,180
shredded. So I'll give him
the benefit of doubt on that.

907
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,900
So the shirtless fucking shredded
dude with the green hair gets on,

908
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:16,080
runs up the runway,
doing his best to act like he's shocked.

909
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,190
Okay.

910
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,610
And then they go into this fucking
dance routine and this dude knows,

911
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:21,760
okay,

912
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,760
every fucking move right down to when
to leave with the other dancers and walk

913
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:29,320
into the castle. It's like, why
is he going into the castle?

914
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:32,290
I thought he was just to some random
guy you pulled out of the fucking crowd.

915
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,540
Should he go back to his God damn seat?

916
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,680
How much of a grumpy contem I
that I'm really ripping the shit.

917
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:42,740
If I was fucking I, I gotta
tell you I was really, yeah,

918
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:47,340
I was really disappointed.
I felt like I put myself in the,

919
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:50,940
in the head space where I could enjoy
this. I was already seven beers in.

920
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,940
I grabbed a little bit.
I'm Mcdonald's on the way in,

921
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,990
had a quarter pounder with cheese, French
fries. I'm like, all right, let's see. Uh,

922
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,680
let's see this fucking, let's
see this. I know she can sing,

923
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,320
so it should be halfway
decent. Didn't it just was, oh,

924
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,290
and in the songs and then just
sitting there with fucking,

925
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,900
every time drapes around her face.
It's like,

926
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:14,900
when are you just going to
accept your nose? We get it.

927
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:17,750
You don't like your nose but you're
afraid to get a nose job cause you think

928
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:19,610
it's going to change the
sound of your voice just well,

929
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,580
when are you get you sitting there
telling all these young gay kids,

930
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,240
it's okay that they're different.
It is.

931
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,490
You can't even accept your face walking
around like that chick from the ring.

932
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,430
Yeah.
Hair all in your God damn face.

933
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,160
Fucking awful.

934
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:37,540
Yeah.

935
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:41,230
If finished it every song and then she
just sit there all wrapped and drapes in

936
00:55:41,231 --> 00:55:45,590
the being only
breathing into the mic,

937
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:48,440
which was super fucking annoying.
Then she was like,

938
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,990
I hope you guys are
having a good time tonight

939
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,110
cause if you're not,
I don't give a fuck.

940
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,110
I said, I don't give a fuck,
fuck. And whole crowd goes nuts.

941
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,190
Then she proceeds to give a fucking
speech about how much she doesn't give a

942
00:56:07,191 --> 00:56:08,024
fuck.

943
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:08,760
Okay.

944
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,110
Goes over to another shredded gay
guy. Fucking backup dancer. You know,

945
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:17,460
hey fucking soliloquy. Do you, do you give
a fuck? He's like, I don't give a fuck.

946
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,923
I think,

947
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:27,970
I think that's when I heckled and I got
my first dirty look from Dhea because

948
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,130
it's literally like, you know,
if you don't give a fuck,

949
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,080
get on with the not giving
a fuck, why would you stop
and give a speech? You know,

950
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,120
that's something I've learned in life is
if you don't give a fuck, you just, you,

951
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,040
you, you don't say you don't give a fuck.
If you don't give a fuck other people,

952
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,750
they recognize it and they say it for you.
Hey Dude, you know, you know that kid,

953
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:51,780
uh, you know, like Kid Mike. Yeah, yeah,

954
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,880
I'd do that kid that he doesn't
give a fuck seriously, that cute.

955
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:58,750
And then you tell the fucking story. But
Mike isn't walking around gone, you know,

956
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,270
telling everybody that
he doesn't give a fuck.

957
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,010
She clearly gives a fuck.
She gives a fuck how she looks.

958
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:08,450
I don't think she likes the way she looks.

959
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:12,380
And I think that that's why she fucking
walking around with an Afghan or fucking,

960
00:57:12,381 --> 00:57:16,790
I don't know what you call it,
upholstery. Oliver fucking face.

961
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,890
I Dunno. Whatever will should, I just
enjoyed that. They, they, they, they,

962
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,200
I don't know if with the fucking,

963
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,920
I dunno what I was really, I
mean, as dumb as this sounds,

964
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,830
I went there with some sort of
expectations and I just, you know,

965
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,800
I thought the drama was the best
part of the fucking show. And he was,

966
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:38,920
he was in a castle and I couldn't
fucking see him granted his,

967
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,980
his drum strix with lit up so I could
seek some of this shit that he was doing.

968
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:48,340
But uh, I dunno. And then
there was some sort of,

969
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:50,050
there was some sort of story going on.

970
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,560
I felt like they were like workshopping
a musical and they didn't really have

971
00:57:53,561 --> 00:57:57,400
the full story. They just kept
being this face that would glow up.

972
00:57:57,401 --> 00:58:00,490
And it was lady Gaga is,
and she would just be speaking monotone,

973
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:01,900
like she was some sort of Zombie,

974
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,290
which I guess was supposed to
give it some sort of depth.

975
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:10,410
Can you guys believe that if somebody's
44 going to be 45 is wasting this much

976
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:15,940
time talking about how I was disappointed
at a lady Gaga concert as if that

977
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:20,941
fucking show in any shape or form was
designed to appeal to some fucking

978
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:24,930
redheaded cont like
make, you know, whatever.

979
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,930
I had to get that out because there's a
chance in the end might be coming down

980
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:33,931
to the podcast and I did a real good
job not taking the piss out of that show

981
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:39,220
when I was there and not ruining
it for, but, uh, anyways,

982
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,870
fucking, it was really
bad. You know what I mean?

983
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,560
Even Madonna concerts back
in the fucking day. Oh,

984
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:52,530
that was another thing that she fucking
said she was going like, you know,

985
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:57,450
when I started out, uh, dramatic pause,

986
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:01,740
people didn't think that I could
bring the underground gay scene to the

987
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,550
mainstream. You know, it's like,
why are you ignoring Madonna?

988
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,620
Didn't Madonna do that like 20 years ago?

989
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,950
Then the village people kind of start it.

990
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,840
You know what's funny about
like it was so, it was,

991
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:18,430
that shit was so fucking
underground in the 70s,

992
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:21,130
right into the 80s that morons like,

993
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,930
didn't know that like half the people
you were listening to were gay. Yeah. No.

994
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:30,530
Even though like you'd be listening
to a band called Queen and the guy's

995
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:31,670
prancing around.

996
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,130
Yeah.

997
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,620
In his, in fucking why don't know
what the diapers, adult diapers,

998
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:40,750
I don't know what he was doing walking
around barefoot. You still like the music?

999
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:41,980
You didn't, you still in? No,

1000
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,670
I watched the other day I was
watching this Judas priest concert.

1001
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,230
Uh,

1002
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,830
I forget where the fuck they were.
It was like in the early eighties

1003
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:57,100
and Rob Halford is coming out
like in like literally a king,

1004
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,133
like

1005
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,480
sn,
this s and m outfit

1006
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,790
and he had no fucking idea.

1007
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,563
MMM.

1008
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,420
I know. There's like 20 guys like
that. It was still underground,

1009
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,440
but like that Madonna's shit when
she know the El Ed Vogan crap.

1010
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,620
That was like 20, almost 25 years
at this point. So I don't know.

1011
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,740
I think that's just what it is.
I think I'm just an old fucking guy.

1012
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,850
And I imagine when I was watching
whatever the fuck I was watching,

1013
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:24,684
they were all going through.

1014
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,860
Zeplin did this like 15 years ago as I'm
sitting there freaking out watching a

1015
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:30,090
band called Cinderella.

1016
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,060
I think that was the point of it.
No offense to lady Gaga fans.

1017
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,390
I think I just realized how
fucking old day was all right.

1018
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,300
And I just watched my team loses.

1019
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:52,110
[inaudible]

1020
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,500
Hey, what's going on? It's bill.

1021
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:57,520
And this is the Monday morning podcast
for the week of October something.

1022
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,500
What is it, the 20th? I
believe it's the 20th. Um,

1023
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,560
I'm actually in Phoenix
international airport connecting,

1024
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,880
trying to get back to la after a A.
I had a great weekend out in Austin,

1025
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:16,030
Texas at the Cap City comedy club and I
want to thank everybody who came out to

1026
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:20,610
my shows. Crowds were ridiculous.
Just uh, just awesome crowds.

1027
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,380
I wasn't one ass told him
the whole week. Um, I dunno.

1028
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,570
Definitely, definitely going
to be coming back. Um, Ellen,

1029
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,870
thanks to Dudley and Bob to the radio
show that let me pour myself out the

1030
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:38,090
entire week. So I could get some
fannies in the seats. And, um,

1031
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:43,760
and with that, here's the podcast at
that beginning stunk something like,

1032
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:48,660
I, I've just lost an election. I want to
thank everybody who helped me out and,

1033
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:53,430
uh, this isn't over. We're going to
regroup and we're going to be book.

1034
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,400
Um, what the fuck? So anyways, as many,

1035
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:04,260
you know, I'm a huge fan of all Boston
sports growing up outside the city.

1036
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:09,110
And last night my red sox lost
game seven to the, uh, the devil,

1037
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,590
the race of the fuck they call themselves
now because those are the devil to

1038
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:16,980
mean. Can somebody from Tampa please
explain to me why you dropped devil,

1039
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,650
devil rays, the name of
a sting ray. You know,

1040
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,750
did some sting rays get together
and find it offensive? Um,

1041
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,720
anyways, uh, congratulations.
Spelled uh, the,

1042
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,590
the race fans keep wanting to say
devil rays, uh, you know, definitely.

1043
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:39,360
What a better team. Um, I
dunno man, you guys would just,

1044
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,130
just, just fucking, just too
good. You were just too good.

1045
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,840
Pitching was ridiculous.

1046
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,530
You got a bunch of young studs
on there and you know what?

1047
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,680
I hope you can hold onto
them for when rich as teams,

1048
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:55,980
like the red sox start buying people up
because that's what the fuck is wrong

1049
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:59,400
with baseball because you
waited long enough down there.

1050
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:01,530
You should have a good team.
You should have it for a while.

1051
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:06,420
Much as it's going to stop. Fuck
that. We'll be back next year. Um,

1052
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,770
but anyways, you know something. Yeah,
this is great. You guys got a great team.

1053
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:14,700
But you know when you do have to get rid
of, you don't have to, just a suggestion.

1054
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,420
Uh,
the fucking cow bells.

1055
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,210
That was really a, I don't know. You know,

1056
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,280
I was willing to look the other way that
every time I saw the d raise on TV for

1057
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,610
the last fucking 10 years,

1058
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:33,150
there was eight people in the crowd and
now all of a sudden you guys are good

1059
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:35,610
and everybody shows up.
I was willing to look the other way,

1060
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:36,570
cause I'm not gonna lie to you.

1061
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,600
I didn't want yourself the game for
about eight years until last year.

1062
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,820
So everybody does that.
But the cow bells,

1063
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:50,450
I've nothing screams expansion
team like noise makers.

1064
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,980
You know what I mean? It's
just like, you know what,

1065
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:57,450
our fans are so fucking lame that
even when this place is sold out,

1066
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,020
we have to give them noisemakers
like it's fucking new years.

1067
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:05,160
You know what I mean?
And it really doesn't hurt the other team.

1068
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,360
It's sort of a noise.

1069
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:10,470
Everybody you notice last night you're
starting pitcher was wearing earplugs.

1070
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,420
I never
just as a sports fan,

1071
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:19,380
I don't understand like how the UN,

1072
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,860
I understand annoying the batter
with the fucking cow bells,

1073
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:28,810
but the picture can hear it too. No
one wants to hear that. You know?

1074
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,660
They really don't.
But you know what?

1075
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,490
I'll give you a pass because
you were an expansion team.

1076
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:38,120
The team that I will not give a pass to
is the California angels of Anaheim and

1077
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:41,920
just north of San Diego,
but fucking south of Sacramento.

1078
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:46,870
Whatever they call themselves with
those funders sticks. I don't know.

1079
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,390
It's just really gay.
You know,

1080
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:54,190
people should know you're in the stands
just because of you vocally when you

1081
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:59,110
have to, you know. I mean, how did
that work out there, Angel Fan?

1082
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:02,680
Did you literally get down on your knees
and below those things up yourself?

1083
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,080
I end up being a bit of a jerk and it
has nothing to do with the socks loosen.

1084
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:12,160
And it actually has to do with the fact
that I stuck around Texas for an extra

1085
01:06:12,161 --> 01:06:14,220
day because,
uh,

1086
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,890
I drove over to Houston and went
to a fucking Texans game by myself.

1087
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:23,350
It's just pathetic. I
Dunno. I got this OCD thing.

1088
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:28,351
I got to go to every fucking team stadium
and I think I'm over it cause I was

1089
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,570
really sitting there and the Holiday
Inn last night thinking, you know,

1090
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:32,740
I could've been home right now,

1091
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,670
but I didn't because I
decided to stay an extra day,

1092
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:41,560
blow a couple of hundred bucks and watch
the Houston Texans play the Detroit

1093
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:46,561
lions because everybody knows what a
fucking pivotal game that is in the middle

1094
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,640
of October. What a moron.
Um, so anyway, hey,

1095
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:55,120
let's start a new topic on the
podcast and knowing things in sports.

1096
01:06:55,150 --> 01:07:00,040
I'm going to start it off. Okay. I
already trashed, sorted, trashed.

1097
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,440
I definitely trust the
angel fence, but, uh,

1098
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,470
I'm gonna say noisemakers I'm
going to start off like that.

1099
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:10,240
I think they're fucking stupid or
unnecessary and they make your fans look

1100
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,560
amateurish. You know what I'm
saying? Um, but just to be fair,

1101
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:18,790
I will throw my own team under the
bus because I love the red sox.

1102
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,470
I love their fans,

1103
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,860
but when they start singing sweet
Caroline during the seventh inning,

1104
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,770
Eh, uh, I dunno,

1105
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,310
I just want the green monster to
fall on every person who's singing.

1106
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,650
I would just like to gather
up everyone in the crowd,

1107
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,300
make them stand under the green monster
and then somehow push it over on top of

1108
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:43,630
them. And you know what
I'm actually going to say,

1109
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:47,890
I think that's worse than noisemakers
the singing of that awful song.

1110
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,720
The song is so bad to begin with. And
then when the whole crowd goes boom, boom,

1111
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:57,580
boom, it just really makes me want
to slit my wrist. Uh, what else?

1112
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:02,110
What other ones
the fuck else bugs me.

1113
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,810
I'd say the Yankees when they do that,
when the,

1114
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:09,100
the grounds crew dancers to why MCA,

1115
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,870
which was cute at first,

1116
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:14,260
but it wasn't not like a big thing when
disco came back in the late nineties for

1117
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,700
half a second. Uh, it's kind of over.

1118
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:22,030
So why don't you pick a bad eighties
heavy metal to like rock me like a

1119
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:28,580
hurricane or whatever. I Dunno. I got
fucking nothing. I got nothing this week.

1120
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,630
You know what I got?
I got exactly what my cell phone has.

1121
01:08:31,631 --> 01:08:34,690
They got one bar right now.
It's exactly what I have.

1122
01:08:34,691 --> 01:08:38,870
So I don't want to get on with the,
uh, the questions for the week. Um,

1123
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,740
and the underrated over rate and all that.
If you knew him like podcast,

1124
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:47,720
this is what I do. I babble
in airports and um, Oh hey,

1125
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:51,520
you know what I just did about
five minutes ago when I was in, um,

1126
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:56,000
I hate when people do that. Did you hear
that? The only security guys were fine.

1127
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:58,730
They have their walkie talkie and
they got it turned down to 10.

1128
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:03,810
So you can't even hear what
they're saying. The Guy, he
can't even understand it.

1129
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:08,390
He just walks by and here
it's like I got it.

1130
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,420
Your important people need to
know where you are at all times,

1131
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,990
bunch to turn it down to eight
for the rest of us. So anyways,

1132
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:20,000
I was dining in the flux man
and place tab or nothing.

1133
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,530
They'll Tequila airport and Mexican food,

1134
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,780
which is some of the fattest
Mexican food that you can have.

1135
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:31,730
I think because it's a sort of fast
food and it's made by white people. So

1136
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,480
white people, the makers
of Mcdonald's. So anyways,

1137
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:39,260
I'm in there and there's some fucking
asshole at the bar talking unbelievably

1138
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:41,090
loud on his cell phone.

1139
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,170
And I do what I usually do.

1140
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,630
I rather than just addressing the guy,

1141
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,080
I go passive aggressive.

1142
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:57,160
First thing I do is I just let a
couple of Jesus Christ shut up,

1143
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:02,270
you know, kind of do that. And you know,
or if he's, if he's going like, yeah,

1144
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:05,480
yeah, yeah, I'll kind of go, yeah,
I'll do one Yaffe really loud.

1145
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,940
And I was sitting there going like,

1146
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:14,320
why don't I just tell him the guy that
he's fucking yelling and I'm thinking

1147
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:19,520
because I'm an angry person and I'll
sound like a dick and I might end up

1148
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:22,880
getting into a fistfight.
And then I started thinking to myself,

1149
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,560
this guy is not going to be,

1150
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,890
what was the last time you saw a
fist fight in a fucking airport?

1151
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,030
I gotta be honest with you. I've
never seen it. Okay. Most, you know,

1152
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:34,910
I've been reading about anger.
If most of anger comes when someone,

1153
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:39,350
when you're in a position and you feel
powerless. So in my head I was like,

1154
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,870
I'm powerless to do anything about this
situation because I don't want to get

1155
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,650
your fist fight cause I'm gonna lose
either way. You know what I mean?

1156
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,190
Once you get past a certain age,
you're going to lose. It's either a,

1157
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:53,420
you get your ass kicked, you know what
I mean? And you standing up in some,

1158
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,740
you know, you know the paper
that goes around a straw. Yeah.

1159
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,220
It's like stuck to the back of your head.

1160
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,650
You're going to suffer that all,

1161
01:11:02,651 --> 01:11:05,510
you're going to fucking win and
then you're going to get sued.

1162
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,040
I think that's why adults don't fight.
It's,

1163
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:14,041
it's the double whammy of the
possibility of losing and getting sued.

1164
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,470
It's kind of sick of myself.
Like,

1165
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:19,650
why don't you just not say
it like a fucking asshole,

1166
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:25,200
right. Just do it that way. So
that's what I did. I just said, hey,

1167
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:29,810
any kind of looked over. I
just said, I said, you get
kind of shouting. I said, Oh,

1168
01:11:29,811 --> 01:11:34,790
I'm sorry. Nine. He dropped it down to a
respectable Tom. And I was like, I'll see.

1169
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,290
There you go.
See I do that.

1170
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:39,800
I always invented my head and I'm going
to get the shit kicked out. And they,

1171
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:43,560
cause I grew up and I had five brothers,
four brothers, five of us all together.

1172
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:46,770
And uh,
that's the way it went down to my house.

1173
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,690
Hey, could you turn the channel?
And next thing you know, you know,

1174
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:57,030
it was like eight year old UFC and
the battle always went to the ground,

1175
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:01,110
but the ground wasn't
sophisticated grappling.

1176
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,350
It was more just headlocks and uh,
and hair pulling.

1177
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:10,530
Um, actually no. Do we have a half an
hour? We just had a rule in our house.

1178
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:14,940
If you could basically beat the living
shit out of somebody below the neck and

1179
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:19,740
above the crutch, you could just
hammer somebody's torso. We, you know,

1180
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:23,850
we've used to beat each other like, uh,
some of these assholes beat their wives.

1181
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:27,420
You know, we don't want the
bruises to show. Um, okay,

1182
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:29,940
I'm off the beaten track here. Let's,
let's answer some questions here,

1183
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:34,710
but for my cell phone dies. Um, all right,

1184
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:37,950
question number one. And as always,
I haven't read these fucking things,

1185
01:12:37,951 --> 01:12:42,050
so I'm going to have to read
the whole goddamn saying. Uh,

1186
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,810
hey bill. Podcasts are great
to listen to every week.

1187
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,780
Don't know if you're a smoker or not,

1188
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:53,700
but was wondering how you felt about
those bullshit truth commercials just saw

1189
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:56,430
one where it's these two bitches,
Jesus Christ.

1190
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,790
It's two bitches dancing in the
streets singing. If you smoke,

1191
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:04,230
it might take your life, but if you
don't, you might beat up your wife.

1192
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:09,390
Once it sunk in what they were
saying about after about 10 seconds,

1193
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:14,850
it just filled me with so much anger
and they would say that smokers are more

1194
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:17,220
apt to beat their wives
without the nicotine.

1195
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:24,150
I hope that secondhand
cancer does actually exist
in every one of those truths.

1196
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:27,750
Motherfuckers get lung cancer
and dies a slow drawn out,

1197
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,100
painful death. What do you think
about the truth commercials?

1198
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:36,100
You know what I love about my listeners
is when they state their point, you'd,

1199
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:38,460
you'd never have to wonder what
side of the issue they were on.

1200
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:43,140
Like reverse politicians. Yeah.
I hate those commercials. Um,

1201
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,340
those commercials actually make me want
to smoke and blow smoke in the people's

1202
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:51,330
faces. You know, I don't wish that they
die a slow, painful death of cancer.

1203
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:54,810
I don't take it to your level,
but just in your defense.

1204
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:57,220
I haven't seen that
commercial yet, but, um,

1205
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,100
I don't know why they've
never been able to make a,

1206
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:04,890
the only good antismoking commercials
they haven't made was way back in the day.

1207
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,930
And you kids can youtube this,

1208
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:11,160
go onto youtube and check out.
Uh,

1209
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,550
it was just great. Act or
one of my favorite actors of
all time now Yule Brenner,

1210
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,540
and you should rent Westworld by the way,

1211
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,660
will be a lot of people
don't know about he was in,

1212
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:26,950
but basically he was dying of lung
cancer and right before he died he did a

1213
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:31,150
commercial and went on TV and
he said, hi, I'm Yule Brenner,

1214
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:36,160
I have lung cancer. By the time you
see this I will be dead. Don't smoke.

1215
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,420
And it was just like, you know,
it was just delivered with Yule.

1216
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:43,060
Brenner's typical like no bullshit,

1217
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:48,220
a brand of speaking. So I think that
that's what they should do. When,

1218
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:50,350
I want to say a few years ago,
didn't they have that?

1219
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,590
I remember in New York they had
these ads maybe 10 years ago.

1220
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,300
They just started showing people who
were dying of lung cancer. And uh,

1221
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,050
actually that was too
brutal. Oh, that was right.

1222
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:04,930
They had the guy who was holding
the odd the thing up to his throat.

1223
01:15:04,931 --> 01:15:09,490
My name is Dan, I had an
eight mile. Okay. You know,

1224
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:13,780
he was doing that shit and then, you
know, it was just so over the top.

1225
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:17,170
Everybody laughed. I Dunno. I Dunno dude.

1226
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,790
You fucking rip those people so bad.

1227
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:22,990
How exactly would you come about doing
a commercial where they're telling you

1228
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:27,160
not to smoke? Um, I dunno,

1229
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,270
I got to tell you this though.
I'm really,

1230
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:30,070
I'm really annoyed with
smokers when there's,

1231
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,900
they're still pissed how they
can't smoke in bars. And, uh,

1232
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,840
I was down in Austin and people started
smoking in the bar and I can't, you know,

1233
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:41,200
it's been so long since I've actually
smelled tent and it's fucking ridiculous.

1234
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,070
It's really fucking,
I keep getting you walk out of it.

1235
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,380
You felt like you've fought a fire.
Your eyes are all red. That burning,

1236
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,490
it's in your clothes. It's disgusting.
I have no problem with people smoking.

1237
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,600
I really don't smoke all you
want, but, uh, take it outside.

1238
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,030
So I dunno.
I'm Kinda in the middle of it.

1239
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,750
I think those truth commercials
do suck without a doubt. But, uh,

1240
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,960
I'm glad that they put you people outside.
I think that's where you belong.

1241
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,290
You know,
I think before you come back in,

1242
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:10,790
they should hose you down
with some sort of perfume.

1243
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:13,330
So we don't have to smell your shit. You
know what I mean? I'm trying to think of,

1244
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:17,110
I have a habit or a hobby or a habit
or something that really annoys people

1245
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,490
other than my general
continuous all. Uh, okay. Bill,

1246
01:16:21,491 --> 01:16:25,600
I got a couple of questions for you.
When was your big break? I mean,

1247
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:28,930
when did you really start getting
paid seriously for your comedy?

1248
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:33,340
How long did it take? Uh, okay,

1249
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:38,260
well I've had some ups and
downs there. Fellow, let's see,

1250
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,123
I um,

1251
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:45,580
had a day job for the first three and a
half years and I paid off my car and I

1252
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,730
was still living at home like a
fucking loser, but I was a smart loser,

1253
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,060
so I was getting out of debt unlike,

1254
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,690
I'm like this shit and I just saw
walking through the airport so bad.

1255
01:16:58,691 --> 01:17:00,630
These credit card companies are actually,
uh,

1256
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,090
I think people's credit credit's so
bad that desperate for new customers,

1257
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,400
you literally get off the plane and
they're like, excuse me sir, sir,

1258
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:07,800
can I talk to you?
Do you guys want?

1259
01:17:07,801 --> 01:17:10,190
And they're basically giving
away a free plane ticket.

1260
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:14,270
If you sign up for a mastercard,
a free plane ticket. Yeah,

1261
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:18,260
set up for a mastercard if fucking 18 to
22% interest and you'll buy that ticket

1262
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:21,770
about nine times during the
course of the year. You know what?

1263
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:24,830
I think I might go over there and just
fuck up their sales pitch just by saying

1264
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:29,390
it was seeing that ship, those, those,
those dumb fucks with football games,

1265
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,370
you know, they hand it out like a free
tee shirt. If you sign up for a, uh,

1266
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,390
you know, at Visa Card, I mean,
how much is the teacher? Honestly,

1267
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:42,050
even if you go to a concert, it's
going to cost you like 35, 40 bucks,

1268
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:44,690
which is ridiculous.
But uh,

1269
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:49,370
you're going to pay that in
interest every month, you know,

1270
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:53,770
go down the fucking clothes for less.
You go to footlocker,

1271
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:57,560
you eat like three tee
shirts for 20 bucks. No,

1272
01:17:57,561 --> 01:18:02,540
I'd rather have this piece
of plastic dude. Uh, anyways,
uh, one was my big break.

1273
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:07,100
I had a couple, um, let's see.

1274
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:07,963
Uh,

1275
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:14,120
I moved to New York and I
booked an acting Gig and uh,

1276
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:19,121
I made a little chunk of money and
then the acting gig ended and then,

1277
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:23,420
but I was able to live off that for a
year so I didn't have to get a day job

1278
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:26,900
when I moved to New York.
But uh,

1279
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:32,990
so I was living good in 97 and
then it was pretty rough. 98,

1280
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,340
99, 2000, 2001.

1281
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:40,520
But then I was like,
this is the all I was doing colleges,

1282
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:45,560
I was doing like 9 million colleges
grossing about a hundred grand a year,

1283
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:51,340
paying 20% commission that dropped it
down to 80 plus another 10 grand in

1284
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,211
expenses,

1285
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:57,680
dropped it down to 75 and then the
government would come in and take their

1286
01:18:57,681 --> 01:19:02,681
fucking half to drop it down to 35 and
then accountants and other bullshit drop

1287
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:06,620
it. And I was making about 30 grand
a year. So it's basically, you know,

1288
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:11,540
the cubicle Guy Shep. I was telling jokes
so my wife was still good. But yeah,

1289
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,800
I was making about after all the bullshit,

1290
01:19:13,801 --> 01:19:17,660
I was make it about 30 grand a
year for a while. And then, uh,

1291
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:23,930
I turned around and that was sort
of steady right up until, uh,

1292
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:29,540
2005.
That was the year when I did,

1293
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:33,530
uh, an HBO half hour. And
I got on Opie and Anthony,

1294
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,400
and literally the month
I got on opiate Anthony,

1295
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,910
my HBO special came out.
And then after that,

1296
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,560
then people started coming to my shows.

1297
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:47,240
Then they started making good money
and fortunately, and his continued.

1298
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,030
Um,
so yeah,

1299
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:55,090
I would say the first break came
when I made a little money on TV 96,

1300
01:19:55,461 --> 01:20:00,440
97,
and then the second time was 2005.

1301
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,660
Did I even answer that? I get fucking
bored with that answer after a while. Um,

1302
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,250
anything else I'm on to take?
Do,

1303
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,210
do you ever still to stand up for 10
10 bucks for 15 minutes? Yes, I do.

1304
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:16,940
Every single week at the firm
in New York. I do it, you know,

1305
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:21,210
at the local clubs and when I'm in La,
I do it at the comedy store.

1306
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,650
And the laugh factory in the front.
They don't pay.

1307
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:29,490
They don't pay that
much, you know? So, um,

1308
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,820
and one last question.
Oh yeah.

1309
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:36,120
Do you think it's possible for a
comedian to do 10 spots a night,

1310
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,620
getting paid $10 for every 15 minutes
at 10 different clubs? All right.

1311
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:43,650
You sound like a guy who wants to do
comedy and you're trying to figure out how

1312
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:48,590
you can make it financially.
You'll be fine just, just to,

1313
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:52,200
you know, have a day job and
just keep hustling at night.

1314
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,470
And this is a big thing.
Get yourself out of debt,

1315
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:58,770
pay off your car.
If you get a brand new car,

1316
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:03,090
fucking try and sell it and get something
quality that's used that you can

1317
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:07,930
actually pay off and get
out of debt because, uh,

1318
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,370
that's what we'll fuck you.
Oh yeah.

1319
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,800
And don't knock up somebody that
you don't give a shit about.

1320
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:18,750
That's another thing that will fuck you.
Um, other than that, you'll be fine. Okay.

1321
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,990
Nobody makes shit when they
start off and then somehow,

1322
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:26,730
I don't know what happens.
We start making money or write,

1323
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:27,720
my cell phone's going to die.

1324
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:32,440
So I think I've got to make this
actually short for once. I'm actually,

1325
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,300
yeah, sorry guys. This is going
to be a real quick one. Um,

1326
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:40,980
let me see if I got anything else.
No more questions that I can see.

1327
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,860
Um, oh, here's somebody talking about my,

1328
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,610
my sports obsession about going
to all the stadiums spill.

1329
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:52,530
I totally respect your sports junkie
narrative session and if you've got the

1330
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:54,810
means to do it, go for it. Why not?

1331
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,300
I've seen a lot more money
spent on dumb shit before,

1332
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:01,770
like a wife who doesn't work,
you know,

1333
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:04,800
there's a lot of anger towards
women on these things. Jesus Christ.

1334
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,810
Can I sound like my act. But even with
that, as I've listened to your podcast,

1335
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:13,170
it sounds like you've been to pretty
much every sports venue in the United

1336
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,780
States and Canada.
I asked to have you ask you a question,

1337
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,130
what's the best fight you've ever
seen at a sporting event? Oh man,

1338
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:24,720
that's a good one. Um, well let's
see his first, he says mine,

1339
01:22:24,721 --> 01:22:26,860
hands down it broad.

1340
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:29,760
Then if you count wrestling is as a sport.

1341
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:34,761
It was in 2000 WWF was at its height and
the entire crowd of 20,000 was drunk.

1342
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,610
18 to 24 year olds showing
up in groups of 10.

1343
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:42,540
And when one asshole from one group
would start shit with another asshole.

1344
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,520
It wasn't a fight between two guys.

1345
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:48,480
It was an all out 20 men bra watching
somebody get their nose broken over.

1346
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:53,070
The fact that he's not a stone cold fan
is some funny shit to say the least.

1347
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:56,190
All right. I've seen some
classic ones coming from Boston.

1348
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:59,250
I remember going to an old Bruins,

1349
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,940
the plan like the Nordiques of the North
Star. It's one of those great teams.

1350
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,980
It doesn't play anymore in first of all,

1351
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:07,930
I remember this guy had this
great sign and the upper deck,

1352
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:10,660
it said a quote back has no deep.

1353
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:15,070
And to me that was hilarious because I
was 18 years old and it was a dick joke.

1354
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,880
Um, but anyways, uh,

1355
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:20,921
I dunno what happened.

1356
01:23:20,921 --> 01:23:24,460
Like these Bruins fans got into
it with the Nordi Canadian fans.

1357
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:28,720
I can't remember what. So they
would just check like an idiot.

1358
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,640
I run over,
I learned my lesson,

1359
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:32,830
I ran over to look at the
fight you ever go to do that.

1360
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:36,490
Never run over to look at a bra
because it's like a tornado.

1361
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,070
You don't know where it's going to go
and all of a sudden you're in the fucking

1362
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:42,760
middle of it and there's
no bathtub to jump into it.

1363
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:47,620
So that's basically what happened to
fucking fight spilled over onto me.

1364
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:51,220
And I was literally impaled on one
of those pillows. Old yellow rails,

1365
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:55,030
I don't know. People from Boston member,
right. And all I remember was some guy,

1366
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:59,440
I don't know what he did when he tried
to push this cop down the stairs and I

1367
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:01,270
dunno how to this day,
this cop did it,

1368
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:06,640
but he literally was walking down the
stairs with this guy and he had a handful

1369
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:07,474
of his neck.

1370
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:12,760
It's like he was carrying him like
luggage and an inside of his fist was the

1371
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:13,630
guy's juggler.

1372
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:17,200
And this guy was literally turning blue
and it's the cop walked down the stairs.

1373
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:20,670
He just kept repeatedly stating,
tried to push me down the stairs. Huh?

1374
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,950
Type push me down the stairs.
Huh? In this guy's eyes.

1375
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:29,440
I thought he was going to kill him,
but I don't know.

1376
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:31,930
I don't think I've ever seen,
I've just seen just haymakers throne.

1377
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,000
I'd never seen like a 20 on 20 Brah.

1378
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:38,860
I went to a ranger's island just game in
1989 when a buddy of mine was going to

1379
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:43,180
Hofstra as back when everybody
was coked up. And I saw some, uh,

1380
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:47,110
guys who were way too old to be
fighting going at it in the upper deck.

1381
01:24:47,111 --> 01:24:47,651
And I got to MIT.

1382
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:52,450
I was terrified because I felt like a
man without a country and I was going to

1383
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:54,310
be discovered, you know, I
felt like I felt like that,

1384
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:58,480
that old guy in the beginning of scar
face, they get stabbed in that tent city.

1385
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,500
You know, I'm sitting there
trying to act like I'm, you know,

1386
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,640
I'm one of the group and I really don't
give a fuck about their cause. But, um, I,

1387
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,980
you know what, I'd probably have to
think about that a little bit longer.

1388
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,190
My cell phone's going to die.

1389
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:16,120
I'm kind of mentally in a panic right
now cause I just babbled for about Oh,

1390
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,640
20 minutes, and I'm worried
that it's not going to save it.

1391
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:22,210
So I'm going to cut it short
here. Uh, thanks to everybody
who came out to Austin.

1392
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,770
Um, so next week send me some stuff that
you find in sports he find annoying.

1393
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,900
Please keep sending in the under room.
Uh, next week I will be in town in La,

1394
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:36,850
so I'll give a longer podcast.
And uh, in November I got the,

1395
01:25:36,851 --> 01:25:41,110
uh, DC Improv and in plain
xannies in Nashville.

1396
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,930
And, uh, hopefully in the next
month or so I will be getting a,

1397
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:49,060
I'll be getting some dates for
2009. All right. That is it.

1398
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:50,980
Everybody have a good week and I will

1399
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,910
you next week.
Next Monday night.

1400
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:23,690
[inaudible]

1401
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:04,510
[inaudible].
