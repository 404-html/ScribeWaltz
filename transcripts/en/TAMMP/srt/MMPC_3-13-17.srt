00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,150
Hey, what's going on is bill burn. It's
time for the Monday morning podcast,

2
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:09,670
but Monday, March 13th,
2017 what's going on?

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,550
How are you? You know what?
I asked you that every week.
How are but this, you know,

4
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:20,030
this Monday I would really
like to know how are you?

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,650
What's going on Mandy? What's
going on with you? You're,

6
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:28,480
you're scaring me.
You know,

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,830
that's the type of shit you can do when
you were abroad. But if you're a gay,

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,480
you can't do that. You can't be
like, Mike, what's going on with me?

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,830
What's going on? What's going on with
you? You're scaring me. You, it was,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,130
you're taking by both his hands.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,953
MMM.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,550
All right. I've got an hour here to
do and I gotta be honest with you.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,600
I don't have shit to say because my
life has become very compartmentalized.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,080
Being a dad here. Daddy. Oh,

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,650
she's asleep downstairs,
man. She's fucking awesome.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,970
Anybody who says that being a parent is
hard. It's a fucking pussy. You know,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,650
I'm not saying that it's not tedious.

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm not say saying it's not like walking
around with a little fucking Kettlebell

19
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,020
all day long, you know, especially if
you fucked up on your rotator cuffs.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,760
I got to keep her in close in the right
hand side, you know, keep her in tight.

21
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,410
Tiki barber don't fumble.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,953
MMM.

23
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,680
But uh, we just sit around, we
listen to a lot of music with the,

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,800
I was listening to fucking, um, there was,

25
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:31,370
I listened to yesterday just like
they called Mulch shot oldies.

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,960
It's basically like Doo wop from the 1950s
and I kind of settled on that channel

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,450
and after awhile I wanted
to turn the channel,

28
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:43,130
but I couldn't because she was sleeping
and the remote was like across the table

29
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:47,020
once they must say fall asleep,
dude. It's just like, you know,

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't care what position you're in,

31
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,240
you're not moving because
if fucking sleeping, right.

32
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:54,260
So I just sat there and listened
to on a loop to all this

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
Dadda that,

34
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,420
but, but, but, but, but, but they book
slowly going out of my fucking mind.

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,420
Do ops great for about
four songs in a row.

36
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:09,800
And then it just becomes the same song
over and over and fuck it over again.

37
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,150
Um, I was listening to that
shit for like a fucking,

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,320
like an hour and like half of those
songs have been in Scorsese movies.

39
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,030
You know, it's always like some guy's
name and then the name of a card,

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,720
you know,

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,480
so and so in the Fleetwood's something
something and the Belmonts Dion and a

42
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,580
bell much. You gotta Love
Them. Miss still fucking great.

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,960
Okay.

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,310
You know,
the wanderer,

45
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,140
that fucking song is so applicable
to anybody who didn't get married.

46
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:44,920
You're in your forties.
Yeah. Well, on the Jab,

47
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:47,020
a guy who will never settled down.

48
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:51,230
It makes you feel great about the
choice you made until if you know,

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,940
you realize he sang it in his
twenties, then you're like, oh fuck.

50
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,100
What was another one?
You talk too much.

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,660
Talk too much. You were re
meet a dead. You talk too much.

52
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,850
At least as you've been
worried. My pet, it's just like,

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,110
I can't be the fucking line.
But they played it twice. Um,

54
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,710
speaking of talking too much, just what
the fuck I do on this podcast. Um, oh,

55
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,410
I know what I can, I know what,
we actually had a date night.

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,580
This is how much of a fucking
dad I'm becoming, you know,

57
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,830
still playing drums, you know,
schedule a helicopter, uh,

58
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,880
thing. So, you know, I'm still trying to
keep the hobbies going, but they're there.

59
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,900
They're starting to wobble
on the sticks here. So, um,

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,010
we were watching a
commercial the other day. No,

61
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:45,810
you're watching will ah,
um,

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,830
the other day and um,
they always get to the fucking,

63
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,160
the last prize and wheel fortunate
is so fucked in a touristy cheap.

64
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay.

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,340
First of all,

66
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,910
you're basically spending this giant
roulette wheel and even on the real weapon

67
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,380
roulette wheel, they got
it, you know, green zero in
Dutton, the double green zero.

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,370
And just that alone,
that alone will completely fuck you over.

69
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,320
Now obviously you guys hopefully listen
to his podcast long enough to know that

70
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:17,190
I am not a mathematician,
so I cannot explain why,

71
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:21,940
but just having those two will
fuck you over. But what's it faces?

72
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,320
The, uh, we were fortunate. I
got like fucking, I swear to God,

73
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:28,920
it's like two or three
bankrupts lose a turn.

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,410
Just every two seconds.

75
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:36,411
You just hear that fucking reverse flute
thing or they go bankrupt and then it

76
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:40,190
comes to their big price. Well,
they try to act like they're gonna.

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,200
They gonna throw down some goddamn cash.
The last one, it's so fucking difficult,

78
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,970
but we're going to get some letters
for you then get some letters for you.

79
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,700
Me Get some letters for me.
You know the fucking answer.

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,140
And they act like it's weird when only
like one letter, they only get one letter.

81
00:04:57,141 --> 00:05:00,050
Right. Then he'd be like, okay, give me,

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,080
give me three fucking letters
in a vile p f owl if a,

83
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:11,430
and then it's always like great
guesses, but you're not gonna like this.

84
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,220
We only got one letter. It's just
like, you know, do the best you can.

85
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:17,120
They always fuck them over.
But this lady, this lady,

86
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,710
she actually did okay and she won
the prize. She didn't do okay.

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
She fucking crushed it.

88
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,050
I came in to say keep your
hands to yourself or something
like that was solving

90
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,910
like, no, this is a phrase.

91
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,440
Yeah.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,510
Like who would ever come up
with that on a fucking game?

93
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,990
She'll keep your hands to yourself
with something on that level.

94
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:41,440
It's like semi aggressive slash you know,

95
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,970
date rapey and it's on a fucking
game show and she somehow got it.

96
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,150
Okay.

97
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,590
There is a point at the end of this,
right.

98
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:52,320
And she ends up winning this fucking to
see some sort of Mazda is some shit's

99
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,700
not a Miata. I don't know what
the fuck it was. Sue. Suki,

100
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,730
I have no idea.

101
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,400
It was a two seat sports
car. And um, okay.

102
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,090
Immediately my first thought was
I looked at me, I was just like,

103
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:09,830
he can't get a kid in there. And then
she laughed. She's like, ah, look, yeah,

104
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,180
becoming a dad. And I'm like,
no, no, I'm still young and cool.

105
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,910
But she was right. You know, not
becoming a dad. I am a god Damn Damn,

106
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,810
but I'm not going to
be one as douchey dead.

107
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,240
It talks about how parents who stalks
about how fucking difficult their lives.

108
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,850
It's fucking awesome.

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,940
But having a kid when you're in
your 20s and you're broke sucks,

110
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,811
you know,

111
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,750
but when you travel in the country and
their pay and your money to talk about

112
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:41,670
your dicks and do fucking dicks talking
about your Dick and do shit jokes,

113
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,230
it's not dead bed. I'm only on the
road like six days of fucking month,

114
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,491
you know,

115
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,930
let's say flying at night early to go
watch the fucking Bruins and Celtics Assam

116
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,500
Shit for our schedules line up.
Um,

117
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,200
uh, that, that I'm here and she's cool
as shit. Man. She doesn't really cry.

118
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:05,670
She only cries, you know, needs a
diaper change, wants to be held,

119
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,690
you know, it's hungry. Other than that,

120
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:12,390
she totally Chels she's
met a bunch of people.

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,660
She doesn't freak out with strangers. One
of the best compliments I got was like,

122
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:19,800
oh your kid's really, uh, cause
a really relaxed, healthy baby.

123
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:24,630
You know what I mean? Which I'm fucking
site cause that's what I want it.

124
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,710
I obviously healthy, but I want to
fucking chill baby. I don't want,

125
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,280
like, I basically don't
want my kid to be like me.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,910
That's why I got to keep up with this
meditating because I didn't do it for a

127
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,630
minute. And the, Oh, the
old gray mare, she a,

128
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:46,530
I started fucking going
back to what the fuck I was,

129
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,560
you know, like I fucking, uh,
I was trying to, you know,

130
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,900
sneak out of the bedroom because I
was going to go work out because I'm a

131
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:59,550
fucking fat cupcake Eaton dose.
And um,

132
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,630
Nina just opens your eyes and just goes,
could you change a really quick,

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,570
I just stopped and I
looked her and I said,

134
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,820
you really need to work on your
good mornings. She's like, sorry,

135
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:18,590
could morning.
And even though I was right,

136
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:23,350
my tone was just, it was way
too, you know, I was like, Dad,

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,280
uh, I always say Liam Neeson
Niamh Niamh Leeson lease them.

138
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,490
I don't know, whatever. I took
it too far, which kills me.

139
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,910
That's why I love meditating
because I don't take it too far.

140
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,930
And if I make a point, I'm still right,
but when I don't meditate, you know,

141
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,200
I'd basically, I walk
around at a six, you know,

142
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,380
like saying 10 is completely
losing your shit. I walk around,

143
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,390
I'm just walking down the street with a
fucking balloon on my wrist at a six to

144
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:58,220
a seven. So it's very easy for me to
go write the 10 unless I meditate.

145
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,290
Then that backs me down to about four
or three, which still is pretty high,

146
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,570
but it's kind of cut my
number almost in half.

147
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,670
The what kills me is when
I'm not meditating and I'm
up around a six or seven,

148
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,510
you know, it gets to that
point, even if I'm right,

149
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,500
my reaction gives them this,
this wiggle room,

150
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,400
you know, some Bill Clinton wiggle room
to get the fuck out of it. You know,

151
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:27,230
some Trump executive order thing
to go around some shit. Um,

152
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,020
so, uh, you know, so I gotta I gotta see,
I gotta stay on that type of shit, dude.

153
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:38,021
Speaking of fucking Niamh Niamh Gleason,

154
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,570
why can't it, you know, it's one of
those fuckers goes by so fucking quick.

155
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:45,620
You never really even hear it. No, Bill.
We all hear it. You don't know. May Look,

156
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,620
okay. Get this guy's fucking name
right. He's great actor here. It Niamh.

157
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,260
Yeah.

158
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,070
Oh No,
it's Liam Neeson is first names not Liam

159
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,810
is it is Niamh Lisa, whatever.

160
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,550
I'll never get that right. I'm never
going to get that fucking right. Anyways,

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,740
a fucking head of hair on that
son of a bitch. Um, anyways,

162
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,120
I saw a fucking great movie this
week. So Saturday nights, Saturday,

163
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:20,920
Saturday we go out and uh,

164
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,210
we actually have a date night,
so we'll be like, all right,

165
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,210
well go get maybe like dinner and a movie.
Well,

166
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,880
it basically turned about appetizer
and a drink and I'm sitting there like,

167
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,780
you know, I'm on the wagon, I can't do it.
He was like, oh, just fucking have one.

168
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:39,310
So I was like, all right, I'll have
one still on the wagon, you know,

169
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm not like a fucking alcoholic or I
just got to shut the whole thing off,

170
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:46,780
you know what I mean? So I had one, I
had a cognac. Oh, fucking corn. Yeah.

171
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:50,860
Can I just say, you know, I just ordered
the best one that they had, you know,

172
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:51,880
so it tasted amazing,

173
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:55,000
but it was also like drinking
gasoline so that can only sip it.

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,700
And we got like an appetizer and
then we just sat there, you know?

175
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,350
Okay.

176
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,150
Shooting the shit. It felt weird because
we hadn't been out together in a while.

177
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,430
And then we just started talking about
our daughter and looking at pictures of

178
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,264
her.

179
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,790
It's like two addicts going out,
you know what I mean?

180
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,270
At some point you're going to start
talking about blow and how much fun it is.

181
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,980
Um, so then, you know, after
that we walked up the street,

182
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:32,240
we went to the movie theater and uh,
we saw get out,

183
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,790
um, the Jordan Peele fee, uh,
film dude. It was fucking him.

184
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,390
That was amazing. It got to go
see it. I know there's, you know,

185
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,030
there's always that movie and he's
like, dude, you gotta go fucking see it.

186
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,330
And it doesn't live up to the eye.
It lived up to the hype man.

187
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,600
It was fucking great. And what
I loved, what I loved about it.

188
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,910
And what I love about all
fucking movies like is,

189
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,810
so it was a bunch of shit
in there that you had,

190
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,240
he left you to figure out yourself.

191
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,270
And I saw the movie like two, three days
ago, Saturday, and that was a Monday,

192
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:09,710
two days ago, you know, and
I keep evil, I'm driving,

193
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm still thinking about the
movie. I was like, Oh fuck,

194
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:16,760
that was this and this meant dad and
this was over here and this person's ad

195
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:19,940
like, you know, it was the perfect length,

196
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,970
the whole thing and the acting
and it was unbelievable. Um,

197
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,220
dude, that fucking guys swear to God, man.

198
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:32,960
That's like one of the most
talented people to come
around in a long, long time,

199
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,660
you know, to be that
good at like, you know,

200
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:41,330
the characters they did on a
sketch show and the writing.

201
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,580
And then on top of that you can direct,
I mean,

202
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,430
these kind of fucking limitless
as far as talent goes,

203
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,580
but if you haven't seen it
yet before somebody ruins it,

204
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,230
you got to go check it out. All right,
there's my, I never do a movie plugs,

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,660
so there you go. There's one for you. Um,

206
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,570
so we ended up going to that thing and uh,

207
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,430
I know what the fuck we did after that
thing. We just came straight home. Oh,

208
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:07,160
I know. Walked up to my car and for
some reason the fucking lights were on.

209
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,610
Okay.

210
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,470
Because cars are so God damn confusing.

211
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,220
Like wherever the fuck my lights
used to be. Boosie the automatic,

212
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,650
he just turned the car on and
they fucking come on at night.

213
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,060
Like somehow the lights sense night.
Fucking creepy is that,

214
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,010
and I did the manual one

215
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,810
and now that it's on the manual and I
can't figure out where the fuck to put it.

216
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:32,950
So now I always have to do it and
now I'm like, you know, but you know,

217
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,680
kills me with today's technology
is I left those things on,

218
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,850
went and had a drink and an appetizer
and then saw like a fucking whatever,

219
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,500
whatever that movies, 90 minutes. I
won 45 minute movie and I came back.

220
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,620
My car is still started up back
in the day. You are fucked.

221
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,630
Okay.

222
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,030
Everybody had jumper cables,
doe, can you give me a jump?

223
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,560
Do you mind if I ate to bar the,
can you give me a jump?

224
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,340
And it was always like the shittiest
fucking car ever. And you're like, ah man,

225
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,980
Naw man, a kid, a kid. Now you can
just say, no, I can't. The big,

226
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,020
why not? It's like, well
what? Today's technology,

227
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,120
it's pointless for me to
ever look under my hood.

228
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,590
I just take it down to the dealer
and they deal with everything.

229
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,250
I don't even know where the battery is
and I can guarantee fucking to you when I,

230
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,580
when I fucking lift up the hood I got,

231
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,680
I'd probably have to remove something
to get to one of the terminals.

232
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,140
So I don't know why you're not a member
of AAA, but I don't want it to tell you.

233
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,970
And I leave and I get my car and I
drive away from a fellow American.

234
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,350
You understand me? Do what's
going on with the fucking Celtics.

235
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,240
We've lost six of the last 11 games.
They're five and six and now the wizards,

236
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,810
the Wiz ease on down,
ease on down the row home.

237
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,720
I never really realized that until a
buddy of mine has been giving me Shit,

238
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:52,991
you know,

239
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:56,310
cause they're wizards amp and playing
well against the Celtics and just point

240
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:56,921
great to share.

241
00:14:56,921 --> 00:15:01,921
They slid into a second place and I
just keep trashing about the name.

242
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,820
I like the bullets is too violent,
you know,

243
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,380
which I understand because the city was
so violent back in the day, you know,

244
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,930
but to go from being the bullets,
which I used to think, you know,

245
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,040
number one with a bullet,

246
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,370
that's how I always looked at it
off faster than a speeding bullet.

247
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:24,340
Superman Shit. I didn't
think like, you know,

248
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,050
the team was embracing gang violence out
on the street. It was like pro crack.

249
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,110
It's such stupid shit. I fucking hate
when they, so then what do they do?

250
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,550
What are the soccer moms
fucking political correct.

251
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,950
Police who for some fucking stupid
reason think that they're the eggs,

252
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:44,170
progressive people and think
that they can just, Oh,

253
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:48,810
we'll change words if we change words.
It changes to reception. No, it doesn't.

254
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,880
No, it doesn't. If your parents
would dopes racist country,

255
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,360
that's what the fuck your
kids going to be. That's it.

256
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,130
Unless your kid is lucky enough to win
a rack with somebody within the group

257
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,900
that your parents used to fucking trash,

258
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,700
they maybe he got some day like you don't
just change a word and it's this fairy

259
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:13,690
dust that sprinkles over somebody's
heart and you'd change the thought.

260
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,730
It's so fucking dumb.

261
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,960
All it did was just become a way to
lose your job because you said the wrong

262
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:23,590
fucking word. And then what?
The person who uses the word,

263
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,960
then they realize it after they lose a
job. Oh, now I'm not racist or homophobic.

264
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:30,980
It's so fucking dumb.

265
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,430
So they've gone right down to
these stupid fucking team names.

266
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,840
I love how they changed the bullets,
but not the Redskins.

267
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,980
You know? I think it'd be got,
you get like the fucking a victim.

268
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,790
If they ever changed the Redskins, it'd
be like, yeah, I get that. I get that.

269
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,800
Like the Indians, you know, it's like, all
right. You know, we weren't from fucking,

270
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,490
we weren't, you know, Columbus didn't
understand that there was a real world.

271
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,390
This shit's even real. Who the fuck
knows? There was no tape recorders.

272
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:02,830
This guy didn't have a fucking diary,

273
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,850
but other story was told was
that he was like, Nah, man,

274
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,290
the world is fucking round.

275
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,260
Okay,

276
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,980
this guy had the balls.

277
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,790
Okay.

278
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,320
Sky had the fucking balls to,

279
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:20,321
to start going towards where they thought
you'd go off the edge of the earth in

280
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:21,800
a fucking boat.

281
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,180
Okay.

282
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,120
You know, I don't know why the water,
it makes it more scary, but you know,

283
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:28,910
if anybody just sat around and thought
about Saturday until the world is fucking

284
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:29,744
flat.

285
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,500
Okay.

286
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,410
Um, how is it the water just
running off the edges here.

287
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,290
Okay.

288
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,980
Did they not have counters and sinks?
I guess they didn't,

289
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,350
did they have plumbing at that
point? It, you know, the Romans did

290
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,770
fucking Eden's banging each other in
the goddamn bathrooms there, whatever.

291
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:52,280
They eight til he had puke rooms
just eat until you fucking puke.

292
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,980
So I would actually think, well, at
the very least, even if it is flat,

293
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
the fact that there's
still water in the ocean,

294
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,290
there's gotta be land on the
other side holding it in. Right?

295
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay.

296
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,010
But not all, Christopher Columbus, not
all crazy. It was like, no, fuck that.

297
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,780
I'm going to get to the West indies,
whatever the fuck I was,

298
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,770
I'm going to get to India.

299
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm going the other way.

300
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,680
You fucking sky the balls to sail
out that way. Sales out that way.

301
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:28,060
And then he thinks, well fuck
these people must be Indian.

302
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,840
You know, that's just sort of like, oh,

303
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,990
are you Arab? I thought
you were Italian. I mean,

304
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,830
it's at that level of offensive, like, I
mean, would you really get that offended?

305
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:44,460
Like, no, I'm fucking Arab. How dare you?
Well, what do you got against Italians?

306
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,320
You can't,
sorry.

307
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,410
Anyways,
um,

308
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,111
speaking of which,

309
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,620
I don't understand all these people going
into ancestry.com why you would go to

310
00:18:56,621 --> 00:19:00,840
a fucking website and let them take
a swab of your saliva. I get eight.

311
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,470
How fucking dumb or people,

312
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,703
okay.

313
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,100
Oh my God, I didn't realize,
you know, I'm also Swahili.

314
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,340
Whenever the fuck, why don't always
pick swell, Uli. I was taking Romania.

315
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,600
I didn't understand that.
We show so Hungarian. Great.

316
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,400
Now I know why I like Goulash
one eighth of the time.

317
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:26,610
Okay.

318
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,610
At this point is so fucking far removed
and I don't understand why people are

319
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:36,150
sitting there acting like there's any
sort of culture there. Is it all right?

320
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,850
It's just like what I saw
in the Greater Phoenix area.

321
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,590
There's a new patch of land, you
know, you fucking clear it out.

322
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,260
You put a bunch of houses
down and then you slam down

323
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,590
a fucking strip ball. Sorry, I
got to do this podcast before,

324
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,710
but daughter wakes up here. Um, yeah,

325
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,980
they slept on a fucking strip mall and
they just continue to progress that.

326
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,680
That's basically, you know, then
there's a cheesecake factory.

327
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,570
They get a frozen yogurt place and
that's what has become, okay. There's no,

328
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,370
there's no culture left. Is
there? I mean that is the culture.

329
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,110
I just sounds like one of the douchey
talk show right now, there is no culture.

330
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,470
Okay.

331
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,310
And this is what needs to stop. We have
to stop these strip malls. All right.

332
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:25,070
Do you have a solution? Uh, no I don't.

333
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,510
I just don't like cvs
anchored strip malls.

334
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,300
Yeah.

335
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,360
There was a bunch of people out the
other day, you know, you don't want,

336
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:39,380
you just have like shit to do.
I go Saturday, right. And, uh,

337
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:42,940
it's rained a bunch when we were out
here with some fucking idiot politicians

338
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,410
said the drought's over. It's like,
no, it isn't. It's never over.

339
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,340
It's just in a good place right now.
When is it going to rain again?

340
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,700
You don't know snow.

341
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,360
You going to let people go back
to taking long fucking showers.

342
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,620
I never do that out here.

343
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,940
Okay.

344
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,820
I shut, I turn it on and shut off
the water like fucking five times.

345
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:05,050
When I take a shower, I turn it on,
you know, get yourself wet, you know?

346
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,010
And then you shut it off,
set yourself up,

347
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,580
then you turn it back on, rinse yourself
off. He shut it off. And that's it.

348
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:16,360
So it says, standing there under
the cascading water, you know,

349
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:17,710
like he's some sort of,
God.

350
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,173
MMM.

351
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,070
Then I like to think a lot of people try
to do that. At least my wife does it.

352
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:28,940
She fucking turns a thing on his
fucking walking around, you know,

353
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,570
she's one of those chill people.
She hasn't,

354
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,380
she hasn't think about shit like that.
You know?

355
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,700
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm
a better person in my wife and I don't

356
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:42,360
know how to bring that up.
If you guys know a good way to word it.

357
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,080
Like how can I basically say,
you know what it is honey.

358
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,410
I guess at the end of the day I'm just,

359
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,750
okay,

360
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,130
I'm just a better person than you are.

361
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,430
I just already pictured her
rolling her eyes anyways. Um,

362
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,740
the fuck was my point. All right. Yeah.
So Indians. Okay. That's like fucking,

363
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
yeah,

364
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,010
that's almost kind of funny.
Like now you're fucking dope.

365
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:14,130
You like 6,000 miles away
from what you think you are.

366
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,720
I guess it was probably funny at first
they started chopping people's arms off

367
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:21,900
cause they couldn't fucking get some
gold for the holes in his teeth.

368
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,350
And who the fuck am I to
say what's offensive way?

369
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:28,710
But you would think that red skin that
would be at the top of the fucking list

370
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:31,800
over bullets. You know,
it's the worst one.

371
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,240
The fact that the Tampa Bay
devil rays and now just the race,

372
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,600
you know, that's when you know you got
to move. That's when you just sit like,

373
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:43,080
wait a minute,

374
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,080
are there enough Jesus freaks in this
area that the local team has to appease

375
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:52,230
their, you know, hocus pocus bullshit.

376
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,690
I mean devil rays that isn't,

377
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:57,900
that isn't then that an actual name
of like some sort of sting ray.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,740
I have no idea. Maybe
it is. Maybe it isn't.

379
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,940
All I know is that that
guy's first name is Liam.

380
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,300
It sounds too close. Like Lima,
like Lyme disease. Um, alright.

381
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,720
Devil Ray.

382
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,480
Hey, we go. Yeah.

383
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,253
Let me see here.

384
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,000
All I'm seeing is pictures of fucking
sting rays, giant ones with the fucking,

385
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,820
you know,
like they're flying through the water.

386
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,880
If somebody can explain to me how that
makes you move forward when they make you

387
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:39,810
go up to the surface.

388
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,330
Yeah.

389
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,910
Do these things a fucking gigantic.
They're bad ass

390
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,940
because I think it's getting there.

391
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:49,490
It's jumping out of the water
unless somebody's photo shopped it.

392
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,460
I got to go video now and they
just change it to the race.

393
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:56,850
Okay.

394
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,550
We're just to ray.
Incredible flying race.

395
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,250
So I guess devil ray was the nickname.
Protect Your Business Data from,

396
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,110
Oh Jesus Christ. I don't need a
commercial. I do the commercials. Not you

397
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,250
on the west coast.

398
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,610
On the west coast is always some fucking
English accent and the shock pluses to

399
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,470
BBC.
Sorry.

400
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,410
Oh, Jesus said, what are they showing
that I somehow I got a fucking Pelican.

401
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,210
Okay.

402
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,210
20 abnormally large animals
that actually exist.

403
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,630
This is how you fucking go down
aisle. You go down just like a, a,

404
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,320
what do they call it?
The go down the fucking rabbit hole.

405
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,633
Yeah.

406
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,320
Let's see. Come on man. Oh, that
was us. Stove was a school of a,

407
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm an asshole. Right?
Is it fucking God. Good.

408
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,880
Okay.

409
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,500
Jesus. Those things are ugly as Shit, Huh?

410
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,900
All right. So there in a helicopter. I
imagine they're flying over this, uh,

411
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,250
this whole school of him. It's like a
fucking devil ray or gee, that's why.

412
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,830
I bet the other ones are like more like
a, what do they, what do you call it?

413
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,320
[inaudible] just monogamous.

414
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,950
These things are out of your fucking
the shit out of each other and the local

415
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:19,010
Jesus freaks down in Clearwater,
Florida. They couldn't have it.

416
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,840
They fly out of the fucking water.
They're not two graceful with the,

417
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,280
with the landing there.
All right,

418
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:28,250
I'll repost that fucking video in case
you want to watch that while you listen

419
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,090
to me ramble about it.

420
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,703
MMM.

421
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,510
Yeah. They changed it to the,
to raise the Tampa Bay rays,

422
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,920
the Tampa Bay devil rays.
Two syllables. Two syllables.

423
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,430
Okay. They went from four,
four time to three. Four.

424
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:46,410
They turned their fucking team into a wasp

425
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,870
bump. Bump, bump. Bump, bump.

426
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,570
Oh, I dunno. I didn't know what the fuck
I'm talking about. Can I, can I read?

427
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,760
Can I read you guys? You guys want
you to listen to me? Read out loud.

428
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,231
Hey everybody,

429
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:00,590
it's time to feel better about your
f the brain you are blessed with.

430
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:02,930
Okay.

431
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,763
Just sit right here.

432
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,580
Somebody explained to me why
it's not at the font I need.

433
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,010
I like a nice fucking 18

434
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:19,030
font. That's good for me. All right.
Oh, dollar shave club, everybody.

435
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:22,510
Oh Jesus Christ. There's no reason
to use a cheap disposable razor.

436
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:25,160
You stupid cunt.
Oh,

437
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,580
pay a ridiculously high
price for gimmicky,

438
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,610

a laser pointer with 17 blades.

440
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,420
Do I always shave club
before dollar shave club?

441
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,250
It was either save money and get a
painful shave from a disposable like ones

442
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,080
they give away for free at the gym,

443
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,550

glass or pay a fortune for the latest

444
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:57,170
gimmick. He shaped breakthrough. You
don't need like a laser chin detector

445
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,420
or has 17 blades.
As I told you before,

446
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,180
the sweet spot was two blades,
two plates was perfect.

447
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:08,900
Nothing shaved like the two
blade three blade stinks.

You don't walk like everyone

go to hell, exceed [inaudible] sleep.com
and answer a few simple questions.

515
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:40,510
Do a saliva swab and they'll run a three
d biomechanical model modelle of your

516
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:47,120
body through the proprietary algorithms
they developed with the help of the

517
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:50,360
world's leading era,
arrogant nomics and biomechanics experts.

518
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,480
They're going to make a fucking robot.
That's what they're going to do it.

519
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,440
They're not going to do this.
I bet helix is going to fucking sell that.

520
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,520
That for fucking proprietary
algorithm of your goddamn nuts, sec.

521
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,720
And next thing you know,

522
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,790
there's going to be a fucking lifelike
robots walking around with an exact

523
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,640
replica of your junk,
but I'm going to tell you right now,

524
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:14,660
you're going to sleep like you never
slept before. All right. You know why?

525
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,940
Because Helen's customers,

526
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:20,390
he looks report at 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality.

527
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,890
Okay?

528
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,510
How they figured that out.
I have no idea.

529
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,950
How can you fucking take
notes while you're sleeping?
I guess when they wake up,

530
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:28,491
they feel you want,

531
00:32:28,491 --> 00:32:32,060
if you want to improve your fucking
sleep by 30% lay off the booze.

532
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:36,800
You're fucking drunk. Save money on
the mattress. If you lay off the bump,

533
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,330
maybe this is the,
this is the fucking mattress for drunks.

534
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,980
So as much as you're hung over,
you offset it with this great mattress.

535
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,830
I'm going to get one of these things. And
for couples, Oh, now they getting freaky.

536
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,520
They customize each side of the
mattress. Ah, they went the other way.

537
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,420
They customize each side of the mattress.
You know,

538
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,020
that's for someone in a loveless marriage.

539
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,290
If you notice that your side
of the bed isn't, as you know,

540
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,060
if you're annoyed that your wife likes
soft of magic, that's fucking over.

541
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,920
And I liked the hard mattress.
That's it.

542
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,000
Just go start sleeping on the couch
and when she goes to bed, you know,

543
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,440
start trolling for Internet,
Pussy, social media.

544
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,710
And that's what you should do.
But anyways,

545
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:26,790
your mattress arrives at your door and
about a week and in shipping is 100% free.

546
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,760
That's why everyone from
Gq magazine to Forbes,

547
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,830
they're all talking about he likes sleep.

out, grouse. And if you don't love it,

549
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,770

day and give you 100% refund.

550
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:44,040
No questions asked.

551
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,850
I always picture Mr. White and Jesse
Pinkman showing up in a hazmat suit.

552
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,060
You know,
we're here for your mattress

553
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,450
and you won't even touch it at that point
yet. It's in the back. Good luck to you.

554
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,290
Go to helix,
sleep.com/burn and get $50 off your order.

555
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,330
That's [inaudible] dot com
slash bar one more time. Hey,

556
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,180

Lastly, but not leastly.

557
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,500
MVMT watches the company started
by two broke college kids.

558
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,210
I never understood that line. Hey, we're
flat broke. You want to start a company?

559
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,350
Absolutely. Um, they wanted
to wear stylish watches,

560
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:29,190
but they couldn't afford them.
So they started their own watch company.

561
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,350
Did they just solve the homeless problem?
You know,

562
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:36,780
I'm fucking living outside.
I can't afford a house.

563
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:40,860
So I went out and I bought
one no more homeless guy.

564
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:45,840
How is this like how you started built
a following, launched into a podcast,

565
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,190
youtube, radio, etc.
Oh, I guess awesome. Oh,

566
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:53,640
you know what this reminds me of
when I started out like a comedian.

567
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,950
I didn't have any jokes,
so I,

568
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,780
I sat down and wrote something
that I went up on stage at a,

569
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:05,750
you know, I did. Okay. Does
that remind you of watches?

570
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,100
All right. Ooh, bit watches started
at just $95 at a department store.

571
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,620
I'm sorry, 95 movement watches
start at just $95. Dot Dot. Dot.

572

00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,710
why the fuck would they say that
I'm walking around wearing them?

587
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,790
I would wear that if I was
like 20 years younger. Okay.

588
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,190
Yeah.

589
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,881
Let me tell you something.

590
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:24,730
If you're in your late fucking forties
and you can't afford a fucking,

591
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,730
you can't afford a decent, decent watch.
Cause I don't, I don't go for the flash.

592
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,070
You know what I mean? I
don't, I don't understand that
dead fuck. I mean, I get it.

593
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,750
I guess I get that Rolex thing,
that hacky thing.

594
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,830
I got a Rolex. As you can see,
I've made my dreams come true.

595
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,600
I'm a man in the world.

596
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:47,890
Okay.

597
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,300
You know, there's a lot of
guys out there, you know,

598
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,490
my dad always said a man should own
a nice watch. What else did he say?

599
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,100
And I get the fuck out of here.
I'm taking a shit. You know?

600
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,300
What else did he say that was so
fucking deep baby? You know what?

601
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,490
Maybe at a nice calm,
relaxed,

602
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,470
relaxing person in your life.
Maybe you did.

603
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm always jealous of that.
When I see like calm families,

604
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,220
they've gotta be bored shitless though.
There's going to be, you know what?

605
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:19,870
I would actually be willing to guess
that the child that is more likely

606
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,630
to just go fucking nuts. You know what I
mean? Take out the family car, you know,

607
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:30,270
throw a hatchet over somebody's
head is going to come from a calm

608
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,010
family after awhile.
It's stupid. No it isn't.

609
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,520
Okay.

610
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm just saying it's possible.
Just the fucking monotony of it.

611
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,200
I give it go to Disneyland and you
fucking worn out and then he just started

612
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:48,500
hearing.

613
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,910
It's a small world and it just keeps
going over and over again and you slowly

614
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:56,720
fill yourself, like
losing your sanity there,

615
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:59,660
right there is why I don't
believe in heaven or hell.

616
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,820
You know what I mean?
I just don't believe in it.

617
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,100
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

618
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,633
You know,

619
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,490
like if heaven was, if it was just
having the whole fucking time,

620
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,470
heaven would eventually become health
because it would just be so fucking nice

621
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:20,380
and everybody would just be walking around
isn't as great. Oh my God, it's gay.

622
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,400
Can you believe how great this is?
This is just fucking great.

623
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,140
It's quite like every fucking day, and
at some point you're gonna be like, ah,

624
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,170
it's fucking gray.
You know?

625
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,980
Like,
what do you do

626
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,580
for the rest of your fucking life?

627
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,200
You just sitting there and it's
always the same. It's just awesome.

628
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,090
It never rains. There's no
disappointments. There's no challenges.

629
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,610
There's no funny stories to tell anymore.
Hey,

630
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:55,970
you remember, remember, remember
that time when it was awesome? Yeah,

631
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,570
it's always awesome,
right?

632
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,700
Then if you're in hell, oh, I'm fine. No,
I'm fine. I've got, I'm, I'm fire. Uh,

633
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,310
fire after a while, you
know? Um, yeah, I'm on fire.

634
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,010
I can't yell anymore.
This just become normal.

635
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:15,470
I don't even remember what my fucking
life was like before it got here.

636
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,370
I Dunno. I guess how well you can
actually see how that would suck.

637
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,120
I said I just don't get heaven. I don't
want to fucking be like, you know,

638
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:29,250
at some point there's some apps to happen.
Um,

639
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,560
so as I'm riding around in my
fucking all angel white bicycle,

640
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,050
at some point you got to get a flat,
right?

641
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,950
Yeah.

642
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,830
Did immediately somebody would
be there to help, help you out.

643
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,910
They just be saying a bunch of Nice Shit
too. I would slowly just start crying.

644
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,640
I would just whisper at some point. You
like cheeses. I told chief as I can make.

645
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,220
I know. It's just weird. I understand.
I'm not, I'm not trying to be,

646
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:58,850
that guy's not appreciative,
but could you just say no,

647
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,710
cause you just call me
a cunt or something?

648
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:05,610
Could you fucking just slap
me with you the Sandal?

649
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,190
You know, can you just imagine the
look on his face as he just sits there?

650
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:11,431
You know,

651
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:16,431
not saying anything as you talk yourself
into a corner and she's sort of looking

652
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:21,160
at, you know, when people look at you and
they go from one eye to the other, right?

653
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,010
Or your left eye, your right eye,
left eye, and he likes his mother.

654
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:26,460
Motherfuckers trying to
get in my head right now.

655
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,890
The son of God is trying
to get in my fucking head.

656
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,680
Then you got to explain
it to the bosses son.

657
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,530
Why you don't like heaven? Not that you
don't like it, but it's just like, can,

658
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:40,370
can you make it rain
every once in a while?

659
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,200
Can it be that dog that's just fucking
barking right as I'm going to sleep? Come.

660
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,400
Can we just have that?

661
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,690
Does every fucking dog
have to behave itself?

662
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,990
Okay,

663
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,850
why can't I say that word? Jesus. Why
can't I say that word? My disrupted it.

664
00:40:57,851 --> 00:41:00,310
What are you going to do now?
Send me down to hell. It's over.

665
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
I already passed the test.
All right.

666
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,600
Can somebody be annoyed?
What's fucking something up here?

667
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,630
Look at everybody looking at,
well,

668
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,220
okay,

669
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,290
these fucking God smiles on their faces.

670
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,250
It's creepy cheeses.
I don't know.

671
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,850
Would you want to fucking be like,
it's like you joined a cult,

672
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:31,220
all of these fucking, you know
what I mean? If I was running shit,

673
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,580
I would make religion illegal.
It would just be fucking,

674
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:38,330
I would just take it all away
from everybody, you know?

675
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,860
I will answer what I would do. I would
have, I would have a fucking crew, robots,

676
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,150
you know,
to infiltrate every fucking religion.

677
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,270
And then at,
when I made it illegal,

678
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,820
they would join the radicalized
people in every group. Right.

679
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,860
And then they would just
wipe them all out. You don't,

680
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,340
and then you'd have to listen to the
whining and the crying and people that

681
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,950
remembered fucking religion and all,
he just,

682
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,620
he just take the whole fucking thing
away. And the new religion is, hey,

683
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,450
I don't know what the fuck happens
after you die,

684
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,050
you know?
But you know,

685
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,880
let's be nice to each other
and then that's it. Okay.

686
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:26,350
No walking on water. No, never
running out of fish part and CS.

687
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,430
I don't know about anybody else's
religion. I don't know what the fuck,

688
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:33,070
but I know there's always some
fucking crazy thing that you know,

689
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:36,340
didn't happen and everybody
acts like it happened.

690
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,313
It didn't happen.

691
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,640
Who is painted on a fucking cave
wall and somebody elaborated on it.

692
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:44,980
Okay.

693
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,410
I Dunno, I get rid of
all personally. I'm just,

694
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,330
I'm just talking for myself personally.
I would get rid of it. Um, but yeah,

695
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,110
by the way, guess what I'm doing on
March 29th out here in Los Angeles.

696
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,410
All right. If you are, um,

697
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,100
if you're in Los Angeles and you're a
guns and roses fan and you like reading

698
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:08,890
their books about the band,
I've read every fucking one of them.

699
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,090
Um,
I read slashes,

700
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,940
I read Steven ad was, I read, uh,

701
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,600
the kid from canter's. Do you know,
knew the band, took all the pictures.

702
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:27,520
I have that fucking book.
And uh, recently, I dunno,
I dunno when she put it out,

703
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:31,420
but Deanna Adler, Steven
Adler, his mom wrote a book,

704
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,820
sweet child of mine. And, um,
especially if you, if you,

705
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,450
you should read this, you should
read Steven's first. You know,

706
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,940
you get his version of the hell he went
through as an addict and then you get

707
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,820
his mother's version,
which is unbelievable.

708
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,390
And you know what would be a fucking
amazing is if you could go down

709
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:59,010
and meet her at a book signing at Barnes
and noble at the Grove on March 29th I

710
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:05,560
believe it starts at 7:00 PM and you go
down there and you could fucking meet

711
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,760
the mother. The best fucking one of the
best dramas, the 80s my personal opinion,

712
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,910
and you know, it'd be even more
fucking amazing, is it followed them,

713
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:16,080
came on my podcast and I got
to interview him. Oh Shit.

714
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,150
Is there a special Monday morning
podcast coming up this week?

715
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,640
Wouldn't that be incredible? Why?
What would it be like if Steven Adler,

716
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,390
you guys all know how
much I fucking love him.

717
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,760
He's mother Adler and then
that brother Jamie had,

718
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:37,580
they're all came on my fucking podcast.
What would that be like? We'll be out.

719
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:41,730
Like if they all came on at the same
time and there was this big happy family

720
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,500
that just sat there
interrupting each other.

721
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,020
And you felt like you were at
their fucking dinner table.

722
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:50,220
How fucking cool would that be if
I did a podcast like that? Well,

723
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,130
it's going to happen. It already
happened. I already recorded it and um,

724
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,100
I'll wait till you guys
listen to it. But, um,

725
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:05,120
I had so much fun with them and their
mother is an absolute salt of the earth

726
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:08,430
sweetheart and she has
a book signing and um,

727
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,080
she's all excited slash nervous that
no one's going to show up, you know,

728
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,050
as you know, same way when
I put out a special, what if
nobody watches it? So I'm,

729
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:22,110
I'm going to be hyping this,
um, right up until March 29th.

730
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,860
Um, it would be such a great thing if
there was a bunch of people down there.

731
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:29,820
I'm going to be down there standing
in line with the rest of you is, uh,

732
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,470
probably get down there. I don't
know, probably like around eight ish.

733
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,660
They get starts at like seven,

734
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,300
but I'll be down there around
h just because I get it.
I get some fucking thing.

735
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:43,860
I'm taping right before, but, um,
yeah, I did a special podcast.

736
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:48,630
I get to meet Steven Adler and I'm
still fucking freaking out. And, uh,

737
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:50,401
and I'll,

738
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:52,320
I'll wait till you guys listen to the
interview and then I'll tell you all the

739
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:55,980
fucking cool stories. All right, here
we go. Let's, let's plow ahead here. Oh,

740
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:59,870
my Bruins beat the fucking fly as,
oh,

741
00:45:59,871 --> 00:46:03,390
at that little fucking prayer of
his shot at the end. Not a prayer,

742
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:04,230
just put it on net.

743
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:08,880
Somehow it found its way to the back of
the net Bruins pickup by huge two points,

744
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,800
Bruins a playing great. Um,
and as are the Canadians,

745
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,020
which, um, I don't like the Canadians,
but I'm happy for Khloe, Julian, you know,

746
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,880
and uh, I'm actually, you know what?

747
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:24,780
I think the Bruins might have been right
to make a move at this point. I think,

748
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,570
uh, it's just one of those things
with coaching after awhile,

749
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,470
even if the person is great, even
if they won your cup, it's just,

750
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,950
it's just part of coaching. At some point.
They just show you the door. But, um,

751
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,470
we're playing great. We look a lot better
than we did. So I think maybe both.

752
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,800
It's worked out in the fucking Canadians
are playing better with Cloe. Julian,

753
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,230
all my friends in this
business who are have fans,

754
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,770
they keep texting me saying
that they love and the guy,

755
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,120
so I guess it worked out for everybody.
So there you go.

756
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,230
And Clode went from original fucking six,
two original six.

757
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,280
Um, there you go. All right. So
anyways, let's plow ahead here.

758
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:05,190
Um, let's read some of the,
uh, some of the fucking,

759
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:09,260
whenever you call them for this
week. The uh, the questions. Alright,

760
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,350
DDP Yoga. Hey Bill, first of all,

761
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:16,410
thank you very much for your
consistently amazing podcasts. Well,

762
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:21,240
thank you for listening.
Thank you for doing what you do,

763
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,810
sir. Or ma'am. I absolutely
love it. To be honest with you.

764
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:26,280
I feel like it's getting,
it's,

765
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,520
I feel like getting it
for free is too much.

766
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,060
I'd gladly pay five to 10 bucks a month
for all the content you're releasing.

767
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,540
You don't need to do that. I'm fucking,
I'm doing great with the advertising.

768
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:38,980
You know,

769
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,680
that's why I fuck around during the
advertising because that's how I fucking

770
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,400
make money.

771
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,940
But I know you guys are going to fast
forward to it unless I keep peppering it

772
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:50,800
with Fox and cons. That's it. It's
a very simple formula. Anyhow,

773
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,121
he said,

774
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:57,121
I want to get in touch and address
your self proclaimed dad bod.

775
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,400
Yeah.

776
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,990
Have you ever heard of
or looked into DDP Yoga?

777
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,220
Okay.

778
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,410
Uh,
if not,

779
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,670
maybe the name Diamond Dave
Dallas page rings a bell,

780
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,470
former WC, WWE wrestling wrestler
and all around. Great Guy.

781
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:17,030
After leaving the wrestling business,

782
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:20,840
he devoted himself to getting
his body back in peak condition,

783
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:26,120
even through wrassling,
even though wrassling is his quote fake,

784
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,150
it definitely takes a toll. Yeah. They
beat the shit out of their bodies. Um,

785
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,220
long story short,

786
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,550
he went from being a guy who wouldn't be
caught dead in a yoga studio to trying

787
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:40,940
it after all else failed to develop
his own system and helping thousands of

788
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:43,760
people completely revitalize their lives.

789
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,630
And I can tell you from
personal experience, it's
fucking great. No bullshit,

790
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:49,910
no fluff, no one's structures, structures,

791
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:54,911
calmly whispering about Schapera
alignment is that he say Chakra Schapera.

792
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,520
It's about consistently performing the
physical and mental exercises that will

793
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,390
have you operating at your best.
This is a commercial healing,

794
00:49:05,391 --> 00:49:09,440
nagging aches and pains, increasing
your endurance gating, mental clarity,

795
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:11,900
et cetera. Like I said, no fluff.

796
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:16,520
Here's the video that got me to take a
chance on it. It's not too late for you,

797
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:20,420
Billy. I hope you'll check it out.
Thanks again for the God damn podcast.

798
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:23,720
All the best to you and your family. Uh,
that actually read like a commercial.

799
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:24,980
But you know what,
I don't give a shit.

800
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:28,970
It's a physical fitness thing and so
many people have taken yoga and done in a

801
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:32,570
different way. You know,
cause there is that thing.

802
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,230
If you really like a wound up psycho to
go into a yoga class and the tone with

803
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:43,010
which that they speak is a little jarring,
you know,

804
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:44,680
okay.

805
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,700
To be in your cargo. Oh you're
fucking caught the lightest weight.

806
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,580
You could have made it

807
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,860
okay

808
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,610
to then being like,
how is everyone feeling today?

809
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,860
I know the traffic was kind of bad.
I hope.

810
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,360
I hope you're not bringing
that energy in here.

811
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,110
Is it slowly walking around lighting
these smelly fucking things,

812
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,660
you know, and as you're talking
to the person next to you, just go

813
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:21,140
and immediately you just want to like,
I dunno,

814
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,580
just slowly roll up your mat
and just walk out. Like I can't,

815
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,810
like I get it, I get, I need to
chill out, but I can't feel like,

816
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,740
yeah,

817
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,080
you know,

818
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,200
you know where it just becomes like this
asexual thing wherever you were just

819
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:39,410
kind of like, hey man, was just kinda,
you know, everybody's just like,

820
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:43,220
we're all like one, you
know, we're like plants. Um,

821
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,520
that's a little fucking jarring.
I'll give it a shot.

822
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,490
I've actually been meaning to do it
because I keep having setbacks with my

823
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:54,200
fucking shoulder. Um, which
is really frustrating. But,

824
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:58,220
um, most of it is diet. So, uh,

825
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,420
whenever I get in shape, the first thing
I do is I cut out the booze and, um,

826
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,500
all I really need to, I need to
go like 46 days without any booze.

827
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:09,530
Even just having that one cognac
didn't really do anything.

828
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,500
Like I had the one and then
immediately my buddy's like, hey,

829
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:16,340
why don't we have 50 more? But I had
to go to the movie and then I was fine.

830
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,970
Um, and then the second I'm in there
and the bus starts to wear off.

831
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:24,050
I think I'll thank God I didn't have
15 more. Not to mention I got to drive.

832
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,700
Right. Um, I'm going to give it a
shot. I just think if I did yoga,

833
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:33,340
I did have to do in the morning
before the little one wakes up. Um,

834
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,670
she's so fucking awesome, dude. I'm
telling you right. You'll never regret it.

835
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,990
I guess you know when you'll get it.

836
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:42,680
If you have a kid with somebody
that you're not love with,

837
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:45,770
I guess that that would suck. But at the
end of the day, the kid is still awesome.

838
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:49,830
It's a hell of a door price, I'll tell you
that, right? Oh, I'll tell you. All right.

839
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,350
Trans wrestling. Hey there,
I'm already gonna Watch this.

840
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:57,940
If this is what I think it
is a there Billy boo. Ah,

841
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,060
did you hear the story about the Trans
girl going through home hormone treatment

842
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,100
who was still wrestling
girls in high school?

843
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,660
His slash her defense is that it's a
low dose of testosterone and it does not

844
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:13,100
allow for any competitive advantage.

845
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,640
Wait a minute. Isn't that what Hg
ages? That's human growth hormone.

846
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,070
Well, I guess I don't think human
growth hormone. I don't know why.

847
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:27,570
I don't know what kind of hormones
they take. Um, having said that,

848
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,940
I'm not sure I'd let my daughter
Rasul a girl who had any edge at all.

849
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,100
Even if it's a tiny bit of extra strength.

850
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:38,070
It could be the difference
in breaking a bone. Thoughts.

851
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,930
Would you let your daughter wrestle
in that situation? Uh, yeah. Yeah.

852
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:46,890
I would then take a break. A
fucking bone, you know what I mean?

853
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,110
How many times do people break a bone
and wrestling? Does that really happen?

854
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:58,110
They just fucking on each other
the whole time. It's like a,

855
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,790
you know, like that official level
shit. Not that, not the fun shit,

856
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:08,880
the stone cold shit that the actual
official college shit, it's like a,

857
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,300
it's like competitive spooning.
You know what I mean?

858
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,110
It's like one person is trying
to spoon with the other person.

859
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:19,650
The other person is like, I want to
be this, the Spooner, not the spoonie.

860
00:53:19,651 --> 00:53:23,890
That's basically what's going on.
They don't like, you know. No,

861
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:28,620
I wouldn't be concerned about that.
Yeah.

862
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,790
I'm one of those debts.

863
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,220
Okay,

864
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,210
well the kids crying going away.
You know, she's already half a guy.

865
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:39,200
I'd be driving her. As far as I know.
She's still a girl, so suck it up.

866
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:45,710
You want to pay them?
Well then you gotta wrestle half of too.

867
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,440
That's a thing. I don't want
to hear another word out again.

868
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,160
I'd be like dead.

869
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,090
Okay.

870
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,150
Why don't you embrace the opportunity
to be like, well, here we go.

871
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,040
If this is actually a fucking advantage,

872
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:02,150
all this is going to do is make me better.
You know what I mean?

873
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:07,270
And then he could go up there and give
you a record 27 and oak against hundred

874
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,043
percent chicks

875
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,770
and wanted to get someone
who's happened to, right.

876
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,960
You got to with Bryce, it mean, what
does that person supposed to do?

877
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,500
There's not enough fucking people that
are going through what the fuck she's

878
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:26,500
going through to fit any of the side,

879
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:33,040
you know, I think it's, I think it's a
cool thing. Fuck it. Who gives a shit?

880
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,800
Look, there's already going to
be that fucking monster anyways,

881
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,240
so some woman's going to walk in there
and just going to be blessed with

882
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:45,520
frontier strength.
You know what I mean?

883
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:50,230
Chopping wood strength is going
to be that person anyways. Uh,

884
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,640
I mean I guess if she was actually,

885
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:58,641
if she was trying to get a scholarship
in a loss could potentially affect it.

886
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,560
Um, maybe. Yeah,

887
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,990
but I gotta be honest
with you. I think, um,

888
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,850
I dunno, I would visit father.
I'd be like cycle MLC. I you do.

889
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,230
This is actually an advantage.
This is a great fucking opportunity to,

890
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:21,200
you become a, for you to become a better
wrestler. There's no money on the line.

891
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:25,190
Who gives a fuck?
Let's go.

892
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,590
Let me tell you something,
brother.

893
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,680
Come this Saturday when my daughter
wrestles a good stat. Half a dude.

894
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,440
What are you going to do when these
pythons run wild on your eyes?

895
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,940
I get up for it. I wouldn't
give a shit. Fuck it. Um, yeah.

896
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:45,230
Many guys in Europe.
So the is from Yemen,

897
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,840
Yemen, Yemen, Yemen, and he,

898
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,020
how the fuck do you say that
guy in Europe. All right.
Hey Bill, I'm a Yemeni guy.

899
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,710
Who is better? I hope I'm saying
that right. No disrespect here.

900
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,700
Who's been living in Europe
for the past six fucking years?

901
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,750
Okay.

902
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,310
Although everything is going all right.

903
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,730
I want to ask your advice because
I can relate to your personality.

904
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:14,250
Hang on a second sir. Or ma'am, I want
to fucking figure out where the fuck.

905
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:15,970
I'm assuming you're from Yemen.

906
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,880
What is yeah.
Many.

907
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:26,250
What is a yummy whom to whom is a,

908
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,380
is a Yemenite. Oh yeah.
Why did that all disappear?

909
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,960
What is a Yemeni

910
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,563
come on.

911
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,690
Alright. Relating to Yemen or it's
people. Holy Shit. I was right.

912
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:47,790
Okay.

913
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:51,060
That's a nice flag. They got a nice
flag. I like just to three bars.

914
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,320
Okay.

915
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,980
I'm a big three bar
flag guy. France, Italy,

916
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,420
Ireland, Yemen. I'm all right.

917
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,200
What do you guys think of the new
Russian flag? I kinda liked the old one.

918
00:57:09,201 --> 00:57:12,560
The old one was the shit all red
with that sickle. I thought the,

919
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:16,460
I thought that that one was fucking dope.
The new ones. All right. What is it? Red,

920
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:20,960
white and blue. Holy Shit. They got
the same colors as us. Is that one?

921
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:21,771
Is it something like that?

922
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:26,560
I Dunno that was watching this whole thing
about flatter me or putting poison in

923
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:31,030
these guys and shit.
Allegedly. I have no idea.

924
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,040
So watching it on 60 minutes so it's gotta
be true, right? Tick, tick, tick, tick,

925
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,810
tick.
You.

926
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,560
How many guys in your or I've been over
there for the last six fucking years.

927
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,890
I want to ask you a question
cause I can relate to personally.

928
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,900
My family has been living in a war
zone in Yemen for the past two years.

929
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,940
Our old house,

930
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,140
our old house there was bombed
and my father was inside,

931
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:55,840
but the lucky bastard came
out without a scratch.

932
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,760
I miss them and wish I could help them,
but that's kind of not possible now.

933
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,410
All right before the, I already feel like
this is going to be way over my head.

934
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:09,700
Before that I lost some good old friends
that I knew for more than 10 years

935
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:15,090
because of some stupid incidents was
beaten by a gang of more than 15 men in

936
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:18,400
Malaysia on a trip there for no reason.

937
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,630
And my two year ex girlfriend at the
time cheated on me with their current

938
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,850
boyfriend isn't fucking amazing.

939
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,730
This guy's from the other side of the
planet and then seek sex, same shit,

940
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:35,890
gang violence and you fucking girl got
sick of you and fucking bang somebody

941
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:36,724
else.

942
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,603
Yeah,

943
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,690
cheated on me with her current
boyfriend while I was on that trip,

944
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,650
I guess to Malaysia, it didn't have the
decency to break up with me before that.

945
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:51,090
She was my first, uh, you know, what
are you going to do? People are young,

946
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:52,620
they don't know how to break up.

947
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,180
So they wait til you go to Malaysia
and they fucked somebody, man.

948
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,020
That this is a time honored tradition
of how to break up with somebody.

949
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:04,080
All right, so if you're with your
first love, what have we learned?

950
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,740
Do not go by yourself to Malaysia.

951
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,190
I don't know how many times I
brought that up on this podcast.

952
00:59:11,191 --> 00:59:15,930
You cannot go to fucking Malaysia. All
right. I just graduated from college.

953
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,680
I have a beautiful girlfriend, which I
love and feel blessed with what I have.

954
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,720
I know that I an asshole at
certain moments in my life,

955
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:27,460
but I changed a long time ago and
I'm still trying to be more honest,

956
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:29,830
clear and focus. Well,
welcome to the club, sir.

957
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:35,250
I'm currently looking for a job in Germany
and we'll try to apply after that for

958
00:59:35,591 --> 00:59:36,880
a German passport,

959
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:41,410
which will make my life much easier and
allow me to start a company and sustain

960
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,610
myself without being dependent on others.
Exactly.

961
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:46,690
You want to work for yourself.

962
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,830
I know that you have lived certain moments
in your life where you are faced by

963
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:55,450
challenged, faced with challenges
that might have taught a lesson,

964
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,300
but at the same time left a
mark on your self confidence.

965
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,830
How did you empower yourself and what
advice would you give a young man like me

966
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:06,130
confronting life's challenges that said,
fuck face.

967
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,920
Congratulations on your baby and fuck you.

968
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:14,170
Now there's a guy,
okay,

969
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,440
who speaks at least three languages
and still is able to break balls.

970
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:22,120
Isn't that amazing? He's
probably speaks Yemeni, Yemenite,

971
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,870
Yemen, Asian, whatever the fuck he
speaks. Right? He's knows that one.

972
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,250
He's in Germany. So he's got his speak
that language on to via you in this space.

973
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,260
Right.
And he can also speak English.

974
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,183
MMM.

975
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,810
How did I empower myself?

976
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,940
Uh,

977
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,510
I used to just say shit out
loud to myself. You know,

978
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:46,740
when I would feel the dark cloud
of doubt coming in, I would just,

979
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,350
you know, and it took me a while,
but I would, I would, um, but I mean,

980
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,460
I wasn't facing what you are,
you're facing being an immigrant.

981
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,890
So I mean, you're facing way more
than I did in the, but the fact that,

982
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,790
uh, I know you're trying to become a
better person. You know what, you know,

983
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,220
to reach out for help and
all that. I, I think I,

984
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,800
my gut says you're going to be fine.
Well,

985
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:14,640
you have to do in general
is when the doubt comes in.

986
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,860
You got to beat the shit out of it. You
know you have to, the biggest thing is,

987
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:25,020
is that you're conscious
that this of the self doubt.

988
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,070
So once you're conscious of it, you
can then address it. It's when you,

989
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,500
when you're really young and
you're not conscious of it

990
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,920
and that thought comes in and then you
start dwelling on it and then it just

991
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:41,820
washes over your whole
body and you can literally,

992
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,480
you know,
have a fucking panic attack.

993
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,920
Would you have to do,
I did anyways is um,

994
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,250
okay.

995
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,560
You know, you try to cancel it
out with a positive thought.

996
01:01:54,561 --> 01:01:57,620
I know this sounds like hokey shit,
but I used to just say shit out loud.

997
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,150
I read some book one where,
and it started off with like,

998
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,530
I would just be walking down the street,
you know,

999
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,480
walking by other people and I would just
really be just be like, yeah, fuck, fuck.

1000
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:13,250
He looking at me like I was nuts,
but I was like,

1001
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,670
fuck that negative thought man.
Wouldn't yell it. But I would,

1002
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:21,320
I would kind of just say fuck that. Fuck
that. No, it isn't. No one has it, right?

1003
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,630
No,
it won't or whatever the hell it was.

1004
01:02:23,631 --> 01:02:26,480
And then it just became like
when I moved to New York

1005
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,190
and I'm trying to get into the clubs,

1006
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,190
I knew I was going to get in.
But you know,

1007
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:38,570
if the day to day just seemed like a

1008
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,940
like impossible and you know, the club
owners and everything and you know,

1009
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:49,941
some of them were cool and others enjoyed
the fact that you were desperate and

1010
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:53,460
just really enjoyed that
position of power over you.

1011
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,870
And I would walk out of the club dejected,

1012
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,070
you know, I was afraid, you know,
am I going to run out of money?

1013
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,480
I don't have a job right now.

1014
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:08,370
I'm doing these driving back to
Massachusetts to fucking feature in Dick

1015
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:12,060
Doherty's rooms that was not
barely covering, you know,

1016
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:16,740
living in New York every time you stepped
outside your blue, 20 bucks, 30 bucks,

1017
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:18,750
you know,
and um,

1018
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:20,710
okay.

1019
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:24,970
I just first started, I what I
said was, I'm tougher than you.

1020
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:28,900
New York is still what I would say, as
Hokey as that sounds. That's what they,

1021
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:29,561
you know,

1022
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:34,150
the city would kick me in the balls and
then I would just mumble that to myself

1023
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,480
sometimes,
like six times in a row

1024
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:43,130
until I got that thought on my head.
And I would just say,

1025
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,110
and then I would just pick,
I'm going to get in the clubs,

1026
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:50,150
I'm going to get in and I'm going to
make a living. I'm going to be fine,

1027
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:54,350
I'm going to be fine. Everything's gonna
be fine. Fuck that. Fuck that. Fuck that.

1028
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,920
I mean something like that.
That's what I had to do. And um,

1029
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,990
okay.

1030
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:04,190
And then it just,
you know,

1031
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,730
and that continues to rot your
fucking life and uh, you know,

1032
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:13,520
then you get to my age, you know,
and I'm doing great and everything,

1033
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,421
but there's also,

1034
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:19,010
there's always your mortality around
the fucking corner and how I've kind of

1035
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:21,140
mentally dealt with death,

1036
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,040
the inevitable death is that like,
um,

1037
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,770
that I just think it's going to be a
great experience. You know what I mean?

1038
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:36,210
That, uh, I don't think anything bad
happens to you when you die, either.

1039
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:41,200
You just go into the ground
and then that's it. And, uh,

1040
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,070
then that's it.
You know,

1041
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:48,600
you got to be a person on this planet
as opposed to like a fucking mosquito.

1042
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,550
You got the best fucking experience.
Hopefully you did.

1043
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,030
Um, and then that's it. It's fucking over.

1044
01:04:57,031 --> 01:05:00,330
Or did you become something else?

1045
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,970
And I just don't think that is bad.

1046
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,470
Okay.

1047
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,861
You know,

1048
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:08,190
I just don't think that it doesn't make
any sense that it would then just be bad.

1049
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:12,840
Um, I don't know. I hope that helps
you. I got a little off the rails there.

1050
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,730
So what I would say is
you just baby your way,

1051
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,860
you know?
And like for me,

1052
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:27,060
making it as a comedian was
like a 20 year fucking 15,

1053
01:05:27,061 --> 01:05:31,620
20 year process. I was obviously, I was
not the overnight, I didn't have the hook,

1054
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:36,600
I didn't have any of that fucking
shit. And I just basically, every day,

1055
01:05:36,601 --> 01:05:41,550
you know, was fucking hacking at the
tree until it came down. And, um,

1056
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:47,820
you know, you just don't quit. You
just, that's it. You just don't quit.

1057
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:52,260
You don't give it a negative thought and
every day you just fucking take a few

1058
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:56,130
steps towards it and then one day you
just wake up and your way you want it to

1059
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:59,130
be and you're like, how the fuck did
that happen? He didn't. He was funny.

1060
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:03,380
You don't feel any
different, you know, so, um,

1061
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,430
but she'll be all right. I think
you're going to be all right. You know,

1062
01:06:05,431 --> 01:06:09,240
you speak three different
fucking languages. You can
break balls and English.

1063
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,790
I mean you sound,

1064
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,550
you sound like you've got a great sense
of humor and you're trying to get,

1065
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:17,400
you're going to be fine. Just say that
to yourself. I'm going to be fine.

1066
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:20,400
This is going to work
out and then that's it.

1067
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:24,060
Then you can try to fucking help somebody
else out along the way. All right,

1068
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:29,070
last one here. Documentary
recommendations. Hey.

1069
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:33,130
Oh Billy. Oh Billy. Beat down. I was
wondering if you had heard of the,

1070
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:37,470
this new documentary that just
came out called ice guardians.

1071
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,680
It's about the history
of enforcers and hockey,

1072
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:43,050
and I would love to hear your
take on it if you haven't seen it.

1073
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,860
I watch all of these fucking
things. Um, I haven't seen it,

1074
01:06:46,861 --> 01:06:51,410
but I watched the trailer
and it looked great. Um,

1075
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,080
I don't know about the name.
Ice Guardians.

1076
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:00,590
That sounds somewhere between
a superhero movie and,

1077
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:05,270
um, a musical, a musical on ice

1078
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:10,940
coming to Madison Square Garden.
It's ice guardians,

1079
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,850
Fossey hands skating around
the ice. Um, he said,

1080
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:17,640
thanks for all the laughs and for always
making me feel better about the way I

1081
01:07:17,641 --> 01:07:21,210
read things out loud.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1082
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,340
Here's the link to the
trailer. Okay, I'll,

1083
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,670
I'll send out this link here
to the trailer. By the way. Um,

1084
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:33,270
I'm going to be at the south
by southwest on Tuesday.

1085
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:34,590
I'm flying in Tuesday.

1086
01:07:34,591 --> 01:07:38,280
I'm doing a podcast with Al Madrigal
for all things comedy network,

1087
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,450
and then I'm a flying
right back out that night.

1088
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,040
That's it. Boom. Doing a Putt,
landing, doing a podcast,

1089
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,900
jump it back on the plane and flying back.

1090
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:51,120
That's my dedication
to the goddamn network,

1091
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:56,100
and also my dedication to fucking coming
back to see my daughter. That's it.

1092
01:07:56,101 --> 01:07:58,620
And after that, I got
three days, a Monday,

1093
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,680
a Tuesday or Wednesday at
the Improv in San Jose Cruz.

1094
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,630
Um, and I think that that's
my, that'll be my fucking, uh,

1095
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,730
that'll be my month. That's it. All
right. Thanks. Listen to podcasts.

1096
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,770
Go fuck yourselves. I'll check
in on you on Thursday. And,

1097
01:08:19,771 --> 01:08:24,030
uh, I think that's it. That is
it. All right. Go Fuck Yourself.
