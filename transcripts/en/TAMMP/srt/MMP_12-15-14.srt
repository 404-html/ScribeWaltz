1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,350
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,570
November. No, sorry. December,
December. Sorry. Sorry about that.

3
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:14,190
December 15th, 2014 sure. Some new

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,970
fucking uploaded the rule.
Big Fail.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,530
Okay.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,570
What a fucking loser,
man.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,810
You Internet comments
just up your fucking ass.

8
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,500
All the God damn time.
You know it's some fucking very rarely.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,540
Very rarely do too.
Why ever block anybody on Twitter?

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,860
Just because I don't want to give people
the satisfaction that they bugged me

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,050
and this technology
fucking cunt bugged me.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,960
He bought, you know what I
am? What am I an asshole?

13
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,340
How long have I been
in this Internet game?

14
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:55,810
I'm going to tell you
what the fuck he said.

15
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,210
I'm not going to tell you what he said.
Go Fuck Yourself.

16
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:01,810
So could you guys all warming up your
fucking little Flan. Geez. There to go.

17
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,010
Send me a fucking tweet. I know
what the Flange, these tassels,

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,700
metatarsal flange. Geez,
that's on your feet. Right?

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,680
And then carpals metacarpals Phalanges.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,360
Remember that when you took biology class
and they talked about the bio juices,

21
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,560
whatever the fuck they did.
No,

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,240
the whole place cause I have to tell
your respiratory system, the respiratory,

23
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:27,241
so still this massive data
scientists for centuries.

24
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,940
Um Oh God.

25
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:34,941
Did that bring back some fucking bad
goddamn there anything good about am I

26
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,530
think one of my science
classes is that like,

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,340
you know with the books back in the day
you had to sign your name, right? Yeah.

28
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,990
In the year you had the books,
so then you get books, you know,

29
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:50,140
and he knows somebody in the grade above.
You got your old math book right.

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,010
Y'All ain't good about my science class
was I got the same book is the hottest

31
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:57,720
chick, two grades in
front of me, you know,

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,530
so it was just sitting back there with
my orange hair, not even listening,

33
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,350
just to be like,

34
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,280
she actually hold this book.
Oh my God.

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,680
That was the old thing and
enjoyable about science class.

36
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,760
What's funny now is I,
I love science.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,040
I love fucking science.
The sound of the shit,

38
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,180
the fucking crappy ozone layer
was that I love a parade.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,690
How simple his life back then
when you could just write a song,

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,030
you could write a song like that.
First of all,

41
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,550
no one would even question your sexuality,
right?

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,030
You could just fucking rattle one of
those off little sound with the beat.

43
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:36,864
The fucking trumpets.

44
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,590
I come walking by [inaudible]
who didn't love a fucking parade?

45
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,430
What else were you doing?

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:42,980
Okay.

47
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,120
Standing around.

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,030
Okay.

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,930
Going out and shooting the
fucking varmint, dragging it in,

50
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,850
carrying it by its fucking tail.

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,950
Fucking wife for their huge dress goes
all the way down to her ankles and up to

52
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,050
her fucking chin,
you know,

53
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,680
to look at where were
all the horse back then?

54
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,940
It's not me.
That was a brothel.

55
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay.

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,060
And what? What did you fucking,
what'd you rub one out too?

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,440
He imagined by a new horse,
right?

58
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,890
Is that what you have
those no celebrities.

59
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,910
What the fuck did you do back all
you gotta do you just fucking,

60
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,690
we're trying to live,
you know?

61
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,640
Yeah. Don't worry about the fucking native
Americans coming back to take what was

62
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,600
rightfully theirs.

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,890
Okay.

64
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,050
Okay. And I can guarantee you
when they came over the hill,

65
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:39,880
the lasting they were doing was gone.
Oh,

66
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,300
they didn't.
Those fucking things,

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,380
those fucking takes those,
you know,

68
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,720
as I was already trying to think
of the animal to compare to. Sorry,

69
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,450
didn't mean didn't mean to offend
any casino owners out there.

70
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,520
Those fucking people.

71
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,990
Okay.

72
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,460
Yeah, you had no idea. Remember that
step fucking line and good fellas.

73
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,650
The second I heard all that noise. I knew
they were cops if they were wise guys.

74
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,120
And when you shut the fuck up.

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,810
Okay.

76
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,100
They were native Americans.

77
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:16,101
You'd be fucking hanging upside down by
a tree right above your Cadillac before

78
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:19,030
you put the keys in the ignition.
You'd have no fucking idea.

79
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:23,390
And then they'd slowly skin you alive.
A breaky on the wheel. All right,

80
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,460
Henry Hill. Um, Daniel, what
the fuck I'm talking about?

81
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,670
Ah, whatever. This fucking
technology content, you know,

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,950
it's like all you douchebags last,

83
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:38,970
last week when I was calling iclouds
soundcloud and you guys thought it was

84
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:41,700
fucking hilarious.
I actually was proud of the fact that,

85
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:44,820
I don't know what the fuck it's called.
You know?

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,990
Is that your big fucking claim to fame?
All you fucking douchebag.

87
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,710
Ellie's none at all. You just said
small. They just, you guys live.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,700
Yeah,

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,430
you get on the few Staci. Let me
tell you something. All right,

90
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:01,630
you middle of nowhere.
Fucking staring at a computer screen.

91
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,950
Can't you go start a podcast? You riff
for a fucking hour and 20 minutes.

92
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,320
All right?
You're gonna make some mistakes.

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,320
Half the time you're trying to think what
the fuck am I going to talk about next

94
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,020
door and say I was talking to Joe Rosa.
We did an uninformed,

95
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,430
I was all excited about those Mercedes
Benz that I checked out and all that shit

96
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,130
and I, I fucked up. I was talking
about a wagon. How's that?

97
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,770
Is four or a coop or whatever.

98
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,690
This fucking guy.
All capital letters.

99
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:34,170
Freaking the fuck out because they
said four door coupe instead of sedan.

100
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,530
Did your too

101
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,040
woo woo woo fucking fell. Oh,

102
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,420
you know what it is.

103
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,380
What I shouldn't do is I shouldn't
get upset by that nick pick and stuff.

104
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:51,610
What I should really do is read between
the lines and see the misery of that

105
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:56,110
person's life that they just
live for that fucking moment.

106
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,250
Sitting around, listening to a God
damn podcast, waiting for somebody,

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,510
some uneducated asshole to
fuck up so you can write in

108
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,743
right

109
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,370
and feel better about the
all weather carpet underneath
your fucking hammer toes.

110
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,630
I know it's the holiday season.
Dolby,

111
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:19,310
Dolby doe and school Billy Bob.
Stick it up. Your dms guys regard.

112
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,410
We'll do the Christmas wreath or,

113
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,870
yeah,

114
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,320
he's got a red fucking shoe,
which some cotton glued to it.

115
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,820
He probably 23 is that the worst one?

116
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:34,900
They get the fucking awful Santa
Claus. It's like, can you even try?

117
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,060
I mean it's a fucking woman.
Okay.

118
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:45,140
She's got blush on, you know,
you'd make a great Santa Claus,

119
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,630
Tom Kauflin or the New York giants.

120
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,610
That guy would make a great Santa Claus
because Santa clause is not obese.

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,770
He was considered a fat fuck
when I was a kid. That's how,

122
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,060
that's how fucked up my country is right
now. That's how out of shape we are.

123
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,550
Dead like a,
what's his face like?

124
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:07,120
A Santa Claus isn't really considered
fat anymore. What would you call them?

125
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:11,840
Husky. If he had to go buy a new one, a
new red suit by, when would he get that?

126
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,620
Okay.

127
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,960
He probably does it sometime in
the fucking summer. Like, ah,

128
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,790
I gotta do this fucking shit again.
You know,

129
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,780
he takes off like January to May and
then in June or start stretching out the

130
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:22,450
old hammies.

131
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,330
I gotta get him another fucking sued
Jesus Christ can have that shut up.

132
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,250
Lady arrived.
I'm second a fucking out.

133
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,910
If they make the same God damn
day every day, every fucking year.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,080
Save God damn show. All right, so
what does he do? He shaves the beard.

135
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,190
He gets a fucking hair cut.

136
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,780
He rolls down to fucking Tom Ford gets
himself a fitted red suit, you know,

137
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,310
but they don't think he sees a fatty.

138
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,033
Okay.

139
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,470
You know,
that's how fucked up it at this point.

140
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,300
Like that guy would be considered like a,

141
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:54,140
not even a cruiserweight if
he boxed db like welterweight.

142
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,580
And despite the fact that he has a sleigh
that can fly around the fucking world,

143
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,350
your average fat fuck sitting in a
Taco bell could beat him in a fucking

144
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:11,320
fistfight matter. How Nimble he is now.

145
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:11,890
Much omics.

146
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,660
Christmas does t sprinkled on
his fucking Jerry Garcia haircut.

147
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,970
They'd just be some of
Shit is leaning on him.

148
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:19,970
Yeah.

149
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,650
Lean in on just wearing
them down round after round.

150
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,400
Just keeping that one fucking
keeping that arm up. You know,

151
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,150
left keeping the left up. Just covering
this fucking big Ted Kennedy Fed.

152
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,230
Fuckhead leaning on Santa Santa
is work in the fucking body.

153
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,970
Okay.

154
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,630
All right.
Old Tub is just eating him up.

155
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,690
Fucking lean and on Santa loses his hat
halfway through the first round gets in

156
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:47,980
the corner, right. Takes off his jacket.

157
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:51,490
He's got some stayed wife beater
on the Fat Fox and you know,

158
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:55,930
doing the Ali thing, he
doesn't, I don't need and share
it. I'm already know. Right.

159
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,310
He's just walking standing in the corner.
Right.

160
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:02,450
They already got that fucking cold
compress right on fucking San his face.

161
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,380
Okay.

162
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,790
I think when I'm talking about,
all right.

163
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,640
All I know is this Christmas and we're
like fucking 10 days away and I haven't

164
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,570
even fucking,

165
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,950
oh, you know, Dasher and dancer and
Prancer and victim. No, I don't, don't,

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,800
I was standing there. He ain't giving
it to dose, make comment and Cupid.

167
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,090
Donna red bled sin.
But do you recall,

168
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,690
Oh man, what'd you shoot a reindeer.
What'd you shoot a reindeer?

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,790
What'd you do with what if your plane
crashed up near the North Pole? You know,

170
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,080
there it was. You couldn't shoot fucking
Rudolph. That's like shooting Elvis.

171
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,891
You can't do that shit.

172
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:47,000
You gotta wait for him to Odey Odey
sitting on the fucking reindeer toilet,

173
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,010
which is basically what
any words standing.

174
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,460
Okay.

175
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,940
You know, I'm so fucking against
technology. People are just, I've had it.

176
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,660
I just fucking,

177
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,660
I know all the shit that it does for you
and how convenient it makes it and all

178
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:03,550
of that bullshit. Oh, by the way, you
know, piss me off. I was watching this,

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,510
the fucking commercial where they
talk about like the first, uh,

180
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,060
you know how the first half time came
about was basically people, you know,

181
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,360
these fucking, you know, racist
white guys. I mean, you know,

182
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,590
they were back then, right?
Jesus Christ the fuck.

183
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,480
Hmm.

184
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,340
Anybody in a striped fucking uniform
with no face mask. I mean he,

185
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,970
you could only imagine what was coming
out or red Granger's miles back in the

186
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,110
day.
The Gallup and ghost straight.

187
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,590
So they got this commercial where it's
like supposed to be that era and these

188
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,590
guys are playing football and then
talking about how the first half time came

189
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:42,670
around and basically how it came around
was these guys were playing and a bunch

190
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:46,690
of fucking ladies came by with some pop.

191
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,540
They came by with like some coke or
whatever, the f Pepsi of Fucking,

192
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,340
I don't know what tab.
I don't know what they brought.

193
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,160
Okay.

194
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,930
The whole fucking thing is, you
know, it's just a metaphor, right?

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,160
It's like you're a guy, you're on point,
you have a fucking goal and what happens?

196
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,490
Pussy walks in the room and
everything gets thrown to the wayside.

197
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:09,410
And next thing you know, you're 53 going,
wait a minute. What the fuck happened? Ah,

198
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,890
I want it to be an astronaut. Hi. I
wanted to learn how to play the Tuba.

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,170
I wanted to own a fucking hair salon.
What happened?

200
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,530
Plus he came in the wrong,

201
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,910
you took your eye off the ball
and you started drinking some pop.

202
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,150
I ain't know.
They say that in the Midwest in fact,

203
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:35,590
that they call it pop and then they
say, pop, you want some pap? No.

204
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:39,780
Do you have any soda? Soda? What's that?

205
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,210
I can't do a Midwest accent.
As you can see,

206
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:47,190
I've gotta be out there hanging
around with those cons. Um, hang on.

207
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,590
I just remind me of something about
the southern tour I want to do next.

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Fucking I type that in. So I
write them st later. Anyways,

209
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,360
so long story short,
because the women's show up,

210
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,640
these guys who are fucking knocking
the hell out of each other,

211
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,490
basically inventing the NFL,
they stop

212
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,540
and they look at each other and
like, hey, you know, maybe uh,

213
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,710
one of them will give us a one of them
fucking 23 is good news over there.

214
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,500
What he say? What did we just knock off
for like 15 minutes to go over there?

215
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,610
A sprite? You know, the guy's
like, what the fuck's is
sprite? It doesn't exist yet.

216
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,390
Douche bag. So, all right, let's get a
coke. It has got to be Coca Cola, right?

217
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,170
What was that? The first one?
And they went over there. I mean,

218
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,010
the original Coca Cola had a little
bit of blowing it. Next thing you know,

219
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:30,830
they're dumping it down her ass crack,
right?

220
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,570
The whole fucking gang
goes out the window.

221
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,000
But that's not the problem that
I have with that commercial.

222
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:39,140
The problem I have is in the middle of it,
somebody takes an old timey camera,

223
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,150
turns it around on them and does a selfie.

224
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,630
Now I know the people
who made that commercial.

225
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,490
I'm going to give him the credit
to be like, they realize that no,

226
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:49,460
we took a fucking selfie back then.
Okay. No, we took a fucking selfie.

227
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,310
Not only did you not take a Selfie,
nobody smiled and photos back then.

228
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,640
I don't know when the fuck that started,
but if you look back in the day,

229
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,410
nobody is smiling in photos unless
you caught him off guard. Okay?

230
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,660
They're doing a little Jig or some shit.

231
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,120
And you took a picture
with that fucking cannon.

232
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,560
That fucking gunpowder fucking went up.
Sorry for everybody's ears here.

233
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,670
I didn't realize it
was gonna be that loud.

234
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,340
Fucking would go off in the background.
Right?

235
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,790
Okay.

236
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,970
And then you know that. Then the guy be
like, you just take my fucking texture.

237
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,250
Okay.

238
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,800
Yeah.
What's all the smoke in there for?

239
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,060
Do you keep that fucking witchcraft
away from me, buddy? All right.

240
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,040
Nobody fucking smile.
You understand?

241
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,780
When they took pictures
of the native Americans.

242
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,520
The reason why they didn't smile,

243
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,830
they all fucking world was going to a
help than a fucking hand basket by a bunch

244
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,180
of fucking Douche bags

245
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,560
whose ancestors were eventually going to
walk around wearing those fucking beats

246
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,830
by Dre,
which aren't even that good ad folks.

247
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,710
Oh, now they're wireless. Tell you what,

248
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,800
fuck the technology making them
fucking no invisible wires.

249
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,970
Why don't you make them good?

250
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,600
So somebody gave me, I got a fucking
pair of those goddamn things.

251
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,010
I was listening to a fuck fucking
year and I finally just sat around.

252
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,030
Any of these things aren't that good.
I can hear the music,

253
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,220
but it's not blowing my mind.

254
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,060
Okay?

255
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,310
You know what beats by Dre or,

256
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,730
and this isn't against Dr Dre
cause he already sold the company.

257
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:23,220
He's sitting on $1 billion. Think he
gives a fuck. He doesn't give a fuck.

258
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:26,250
Plus I never fucking trash anybody.
He's got a scar on the neck. Okay,

259
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,680
that guy saw death stare
it down one and then what?

260
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,540
I'm going to come at him with. Where
am I fucking PJ's? I don't think so.

261
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,033
All right.

262
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,890
And if you think I'm the kind of guy
who's going to do something like that,

263
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,970
you're listening to the wrong
power podcast, my friend. Okay.

264
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,150
Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning
podcast and it's 10 days before Christmas.

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,850
Don't, whoa. Who wouldn't go?

266
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,840
Yo Paul who wouldn't go all up
on the house top click, click,

267
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,930
click down through the chimney with
those Saint Nick gonna. Fuck that.

268
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,900
I remember that one.
Just trying to sing when different,

269
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,670
you know what fucking Christmas song.

270
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,920
I absolutely is a bunch
of them that I don't like,

271
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,420
but the one that just really would
wear on me with silver bells,

272
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,530
silver bowels sale verb or a Raga
in and around the Christmas tree.

273
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:20,650
I am white and I'm giving it a shot.
Um,

274
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,390
Bob in my head,
like a fucking end dose.

275
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,320
Where in this title suit.
Oh,

276
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,440
the missile total shoved up.
Yolo fucking plot. This is the,

277
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,720
this is when the guy scant sang it,
you know,

278
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,600
and he was just trying to feel out some
words. You know what? We'll put Christmas,

279
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:43,370
he shit in there. Let's just jam with
the band, right? Well to psalm body suck.

280
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:47,180
My Dick bought up beat by dude.
Oh Emmalie right.

281
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,550
That's probably what they did right
down there at capitol records.

282
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,730
We have a melody. If you could just
sort of riff on it, Dag and do that

283
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,890
jingle bells, jingle bells
jangled and down the street yet,

284
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,470
but bad in Edd. I got a
friend named Pete. Oh,

285
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,980
something Christmas. Get her a gift.
Maybe they don't shut her the fuck up.

286
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,990
That's how am I feeling it today
guys? Shut down. Shut down.

287
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,210
Um, all right. It's
probably, Oh, you know what?

288
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,660
It is time to do some advertising and
the most important advertising than I do

289
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:27,860

Okay.

318

Sick of that shit.
Comics tell a fucking joke.

319
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:22,610
Somebody records it and then they got,
they talk to the fucking comic about it.

320
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,230
I didn't say that shit to you.
I sent it to the people in the crowd.

321
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,310
I told a joke and a comedy
club not on a news program.

322
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,380
You've brought the wrong

dressing room on Broadway.

327
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,430
Okay.

328

He's leaving the Charles Nelson
Reilly suite to go do this.

00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:59,460
Taking time out of his schedule. Um,

five, eight, one, one, two, one, two.

335
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,020
If you live anywhere in New York City,

336
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,900
you want to see one of the best comedy
shows of the year that also all the

337

the fucking building. Other than that,

this is above the board.

339
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,550
There'll be no pick microphones,

340
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,820
no mustaches grown now support the troops
and then I keep all the fucking money.

341
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,430
None of that shit. All right?
Everybody's donating their time. This is,

342
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,280
it makes a great Christmas gift and a,

343
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,830
it's the best money you ever going to
spend. It's such a great thing to do.

344
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,370
Absolutely love doing this. And
I thank all the Comedians, um,

345
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:51,070
over the years that have done this and
we're just going to keep expanding it.

346
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,160
And I learned this year that I love that
Michael Che and Hannibal Burress are on

347
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,680
it because now we've got some younger
guys that were actually influenced by

348
00:19:56,681 --> 00:20:00,620
Patrice has comedy. If you
don't know who he is. Um,

349
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,010
I'm actually jealous because now you're
going to get to discover the funniest

350
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:07,520
fucking guy I ever met. Elephant
in the room. Download that.

351
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:09,320
Please do all of this legally.
Uh,

352
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,210
so that the money goes to the
people he cares about. Um, is great,

353
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,660
wonderful. A CD, whatever
you kids call it now,

354
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:21,650
downloadable fucking CD
laser disc thing. Mr P, uh,

355
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,550
so funniest fucking guy I haven't met.
He's the best comedian I ever saw.

356
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,080
And uh,
if he was still alive,

357
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,050
I would have chased him my whole career
and I never would have caught up and he

358
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:36,620
would have just continued to widen the
gap. I mean, he just was the fucking man.

359
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,990
So please,
for the love of God,

360
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,500
we've got a couple hundred
tickets left and, uh,

361
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,790
makes a great stocking
stuffer. Um, all right,

362
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,420
let's get to the fucking corporate ones.

363
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,440
Were all Billy whore bag reads these
things? Oh my God, look what's back.

364
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,790
Everybody had Sherry's berries.
Oh,

365
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,270
it's gotta be a holiday coming up.
Don't get you tinsel in a tangle.

366
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,660
There's more than one way to get
your shopping for the holidays done.

367
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,730
So don't get your tensile in a tangle.

368
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,630
You already said that you don't have
to get burned out with the crowds.

369
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:15,160
Instead shop with the convenience right
from your home. Christmas is next week.

370
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:19,690
You'd dumb bastards with only in certain
number of days left until Christmas.

371
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,310
I got to do math now. There's 10
days left. Everybody does that.

372
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:28,420
Make him fucking nervous enough to
buy chocolate, strawberries, um,

373
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,230
rapid and deliver your, uh, 10
days left till wrap to shop,

374
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,610

375
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,970

skip the crowds all together by Sherry's

377
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,650
freshly dipped strawberries from
Sherry's berries starting at 1999.

378
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,270
That's over a 40% savings.

379
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,690
How the fuck would we know that as
that when you watch the stock market,

380
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,400

It takes watching football for that man

414
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,910
level. You're a season long fantasy

lose your shirt. I mean it
is gambling. True Story.

418
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:13,280
One player turned 10 bucks into five
grand and other turn two bucks into 10,000

419
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,460
another guy lost his rent money.
It's all how you play the game.

423
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,100
There's no c in defense. Why, by the way,
you're dummies. It's d e f. E. N. S. E.

424
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,990

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:55,670
All right. He voice. All right. I love
the flexibility that, oh, that, um,

429
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,230
of owning my own personal business.
Evidently, uh, look at me.

430
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,910
I've created an empire with this show.

431
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:05,600
But when it comes to handling business
calls, just stuck with the challenge.

432
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,420
Either you've got to hire a full time
receptionist is gonna be bitching,

433
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:11,420
moaning and complaining,
and then you need stuff to chair.

434
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,120
Do I get any benefits?

Uh, where do we go? Where do we owe,

456
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,410
you know what? I had an acting Gig, uh,

457
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,340
this past week and on Friday I got to
work with an actor named Brad Carter,

458
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:49,420
who you guys have seen in a zillion
things. And I was actually imitating him,

459
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,580
uh, back in the day when true detective
came out and he played that inmate,

460
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,110
you know, when a Matthew mcconaughey
character goes into the guy,

461
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,770
went Reggie to do
regiment, do, do dat shit,

462
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,460
fucking unbelievable actor.
And next thing you know,

463
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:07,990
old freckles gets an acting gig.

464
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:10,720
And who am I sitting across
from this same fucking dude?

465
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,610
And he was so God damn funny
and scary at the same time,

466
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,860
all while eating Bologna sandwiches.
That's all I can tell you about it. Uh,

467
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,770
but my face still hurts from trying
not to fucking blow takes, uh,

468
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,930
you know, laughing cause he's such
an end. He always played like,

469
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,800
like character actors are amazing
to me. Like, uh, they just,

470
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,830
how they make a living and how much
they have to hustle and all that.

471
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:38,800
And he was talking about how excited he
was to do something that was, you know,

472
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:42,460
had a comedy background
and now he's always playing
these psychos and everything.

473
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,100
So we're on like whatever the 10th take.

474
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:50,101
He's on like his fucking ninth fucking
Bologna Sandwich cause he feels like he

475
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:54,850
has to eat it to get into this character,
which is totally fucking working. Right.

476
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,800
And I, we ended up
asking him, uh, he said,

477
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,990
he mentioned he had to be on set the
very next day at 7:00 AM and we're still

478
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:05,470
shooting it like fucking 10
at night trying to get this
fucking dog to walk into

479
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:09,130
the room, sit down and look over at the
camera. Right. And he says, hi. He goes,

480
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,470
I got to be on set tomorrow at
seven. I'm like, Jesus Christ,

481
00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:13,420
I don't know how you'd do it. He
goes, no, I'm loving. I love it, man.

482
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:16,930
I'm happy to be working. So he's talking
about how, oh, we always play psychos.

483
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:20,320
I go, Whoa, what do you, what are
you playing tomorrow? And he goes,

484
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,154
I'm playing a rape.

485
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,920
Okay.
In

486
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,340
a independent movie called eat me.
Um,

487
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,960
that's what the debt is being made
right now. So look out for Brad Carter.

488
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,400
He shooting eat meat right now and a
watch true detective and look them up.

489
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:43,230
He also, um, had brain surgery and uh,

490
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,500
for this little thing that he had
going on, I'll let him explain it,

491
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:49,110
but this is unbelievable video
where he's playing guitar.

492
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:53,880
He's a musician while they're checking
out his brain to see if they put the

493
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:57,360
thing in the right place, it's
fucking unbelievable. We'll,
we'll upload it. But, uh,

494
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,351
you know,

495
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:03,000
if you really like character actors and
people just disappear into it to the

496
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,730
point you want you to go. And where
the fuck do I know this guy? Wait, no,

497
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:09,960
I fucked Dorthy and Brad Carter.
That shit man, right there. Um,

498
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,620
so anyways,
let's,

499
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,450
let's get onto some shit here
that I'm really excited about.

500
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,900
I know that I've been bitching.
I know that I've been moaning.

501
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,210
I know that I'd been bitch moaning and
complaining the whole time about this

502
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:28,020
construction downstairs. Guess
what? Everybody, it's fucking done.

503
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,190
The motherfucker is done.
There's a couple of little knickknacks.

504
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,420
They get a stick in these fucking, I
dunno, the plates over the light switches.

505
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:37,254
Little Bullshit,

506
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,260
like that little fucking bullshit
like that and it fucking awesome.

507
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,620
Absolutely beautiful. Absolutely
gorgeous. It costs me a fucking fortune.

508
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,100
I will never make my
money back in this house.

509
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,280
And I say go vegan right now
and try to live to be 106,

510
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:59,090
but I've just made the decision that I'm
not leaving. I'm not fucking leaving,

511
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,730
right.
Just all the cons.

512
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,870
I'm erasing all the fucking
cops who have lived here. Um,

513
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,930
exercise and the demons of every one
of these motherfuckers that went cheap.

514
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,340
You know, I got this ugly ass. Fuck. I
don't know. There's like, there's no,

515
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,860
I don't know what to tell you what the
color is of the rug and the bedroom that

516
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,570
I'm in right now. So
I'm thinking, you know,

517
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,880
there's hardwood floors
underneath this fucking thing.

518
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,750
So I started to pull back the rug,
you know,

519
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,990
for a future project and guess what's
under the rug? Fucking plywood.

520
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,460
And underneath the plywood is
the original hardwood floors.

521
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,610
What kind of a fucking animal?
You know what it was?

522
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:42,340
It was probably done in the 70s you know,

523
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,170
when wall to wall carpet was
just considered so fucking plush.

524
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,770
What it was is after years of
people just walking around on ward,

525
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,210
first it was dark, right? Was
probably stone or some shit, right?

526
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:58,990
He lived in a fucking cave and then you
just had stone in the fucking shit was

527
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:03,370
cold. Nobody could afford rugs,
right? It's expensive or whatever.

528
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,530
Your wife started net and one
by the time she finished it,

529
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,290
she had tuberculosis and she died.
And every time he looked at the rug,

530
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:12,250
he thought of her. She gave it to
somebody else. So people's feet,

531
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,140
they were sick of being
cold. They get, you know,

532
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,070
getting splinters and that type of
shit, which, you know, buy it back.

533
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:19,110
Then you got an infection,

534
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,840
then you fucking died or somebody
came in and saw your foot off. Right.

535
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,050
Is he had a fucking know you bit down on
a fucking angel, whatever that happened

536
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,500
because there was no anesthesia.

537
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,900
So after centuries of that bullshit wall
to wall carpeting seemed like a good

538
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:41,940
idea, you know? And uh,

539
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,720
it wasn't,
you know,

540
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:50,140
what's the most disgusting thing when it
comes to copywriting is carpeting in a

541
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,280
bathroom every once in a while.
Right? I like, you know, you,

542
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,490
when they have like an open house,

543
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,190
I'm one of those constant just walks into
your house and I'm not going to buy it

544
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,340
cause I just want to look at it and get
ideas and just see how's this fucking

545
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:03,880
douche limit. Right. It's like
when you go to Elvis's house,

546
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,350
he always felt like a creep.
You know,

547
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,570
you've got to Elvis's house and you
want to go in there and laugh at him.

548
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,400
Then you walk in and you
realize this was his home,

549
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,360
and I'm walking around looking for peanut
butter and banana sandwiches because I

550
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:16,300
want to laugh at this guy and it's
just like sky accomplished more than a

551
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,350
weekend than I ever did in my life.

552
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,400
And he's buried in the backyard and we
just won't give the guy at the piece that

553
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,580
he deserves that even spell his
fucking name right in the grave.

554
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,190
One of the most exploited stars of all
fucking time. He'd go across the street,

555
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:28,961
does it gift shop,

556
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:32,740
and they turned them into a cuckoo clock
and a fucking coffee strainer and every

557
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:36,280
fucking filter, every God damn fucking
thing you can think of with Elvis on it.

558
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:42,060
You know, this is an Elvis fan.
There's nothing Elvis about that.

559
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:46,220
Press the button. Ooh, Yay. Hi.

560
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,520
Just start singing a song.

561
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,260
They paid little mutton chops
on the fucking fan blades.

562
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,330
So anyways, every once in a while
you'd go and do an old house

563
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,000
and you know what's up?
My favorite thing that,

564
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,470
see when you walk into an old house and
you smell an old person, you know like,

565
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:05,011
oh my God,

566
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:09,750
this shit be going to see shit
in here from the 1950s right.

567
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:12,930
And you walk in there and you see like
the old kitchen and the old bathrooms and

568
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:13,321
all that,

569
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:18,321
and you just see all the errors of
styles that the house is fucking lived

570
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:20,730
through.
You know,

571
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,350
that fucking lime green toilet seat cover
or the plastic cracked fucking toilet

572
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,540
seat itself. You know, where they made it,

573
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,080
like that squishy shit that was supposed
to be comfortable and then it cracked

574
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,720
after a while and then they would
just have wall to wall carpeting.

575
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:41,640
And you just sit there looking at
it. Good. Oh my God. The fucking

576
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,690
health department.
Like how many restaurants?

577
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,070
I mean if you had that in any
restaurant, like, like the 10,

578
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:54,600
any restaurant within a fucking five mile
vicinity would be fucking shut down to

579
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:59,560
have carpeting in a fucking bathroom.
Absolutely disgusting. So anyways,

580
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,543
um,

581
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,550
so what I love about the downstairs
now is it's fucking, it's level,

582
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,870
it's clean,
everything works.

583
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,920
It's just fucking awesome and it's
right in time for the fucking holidays.

584
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,080
And I'm, I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled
with it. You know, it's funny,

585
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:21,690
as the guy who sold me this house, he
keeps calling me up every once in a while,

586
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,580
right? In know they do the call you
up like a fucking old girlfriend.

587
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,010
They can just feel you're
starting to love your house.

588
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,890
So they got to put that doubt in your
head day bill. Are you doing? Yeah.

589
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,010
Tell you it's a great time,

590
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,360
great time to get right back out there
and fucking start all over again.

591
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,483
You know,

592
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,300
the great thing is when you invest so
much in your house that you never going to

593
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:48,630
make any money off of it. You don't
give a fuck anymore. You're like, well,

594
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:52,160
I'm never leaving.
I'm gonna Redo this whole fucking thing.

595
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,910
Let me see if I can go broke on
this fucking thing. So, um, anyways,

596
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,170
you won't hear me bitching
about it anymore. Um,

597
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,390
it's done. And now that it's done,
it looks fucking gorgeous and, uh,

598
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,880
it was worth every,
every cent of it.

599
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,240
And your next question is going to be
built and we see pictures of it and no you

600
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:14,970
cannot. No you can't.
What are you an asshole?

601
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,750
Showing the pictures of the inside of my
fucking house isn't enough that I'm in

602
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:23,730
my house talking to you.
Fucking creep. Um, anyways.

603
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,680
Yay.

604
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:30,681
Look who she just walked
in all needy face.

605
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,690
Why don't you grab a, grab a
microphone, set up the old chord there.

606
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,180
Um, see what I wanted to talk
about. Anything here. Oh,

607
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,120
by the way,
as a new England Patriot Fan,

608
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,330
I am so fucking jealous of the
Seattle Seahawks defense man.

609
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,210
They just look fucking great.
And I'll tell you right,

610
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,930
I made fun of Pete Carroll for
years and uh, I was never more raw.

611
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,480
I mean, I, I never thought that he
was a bad coach or anything like that,

612
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:01,290
but that fucking guy is going to go.

613
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,760
He already,
he's,

614
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:07,761
he's one of two people who ever won a
Ncaa Division One championship in football

615
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,660
and also on the Superbowl. The other
guy was Barry Switzer, but you know,

616
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,280
no disrespect to Barry, he's a great
coach and all that type of shit. But he,

617
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,200
he won with Jimmy Johnson's team.
All right. Pete Carroll, you know,

618
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,300
you know what happened? The NCAA
was, the wolf was at the back door.

619
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,510
He got the fuck out of there.
And uh, he went up there.

620
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,800
What was Seattle at that point?
They were not thing. And uh,

621
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:38,460
he's turned it around and he's right now.
What's your watch you Pete Carroll Do,

622
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,080
is one of the hardest fucking things you
can ever do is to have a team that won

623
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:47,080
the championship the year before,
come out and,

624
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:51,540
and somehow the next season
motivate them where they're hungry,

625
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,660
not they want to win it again. They
always want to win it again, but they,

626
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:58,140
they have a hunger in them,
it seems when you're watching,

627
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:01,830
like they haven't won it yet.
Like they still have something to prove.

628
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,090
And earlier this season,

629
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:05,910
I really look at Pete Carol
and Bill Bella check this year,

630
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,470
who was kind of the same thing where the
first six, five, six games or whatever,

631
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,790
they had to figure out what their team
was because every year people leave,

632
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:16,860
people come in,
it's a little bit different.

633
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,480
And I'm watching Pete Carroll do some
bill Bellacheck shit where it's like he

634
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,291
knows what he has,

635
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:27,291
he knows how to work it now he knows
it's thick though I don't know as much as

636
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,550
my patriots or 11 and three.

637
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,740
I feel like I still feel like
the level of play in the NFC, uh,

638
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,760
is, it's on, it's another level. Um,

639
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,660
I would never bet against, uh, you know,

640
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,710
Bella check and Brady if anybody
could figure out how to fucking,

641
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,910
I dunno. Seattle looks like
fucking world beaters man.

642
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:55,620
So my money's on them at this point.
They just look like

643
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,890
they look fucking unstoppable and uh,
their QB there, Wilson, that guy is,

644
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,220
uh, is that even his fucking
name? I was so god damn old.

645
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:09,300
I can't remember names anymore. That
fucking guy is the real deal. I, you know,

646
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,790
and all you kids out there
who are starting to say verse,

647
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,160
he might've been right about Mark Sanchez.
I cannot help you.

648
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,680
I can't help you.
Firs even texted me that don't I,

649
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,890
you know I might've met rant about this
guy. It's like Paul, you watched the,

650
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,630
first of all,
Paul Versey is not right.

651
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:27,620
Whether the guy's great or
whether he sticks Paul verse,

652
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:31,740
he said after the first three games of
a quarterback's career, guy's a star.

653
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,740
Like based on what Paul,
based on what?

654
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,870
Sitting at home watching front of
fucking TV, never talking to him.

655
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,020
Never seen him in the locker room get you.
You threw a fucking Hail Mary.

656
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,010
This is the deal was Sanchez. Okay.
I think he's a good quarterback.

657
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,540
I think he could win
the Superbowl with them,

658
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,390
but the defense has to be unfucking
believable. We're talking some,

659
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,360
I'm not saying he's a Trent Dilfer
it, he's beyond that guy. Okay.

660
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:57,361
But to sit there and act like
this guy is like on a Brady level,

661
00:38:57,581 --> 00:39:01,960
a Peyton manning level like Tom
Brady paint man and guys like that.

662
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:05,290
And I even think there's Wilson guy
like could could get to that level.

663
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,820
Like those guys are so fucking good.
Even if you suck,

664
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,390
even if everybody around them
suck, you know, as a wide receiver,

665
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:17,290
if you come in there and you kind of
stank and everyone around you stinks and

666
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,720
all of a sudden you're the number one
receiver because everybody's stinks.

667
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,950
You still know you're getting a thousand
yards because Tom Brady or Peyton

668
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,630
Manning's giving you the fucking ball.
Sanchez is not at that level, all right?

669
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:29,920
That guy, if he has a great team,
he's great, and other words,

670
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,280
he'll win the fucking game but
won't fuck it up, all right?

671
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,550
But when people start to leave and,
and, and the talent level dips,

672
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,030
it's but fumble time,
okay.

673
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,510
And I did not see that ever with somebody.
You know the higher guys,

674
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,560
the Damn Marino's, the fucking Peyton
Manning's the Tom Brady's, okay?

675
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:49,150
So enough with this shit,
okay,

676
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,460
stop watching fucking football
week to week and going,

677
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,330
this guy is this and now he's this,
now he's dead. Go fuck yourselves.

678
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:55,871
All of you guys,

679
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:59,770
you guys can all go listen to the
fucking fuzzy effect and fucking rob,

680
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:03,970
do a circle jerk and pat yourselves on
the back with your horrific predictions.

681
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,770
I love you Paul. All right, Nia. Hi. Hey,

682
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:13,030
what's going on? You're here
just in time for the, um, for,

683
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,110
for getting into the, uh, the
questions. Perfect. I told him, boy,

684
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,360
let me turn this up here. Uh, I told them
how the downstairs is finally, right.

685
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,210
Uh, what do you mean? I mean, there's
a couple of things. Yeah, I know.

686
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,400
I told I'm not,

687
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:33,401
I cannot muster this endless enthusiasm
that you seem to have until it's done,

688
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:38,690
until it's 100% fucking done.

689
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,030
I know till every single little
piece is, is done. And you know what?

690
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,590
I went down there and there was a
couple of fucking things. I'm like,

691
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,960
that's the thing.
That's why I don't keep going down there.

692
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:51,620
So you keep going down there every day
and I understand that it's important to

693
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,190
check on it, but like, you're like Judah
has zero, zero, zero was like every day.

694
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:55,491
And it's like,

695
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:58,580
I can't go downstairs every day because
I will see a hundred things wrong with

696
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,600
it and I'm just, I'm, I'm giving them time
to do their thing, you know, I'm like,

697
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:06,350
hey, we're done. Then I can
look and be like, are you done?

698
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,640
Are you really done? Hey, I'm
Billy. Big Eyes, really big ass

699
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,710
billboard bar. I still haven't
seen your billboard in real life.

700
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,590
What do you want to see it? You
know what I'm saying? Yay. Oh,

701
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:23,440
don't be so modest. Well
that's a well, yeah.

702
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,050
What am I going to bring up a fucking
billboard on my own fucking podcast.

703
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,600
Well you didn't bring it up. I did. Hey,
by the way, very proud of you. Thank you.

704
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,020
I'm very proud of shut up.

705
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,520
Um, by the way, for you guys, like I
somehow I just like, I sent a link.

706
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:41,510
Do you really want to get people going
send any sort of link about global

707
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:45,350
warming? Like the people who
were, I don't think it exists.

708
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,230
Like they always say the same thing. They
go like, oh, looks blue. Fuck a Polaroid.

709
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,210
He always talking about the
ice age is age of the ice caps.

710
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,080
Well, you had the ice age and then
it all melted, right? Right. Yeah,

711
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:03,250
the dinosaurs and then what the fucking
ice age came and they died. Whatever our,

712
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,660
our fucking or hit whatever
it fucking happen. Right?

713
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,630
But while you sit there and look at it,

714
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:12,020
somebody who's fucking got
a lazy eye flow history,

715
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,850
the fucking plans gone from periods
warming up and cooling, right?

716
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:20,660
You're talking to like a
dentist, Jake, and he, and I'm
arguing and I'm a comedian.

717
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,220
This is like, this is, this is okay.
What they're talking about is the rate,

718
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:29,990
the unprecedented rate of
how fast it is heating up.

719
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,130
All right, here's another thing I just
saw is that, that's what the argument is.

720
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,420
Not whether or not the planet heats up and
cools down. Well, it's fucking history.

721
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,260
It's the unprecedented rate that it is
doing. Any, any, any, any alarming. Great.

722
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,620
Um, I almost said get that word out and
like, Hey, what are you talking about?

723
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,200
Even nobody knows me.
I'm trying to fill a fucking hour here.

724
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,840
There's over 5 trillion pieces of fucking
plastic estimated estimated over 5

725
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,300
trillion in the ocean. Okay. Yes. It's
terrible. I know I'm not talking to you.

726
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:04,820
I'm talking to a few people.
Give me shit about it.

727
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,720
I'll sit there and act and think that
we don't have like an effect on this

728
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:09,590
fucking planet.

729
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,160
Like do you know those places in the
United States where you just can't live

730
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,850
there because of whatever we put
in the ground, nuclear waste,

731
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:19,550
whatever shit and it's just you can't
fucking live there or you will die.

732
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,120
Nothing that is alive can live
there. It's just dead zones. Name,

733
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:26,970
name one other fucking animal.
I mean Gypsy Moss, Caterpillar.

734
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,290
This is the closest thing I can come from.
What Gypsy moth caterpillars.

735
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,990
Gypsy moth caterpillars. They come up and
real thing. Yeah. They just want, want,

736
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,580
want, want, want, want more.
Come on up from the South Wall.

737
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,970
Doesn't help me envision and the,

738
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,100
and they would just sit there and they
would eat up all the trees and stuff and

739
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:46,190
people would have to put like a little
piece of plastic around the tree guy.

740
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,770
You are talking about five different
things. What are you saying?

741
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:49,431
You were saying that you,

742
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:52,640
there are places that you can't live and
then you said there's a Ma except for

743
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:56,570
the math gypsy. Like they're the only
ones that can survive in these areas. No,

744
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:58,610
I'm saying name another animal.

745
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,850
That fucking affects the planet
the way we do at firstly. I,

746
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:08,260
yeah, I don't, I don't know. I am not a,
I'm a specialist in that area. Oh yeah.

747
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,000
You're missing the whole
point of this spot.

748
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,530
You're missing will not speculate on it.

749
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,270
You're missing the whole point
of the podcast. The holes.
What honey? The point is,

750
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,470
you don't know what you're talking
about, but to, you know, I mean me. Oh,

751
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:24,980
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I've seen when you come on the podcast,

752
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,840
you don't know what you're talking about,

753
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:30,800
but that by no means stops
you from pontificating.

754
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,190
True and throwing out

755
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
facts

756
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,730
that are facts in your world of
science and your world alone. Hang on.

757
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:41,670
I got to read two more advertisements
here and then we'll do the, uh,

let's get to the content for this week.

812
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,590
All right. Aren't you worried about the
wonderful Patrice O'Neal benefit? Um, AMG,

813
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:54,520
Mercedes, Mercedes, and Mercedes is,

814
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,100
you know what AMG stands for?

815
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,930
American made great

816
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,320
Mercedes isn't, isn't
American? No, it's German.

817
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:11,560
So the a and the m is the last name
of two German dudes and the g is the

818
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,800
hometown of the guy with the last name
that begins with an a according to my two

819
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:19,650
seconds of research. And it's the
top of the line. Okay. Fucking like,

820
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,840
they already have a sick ass German
car and then it's like, you know,

821
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,470
but if they take it to the chairman
gas monkey garage and they kick it up a

822
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:30,820
notch car called the MG as well.
Yes, my dad had one of those.

823
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,630
That's not,

824
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,250
that's not the same company or
same no factory or nobody ever,

825
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,550
uh, mg, uh, was a,

826
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,990
was English is what it was. And they, uh,

827
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:46,210
these little two seater racecars yes,
they were.

828
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,870
And a lot of the American soldiers
got exposed to European cars, uh,

829
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,100
sports cars to cedars and that type
of Shit. Italian stuff in English,

830
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:58,450
stuff in German. Shit when a, no offense
to German people, German stuff when, uh,

831
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:02,500
they were when they were fighting
over fighting over in Europe.

832
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,560
And um,
so when they came back,

833
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,180
those cars sold over here like a EMG,

834
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,910
TD and the fucking triumphs and all
that shit in the Italian stuff. Um,

835
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,220
so anyways,
these guys,

836
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:17,530
I don't know if they just make the
best fucking cars anyways. Hey Bill,

837
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,850
just listen to your podcast.

838
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:22,330
When you talked about how much you
enjoyed your test drive of the AMG wagon,

839
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,580
the station wagon, which you just,
yeah, yeah. Now I know you love it,

840
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:31,350
but I'm just, I had
fucking bad ass. He goes,

841
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,480
I'm totally with you on the
sleeper wagons being bad ass.

842
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,310
I just wanted to write you
to see if you've looked into
the CADILLAC CTS v Wagon

843
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,900
at all.
In my opinion,

844
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:44,170
it looks meaner than the Mercedes and
would cost you tens of thousand less.

845
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,040
Those Cadillacs are mean looking with
that vertical break light that they have.

846
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:49,910
They just look fucking angry.
And I loved it.

847
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,830
He loved Cadillacs and he always
looked bad ass driving them.

848
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:58,590
They're just bad ass cars.
Yeah, I absolutely, uh, if
I got a buddy of mine, uh,

849
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,970
has one, it's just a fucking great
car. Did Grandma I, you know,

850
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,270
I realized I'm a sedan guy. I really
am. I like, I'm Tom to social media.

851
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,870
Look at me.
I get that people in the backseat,

852
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,930
if you're gonna have a fucking two door
cards, don't, don't have a back seat.

853
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:18,610
That's so dumb.
Fucking staring at that station wagon.

854
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,110
I mean, I'm not like [inaudible] wrong
with station wagons, but they just,

855
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:26,650
I don't know. They carry that thing
about them that makes it just feel like,

856
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,980
I don't know,

857
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,940
just like, not that there's anything
wrong with having a family car, but like,

858
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:35,570
they're just not sexy. That's what it
is. A station wagon. It's not sexy.

859
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:39,620
Whether it's a Mercedes or a
Cadillac. I just, you know what it is.

860
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,870
It's because you guys, all you
guys know is nerd. If you had,

861
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:47,120
as you guys,
you and everybody else who trashes wagons,

862
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:51,770
if he knew anybody who played in bands,
guitar players, drummers, surfers,

863
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,250
all these cool bad ass people
drive fucking, yeah. Yeah,

864
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:59,110
because they should away like I
see a station wagon for a surfer.

865
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,460
That makes sense.
The shape or the boards and stuff.

866
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,570
Do you plan on putting surfboards in a
station wagon? I played drums. I say,

867
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:09,800
and you can't put drums in any other
kind of car, but a station wagon. Right?

868
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,960
All those vans that
van travel around them,

869
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,030
they don't try to van
the station wagon buddy.

870
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,540
All the baddest bands ever. Some
old, not saying, they all said, look,

871
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,450
anybody can take a yet.

872
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,060
Like I just think to look at a fucking
like a corvette or something like that.

873
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:31,130
[inaudible] it just for that thing
to go fast is designed to go fast.

874
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,150
I just, I'm so sick of arguing with this
point. When you look at a station wagon,

875
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:37,000
everything that everybody
thinks about a station wagon,

876
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,540
that's what makes it cool.
That's the thing.

877
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:41,930
Then fucking blows you away off the
fucking line. That's all I'm saying.

878
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,890
That's all I'm saying. I'm done. I'm
done talking about know Farron. Alright,

879
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,620
fireman.
Oh I asked for some firemen to a,

880
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,950
to a right in,
you know,

881
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:55,460
but some shit that they found in
a fire and they actually kept it.

882
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,960
They're not going to tell you what they
kept. The why. This is all anonymous.

883
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,820
How a big bed bill.
My father was a fireman for over 20 years.

884
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,780
One morning he came home and he handed
me a rent and Stimpy shirt. Oh my God.

885
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:12,500
That's funny cause he knew I liked,
to me you eat it.

886
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,430
It's debut 80th to be easy.
It they don't deserve to live.

887
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,480
I didn't put it together right away that
he had taken it from a job he couldn't

888
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:27,370
even buy as a kid. A simple ren and
Stimpy sir, you had to steal it from afar.

889
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,670
I'm sorry, I'm to steal when
I was a lovely man. I'm so,

890
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:31,760
I don't mean to diss your dad,

891
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:35,420
but that's as funny of all things
to give your kid a tee-shirt from a,

892
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,560
and now I feel like he
put his life on the line,

893
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,420
not like a bike that was managed to
be spared or something like that,

894
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:47,660
but a teacher is kind of weak,
you know,

895
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,560
it smelled like fucking suit,

896
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,690
probably at like little holes in it
from ambers linen on it. A go kit.

897
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,210
The loves you. He goes, I didn't put,
I didn't put it together right away.

898
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,220
He had taken it from a job.
But when I did,

899
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:05,750
I felt so horrible thinking that someone's
entire life disappeared in a fire.

900
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,900
And now I had one of their
only surviving possessions.

901
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,110
I had thought of that shirt a long
time until you brought that up on an

902
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:16,970
unrelated note.
Check out the book.

903
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,930
Meat is for pussies by John Joseph.
Uh,

904
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,020
you always make comments that sound
like you could be persuaded to try

905
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,700
vegetarian.
A lot of them.

906
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,750
Um,
I would,

907
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:31,530
if I could just get myself into like
learning how to cook it and I just,

908
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,830
I bought in like, you know how to cook
it, you know how to cook every vegetable.

909
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:35,850
You know how to Cook grinds,

910
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:38,520
you know how to cook beans and
rice and all that kind of stuff.

911
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:40,830
You know how to do it. So you
know, I'm a crabby old man.

912
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:43,260
I mean I know what to do with the pork
chop I don't have to do was fucking

913
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,500
eggplant. Now there are certain foods
you would like to cook more than others.

914
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,460
Like you like to make braised short ribs.
You like to make pie,

915
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,060
you like to make pumpkin bread.
So these are the things that you make.

916
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,450
It's not like you can't cook.
It was Anya.

917
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,160
I think this book might help you take the,
take the final step.

918
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,600
The author is a nut who has been singing
for a great punk band for the last 30

919
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:06,931
years,

920
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,690
but he's in killer shape and breaks it
down and all sorts of conversation on all.

921
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,810
I'm all over this conversational
English. It's not boring. Hippy dippy,

922
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:17,430
calm you a pamphlet.

923
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,230
It shows all sorts of
athletes and fighters who are
shredded without using any

924
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:27,090
animal products. I've been a vegetarian
for 23 years, so it didn't convert me,

925
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:29,370
but it served as a great
source for rebuttals.

926
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:34,610
When insecure meat eaters go after me
for eating rabbit food and say other dumb

927
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,250
things because my eating habits remind
them of how shitty their diet is,

928
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,730
it's worth checking out. Love the
podcast. Keep up the great work.

929
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,870
Go Fuck Yourself. Ps, stop
cutting yourself off short.
When you talk drums, music,

930
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:49,530
I sit through hours of you talking sports,
which I still find entertaining,

931
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:52,470
but I don't give a shit about, but
every time you get nerdy about drumming,

932
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:55,890
which I love, you say, Oh, this
is boring everyone and move on.

933
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,000
Please stop doing that.

934
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:00,210
I would rather hear you spend a half hour
talking about John Barnas, right foot.

935
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,830
Then some jerk off, overpaid
meatheads throwing our, oh my God.

936
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:09,720
Amazing. I suspect that there are others
who agree with me. That's a solid point.

937
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:13,710
Yeah. Guys in station wagons drive into
the fucking Gig who don't eat meat.

938
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,100
No, I think vegetarianism is, is
cool though. There's some really,

939
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,790
I would be completely satisfied.
You know what I love about f eight?

940
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,610
A total vegetarian. Me, I don't
choose to because I liked me,

941
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:28,410
but I wouldn't be mad if that's,

942
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,190
you know what's great about
eating vegetarian healthy
way of eating vegetarian

943
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,640
is you don't get, you can eat, you know,
get fat and then you don't have to worry.

944
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:38,490
Oh good. And again, still working
out like me right now. I got fucking,

945
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,800
but there are some fat vegetarians though.
Yeah.

946
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:42,450
Those are the ones who
don't read up on it.

947
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,700
They just stop eating meat
and they eat fucking chips,

948
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:49,770
cookies and Pasta and bread.
I'm a vegetarian. I can
eat that. It's like, dude,

949
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:54,840
which Chin just said that? So, um,

950
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,450
no, I would like to do that. Like, I would
like to try to, uh, just as you get older,

951
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:02,670
it's harder and harder
to fucking stay in shape.

952
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:05,670
And I just don't want to look
like a fucking, you know,

953
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,140
you start getting that fucking torso that
like the cops usually find floating in

954
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:13,200
a lake. Oh my God. Oh, bloated.

955
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:17,280
That's what that's been in a lake.
Yeah.

956
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,320
That's cause you know it
was because she had the dead

957
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,980
because you're dead in the bacteria,
your gut.

958
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,030
Oh God.
It's already there near the back.

959
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:33,070
When you die someday the bacteria that's
going to eat you up so more than it is

960
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,480
in this. Fascinating. No, it isn't. And
it sits in there your whole life. No,

961
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,660
it's nature. It's what the fuck
supposed to, it ranges the interests.

962
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,890
What's supposed to happen here.
Okay. The least fucking jerk off.

963
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:46,810
She'll get buried and you get stuck.

964
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,350
Don't blame them. They're dead.
And, and they, they get buried.

965
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:57,100
They get shoved in a drawer
in the basement of a church.

966
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,330
Those people,
it's the biggest fucking waste of stupid.

967
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,110
Your fertilizer does it put
you in the ground and said,

968
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,940
mom does Mazal I am the whole fucking
thing to circle it. Just go, okay,

969
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,501
you're alive.

970
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:15,160
Why do they decided to put people
in those instead of in the ground?

971
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:19,870
Cause it's like a fancier, and
you're better than the ground. Yeah.

972
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,120
You can't be,
you can't be warm food.

973
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:26,860
You have three like uh Nah man.
There's some cool about just fucking,

974
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,860
just being raw. Just rot
away to gone dust. Boom over.

975
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,010
Get out of here. Beat it. Yeah.

976
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,820
It's fucking sitting there with your
dumb headstone so people can come up to

977
00:57:40,821 --> 00:57:45,690
with Jack Daniels and fucking
their arm around him. Man,

978
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,320
he's not there. She's not there. They're
fucking, they're there in the air.

979
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,720
You can stay at home and do that. Just
like crazy philosophical to the night.

980
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:01,720
Philosophical is stupid. Both. I know
one of the other, well, all right.

981
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,660
I'm
lying about medical school.

982
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,710
I've been lying about medical school to
my family and friends for the last two

983
00:58:11,711 --> 00:58:16,030
years. I'm now, he's 23 this
is understandable. He was, wow.

984
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,190
I'm guest teen and lying about, you
know Jesus. All right. All right,

985
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:23,770
fine. Fine. Jesus.
Jesus. Can you give the,

986
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:28,771
can we get the kid a fun at 23 near like
if you saw how fucking introverted I

987
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:32,980
was at 23 you know why?

988
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:36,460
Compared to the Gloria Social
Butterfly that you are today,

989
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:42,160
you are on fire
person.

990
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:46,750
I like who I like. Okay.
I like, I don't like fuck.

991
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,170
Yeah, I don't like those big
parties. Got To stand there.

992
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,120
The fucking eyebrows up.

993
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:56,170
Is that what you tell
it did rain yesterday.

994
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,770
You're not good at small talk
is what it is. Pointless.

995
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:03,040
And then in little party conference
you've got to come up with some sort of

996
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:06,280
thing to just say and just when they
look and you feel the same thing,

997
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:10,450
just be like, dude, don't feel
you don't have to talk to me.

998
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,310
We don't have to do this.

999
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:16,870
That sounds like a great
way to make somebody feel
comfortable. No. If they know,

1000
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:19,300
you know what I mean? These
fucking, we don't have to do this.

1001
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:23,780
We can just sit here and the
quiet until our wives come over,

1002
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,330
drag us back into that

1003
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:33,440
and you just click your drinks.
Definitely worked with me, man.

1004
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,930
That's so funny.
I would love to,

1005
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:39,080
I used to do a bit of ice to talk
about you on stage when you come off

1006
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,350
everything. Okay, I get it.

1007
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,160
I always ended up drifting
into a corner at these parties.

1008
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:45,470
You're the social butterfly going around.
Everybody fucking loves you.

1009
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:49,580
And I'd just be standing in the corner
drinking a Miller and then you'd come

1010
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:51,800
over and just be like, [inaudible]
okay, I just hear anything.

1011
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,380
I feel like you're avoiding the party.
Like I am you.

1012
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:58,400
In the beginning when I was getting
to know you and then I realized,

1013
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,400
you know what? A wildly, you know,

1014
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,870
dazzling personality that you can be at
social gatherings and I just let you do

1015
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:08,330
your own thing and then I do my thing.
And then what happened?

1016
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,250
You always say that I abandoned you, I
parties. No, that was early, early on.

1017
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:17,810
That was weird to me that I would just
let you just say and you'd break off and

1018
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:18,621
I'd be like, what the, I'm mean,

1019
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:20,960
so someone beat on my hip and
they would just be an egg.

1020
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:24,650
And it's also so first it weirded
me out and then I, then I was like,

1021
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:28,850
wait a minute, this is
perfect. Yeah, you go Ryan,

1022
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:31,170
you go round the room and be like,
oh look,

1023
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,770
you do all, you find thinness. What
is in it? Oh my God, it's a Dylan

1024
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,870
said I'm in the corner. Like, no, no,
I'll set. You find them. One of the guy,

1025
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:48,500
the party that like spores and you guys
ended up talking all night. It's perfect.

1026
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,700
It really is perfect. It's the
perfect. Usually I, you know,

1027
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:55,310
nobody's feelings get hurt and we have,
we have very independent socialize.

1028
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:58,820
I think that's important.
You know, I fucking,

1029
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,260
I go, I find the room. Nobody's in.

1030
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,300
I just stand there. I know you
always want to sit down. Yes.

1031
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,110
What are we standing up for? But
you know what? I don't like this.

1032
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:13,580
I don't like to stand
either during part anyway.

1033
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:17,060
We'd have to get back to the question
watching all the fucking couples competing

1034
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:20,030
with each other. Dumb Shit. Oh,

1035
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,080
do you see the fucking woman jealous of
her bag and then you see how can it his

1036
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,400
eye and then he sit and they go out.
God, now I get to buy a fucking bag.

1037
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:33,440
Got to buy a fucking bag.
Cause Suzy q's got the fucking yellow one.

1038
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,890
Fucking hate her. She's so, she's
skinny, right? She's getting, you know,

1039
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:39,200
that's the nightmare chicken. Then
you drive home. You got to convince,

1040
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,560
you got to convince the
woman you're with that.

1041
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:45,180
You didn't want to fuck anybody
there at the party. Oh yeah.

1042
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:47,450
She was too skinny for me.
Yes. She should've put,

1043
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,700
she should have left
something to the imagination.

1044
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,970
Thank God her tits were
hanging out fucking [inaudible]
and it was a great thing

1045
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:58,010
to look at. And while I was in the
middle of that awful conversation,

1046
01:01:58,011 --> 01:02:03,011
now there example of why
having independence socialize
is so great because I

1047
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:07,670
don't invite you to shit because I know
that you're not going to be into it.

1048
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,390
So I don't even know if I
asked. You did forever. I did.

1049
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:14,450
And then I sobbed and I was like,
yeah, you want to go to blah blah.

1050
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,670
And I'd be like, no. And
then you would always go,

1051
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:26,250
I died a thousand deaths than I not.
Can I take some,

1052
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,050
give me a fucking break.

1053
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:30,960
You've died a thousand deaths because I
invited you to parties because I want to

1054
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:35,130
spend time with you. Oh, just hey
you up on that cross. It's so hard.

1055
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,680
The things that you went to or what?

1056
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:42,681
The fact that they were called parties
is an absolute insult around with you and

1057
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,830
all your bone head comedian friends while
you insult each other for three hours.

1058
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:49,920
That's like supposed to be something
amazing. Never called it a party.

1059
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,003
Certainly not.

1060
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:00,230
It is not a point when they say were you
and Joe de Rosa and Keith Robinson and

1061
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:02,920
we're going to have dinner
and you're like, oh, you can
come if you want. See you.

1062
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:07,160
And I said, who's going? It
was going on, I don't know,

1063
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,120
smart,
this beautiful fucking great steakhouse,

1064
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,840
hate this unbelievable food.

1065
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:15,600
And all we did was sit there and
make fun of Keith's fucking sweater.

1066
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,290
And then the waitress came over and
had the best insult because Keith was

1067
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,710
defended the sweater and then she
comes over and we go, what do you,

1068
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,160
excuse me miss it.
She already knew that were,

1069
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,000
we were a jerk offs and we just said,

1070
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:31,740
what do you think of when
you look at Keith sweater?
And she goes, Freddy Krueger.

1071
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,860
And it was, and it was, and
it was such a Freddy Krueger,

1072
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,050
it was their Thanksgiving colored thick
stripe fucking sweater. I was great.

1073
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,990
And he had to just sit there and
take it and that, that made my meal.

1074
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,640
And she said, do you want dessert? I said,
no, you just gave it to me sweetheart.

1075
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,490
Sorry. Um, all right. So he says,

1076
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:54,990
I've been lying about my medical school
and my family and friends for the last

1077
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:55,560
two years.

1078
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,880
I'm 23 I have aspired to be a doctor ever
since moving to the United States when

1079
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:04,740
I was 10 I crushed it in high
school without really studying.

1080
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,440
Graduated, graduated as, sorry.

1081
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,430
I already go to salutary and I fucked.
Graduated as salutary.

1082
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,150
I don't even know what that means.
Is that number one in the class to

1083
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:21,420
Jesus Christ? Valedictorian is number
one. A salutorian is number two. What's,

1084
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:23,580
what's the bronze?
I Dunno.

1085
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,640
I'm still just the class
president or something.

1086
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,530
They didn't miss them
that high academically,

1087
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,710
but socially they were popular
enough to get [inaudible] president.

1088
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:35,750
I was in the supplemental draft.
All right.

1089
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,930
So I had an ego trip going into college
and decided to push myself in order to

1090
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:43,380
get into the top tier medical
schools by junior year.

1091
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,330
I was double majoring, working in
a research lab and teaching. Uh,

1092
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,520
I say that word recitation. What the fuck
is that? A recitation session of my own.

1093
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,250
Do you know what that is?
So how do you know that's how you say it,

1094
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,430
but why don't you stand it out?
I do.

1095
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:03,920
I have to like help you like a child
in school learning was sound out rats,

1096
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,770
sealant, recitation or what
else would it be? I don't know.

1097
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:12,480
I don't know what it is and either deal.
How do you know it's not recite Taishan

1098
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,600
anyways, uh, on my own,
on, uh, a recitation

1099
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:23,600
session of my own on top of volunteering
in the Er as an EMT during off hours,

1100
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:28,650
ah, I'm gonna say this dude burned
himself up. To make a long story short,

1101
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:31,530
I over extended myself, Mike,
but by graduation, my GPA,

1102
01:05:31,531 --> 01:05:35,760
Sax Solo that no United States
medical schools would ever consider my

1103
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:36,594
application.

1104
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:41,250
I was too ashamed to admit this to
my family and friends who have always

1105
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:44,400
considered me as smart as
the smart one of the bunch.

1106
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,700
For two years after graduation,

1107
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:51,210
I had been lying about working fulltime
and applying to medical school,

1108
01:05:51,211 --> 01:05:54,240
but rarely but barely missing
the cut or at least sure.

1109
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,350
Oh, you've been lying
that you have that. Oh,

1110
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,640
about working fulltime and
applying to middle school. Oh,

1111
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,770
so that's what's really going on.

1112
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:05,530
You're working full time and you keep
missing the cut. In reality, I am working.

1113
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,990
Oh, in reality. Oh that is what
you're doing. I'm sorry. In Rio.

1114
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,430
Oh my God.
Hey,

1115
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,140
that's the reason I'm a clown.

1116
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,840
Oh, this is torture. How long it's
taken you to get through this.

1117
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:20,840
In reality,

1118
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:26,660
working parttime secretly taking
classes to improve my GPA and I've never

1119
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:28,180
applied.

1120
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:32,080
This lie has gotten so elaborate that
I have been making application size,

1121
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:36,700
credit card payments to a credit card.
My parents don't know I own,

1122
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,100
so if they review my bank statements,

1123
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,230
it actually looks like I
have been applying what?

1124
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:46,990
The burden of keeping the truth to my
self and it's gotten so bad that I'm

1125
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:49,930
actually starting to feel a
disconnect from my family and friends.

1126
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,131
First question,

1127
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:55,210
should I come clean or should I just
keep up the lie until I get into medical

1128
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:59,050
schools? Second question, is it even
worth pursuing this dream anymore?

1129
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:01,150
By the time I improved my GPA,

1130
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,110
I'll be 25 plus four years of medical
school plus three years of residency.

1131
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,010
I'll be 32 by the time I have my first
day of work. That's still pretty young.

1132
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:11,200
Dude,
I would love to take your advice to heart.

1133
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,470
I think you're far more insightful
and to give us a no compliments here.

1134
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,120
All he came out of it,
he goes,

1135
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:19,570
I think you're far more insightful
than you give yourself credit for,

1136
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:24,410
but you're still a balding ginger. Go
Fuck Yourself. God, I keep you honest.

1137
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,870
Still over there. All right,
here's a good shit. Um hmm.

1138
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,120
I would definitely come clean because
this is fucking eating away at you and

1139
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:33,820
your brain and it's making you
live in a double life here.

1140
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,630
I would definitely do it. And you if,
if it's still really is your dream,

1141
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:41,200
who gives a fuck? Gives a fuck.
Who cares how long it takes.

1142
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:42,970
But something tells me
that I didn't gradually,

1143
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:47,830
regularly regular college until
25. Yeah, that's true. Um,

1144
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:48,880
and it doesn't,
I don't know.

1145
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:52,300
I get the feeling that he actually
doesn't want to be a doctor anymore.

1146
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,260
What the hell? I didn't see that way.
What'd you mean? I don't know. I'm in,

1147
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,050
what do you think? Um, cause I just,

1148
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,170
I dunno, I just feel
like he or she is. Um,

1149
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:07,280
probably he though I just feel
like the way it's written as a guy,

1150
01:08:07,281 --> 01:08:11,330
I have just feel like, yeah, maybe you
got burned out and really you don't,

1151
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:12,890
maybe you don't want to do it anymore.

1152
01:08:12,891 --> 01:08:16,610
Is there a possibility that there's other
things that you to do? But either way,

1153
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:18,110
I know you shouldn't lie anymore because,

1154
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:21,530
and it's not so much about other people.
It's like you were saying,

1155
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,700
it's about you.

1156
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,450
It's how it's eating you up inside and
making you feel disconnected from your

1157
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:29,500
family and friends. That's not
good. Like they, they love you.

1158
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:32,270
You're only thing it really comes down
to they don't want you to be miserable.

1159
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,030
Hopefully

1160
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:37,680
this guy's academically George Foreman,
right before he fought up,

1161
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:41,340
fought Isley where he just never lost,
never got knocked down.

1162
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,680
And then when Ali knocked him down,

1163
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,140
he said years later that
he could've got back up,

1164
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:47,520
but he'd never been there before.

1165
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,550
And I think this dude was crushing
it without fucking trying,

1166
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:55,740
cause he was so smart. And then it got
a little hard and uh, he's dealing with,

1167
01:08:55,830 --> 01:09:00,240
um, like, uh, dealing
with a couple of losses.

1168
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,190
You got to turn it around and do it.
It's not a,

1169
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:04,530
you're not even fucking at 23 years old,
dude.

1170
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:07,560
That's way too young to pack in.

1171
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:12,870
You look at this way. This is how
I always looked at it. All right.

1172
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:17,970
You're 23. All right. You're saying by the
time you get through all this bullshit,

1173
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:21,690
you're going to be 32. What
would you rather be at? 32 32,

1174
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,220
not a doctor or 32. Just became a
doctor. If that's what you want to do.

1175
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,770
All right, because Sunday, dude,

1176
01:09:28,771 --> 01:09:32,880
you're going to look at 32 years of
age and be like, Jesus, I was a kid,

1177
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:35,940
I was a fucking kid.
I still had it all ahead of me.

1178
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,660
And you do so stop being
so hard on yourself.

1179
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:43,770
Come clean because it
seems like it's your turn.

1180
01:09:43,771 --> 01:09:46,620
You're turning yourself into
a bit of a sociopath here.

1181
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,130
Yeah.
Cause the two years is a long time.

1182
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:52,470
And the fact that you're
making these payments,

1183
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,190
you like the credit card and
stuff. That's a little much. Yeah.

1184
01:09:56,191 --> 01:09:58,590
So what are they doing?
Like buying flat screen TVs to be like,

1185
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:00,850
oh that's for this. And then
you get that. That's a little,

1186
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:05,630
that's taken it too far. I mean it takes
the TV and throws it over the backyard.

1187
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,190
Yeah, there's really no
need to get this for that.

1188
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:15,150
You let slip scale back before you do
anything. And here's this thing. Crazy

1189
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,800
set. As your parents get at some point,
you guys are all gonna laugh at it.

1190
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,840
You're going to laugh at lift the
shit that my parents laugh at,

1191
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:27,300
the stuff that I fucking did. You know,
I got arrested for drinking and driving.

1192
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,830
I've never seen my mother have a
more disappointed look on her face.

1193
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:31,990
She still rolls her eyes,
but when I tell the story,

1194
01:10:31,991 --> 01:10:36,340
she laughs now she left still get over
it. All right. They'll get over it. Okay.

1195
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,780
But uh, you know, I just, she's
still want to be a doctor dude.

1196
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:43,450
The fact that you'd be a doctor
in 32 would be fucking amazing.

1197
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:46,100
Yeah, of course. Being on becoming
a doctor is fucking amazing.

1198
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:51,530
If you want to do it, if you
want to do it. Oh my God,
it is so hard. It's so hard.

1199
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:54,650
You guys know.
What did he say?

1200
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:58,760
I'm working part time and I'm secretly

1201
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,420
do to improve and have never applied.
Um Hm.

1202
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:09,010
Do you like working parttime though
and what are you working at? Cause I,

1203
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:13,360
I feel like there's something else that
he's interested in doing. Well. Okay.

1204
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:16,090
Maybe. Yeah. Like I know he wants,

1205
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:18,250
he says he wants to be a doctor
and I don't doubt that, but I,

1206
01:11:18,251 --> 01:11:23,251
but what if there's something else that
might be even more interesting and I

1207
01:11:23,661 --> 01:11:24,250
don't know,

1208
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:29,050
not make you turn into a person
that has to make up a second life.

1209
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,960
I don't know. I don't know. The way I
read it, I don't think he ever had to,

1210
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,960
I think you just put too much pressure
on himself. Oh yeah, that's true.

1211
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:38,860
So I think his parents will be
fine with it. And if they're not,

1212
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,770
then they're not your real parents.
That's right or not. You're really,

1213
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,900
you know, they say if they don't agree
then you're not your real friends,

1214
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,820
but you are.
But your mental,

1215
01:11:48,821 --> 01:11:53,821
like emotional wellbeing is way more
important than a medical school,

1216
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,470
I feel like ultimately.
Right.

1217
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:01,010
Uh, I wasn't listening to you. I was
already looking at the next question.

1218
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,460
You know what?
Before I came in here,

1219
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:08,230
I was reading about adult ADHD cause
you know I like to read it every couple

1220
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:11,440
months and like make you take a quiz just
to confirm the facts. Bring it in here.

1221
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:14,950
That's true are in fact, I'll take
the quiz right now. Have Adult Adhd.

1222
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:15,950
Should I go get it?

1223
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:17,780
Good.
I'll take it and I'll answer the next one.

1224
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,620
I'm going to fucking destroy this test.
You know she's out of the room.

1225
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:24,410
You know I'm going to destroy it.
I'm just going to fucking lie.

1226
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:29,770
Never let the broad in your life
psycho fucking analyze you. All right?

1227
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,680
Whether you wanted or not, they're already
gonna be running around in your head.

1228
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,440
You don't need to fucking open the door.
You know what I'm saying?

1229
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,560
When you get in a
relationship with a woman,

1230
01:12:39,561 --> 01:12:43,670
remember that star Trek one where they
fucking tied those guys hands behind

1231
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:46,670
their back and they stuck that warm and
they're fucking helmets and then put it

1232
01:12:46,671 --> 01:12:49,880
on. They went in their ear. That's
what I'm talking about it all right.

1233
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,410
Skating rink.
Dear Billy Bruins,

1234
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:53,270
you've been talking a lot
about your home renovation,

1235
01:12:53,271 --> 01:12:57,150
but we never heard much about
the Yad, which leads me, uh,

1236
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:01,850
leads to my suggestion of installing
some ice in your backyard. Dude,

1237
01:13:01,851 --> 01:13:03,020
I live in Los Angeles.

1238
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:07,730
Surprise to me how few people have these
things going on regardless of whether

1239
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,170
or not you could actually do it.

1240
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,160
Is that something you would want to have
two out of the four seasons of the year?

1241
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,030
Ps, maintain the ice would be the hardest
part. Oh Dude. Are you kidding me?

1242
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:18,620
I would love to have
a rank of my backyard,

1243
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,550
although would I want to go through living
in a place where I have to go through

1244
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:26,210
winters? I did that for
40 years. I did my time.

1245
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,650
I bought enough ice scrapers in
my life. Uh, I love the winter.

1246
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,040
I like to visit it at this
point. And, um, you know,

1247
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,780
and all you guys who say I'm a pussy now,
eve,

1248
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:40,850
show me how it's done by standing back
there in the fucking goddamn winter.

1249
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,380
Um, anyways. All right, that's the
podcast for this week. Everybody.

1250
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,630
Thank you for listening. We're waiting.
Um, oh, by the way, by the way,

1251
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:55,370
by the way, I finally got some
Boston dates coming your way. Uh,

1252
01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:00,390
rumor has it that all freckles is
coming to town sometime possibly

1253
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,310
bleed,

1254
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,390
possibly in May.

1255
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,340
And I'm going to do a run of
dates at the Wilbur theater.

1256
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:13,460
I'll let you know. I'll let you know,
definitely when a, when that's going down.

1257
01:14:13,461 --> 01:14:17,030
And also I'm going to be doing
another bus tour through the south.

1258
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,480
And when I'll fucking around this
time we're going to go to, uh,

1259
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:24,440
I want to try to avoid all major
cities in the south. I want to go to,

1260
01:14:24,441 --> 01:14:28,190
I don't want to go to Nashville. I just
was there. I want to go to Knoxville,

1261
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:32,720
Memphis, shoo fly North
Carolina. Oh, mobile.

1262
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,810
I already got a theater.
I'm picking out to go to Mississippi.

1263
01:14:35,811 --> 01:14:39,040
I've never done standup in Mississippi.
Um,

1264
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:42,350
somebody showed me one inch and
I want to go to some cool venues,

1265
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,980
some old theaters that have some history.
Somebody showed me one in Shreveport,

1266
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:50,300
Louisiana that both Elvis and Johnny
Cash played at. It's pretty big.

1267
01:14:50,301 --> 01:14:53,410
I don't know if I could fill
it, but uh, that's what I'm,

1268
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:54,620
that's what I'm looking to do.

1269
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:58,580
And then after I booked the tour of phase
two is I want all you fucking southern

1270
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:02,930
people to tell me where you eat in that
town. And I won't fucking tell anybody.

1271
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,100
I won't blow up the spot.

1272
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:07,250
You just let me know where to go
for some mom and pop fucking place.

1273
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:11,660
Do not tell me about the apple bees or
the cracker barrel or wherever the fuck I

1274
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:16,430
want to know where the fuck you
go. Uh, you know to eat. Okay.

1275
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:19,310
That's the deal. Now let me take
this fucking test here. Here we go.

1276
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:24,830
Alrighty. Ready? This is, hold on.
I have to study. The whole thing is,

1277
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,130
the whole thing is never,
rarely, sometimes, often.
Okay. That's how you answer.

1278
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,570
Is that the title? Oh No. That's how
you answer it. You're already failed.

1279
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,820
That sounds like a fucking
the name of a book.

1280
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,880
How often do you ever rarely tension
while doing something for work,

1281
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:47,180
school hobby or fun activity? Eeg.
Remaining focused during lectures.

1282
01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:49,820
Links too many fucking things.
Hobby. I'm playing drums.

1283
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:53,720
I could finish the question and
you're already cause it's vague.

1284
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,870
Are you going to answer? Are you going
to do this and that? All right, good.

1285
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,040
I'll just pretend you
have like power over me.

1286
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:02,570
How often do you have
difficulty sustaining your
attention while doing something

1287
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:04,640
for work? School, a hobby or fun activity?

1288
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,663
Never.

1289
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:14,550
If you already know the answers are
never, rarely. Sometimes. Often, often.

1290
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:18,510
Okay. How often are you easily
distracted by external stimuli?

1291
01:16:18,511 --> 01:16:20,790
Like something in your
environment or unrelated thoughts?

1292
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:25,260
What does that say it again?

1293
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,510
Let's do it again. I was already thinking
about the joke in the middle of it.

1294
01:16:30,511 --> 01:16:34,350
I was going, can I imitate Barbarino what
people are going to get it? Oh my God,

1295
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:36,360
I don't even need to.
I don't even need to ask you.

1296
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:42,010
How often are you easily distracted?
You're not a doctor. Where's your in?

1297
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:46,710
I'm not saying I'm a doc.
Was Bio psych central.com oh shit.

1298
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:52,290
Fucking forget it then. Whatever they
say I am. How often do you avoid,

1299
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:56,490
disliked or are reluctant to engage in
Taipei? People who spells psych? Yes.

1300
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:01,440
Yes. Well, I'm psyched and they
spell it with an s. It's so gay.

1301
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,530
How often do you avoid
dislike or reluctance?

1302
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,990
Engage in stock. Dare you embarrass me
like this in my own fucking podcast.

1303
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,640
Sustained mental effort.
Orthotic?

1304
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,790
No, I actually didn't
hear the first part, but

1305
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,670
you can not fucking paying
attention to see me.

1306
01:17:30,671 --> 01:17:34,220
Her fucking everything you read. No.
Cause it reminds me of other shit.

1307
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,290
Exactly. What Adhd, Adhd as you can,

1308
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,400
it doesn't mean to remind
you of other shit bill.

1309
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:48,420
The like the second question was how often
are you easily distracted by internal

1310
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:52,010
stimuli, like something in your
environment or unrelated thoughts?

1311
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,790
That was question number two, Bill. Often.

1312
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:58,933
Oh my God.

1313
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,880
How often do you have trouble listening
to someone even when they are speaking

1314
01:18:02,881 --> 01:18:06,510
directly to you,
like your mind is somewhere else.

1315
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:08,370
Often it's not somewhere else.

1316
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,640
They're not interesting and then I just
start going and looking at their shoes.

1317
01:18:11,641 --> 01:18:15,660
Screw you. You're saying I'm not
interesting. No, don't fucking do.

1318
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,850
Well I've got a fucking disease over here

1319
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:23,141
often.

1320
01:18:23,141 --> 01:18:27,890
Then how often do you have difficulty or
in organizing a task or activity needed

1321
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:31,580
to get done? Eg Poor time
management failed to meet deadlines,

1322
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:36,020
difficulty managing sequential tasks.
Not One of those was good.

1323
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,320
What? Oh, I thought those will do what
you said in the end with the options.

1324
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:46,370
I told you at the beginning
that it's never, rarely,

1325
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:48,740
sometimes or often.
That's how you answer.

1326
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:53,180
Somewhere between rarely and
sometimes there's the I get shit done.

1327
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:56,960
I'm a successful fucking God. That's true.
All. Well, why don't we say sometimes.

1328
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,960
Okay, how's that? Well,
you're not supposed to say,

1329
01:18:59,961 --> 01:19:01,640
and I was supposed to say it when we,
well,

1330
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,730
I apparently need to coach you through
this because you keep getting distracted.

1331
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,410
Oh,
you are a devil woman.

1332
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,340
And then how often do you fail to give
close attention to details or make

1333
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:14,270
careless mistakes and things
such as schoolwork, at work,
during other activities?

1334
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:19,040
Rarely take my work seriously. Okay. Sat
in that fucking writer's room. Six, seven,

1335
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,650
eight hours a day. I didn't have to be
there. Could I showed up like the Douche,

1336
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:24,320
hey, write me something. That's
true. I didn't. I sat there.

1337
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,440
How often do you forget to do
something you do? All the time.

1338
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:30,230
So just missing an appointment or
paying a bill all the fucking time.

1339
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,730
Not Paying a bill though. I
pay bills. Yes, you do. Yeah,

1340
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:38,720
but the 50 important shit
near the important shit. I'm
fucking locked and loaded.

1341
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,790
I'll put sometimes all the dumb shit.

1342
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:44,810
How often do you lose ms plays or damaged
something that's necessary in order to

1343
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:49,610
get things done? Your phone,
eyeglasses, paperwork, wallet,

1344
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:54,410
keys, et Cetera. Do I lose it or damage
it? Wouldn't mean damage it. Throw it.

1345
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:59,790
How often do you lose ms plays
or damage? Either one. Oh,

1346
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,860
fuck a time.
Yes.

1347
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:04,130
How often do you have trouble following
through on instructions or failing to

1348
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:07,870
finish school work chores or duties
in the workplace? Eg Syrah task.

1349
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:10,060
We quickly lose focus and
are easily sidetracked.

1350
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:11,360
Okay.

1351
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,600
Sometimes, but not that much. I'm really
good with the work thing. Yeah. Yeah. No,

1352
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:17,150
I would agree with that.
Obviously you are,

1353
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,580
there's no doubt that you are successful.
What does,

1354
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:23,060
what does the end game of this?
So then you find out here fucking Adhd,

1355
01:20:23,061 --> 01:20:24,410
fucking whatever,
and then what?

1356
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,200
I lose the argument about the
fucking closet downstairs.

1357
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:31,670
How often are you unable to play or
engage in leisurely activities? Quietly.

1358
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:32,960
Okay.

1359
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,960
How often are you unable to play
or engage in leisurely activities?

1360
01:20:38,121 --> 01:20:42,950
Quietly? Well, let me, cigar
smoking is pretty quiet.

1361
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,640
I loved the one that sometimes.

1362
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:45,480
Okay.

1363
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:50,400
Rarely. Okay. Rarely. How often do
you have difficulty waiting your turn?

1364
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,840
Such as while waiting in line.

1365
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,493
Okay.

1366
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,380
What would have of
course to stand in line?

1367
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,460
No. If I see a long line, I just
like, I just think about what is,

1368
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:07,290
is it really worth standing in line?
Is this,

1369
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:12,490
you know, parative than my fucking
survival. I don't need it. I'm out often.

1370
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,970
How often do you feel like you're on the
go acting as if you driven by a motor

1371
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:20,800
or EEG you're unable to be
or uncomfortable being still
for an extended period.

1372
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:24,130
All right. All right. I see where this
is going in a restaurant or a meeting.

1373
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah.

1374
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,360
I like going to restaurants at
bill at the end of a meal. Right.

1375
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,970
While you're still finishing dessert,

1376
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,760
you literally have your coat on
and you have your credit card.

1377
01:21:35,761 --> 01:21:38,050
How you're holding it on the table,
like looking around.

1378
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:40,890
I know cause that's cause of the
fucking smalltalk throughout all of it.

1379
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,100
Oh here's a story and people tell a story.
This is one,

1380
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:46,920
you know his story bombing in
the middle of it. You have to go.

1381
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:52,500
So damn
fuck isn't grabbing their coat.

1382
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:58,200
Sometimes I'll put how often do you leave
your seat and how often do you leave

1383
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:01,440
your seat in situations when
remaining seed is expected?

1384
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,910
10 pens on whether I'm being entertained,
plays in the office or workplace.

1385
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,460
If I'm being entertained sometimes.
Okay.

1386
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,930
Yeah I have a hot fucking how often do
you blurt out an answer before a question

1387
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:13,890
has been completed?

1388
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:17,520
Eg completed another incense or
can't wait your turn and conversation

1389
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:19,703
to an o?

1390
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,990
An answer like I know the answer cause
that doesn't happen cause I've used don't

1391
01:22:22,991 --> 01:22:23,531
know the answer.

1392
01:22:23,531 --> 01:22:27,610
How often do you blurt out an answer
never happened or a question yesterday.

1393
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:31,840
Fleeted jeopardy or wheel of fortune.
That never happens. That's I'm going to,

1394
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:33,280
I'm putting off in and you know,

1395
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:37,540
it's often can I put often
you do whatever you want.

1396
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,940
This is fucking test isn't
gonna affect my life in any way.

1397
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,330
I don't know what your point is.
How often do you feel restless?

1398
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,650
Like you want to get out and do something?
Yeah,

1399
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,930
like I get up and turn the data.
I want to do something. Yeah.

1400
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:52,420
I don't want to lay around
like a dose. So yeah. Often.

1401
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:56,460
How often do you fidget with our tap?
Your hands or feet or storming?

1402
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:57,443
How many more?

1403
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:01,960
It's the same fucking question
over and over and over again.

1404
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,840
How often do you fidget
or tap or your seat?

1405
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:09,340
I don't know. Sometimes. Okay.

1406
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:12,940
How often do you find
yourself talking excessively?

1407
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:17,270
Can I tap out often? Do you
find yourself talking yet

1408
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:20,120
often? Sometimes I'm running
my mouth all the fuck at times.

1409
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:23,300
Other times I clam up. Like when I'm at
a party I don't walk in and take over.

1410
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:26,870
I see everybody Geekdad we'd
be talking about that bullshit.

1411
01:23:26,871 --> 01:23:30,740
I'm just saying this is awful. I don't
understand the corn. I don't say anything.

1412
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:35,370
Okay. Sometimes. How often do you
interrupt or intrude on others?

1413
01:23:35,371 --> 01:23:38,520
I just butting into their conversation
and taking over what others are doing.

1414
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,760
Well, I was with it until
the end. Taking over.

1415
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:46,400
It's a little fucking hard letting in
or taking over. Yeah. The, the, these,

1416
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:50,910
this is all the same fucking question
over and over again. See a patient,

1417
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,970
non ADHD person would be able to take
this quiz and like, you know what,

1418
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:58,950
this is just, I'm going to put some
time. All right. It's almost done. Uh,

1419
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:03,840
were several of the symptoms
present, uh, prior to age 12? No.

1420
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,970
You never felt this way as a little
boy. Okay. No, no I didn't. All right.

1421
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,530
The fuck was I worried about,

1422
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:13,040
do these symptoms appear in at
least two or more settings at home

1423
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,110
and school or home and work or whatever?

1424
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:22,600
Yeah. All right. Your
score, this is 20 questions.

1425
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:29,480
You scored a total of 42 based upon
your responses to this adult add ADH

1426
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,181
screening quiz.

1427
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:32,990
Do you ever replied in a way similar
to peach people who have symptoms of

1428
01:24:32,991 --> 01:24:36,020
moderate to severe
attention deficit disorder,

1429
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:41,330
moderate to severe, severe? That's
pretty much the entire gamut. Oh,

1430
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,310
they it go psych.com.

1431
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:47,360
You may have it a little bit or a severe.

1432
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,710
All of that mental torture.
Do you see why I tap out half the time?

1433
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:55,130
Symptoms typically worsened in situations
that requires you just send a up that

1434
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:58,040
mentioned or mental
effort or that are boring.

1435
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:00,060
You know,

1436
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,970
that was written by boring people that
are tired of getting interrupted by

1437
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:07,820
exciting kickball.
Me Burn everybody.

1438
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,410
Go Fuck Yourself.
Don't fucking see what you just did.

1439
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,650
You drag me through my own shit
that they go, but I love you. Hey,

1440
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,840
let's look at this right here.
This is, this is the guy, uh,

1441
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:22,460
I worked with the other day.
Brad Carter. All right there.

1442
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,840
You remember him right?
Look at this picture right there.

1443
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:29,630
Regular do. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Reggie
Lewis who did that? She was awesome.

1444
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,240
Yeah. I'm going to post
a video he had, he had,

1445
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:35,450
he's got a video on the Internet,
says man plays guitar.

1446
01:25:35,451 --> 01:25:39,260
Well having brain surgery and it's him
blacks as they weren't, they weren't.

1447
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:43,310
I'll let him tell the fucking story.
I already sound dumb enough. Is it is,

1448
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,670
but a fucking a,
that's cool.

1449
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:47,850
Okay.

1450
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,670
Amazing. Fucking actor.
Funniest fucking hell.

1451
01:25:50,671 --> 01:25:52,560
And like can be scary if he wants to be.

1452
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:56,070
So I'm really looking out for this
guy to do big shit, man. All right.

1453
01:25:56,071 --> 01:25:58,050
That's the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody.

1454
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:01,800
Good luck with your holiday shopping and
good luck if you fucking wife comes in

1455
01:26:01,801 --> 01:26:02,970
and goes, hey, you want to take a,

1456
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,240
because I can tell you right now,

1457
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:08,990
she is a fucking axe to grind and
you're going to fail it. Alright?

1458
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:13,430
Go Fuck yourself and talk to you next
week. That's next week. Next week,

1459
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,780
10 days away. Oh my God. It's coming up.
It's coming so fast. All right. See you.
