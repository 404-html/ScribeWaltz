1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:01,651
Hey,

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:05,130

time for the Monday morning podcast from

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,880
Oh were you blah, blah, Blah
and all of that shit. I'm,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,890
I am back out here in Los Angeles.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,160
And guess what all Fraco sits on vacation.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,390
That's right.
I did my last Gig of the year,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,220
my last road gig. I should say,
let me drinking tea on this one.

9
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:34,170
Cause my fucking voice is shot as you
can hear after, uh, my past weekend,

10
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:38,760
but I'm, I don't have any more fucking
road gig. Say Oh damn all shit to do.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,740
I think I do have to go back to New York
to promote emphasis for family by the

12
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:43,981

18th the same day that they're released

00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:54,930

can look at a little cute. You're Parker.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,150
See Him when he was only fucking a puppy,
right?

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,150
So what do, do whatever. So we're
competing against star wars or whatever.

18
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:13,560
So I need you guys to police. I, I
tweeted out the, uh, the trailer for it.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,530
I need you guys to,
a few ever going to be there for me,

20
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,590
which I like to think you want all
the time. I like to think you care.

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,583
Oh.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,790
Um, if you guys could
retweet the, to the trailers,

23
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,500
show it to as many people as you possible.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,040
All Ages, all races, all
sexes, transgenders, anybody.

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,040
Just get people to watch
this fucking show. Uh,

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,850
cause I think it's really funny and
I think you guys are a, you know,

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,910
if you liked this shit, you're gonna
like that Shit, you know, whatever. So a,

28
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,780
that comes out December 18th. That's
a big thing. Uh, I got coming up so,

29
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,260
but other than that, I don't know. I don't
got shit to do. I don't got shit to do.

30
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:55,170
I just got back from the airport,
lax.

31
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,700
I immediately came in here to do the
podcast. And uh, the second this is over,

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,050
I'm going downstairs,

33
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:04,830
I'm taking a shower and I put not
pajamas and I'm not taking them off until

34
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,040
fucking thanksgiving.
I think that's the next time I'm actually,

35
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,100
you have to be required to
wear fucking clothes, you know,

36
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:15,600
some sort of respectable clothes.
You know, you can't have you fucking,

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,690
uh,
just my,

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,100
my dad used to walk around in his
underwear all the fucking time.

39
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:24,080
It was just totally acceptable,
tidy. Why? He's in a tee shirt.

40
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,730
You have a dead like that,
who you had no chill out clothes.

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,430
My Dad was a suit and
he would just come home,

42
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,630
just take his suit off and then we'd be
walking around with his dark dress socks

43
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,900
on and is tidy. What? He
always just walked around.

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,500
My whole fucking chill was just completely
fucking normal. In fact, I mean,

45
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:45,300
the only time you ever put on pajamas
was when he was sick and it look weird.

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,220
Um, but anyways, so would say it.
The second this is over, that's it.

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm jumping in the shower and I'm putting
all my fucking PJ's and I'm going to

48
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:58,590
watch a bunch of Bruins
games that I taped.

49
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,420
I'm so fucking happy right now.
Um,

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,330
with the whole way this
weekend went Madison Square
Garden from the bottom of my

51
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,270
heart. If you were one of the many
people that came out that night,

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,990
that was the single greatest
moment of my standup career.

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,370
I can't even put it into words.
I can't believe that it happened.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,160
Um, I just, from the second I got
on stage to the second, it ended,

55
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:28,000
I did like 90 minutes. I went on stage,
right? And before I went on stage,

56
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,060
I was like, what time do I have
to be off? And they were like,

57
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,470
you can't go past 10 30,

58
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,170
cause then the union kicks in and then
I don't make any fucking money. Right.

59
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,180
So I, you know, I went on stage a little
before nine and I got off at like 10,

60
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,410
28.
I just,

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,630
I think I said at one point to the crowd
that I didn't want to get off. And, uh,

62
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,500
they, uh, fortunately applauded and
then I just kept going. And, um,

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,970
I did every joke that I could think of and

64
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,600
it was fucking amazing. My apology.
So I do have to apologize to, uh,

65
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,390
the people that were up to my right.
I thought they were drunk yelling at me.

66
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,370
What they were yelling was
that they couldn't hear.

67
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,650
It was evidently a couple of
pockets during VRC de Rosa. Um,

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,530
I felt bad for Versie cause he thought
they were half one them and stuff and it

69
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:17,730
kind of messed up is set a little
bit, but he's still killed. But, um,

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,330
I thought they were just
drunk. I was like, oh,

71
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,720
it's just a bunch of Yahoos who got a
box and now they're going to be screaming

72
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,360
it's setups. But they were actually
yelling that they couldn't hear.

73
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:29,710
So from what I heard, 10 minutes
into my act, they fixed it. And uh,

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,520
so you heard the last hour and 20? So my
apology or I feel real bad about that.

75
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Um, I don't know why that happened. Um,

76
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,590
but anyways,

77
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,170
okay.

78
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,920
Uh, I'll take you through the whole
day. I want to take it to, you know,

79
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,460
I checked in, I checked
in on Thursday, Friday,

80
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,620
the day before Madison
Square Garden. All right. Um,

81
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,060
I went down to the stand to go do a spot
and I went up there and I fucked around

82
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,730
and trying out this new material
shit that I didn't do it.

83
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,160
Madison Square Garden and you know,
went well and everything.

84
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:10,300
And one of the owners over there
was, was telling me to fucking, um,

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,770
make sure I enjoy Madison Square
Garden and Blah, blah, blah,

86
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:15,910
Blah and all this type of shit.

87
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:19,690
And the whole fucking time I was
downplaying Madison Square Garden.

88
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,810
Um,
and the reality was because I had to,

89
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,310
cause it's fucking Madison Square Garden.

90
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,080
If I actually thought
about the magnitude of it,

91
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,070
I don't know what would have happened.

92
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,660
So I just kept downplaying
it and everything. And um,

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,300
so I did a spot there and then later
on after I did the spot at standup New

94
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,270
York, sorry, the stand
showing my age there,

95
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,020
I walked over to the Grammercy where
they had the goddamn comedy jam.

96
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,800
Um, some drinking my
fucking tee here. And uh,

97
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,870
I went over there and it was the best
comedy jam show that I've seen to date.

98
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,750
Um, Josh and all the guys had
been on the road doing the show.

99
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:04,220
So the band was, sounded the
best I ever heard him sound. Um,

100
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,170
I got to do a sound check there during
the day and you just feel some telling

101
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:13,100
you some venues, just have the magic
and you walked in, you're like,

102
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,270
this is going to be a six show.

103
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,600
And Josh and all the guys were excited
going to do this, going to be no chairs.

104
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,010
Everyone's going to be standing up.

105
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,900
There's going to be 600 people
in the fucking packed. So, um,

106
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,940
so anyway, so we would close out
the show doing paradise city,

107
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,780
um, because they got such great
fucking anthem to end the show with.

108
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,860
And also what's his face Josh was going
through and that's your funniest fucking

109
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,920
costume. Like that blonde
wig looks fucking ridiculous.
So I'm like, all right,

110
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,350
cool. We'll do that. So, um,

111
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,370
everybody went on and killed Matteo Lane,
crushed it,

112
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,290
singing that a Whitney Houston song,
I will always love you.

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,360
Right. Crushed it than Eliza Schlesinger
went up there. She fucking killed it.

114
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,920
Um,

115
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,330
then I saw a big Jay Oakerson
who's one of my favorite comics,

116
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,430
absolutely loved the guy. He sang that
song, is it Weezer say it ain't so,

117
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,140
and he was so fucking relaxed and so
comfortable in big Jake can actually sing.

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,520
He was crushing it and the whole fucking
room was singing along with them.

119
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,640
And I'm going to look at it, get why, how,

120
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:23,150
how's he that fucking comfortable
doing that shit? Each is killing it.

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,320
And uh, I was thinking maybe, cause you
know, he opened up for all these bands,

122
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,960
like he opened up for corn,
insane clown posse.

123
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,140
So those could be really hostile crowds.
He knew how to handle them.

124
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,740
So I'm thinking, well, maybe
he's just like, this is a layup.

125
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,250
These people actually want me to hear it.

126
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,130
So he was walking around like it
was no big deal. But it was funny.

127
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,280
The second he got offstage, he turned
into a little kid. He was just like, dude,

128
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,570
that's like the coolest thing I ever did.
He crushed it.

129
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,410
An animal birds came in and Sang
Bennie and the jets. And by the way,

130
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,530
everybody does stand up beforehand.
You gotta check this show up, you know,

131
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,810
does all their best shit
talks about going to shows.

132
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,330
So makes the crowd laugh, they get
great stand up and then you get to make,

133
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,890
watch them, uh, you know, act like an
idiot in front of a band. And then, um,

134
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,990
I went on in the end and did a,
um,

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,810
paradise city and it was
just a, yeah, it's just some,

136
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,370
it was just fucking sick.

137
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,120
It was just such a great environment
there and everyone was standing up.

138
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,100
And, uh, and then it's also always
fucking hilarious to walk out, you know,

139
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,840
dressed up as,
you know,

140
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:31,490
have a fucking wig on and shit and
then just go into my act, you know,

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,430
talking about people that I think are
fucked up as I'm standing there wearing

142
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,410
this stupid wig in a leather vest.

143
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,420
So we ended up having a great time.
The drums are tuned up.

144
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,940
Fucking just sounded amazing. So, um,

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,820
then ended up hanging out with Barton.
It can. We ended up in this Irish pub,

146
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,150
just me and him and uh,

147
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,950
and the bartender and we ordered like
one beer and in the course of doing,

148
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,900
you know,
sipping on the beer,

149
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,740
we all did like three shots
and then another shot with
the bartender and we just

150
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,770
had the best fucking time,
just sent New York Shit.

151
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:10,680
All of a sudden it's three in the morning,
you go into a Deli, you get a bacon,

152
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,920
egg and cheese, all this shit
you shouldn't be fucking eating.

153
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,110
And went back to my apartment
and just sat there, uh, you know,

154
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,580
talking about how we were going to be
at the garden the next day. So, um,

155
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,181
anyway,

156
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:28,500
so the next day comes and now here it is
and I'm still downplaying it going like

157
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,940
I'm not even fucking excited for this.

158
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,390
Maybe I over downplayed
this fucking thing. So,

159
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,830
as I mentioned during the day,
I was going to have them a,

160
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,050
I rented a drum kit
and I loaded it into a,

161
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,210
they had them loaded into fucking Madison
Square Garden and the Goddamn comedy

162
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:50,211
jam guys came over and we played for
an hour and a half and an empty Madison

163
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,840
Square Garden. It was like my manager,
my agent, my father in law was there,

164
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,040
my publicist, couple
other people. That was it.

165
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,240
And uh,
and Ben Bailey,

166
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,420
who I knew played guitar and
had a studio and everything,

167
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,850
I actually texted him a few
days early. I said, Hey Ben,

168
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:12,750
I'm in New York and we've been trying
to get together and jam for fucking like

169
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:16,560
five years. And I said,
hey man, do you want to la?

170
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,250
Can you play on Saturday? And
he goes, yeah man. He goes,

171
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:24,390
I just finished my studio at my house.
You got to come by. And I just wrote back,

172
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:29,270
now I've got a better place. He
writes back like, what the Fuck Kevin?

173
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,630
He see my place. How do you know it's
better? So I said, you want to fucking,

174
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,870
you know, go to Madison Square
Garden. He fucking freaked out.

175
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,200
So we got a setlist
together and all that shit.

176
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,990
Obviously all the shit that I
did with the combi jam guys,

177
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:47,190
we had that down and Ben Bailey is
like a fucking black Sabbath's freak.

178
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,660
So we learned war pigs and we
supposed to learn one other.

179
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't know we ever got got to it,
but um,

180
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,110
so we ended up going in there,
right?

181
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:01,320
And there's all these guys setting up
chairs and shit for the show that night.

182
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,040
And I was like, Oh man, I don't want to
sit up here and making all this noise,

183
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,000
you know, fucking ruin in
this did thereafter. And I go,

184
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,890
when are they gonna be done setting
up the chair so we don't bug them.

185
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,060
They got out and now
that they're used to it,

186
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:15,720
they used to go ahead and get
up there and play. And um,

187
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,420
we started playing.
It was fucking unbelievable.

188
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,370
And the people working
there actually got into it.

189
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,410
They thought it was cool that we were
doing it because they know we were just

190
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:26,520
geeking out and they started, they'd
started turning on the lights, you know,

191
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:30,600
doing like a light show as we were
playing in an empty fucking Madison Square

192
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,090
Garden. And by the end of it they, uh,

193
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:36,120
they had the video guy comes
down and he starts filming us.

194
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,470
So I guess on the last song
we were up on the Jumbo Tron,

195
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,090
I think we closed the paradise city again,
but we did like custard pie.

196
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:46,860
We did war pigs.
Welcome to the jungle doctor feelgood.

197
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,610
Uh, my publicist also played
drums. He went up there.

198
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:55,110
They did wanted dead or alive. It
just, all this arena rock shit.

199
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,560
My agent went up there, had to drag
him up there. He went up and he played.

200
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,020
Um, I'll, and I'm going to pose, see
some of these pictures to that, that, uh,

201
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,200
that we had a photographer was
going to be there for that night.

202
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,750
He posted them and we had
the best fucking time.

203
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:13,350
And I really think that it helped me.
So my show that night,

204
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:15,750
cause I kind of went in there
and got a feel for the room,

205
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:19,500
got my stink in there a
little bit, you know, and um,

206
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,350
okay.

207
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,430
Just got on the train,

208
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:26,660
went back to my apartment in neo was
getting ready and I was just sitting there

209
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
as I was waiting for her to get ready
and I was uh, I was drinking a Budweiser.

210
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,760
Right.
And I never drink before shows ever.

211
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,750
I don't give a fuck how far ahead
it is. Right. So she just goes,

212
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:43,250
you having a beer? And I was like, yeah.
She goes, he never drank before shows.

213
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:47,690
I was like, no, no. I just felt like
having one. She goes, are you nervous?

214
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,960
I was like, nope. And I don't know why.

215
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,700
I don't know why I wasn't nervous.
I should have been, but I wasn't.

216
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,100
And I went down to the arena
and everybody was there,

217
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,160
had a bunch of people in the
dressing room hanging out,

218
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:04,250
talking almost right up to we went on.
Usually I'm like,

219
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,190
get the fuck Outta here
for the last 10 minutes.

220
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,890
Let me be alone with my thoughts.
I just, he knew what it was.

221
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:14,891
I did those two weeks on tour through
the Midwest and then I did that run

222
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:17,600
through Pennsylvania and down in Florida.
So I was just,

223
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,980
I was on my game and,
um,

224
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,470
I just felt like it was
going to be a good time. So,

225
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,960
so the moment of truth comes right
versus he shows up of course, you know,

226
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,130
wearing a sweater and it's fucking
Jordans or whatever the fuck he had.

227
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:38,870
I forget what he had air max to Rose's
showed up with wearing this fucking

228
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:42,740
hipster old lady sweater, which I
actually made fun of when I got on stage.

229
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:44,160
So Joe Barton,

230
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:48,320
it goes out and he does the voice of God.

231
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,630
You know, I got the video for that.
I'm going to post that too. Um,

232
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,680
it was fucking hilarious watching him.
He got people so fucking amped up, right.

233
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,360
So verse, he goes up, he does his thing
to Rosa does his thing and then they, uh,

234
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,440
and then we showed the trailer for the
first time ever we showed theF is for

235
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,430
family trailer,
uh,

236
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,800
which I literally had to walk into the
tunnel and block my ears because I didn't

237
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:16,830
want to handle if they weren't liking it.
So after it was done a hurricane,

238
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,960
a nice round of applause and the Netflix
people, everybody was excited that a,

239
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,690
that had done well. I hope I'm
not boring you guys with the ship.

240
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,030
I feel like I'm babbling here.
Um,

241
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,760
and then it was the moment of truth
going on stage to do stand up comedy at

242
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:36,761
Madison Square Garden is
sold out fucking show and uh,

243
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,070
Versie introed me
and I dunno,

244
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,850
I just walked out there
and I forget what I said,

245
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,380
but it just was one of those things.

246
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:48,430
It's like you hit your first
shot and you're like, I,

247
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,820
it's going to be a good game.
And

248
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,950
for the next 90 minutes, I don't
think I've ever bought more present.

249
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,510
I just totally fucking enjoyed
every last second of it.

250
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,460
I did every joke that I wanted to do. I
was improvising. I was fucking around.

251
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:08,320
I think I trash babe Ruth at one point,

252
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:12,370
cause me and Yannis Pappas had
this big debate about it. Um,

253
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,510
and I ended up telling this story about
me and versus smoking a cigar in his

254
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:20,930
garage. That's how I ended. And, uh,

255
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,940
and it was over, and I, and I
outro, uh, the outro music, oh,

256
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,080
I went on stage to the song remains the
same because the name of the show was,

257
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,600
does anybody remember laughter?
It was just like a fucking park.

258
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,680
It was a perfect night.

259
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,640
And then the outro music was Frank
Sinatra Sing in New York, New York,

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,010
which I thought was perfect.
It was a nod to, you know,

261
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:44,580
they played at Yankee Stadium
and everything and Madison
Square Gardens in such

262
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:49,140
a legendary venue. Uh, and I got
off dude, and it was just, it was,

263
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,170
it was unbelieving.

264
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,960
Everybody that I care about was backstage
was flipping out saying what a great

265
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:57,550
show it was.
And uh,

266
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,850
yeah. And I was worried. I was worried.

267
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:05,330
The only thing I was worried about was
that the next day I was going to have a

268
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,870
letdown. Like I was going
to have that hole. Now what?

269
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,820
And do you know all the big extent,

270
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:13,040
no psych after you open all the
gifts on Christmas, you know,

271
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,650
that feeling of melancholy,
I thought it was going to feel that I did.

272
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,240
The next day I woke up, I just
felt great. I felt satisfied.

273
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,360
I felt at peace. I was just like,
if I never get to do that again,

274
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,040
I couldn't have done it any better. And
I enjoy every last fucking second of it.

275
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:33,041
It was the night of my life and of course
I recorded it and I will be putting

276
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,730
that one out on vinyl. My Act is not
ready to be a special yet, but uh,

277
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,240
that will definitely be an, I'm putting
out every fucking second of that.

278
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,030
So it might be a double album.
Um,

279
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,500
I'll put that out hopefully
after my next special. Um,

280
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,900
but it was,
it was incredible.

281
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,360
The only part of the night
that wasn't fun was, uh,

282
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,200
when we went to the after party. Um,
one of the people that I work with,

283
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,140
um, no, it was a, it goes actually dates.

284
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:07,640
Uh, I don't want it to
say that. Business states,

285
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:11,090
this guy who was a big
fucking fan of the UFC,

286
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:15,440
so somehow he had the UFC feed on,
uh,

287
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,420
on his computer and neo was screaming,
going, Bill, get over here, get over here.

288
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,040
Rhonda is having a tough time, blah, blah.

289
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,900
And I was just talking to some people
and I didn't want to be rude. Um,

290
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,610
and then I just saw near
God, Oh my God. Oh my God.

291
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:34,330
But I hand over mouth and uh,

292
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,990
I went over there and I saw the replay
or Brian to get knocked out and I get it.

293
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,240
I haven't had a feeling like that
since I watched Tyson get knocked down.

294
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,510
It's just something like,
you know, you just, I dunno,

295
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,660
I love greatness and I didn't, I
didn't want to see the, you know,

296
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,320
I didn't want to see that.
Congratulations to Holly Holm.

297
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,910
I hope I'm saying her name right.

298
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:59,840
So she doesn't kick me in the fucking
John Neck. But that was fucking brutal.

299
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,730
Brutal to watch.

300
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,030
And it's one of the reasons why I have
such respect for fighters is they know

301
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:08,870
that say keep fighting eventually,
you know, on any given night,

302
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,250
even somebody is not as good as you,
you can just get caught.

303
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,050
And I hate when there's something like
that happens and then people say, yeah,

304
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:18,170
you know, you know what's up
now bitch and blah, blah, blah.

305
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,040
Like you ever had the balls
to fucking go in there. Um,

306
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,150
I obviously think Ryan is going to be
back. I mean, she's only 28 years old,

307
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,530
you know,
whatever she got caught,

308
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,340
I actually think now should probably
become a better fighter because a,

309
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:34,370
that whole fucking pressure of, of, um,

310
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,140
being undefeated is gone and she can
just focus on what she needs to do. But,

311
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:43,140
uh, that was fucking brutal,
man. That was really brilliant.

312
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:44,120
It actually reminded me,

313
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:49,121
I had this flashback aside from the fact
when I watched Tyson get knocked out by

314
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:51,910
buster Douglas, I watched that, uh,

315
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,460
over my buddies house up in his
bedroom. Right. We were like,

316
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,970
I think we were underage. Yeah, we were
underage. No, we weren't. No, we weren't.

317
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,450
Why are we, I can't even remember
how long ago I just went,

318
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:06,610
we were drinking beers in his bedroom,
right.

319
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,360
And he had this fucking TV in his bedroom,

320
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,430
which was fucking
ridiculous back in the day,

321
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:12,470
if you had a fucking TV in
your bedroom was insane.

322
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,830
Most houses had one TV and
maybe a little kitchen TV.

323
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,170
And we were watching it on
this fucking thing. And, um,

324
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,960
I, I just, I just remember,

325
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,030
I just remember sitting there
and just handled with my mouth.

326
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,840
I couldn't fucking believe it. You just
never thought Tyson was going to lose.

327
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,800
And I felt the same way about Rhonda and,
um,

328
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,110
but that's happened two times on big
gigs for me that there's been a big fight

329
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,970
with something unbelievable happen.
Sorry,

330
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,230
drinking the tea here.
I'm the first one was a,

331
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:45,810
okay.

332
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,680
Who was the first time I
ever did comics come home,

333
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:50,890
which I believe was the
second one afterwards.

334
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:55,891
The after party was in this bar and
they had the Tyson Holyfield fight,

335
00:19:56,051 --> 00:20:00,610
the one where Tyson was biking,
holy fields, fucking ears. And,

336
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:03,820
uh, you know, the bar was loud so
he couldn't hear the announcers.

337
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,010
So he had no idea what was going on.

338
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,900
And the second time when like Holyfield
was like grabbing beautiful bodies,

339
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:11,740
like gloves up,

340
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,220
like trying to grab his ear and he
was dead fucking temper Tantrum,

341
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:18,710
almost like a little kid jumping up and
down when I got the fuck's going on with

342
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:21,370
them mad, he's looks like he's
like on fire or something.

343
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,210
And then so many fine just
goes, dude, did he like Joe Day?

344
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:29,590
Fucking buy is right. And then all of
a sudden it just became that. And then,

345
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,060
you know,
when he went to the,

346
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,380
it was kind of cool to actually see what
the sound down and then they focus in

347
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:36,540
on his ear,
the blood and that,

348
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,480
that little bit taken out of his ear and
everybody in the crowd just going like,

349
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:45,380
dude, what the fuck? Um, and
that was beyond a surreal night.

350
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,600
It was the first big Gig.

351
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:50,130
Let's first time ever met Denis leary
and it was all these famous guys on the

352
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:54,480
show. And Larry knew all these hockey
guys. Cam Neely was there, fucking, uh,

353
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,760
uh, Chris Nyland was there, Rick
Middleton, I couldn't fucking believe it.

354
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,570
And then I'm watching this fight and
I'm watching them reacting like regular

355
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:07,860
fight fans like I'll do, did he fucking
bite him in the air? Like, well, you know,

356
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,540
just acting regular. So, um,

357
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,950
I got to admit that was
really fucking tough to see.

358
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,660
Okay.

359
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,680
That was tough to see that
fucking picture. We're just
sort of taking that shot,

360
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:24,210
man. I ain't seen that happens to just
about every other than rocky Marciano that

361
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:28,750
happens to every Greg
fighter. Um, so anyways,

362
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:33,420
so that was that night. All right, so
here we go. My Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

363
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:38,010
So Friday I get to fucking do the goddamn
comedy jam in front of 600 standing

364
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:40,020
room only people at the Gramercy theater.

365
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,940
Saturday I jammed during the day in an
empty Madison Square Garden and have the

366
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,580
set of my fucking life

367
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,350
did this most famous
arena and all that shit.

368
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:55,010
The Mecca and all that crap that I
always hate that they say it, you know,

369
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,320
as a Celtic Fan, but Boston,
God doesn't exist anymore. Um,

370
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,040
and then Sunday, how do you top it?
Audio topic. Where did he get go?

371
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,510
I went to the giants patriots scape.
Hilarious. Mean a buddy of mine.

372
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:14,190
We ubered over there. Right. And
uh, and we knew like another,

373
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:16,800
like two or three other groups
of two that we're going to there.

374
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:18,480
And we were all looking for a tailgate.

375
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,210
We were trying to meet up with each other.
We just showed up.

376
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:24,540
Like the guy just pulls up to
like the exit off of the highway.

377
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,790
We just get out there,
you know,

378
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,720
stumbling up the fucking hill with a 12
pack in our hand and they let us into

379
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,930
this gated area where they had tailgates.

380
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,250
I felt like it was in like a tent city
and we just wandering around like a two

381
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:39,330
man without a country.

382
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:43,530
And we finally just ended up sitting
on like this Jersey barrier. Oh,

383
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:48,270
I remember what happened. Um,
a couple more of my friends
showed up and they will,

384
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,090
they like, did you find a tailgate?
I was like, no, I tweeted it out,

385
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:54,840
but nobody got back to me about,
uh, letting us crash the tailgates.

386
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,780
And my buddy was like,
well, when we walked in,

387
00:22:57,781 --> 00:22:59,820
these people asked us if we had any beers.

388
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,630
So we walked back over and we literally
traded beers for food and joined their

389
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,630
tailgate. It was like a, we were like
fur trappers instead of having pelts,

390
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:14,631
we had like fucking bud light and shit
and I'm cooked us up some burgers.

391
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:18,600
They were all giant fans and uh,
you know,

392
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,480
breaking my balls about losing the
super bowl. But, you know, we were cool.

393
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:22,990
We were like, yeah, dude,
you guys fucking owners.

394
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,920
We haven't been since the end of 2007.
There's nothing we can say.

395
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,440
I fucking love Eli. You know,
he's a big, he's of fucking Gamer,

396
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,750
but I hate them because it
always breaks our heart.

397
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,000
So we fucking go in and
we watched the game.

398
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,520
I can't even intelligently
talk what was going on.

399
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:42,240
I was still flying so fucking high
from MSG and I was drinking of course.

400
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,220
And um,
it was this little kept giving a shit,

401
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,790
tearing up stuff and throwing it at
us and we weren't being assholes.

402
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,010
We laughed at it at first that she just
kept giving a shit. She was like seven,

403
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,640
you know, at some point you're looking
at the parents like, can, can you,

404
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,990
can you not have a her
app behave in this way?

405
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,950
What are you trying to do?

406
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:03,260
She was like going to be one
of the worst sports fans ever.

407
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,640
She's going to get one of her boyfriends
knocked the fuck out when she gets

408
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:11,160
older because she's going to behave this
way, but the person did nothing. So, um,

409
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,530
we watched the game and I thought
once again, you know, once,

410
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:19,160
when we scored that touchdown, they called
that bullshit holding call. I was like,

411
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,220
ah, here we go. Here we
go. What's going to happen?

412
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:26,690
But finally Tom Brady
had some Eli football.

413
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:27,590
God luck.

414
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,480
He threw up fucking picture and
the game and they dropped it.

415
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,130
Um, so there you go. I
said he lay was dealt.

416
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,190
I said the man was fucking do to have a
game where the football doesn't bounces

417
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,150
way or whatever, but uh, it's not
like he screwed up or anything.

418
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:49,190
He didn't throw a fucking picky.
He actually threw a touchdown,

419
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:52,340
great play by Malcolm Butler.
Um,

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,290
I didn't get to really see the
replay a son on the jump on Trump,

421
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,560
but I'm sure if I was watching it at
home, I probably say, well, you know,

422
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,310
back in the day that would have
been considered a touchdown. Um,

423
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,560
but who knows what these toll new
fucking football move rules or whatever.

424
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,110
But, um, it was great too. It was
great to see them fucking win the game.

425
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,430
And it was great to see,
you know,

426
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,970
to be able to say that I saw Brady and
he live play against each other live.

427
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,360
I saw Brady and Pete Manning
play each other live.

428
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:23,770
We back in all foreign manning was still
on the colts that hadn't won a super

429
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:26,960
bowl yet. Um, so that
was a great one to see.

430
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:31,961
But in all paled in comparison
to doing Madison Square Garden.

431
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:37,090
So Diego, there's a 24 minutes story
on my fucking last three days. Um,

432
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,590
I got to read some of the
advertising here, but once again,

433
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,960
I can't thank the people
that showed up enough, um,

434
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,300
that, that, that was, it was
unfucking believable. You know,

435
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:53,370
it's funny when I left too far as he was,

436
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,680
was Leno all amped up and shit.
Now, you know, I was flying high,

437
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,020
it was just sick and we walked
over to the after party,

438
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,280
write down like the streets in New York.
And first he was flipping out going,

439
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,780
dude, you realize what? You just did an
that he realized how hard you realize.

440
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,880
I was just like, yeah, yeah, it's
the best they could fucking do.

441
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,380
And then we went in and when I
went to the after party, we drank,

442
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:21,260
we smoked cigars. It was fucking second.
Then ended the night with a bacon,

443
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:25,760
egg and cheese. It has fucking was the
shit, the shit. And now I'm on vacation.

444
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,360
I remember somebody said
to me, Oh, now what?

445
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,800
Now I'm trying to put that in my head now
what? It's like, what do you mean now?

446
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:37,730
What? Now what? Now I enjoy my
evening. No, no. What's next?

447
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:38,810
I don't give a fuck.

448
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,020
Like you're not supposed to be able to
top something that what you supposed to

449
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:48,640
go in there is enjoy every fucking second
of it and do the best you can possibly

450
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:52,180
do, which is what I did. So I am told
there's diverse know what's next.

451
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,870
Okay.

452
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,270
I, you know, I think I probably, when
the person asked me that, it's just like,

453
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,070
do you want me to stand how much
I love doing what you stand up?

454
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:02,010
I do it right now and for a six people
and if I got a new bit out of it,

455
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,500
I'd still be excited.
Yeah.

456
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:04,690
Okay.

457
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,180
So we've got gotta be some kind of
fucking ruin it. Oh, it's my dog back.

458
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,730
Hey Buddy. Look who's hopefully
I'll get down to Jesus Christ.

459
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,080
Hey, what's going on?
Alright. Right. Alright,

460
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,620
get down all cleo. Hang on a second.
I haven't seen her in two weeks.

461
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:25,050
I've got to give her a proper, hello?
What do you say that? Why you come here?

462
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,390
What's that one?
What's that one?

463
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,970
You got a bath? Look at you. Yeah.
Okay. All right. I'm doing the podcast.

464
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm doing applied yet.

465
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:41,360
Oh, sorry. Sorry, I'm back. I'm back.

466
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,260
Look at you. Wow. The old blue bear.

467
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,640
Your blueberries back in the building.
I haven't seen my dog in two weeks.

468
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,470
You and I, lady, Cleo, you and I are
going to go on some fucking hikes,

469
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,440
my friend. I'm in town for the rest of
the year. What do you think about that?

470
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,641
You know,

471
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:02,090
I put on some pounds and I'm going to
get back and pit bull shape and I'm not

472
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:06,890
talking about the wrap
up. Um, all right buddy.

473
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,870
Can you get over there and lay down?
Cleo, can you go lie down please? Go on.

474
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,450
Go lay down. Go lay down. No,
I'll play with you in a minute.

475
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,020
Hey, get your nose out of
there. Go lay down. Down. Sorry.

476
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,070
Is this even a podcast anymore? Clear
up. Get up. Get over there. Go on.

477
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,240
Walk over there. Lay down. You can't
keep jumping up here. Um, all right,

478
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:33,410
let's do some reads for this week,
a dollar shave club.

479
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:37,850
Everybody stopped shaving
with an old razor. It's gross.

480
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,270
Why are you torturing yourself with
the gross old blade week after week?

481
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,820
Why would you do that to yourself?
Why don't you love yourself? Uh,

482
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,820
it's probably because
you don't want to say,

483
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,280
actually the real reason is probably
because you want to shell out 20 bucks for

484
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:50,300
a pack of new ones,
right?

485
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,860
Dollar Shave club.com has revolutionized
the way that people shave men in

486
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:56,960
particularly with dollar Shave Club,

487
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:00,890
you shave with a fresh blade as often
as you want because they deliver a whole

488
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:04,850
sleeve of amazing raises.
But just a few bucks a month.

489
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,640
The razors are so good.
Hey, I keep it down.

490
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm doing the podcast.

491
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,403
Hmm.

492
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,070
Um, I said, can you keep
it down? I'm trying to do,

493
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,280
the podcast should like louder than me.
I'm fucking with you,

494
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,130
Jesus. Sometimes the jokes
work, sometimes they don't. Um,

495
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,480
even the billion dollar razor companies,
uh, corporations are freaking out,

496
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,900
but instead of lowering their bloated
prices, what are these pigs do?

497
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,380
They trying to fool you into milking
the same blade for an extra month.

498
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,990
And you know what, that's gross.
It's not good for your face either.

499
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,110
They've price gouged to us
for long enough. Attica,

500
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,400
never go back to squeezing weeks and
weeks of shaves out of a disgusting rusty

501
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:52,570
blade. All you gotta to do is just join
dollar shave club and use a fresh blade,

502
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,810
uh, whenever you want. It feels
amazing and it's a third of the price.

503
00:29:55,811 --> 00:30:00,550
Join the millions and millions of
fans, uh, millions of others who, uh,

504
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,350
figured out the smarter way to shave.
Uh,

505
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,640
join dollar shave club now by going
to dollar shave club.com/burr.

506
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,820
That's dollar shave club.com/bar hey
dollar shave club.com/burb all right,

507
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,250
here's a new one. MVMT watches. Oh,

508
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,720
movement watches,
sorry.

509
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,010
Thanks to movement watches for
their sponsorship of this podcast.

510
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,390
They sent over some watches and I
haven't received them yet. You know what?

511
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:33,270
I've been on the road, but whatever. I'm
sure they're great. Sure. They tell time,

512
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,170
you know,
check them up.

513
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,430
It was this little crowdfunded brand that
is revolutionizing the watch game and

514
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,410
they started to get a lot
of press from a GQ playboy.

515
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,140
Hypebeast askmen said they are the
hottest watch company on the market.

516
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,100
Is that right? Well, anything that's
fucking over the Iwatch is great for me.

517
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,100
I think that's hilarious.
Cleo, have you seen anybody,

518
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,140
any of your friends have
the, uh, the Iwatch?

519
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,350
Quality crafted watches start at just $95.

520
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,800
If you tried to get a watch
like this at a department store,

521
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:09,460
you'd be spending at least four or 500
bucks. They're style is minimalist.

522
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,180
It's clean and sleek.
Um,

523
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,810
you could wear this thing at the
office during the day or night at bars.

524
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,690
It's new, it's sharp, and it's an all day.

Um,
she'll calm down on that.

557
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,740
A military response,
a bill.

558
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,760
I'm not affiliated with any
political party. Read extremists.

559
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,230
Whenever anybody says I'm not
a Democrat or Republican, um,

560
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,680
hold on. You're just going to make all
kinds of fucking noise up here on shit.

561
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,670
All right.
I hate groups just as much as you do.

562
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,210
I'm not looking forward to hearing people
argue about proper responses to recent

563
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:53,530
attacks in Paris because everyone talks
like they have military background.

564
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,780
That being said,
what is the solution?

565
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,950
It seems like it's always a damned if
you do and damned if you don't situation

566
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:02,260
with the military action.
In one sense.

567
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:05,530
I find that comforting knowing
that it's fucked up either way,

568
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:09,950
it means we're just human beings
getting yeah. By thoughts. Um,

569
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,860
all right. What do I
think? Well, obviously,

570
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:19,350
you know what happened in Paris is
fucking brutal and I don't see how that,

571
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,800
you know, even if I agreed
with the political agenda
of wherever the hell did it,

572
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,230
like that's not the way to get people to,
uh,

573
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,430
pay attention to your plate
to do stuff like that.

574
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:34,980
Okay.

575
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,820
Having said that,

576
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,240
I live in a superpower and I know that
our bombs don't always land on the right

577
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:43,380
people. So I understand why countries
don't get along with each other.

578
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,960
Um,
and I've been to Paris twice in,

579
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:52,430
it's my favorite city in the world.
And I think the people are great and it's,

580
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,580
it's just brute an eagles
of death metal or on stage.

581
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,820
Thank God they were all right,
but just, I can't imagine why.

582
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,083
I mean,

583
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,060
nobody was in that building is going
to be the same. I mean, it's just like,

584
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,030
I can't even imagine. It's
just, I didn't actually,

585
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:11,210
I didn't even want to talk about this
stuff is so fucking brutal. But um,

586
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:16,290
unfortunately I think that human beings
are a hairless apes that can speak and,

587
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,753
um,

588
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,200
okay.

589
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,170
And we're doomed to destroy one another.

590
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,780
So try to enjoy every fucking
day before, uh, we deal. I mean,

591
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:31,610
that's the only thing. I mean, there's no,

592
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:32,510
okay,

593
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,510
there's no stopping 'em all this shit
that's going on the fucking world.

594
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,350
We're never going to get along.
We're just not going to, you know,

595
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,060
there's no solution in the Middle East,
whatever side you're on,

596
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,280
those people hate each other for fucking
ever. I'm the only way, you know,

597
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,700
the only way you could fucking do it
is you'd have to eliminate everybody.

598
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:01,590
But like babies and you'd have
to start over again. So all this,

599
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:05,760
nobody told them the fucking stories
about why you should hate these people.

600
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,450
Right? But even if you left
the fucking babies alone,

601
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,000
cause there's this big fucking
thing where they go, you know,

602
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:16,020
a baby comes into the world and a baby
isn't racist and a baby isn't this and a

603
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:20,130
baby isn't that. Uh, but you know what
a baby is. It's a fucking human being.

604
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,680
All right.
And so one of those babies,

605
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,060
eventually it's going to be a sociopath.
One of them's going to be, uh,

606
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:30,870
an egomaniac he's going to give into,
to jealousy and envy.

607
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,980
And it would just start all over again
in different parts of the world for

608
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:37,380
different fucking reasons. And, uh,

609
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,600
people would not like people
because of how they looked.

610
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,290
And it's just how we're wired.
I think everything has a beginning,

611
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:47,910
a middle and the end. We're closer
to the fucking end, unfortunately.

612
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,660
And um,
you know,

613
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,380
that's why I don't watch the fucking
news anymore. That's why I, I,

614
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:02,250
I, I don't, I don't understand
why it is the way it is.

615
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,030
And there is no fucking solution.
I know that's depressing and uh,

616
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,350
enjoy your holidays, everybody. I just,

617
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,760
what are you going to do?

618
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,230
What are you going to do to stop these
people do my dog just keeps wagging her

619
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:19,140
tail is right just sitting on a couch
with your fucking dark man, right?

620
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,510
That's it. Playing music with some
friends of yours, doing a comedy show,

621
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,050
going after a dream is going after
what the fuck you want in life.

622
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,250
That's all you can do.

623
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,870
You can do that and you can recycle
and you can try to use less materials.

624
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:37,530
But other than that, what do you,
what do you do you really think,

625
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,480
and all the years of watching the fucking,

626
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,260
the debates between Democrats
and republics do Republicans.

627
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,000
You think they're ever
going to fucking agree.

628
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,730
You think they're ever going to be
like, no. I see your point. You know,

629
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:50,430
if you get the people at top more
money, they're going to create jobs. Oh,

630
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:54,180
I get what you're doing. Or The people
on Republicans are going to be like, Oh,

631
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,920
you know what?
Maybe we are taking too much.

632
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:59,340
Maybe we should fucking do this
and do there. There's, there's no,

633
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,220
there's no fucking solution. It says
like when I was in New York, you know,

634
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,340
they were talking about, you know,
all the homeless people, you know,

635
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:08,370
and people with mental problems and
shit that, that's just on the street.

636
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,100
The police chief goes,

637
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:14,880
the solution was stop giving them
money and it's just like, all right.

638
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,040
And then what? They just go, okay,

639
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,740
well I guess the city isn't giving
money and they're going to do like what?

640
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:24,420
Walk to Philadelphia with no money and
no food. They're going to get desperate.

641
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,050
Um,
you know,

642
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,540
and then if you give them food and
money and then what does that mean?

643
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,920
Then they get their life back together.
I have no fucking idea. I just, I dunno.

644
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,560
I don't think there's any solution.

645
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,763
MMM.

646
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,530
And that's depressing
and it's not even funny.

647
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,620
That's why I don't talk
about that type of shit.

648
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,570
So moving along to the
next happy fucking topic.

649
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,370
Alright, boyfriend won't shut up and
let me listen to the game now. Right?

650
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,550
Bill, I'd been in a relationship.
What do you have fucking,

651
00:38:58,551 --> 00:39:03,290
did you marry a hipster? So you want
to put on the Scifi channel a bell?

652
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,860
I've been in a relationship with
my wonderful boyfriend for a year.

653
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,810
I'm 29 and he is 33. Yeah, that's
a good age split right there. Uh,

654
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:15,590
he's a wonderful man. Treats me
very well and we are very in love,

655
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,320
but he has no respect.
When I tried to listen to the game,

656
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,920
I'm a diehard Denver Bronco
Fan and we live in Chicago.

657
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,090
It is Sunday and the game is not being
aired locally because there's showing

658
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,240
your laneless patriots instead.
Lame ass.

659
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,780
Patrius um, yeah, I get it.

660
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,440
We're undefeated and you're not. So
that annoys you. I get it. So your tech,

661
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,160
my team, my team of Patriots.
How can I like the Patriots?

662
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:42,680
That means you don't support the troops.
Uh,

663
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,820
so my only option is to listen to the
game on Denver Broncos radio network.

664
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,220
You Go,
you can also get the NFL package.

665
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,520
You could not go out and drink in one
weekend. You could use that money,

666
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,400
could watch him every
week. Anyway, she goes,

667
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,800
but my boyfriend makes it
impossible for me to listen to it.

668
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,260
He keeps playing a stupid videos
during the game talks, uh,

669
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,470
talks a lot like the game isn't even
on and even broke out into a song and

670
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:10,300
started vacuuming.
This is not a one time occurrence.

671
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,580
Last week it was on any kept switching
over to other Games is sports or hockey

672
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,930
and baseball and I never once interfered
with his ability to watch the black

673
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:22,930
hawks and the cubs. Yeah.
He makes it impossible for
me to listen to the Broncos,

674
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,790
the only sports team I really care about
Jesus Christ. This guy's an asshole.

675
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,180
He doesn't seem to have any respect
for my team and sports fandom.

676
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,030
It's surprising because he's
so respectful. Otherwise,

677
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,920
how do I handle this going forward? Should
I just always leave and go to the bar?

678
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:42,790
Because I know he makes it impossible
for you to watch the game or listen and

679
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:46,180
listen and watch the game. That's
one of them. That's one solution.

680
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,890
Why don't you just write down on a piece
of paper? If you don't shut the fuck up,

681
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:52,510
I will never blow you again.

682
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,430
And then flip it over and say
I'm serious after he goes,

683
00:40:57,431 --> 00:41:01,540
are you serious right
now? I am serious. Um,

684
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,940
I dunno if you have you sat down and uh,

685
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,830
talk to them about it, you know, I dunno.

686
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,620
See then, let's see. Look at this right
here. This is a little tension here.

687
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,950
Hatfields and McCoys. What do you
do? And if he doesn't listen to you,

688
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:19,950
then you're going to get resentful.
That's it.

689
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,870
I would just politely ask them
not to do and he does it again.

690
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,150
The next time one of his games are on,
I would vacuum.

691
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,210
I just keep turning the vacuum
on, on and off, on and off.

692
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:32,330
And if you do that to him for like
five minutes, he's going to get it.

693
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,720
I think you got to go child to share.
If you haven't talked to him yet,

694
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:37,310
I think you got to go childish.
You know,

695
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,940
there's always room to act
like an absolute fucking baby.

696
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,990
Don't ever forget that and
it's fun. Um, all right,

697
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,450
thanksgiving dilemma. Uh,
hey Billy. So I will get,

698
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,140
I will get right to the details. My
family is hosting Thanksgiving this year.

699
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,090
Oh geesh. We have five people in our
family, mom, dad, and three brothers.

700
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,740
I am the middle child.

701
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,340
We have grandparents for both my mom
and dad's side coming along with my

702
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:09,110
grandparents. We have cousins coming.
All right, now, here is my dilemma.

703
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,570
Here's my dilemma.
Comes into play.

704
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,610
My cousin got married a while back and
his wife has asked if her mom could come

705
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:21,050
to our Thanksgiving
dinner. Uh, Jesus Christ,

706
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,020
Jesus Christ. You know, there's,

707
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,740
there's something to be said when you've
lived that long and you don't have a

708
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:32,000
Thanksgiving party to go to. The probably
means you're a fucking asshole. Um,

709
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:33,590
my mom had to go.

710
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,640
My mom had gotten into a little dispute
with her like a few months ago and my

711
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:42,320
mom fucking hates her. Uh, Jesus
Christ, you can't do that. People,

712
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,740
he can't get into a fight with
you fucking in. You can't do it.

713
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,830
You can't get in a fight with your, uh,
I don't even know what you call them.

714
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,200
If your brother or sister gets married,

715
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,290
you can't get into what they're
fucking analyze. You just can't do it.

716
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,700
You get to bite your
tongue and just be like,

717
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,140
I'm going to sit here and my sweater.

718
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,680
I'm going to smile and wave and this is
going to be over and then I'm going to

719
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,960
go back to the life that I'm,
that I'm leading,

720
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,980
that I built and I'll deal with this
person once a fucking year. Right.

721
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,960
Why is there always a
current male of female?

722
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,490
There's always that one fucking
person just doesn't know how to hang,

723
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,880
doesn't know how to be a good
person. You know what I mean? Like,

724
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,550
like if you are knowing people on
Thanksgiving, which is his coops, Kevin,

725
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:28,580
who that's just the greatest day.
You hanging with the people you love,

726
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,820
you're eating way too much food.
It's all delicious.

727
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:36,320
Everybody from all different families
and shed is breaking out their secret

728
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:40,220
recipes.
There's football on his video games.

729
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:44,930
You got the fire going.
There is no fucking reason

730
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,600
to even remotely be a cancer on
that day off for the whole weekend.

731
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,350
It's just a, it's just a Pfister,
the greatest fucking weekend.

732
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,940
College kids come back Wednesday night.
Everybody fucking hangs out.

733
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,570
He get to tired of fucking hookup with
people that you liked back in the day

734
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:05,660
when you were in high
school. Right? By the way,

735
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,850
you got to do that Wednesday night hookup,
man.

736
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,090
You got to do that until you're like
fucking 30 and everybody starts disappear

737
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:14,930
and then you've got to realize
you're too fucking old.

738
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,360
And then maybe I should go
out and fucking, uh, you know,

739
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,440
maybe I should go out and get
married myself or whatever. But uh,

740
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,920
read through your 20s. You're going to
hit that every fucking time. In fact,

741
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:28,820
you know, we did a great rant about
that. The one man thrill ride,

742
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,700
the one men throw rights. Got a great
one. I'll try to find that video. Um,

743
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,560
he's got a great video about
that. But anyways, yeah,

744
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:41,430
there's no reason to be a cunt.
I just don't fucking get it.

745
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,870
And there's nothing to like,

746
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,870
your mom needs to set aside her shit.
You had one fucking argument.

747
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,820
All right. Let me go back and read
every, forget now. This is this

748
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,210
your mom's sons mother-in-law.
You have to get along with her.

749
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,980
My cousin got me all your cousin.
Uh, it's a little distant.

750
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,350
Just just be fucking civil.

751
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,800
You know what's funny is when men don't
like each other, it's way more civil.

752
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,500
It's a family event like that because
we solve shit with via violence.

753
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:17,750
Do you know what I mean?
No one wants to get involved in that,

754
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,190
but women are more mature I guess.
So they don't solve shit with violence.

755
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:26,300
So it all it is is dirty looks
and fucking, you know, Sasha,

756
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:29,870
your sides or whatever the fuck you
call him, side glances and shit.

757
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,900
They just all day long.
They don't give a fuck.

758
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:37,460
They just be just openly being
rude to one another. Oh my God.

759
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:41,000
You know what you should do? You
should. You should have like a fucking,

760
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,350
I should just have an area to
put people like that. All right,

761
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:48,950
you two douche bags don't get along
so you can, you guys can both eat.

762
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,160
You can eat Thanksgiving dinner,
standing up outside in the backyard.

763
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:56,300
That's where you should stick them.
Right the fuck out of here. All right.

764
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:58,970
My mom had got into a little of the street
with them a few months ago and my mom

765
00:45:58,971 --> 00:46:02,990
fucking hates her. She's the type
of lady that just sits on her ass.

766
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:07,760
It doesn't help making food,
doing the dishes, cleaning
up or anything. Yeah, yeah,

767
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,330
exactly. There's always one
of those. We know that. Yeah.

768
00:46:11,331 --> 00:46:15,680
And then fucking goes to the, your bar and
did, takes out the most expensive shit.

769
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,570
Doesn't finish it. You know what I
mean? Dumps it down the fucking sink. A,

770
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:21,860
we know this from the shoot times.

771
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:26,861
We hung out with her at family gathering
spiked cousin's wife's mom has no other

772
00:46:27,111 --> 00:46:30,770
place to go for Thanksgiving yet.
Cheat. Why do you think that is?

773
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,280
Cause she doesn't help making the food.

774
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:38,060
She doesn't do the dishes and clean up
or anything. She's a Douche. Oh my God,

775
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:42,440
I fucking hate this
person. Um, but honestly,

776
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:46,190
none of us really know her or nor do
we want her to come and make our day

777
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:47,024
awkward.

778
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,750
I guess I just need to ask advice and
how we respond to my cousin and tell him

779
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:52,430
that that bitch isn't invited.

780
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,240
We don't know how to do it without hurting
feelings or making it weird the next

781
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:58,550
time we see them.
Um,

782
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,800
you can bring Nia in on this one if she
knows how to set this bitch down easy.

783
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,010
You know what? I'm going to go get her.
Hang on one second. Hang on one second.

784
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,110
Hey Nia, I need you to help
on this one. All right.

785
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:16,760
Even though you still mad at me for
my, my rude comment earlier. Can you,

786
00:47:16,761 --> 00:47:20,980
can you come over? This is, this is, this
is recording live. You couldn't clean up.

787
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:25,280
Get down. Get Down Buddy. I'm sorry.
Get over there laid out going. Yeah,

788
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,460
I hear you. All right, come
over here. So long story short,

789
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,510
this guy has got a dilemma he's having,
he's having Thanksgiving at his house.

790
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,410
Okay.
So here's this dilemma.

791
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:43,411
His cousin got married a while back and
his cousin's wife's asked if her mom can

792
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:49,090
come along. Okay. All right.
And evidently she's a Douche.

793
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,690
She doesn't help with the cooking.
She doesn't help with the cleaning.

794
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:56,770
She just sits around. She's
a jerk. Okay. And guess what?

795
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,640
She has no place to go for thanksgiving.
Can you believe it? Can you believe this?

796
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:04,210
Jerk him over here near the microphone.
I know, I know. Just really quickly.

797
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,070
Oh my God, you so mad at me right now.
So was the question. So how can he,

798
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,730
how can he just in a nice way,
let this woman down easy.

799
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:14,080
Like how can you just say,
listen,

800
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,880
we'd love to have your mother over here
if she wasn't such a jerk and she wasn't

801
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:23,020
going to ruin thanksgiving. So
we, so the cousin is coming,

802
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,150
the cousin was invited. Yup.
And he's bringing his wife.
They're both invited. Yeah.

803
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,010
They just don't want them to
bring his cousin's wife's mom.

804
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,670
Yeah. That's an impossible
situation. I feel you though,

805
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,100
because you want to be like,
well it's my house.

806
00:48:40,101 --> 00:48:44,510
I can have how whoever I want over and
if I don't want this person over as you

807
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:44,640
know.

808
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,160
But the thing is what the holidays and
family and this is the cousin's wife's

809
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:52,400
mom, that's one. You're not
going to be able to win.

810
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,810
So I feel like you can't
turn them down and say, no,

811
00:48:56,811 --> 00:49:01,811
they can't come because that will
create a bigger problem than it's worth.

812
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,550
And so what?
What does she do?

813
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:09,050
She just doesn't like my mom got into a
little dispute with her a few months ago

814
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:10,720
and my mom fucking hates or oh yeah.

815
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,800
Oh, it was brutal. Okay, well I know,

816
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:18,550
I love that you have to be like the
bigger person and just allow this fucking

817
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:22,000
stick in the mud to come over and
ruin this person's thanksgiving.

818
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,300
I really feel for this person,
right.

819
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,540
Blows. I think. I think
what you can do is,

820
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,390
especially since the mom
doesn't get along with her,

821
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,970
I think it may be one of those
things like, you know what,

822
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:35,270
we're really only prepared
for like this many people and

823
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,070
but they had the fight and the falling
out. They're going to know what's up.

824
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:44,350
They got to know why she's not. Show me
says, can, can you, can I bring my mom?

825
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,730
You have to say yes.
You can know your mom could stay at home.

826
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,940
That's the thing about it.
And the thing is I would,

827
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,970
I think maybe this is more
advice for the next time,

828
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,140
next time you can invite your cousin over.

829
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,480
That's what it is.
That's what it is.

830
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,840
This year's Thanksgiving
is going to stink,

831
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,110
but the neuros of them won't because
your cousin can't come the next day.

832
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,980
Yeah. Just, I mean, just
ignore that woman for now.

833
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:10,770
Even if she doesn't help or
whatever, it's, you know what,

834
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:14,790
I've got to have fun with it. Yeah. And
you can also say, Oh hey, I'm, you know,

835
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,400
whatever her name is. Susan,
do you mind, you know,

836
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:19,980
gathering a couple of those plays
for us and you know, just kinda like,

837
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:22,830
just throw that in there.
But if she's continuing to be that way,

838
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,730
I'm sorry about your cousins can't come
to your thanksgiving anymore because

839
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:30,280
she's to be a part of the package.
And if they bring it up, just say,

840
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:31,900
you know what,
to be honest,

841
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,250
our mom does really get along with her
and we feel like it gets uncomfortable

842
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,430
and you know,

843
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,180
maybe they can come by for pie at the end
of the night or something and they can

844
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,260
just bring it out to the car and
just hand it to you as they're,

845
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,080
as they're driving by as a driving mode
just to stick your hand out the window

846
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:48,970
and I'll just have it on the,
I'll have it on a plate.

847
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,790
You know, we used to do it when there
was somebody like that around. We would,

848
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:56,230
they will be some sort of inside joke
that whenever the person was behaving the

849
00:50:56,231 --> 00:50:59,200
way that we hated it was the
inside joke with the other people.

850
00:50:59,201 --> 00:51:02,010
You would just like sing a song,
you don't make a deal with,

851
00:51:02,011 --> 00:51:05,590
clean up the dishes and she doesn't do
it and then you just walk away and you

852
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:10,000
just sing like Jess was gay.
We tried and it just becomes,

853
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:11,350
and it actually makes it fun,

854
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:16,730
but I really think you should just do
the thing where you ask her to help out,

855
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,130
Hey, do you mind grabbing the
plates and sending them out?

856
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:22,770
It was so good at that too. I do do that
really well. I'm really good at like, Oh,

857
00:51:22,771 --> 00:51:24,600
do you mind just grabbing
this for me really quickly?

858
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:29,340
It's all laced with do you might not
be in such a selfish Douche. Exactly.

859
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,320
Like it's, you know, it's,

860
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:35,321
it's customary when you're invited
to somebody's place over to dinner,

861
00:51:36,031 --> 00:51:38,550
anything, can I help you with
the dishes? Do you need anything?

862
00:51:38,551 --> 00:51:41,790
Like that's a custom, even if
the person is like, no, no,
no, no. I got it. I got it.

863
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:44,070
I got it. It's, it's customary.

864
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:49,250
It's an etiquette thing to at least ask
if you can help out or bring wine or

865
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:51,300
something like that.

866
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,650
Yeah. And here's a,
here's a major red flag.

867
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,850
If you're that fucking old and you
have nowhere to go for thanksgiving,

868
00:51:57,851 --> 00:52:01,480
and it wasn't some boating accident,
but all your family was on,

869
00:52:01,481 --> 00:52:03,610
like how do you not have anywhere to go?

870
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,990
Nobody wants to spend Thanksgiving
with you. Pick up up dirty plate,

871
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,810
you selfish whore.

872
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,251
Well,

873
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:15,251
the thing is like the cousin and the
wave and the cousin's mother in law,

874
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,900
and they can do their own
thing separately. I mean,
maybe not. Maybe it's a war.

875
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:25,280
It's all about the big family gathering,
but I think that's what I think.

876
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:26,480
You just got to grin and bear it.

877
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:29,510
I think you should definitely
gently suggest to her, hey,

878
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:31,880
do you mind grabbing this?
And just little stuff.

879
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:36,860
Not Crazy because then she'll be on to
you and I'll be like a real big blowout

880
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:41,620
and you don't want that,
but just subtly Turkey Douche Kimani

881
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,640
but next year, yeah, he's
just Canavan. You know what?

882
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,400
We're actually going to do a really
small things giving this year.

883
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:52,940
It's just gonna be me and the wife
and my mom like we're no assholes.

884
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:56,540
We're just doing a small this year.
You have to be very gentle about it,

885
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,890
but that's how you get around it.

886
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,560
Cause that you just don't
invite the people that are
attached to the people that

887
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:03,380
you don't like, which sucks.
But that's how it goes.

888
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,860
Here's the other thing
to watch, watch, watch,

889
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:09,400
watch your alcohol intake because you're,

890
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:12,520
the truth might be coming out later on.

891
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:16,180
You might say something and the alcohol
will start going like, I'll say it.

892
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,890
Say Fuck it. She wants the day. It's
your Thanksgiving too. All right,

893
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,420
I will do that. Okay. Who
do I make this sound too?

894
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,090
Uh, can we shout out Justin? Absolutely.

895
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:33,590
Shout out to Justin Long and
his brother Christian Long. Um,

896
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,590
they listen to the podcasts
and they're awesome. Justin,

897
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,830
you know what I found out the
next day after we met each other.

898
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,320
You and I have the exact same birthday,

899
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:47,150
the exact same birthday day,
year.

900
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:52,150
How crazy is that? It why was just in
there? He was there because he does it.

901
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,240
[inaudible] her family coming to
Netflix on December 18th. Yeah,

902
00:53:56,241 --> 00:54:00,480
they go and he's been so great,
man. He tweeted out, uh, you know,

903
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,730
he was tweeting the hell out of the,
uh, the teaser and all that. And uh, he,

904
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:08,600
he does the voice of Kevin and he is
fucking hilarious and it's was one of my

905
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:12,560
favorite characters to write for once I
saw what Justin was going to do with it.

906
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:16,790
So, uh, we had a lot of fun hanging
with them. One Nia, thank you so much.

907
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:20,020
The lovely me. Everybody. Yeah.

908
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,710
Coming on the podcast supports to
support you at the Madison Square Garden.

909
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,570
You were incredible. You are
amazing. You are in the zone.

910
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,200
I was very proud of you. Thank you. Thank
you. I know, but I'm telling you, I'm you,

911
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,450
I'm uploading this and I'm taking a
shower and then I'll put on my pajamas.

912
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:41,290
So that's it. That's it. It's all
all right. One more question here.

913
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:46,480
One more question. I've got
to get through here all yet.

914
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:50,920
Get cleo some food. All
right. Gay Rumors Day,

915
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,240
Billy twinkle toes.
Uh,

916
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,940
my friends and I are freshmen
in college at different schools.

917
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,500
Recently he hooked up with this girl,
with this lady.

918
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:08,170
It was after the party had died
and everyone, uh, was cleared out.

919
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,700
She crawled into his bed,
Jesus Christ and started jacking him off.

920
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:16,090
And that's how it happened.
So what happened?

921
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,490
He had a hand,
baby

922
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,930
kind of open ended.

923
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,340
I was visiting that weekend and
I watched her walk into his room.

924
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,430
The rest I heard second hand from him,
no pun intended.

925
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,720
The next day she started talking
like they were in a relationship. Um,

926
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,340
he explained that he wasn't into being
in a relationship aside from the fact

927
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:47,200
that she's a slob. He wasn't into
the idea anyways with any girl.

928
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,420
Um,

929
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,380
she responded by telling a group of
people that he asked her to be his

930
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:58,000
girlfriend to cover that he was
gay and that he needed to meet,

931
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:01,780
needed her to meet his parents. Can
you blow? She just made that up.

932
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:05,860
Can you believe this chick? That's
sociopathic behavior. It's slander.

933
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:10,960
My question obviously is what should
he do? He's not a feeble soul.

934
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:15,280
He's actually really quick witted and
if he really wanted to, he could air,

935
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,050
he could clear the air publicly.

936
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:22,300
It's one of those situations where if
he lets it all fade away, it could,

937
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,470
it could end clean on the other hand,
fuck that.

938
00:56:25,471 --> 00:56:28,140
She shouldn't get off that easily.
Uh,

939
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:31,860
she could do it again and the next guy
could respond with violence is suicide

940
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:33,450
Assam Shit.
What's the move here?

941
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,200
You know what the move here is to
fucking watch that crazy train.

942
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,060
Just go down the street and
disappear over the hell. Fuck her.

943
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,090
That's fucking hilarious. It's hilarious
that she said that. That she's, you know,

944
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,920
she's a maniac.
Why would you do that?

945
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,693
You know what I mean?

946
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,520
It gives a shit. How easy to
play are you gay? Well, I mean,

947
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:58,330
I am a sharp dresser. You can, you
got to give me that. Who knows?

948
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,930
Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. I don't know.

949
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:03,890
Okay.

950
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,581
Hey ladies,

951
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:09,470
you want to see if he can ungay me like
they do with the fucking weird churches

952
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,620
where they try to cure your being gay.
I would just have fun with it.

953
00:57:12,621 --> 00:57:13,610
Who gives a fuck?

954
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:14,930
Okay.

955
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:18,700
Honestly, who gives a shit some
swabs? Is that you're gay? All right.

956
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,440
Well,
I'm not,

957
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,570
and I can prove it.
Show me a text ladies.

958
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,170
Oh, look at all Frederick
standing up at attention.

959
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:37,120
Yeah. This is, this is like
childish. Who gives a shit?

960
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,560
Who gives a shit what people think.

961
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,393
MMM.

962
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,570
Yeah. I mean, that's, so
that's why it's a joke.

963
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:46,910
She's going to do it to
somebody else. Yeah. Okay.

964
00:57:46,911 --> 00:57:50,150
And then why did she keeps going
around? Oh, that guy doesn't like me.

965
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,130
He doesn't like because he's gay.

966
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:53,743
MMM.

967
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,060
I Dunno.
Maybe she's a,

968
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:58,960
yeah,

969
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,320
maybe she that much of an ego maniac
that she's thinks the only way that you

970
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:05,980
could not 100% be endure
is because that you,

971
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,990
you liked men because evidently she's
just the most amazing fucking woman of all

972
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:14,980
time. Uh, yeah. When people
walk around and they say shit
like that to you, I mean,

973
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:17,650
if you have like a business and somebody
is trying to say like, yeah, Hey,

974
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:21,460
I got food poisoning there. I mean, you
got to put a stop to that. But you know,

975
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:26,160
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Like you,

976
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:30,680
you haven't hooked up with
a woman dated a woman,

977
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,763
you know,

978
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,330
unless you've had a woman go around and
just make up shit about you and say a

979
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:39,930
bunch of fucking yeah, stuff to try
and hurt you. That's what they do.

980
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,660
She wants to beat the shit out of him,
but she can't.

981
00:58:42,661 --> 00:58:46,410
So she's doing what women do is they,
you know,

982
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:47,560
okay.

983
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,170
They just go around saying
shit about each other.

984
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:54,310
That's what they do at know this
woman is acting completely normally.

985
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,250
This is what completely
normally completely normal.

986
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:01,930
This is normal chick psycho
fucking behavior. Um,

987
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,690
I think it's fucking
hilarious and uh, oh yeah,

988
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:11,260
we'll just let it go. Yeah. Don't, don't
even, we can't let her get away with this.

989
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:15,340
You can't go vengeance, vengeance
never. That never ends. Well,

990
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:19,840
it never ends well because then
they're going to come back and get that

991
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:24,520
vengeance on your vengeance and then
eventually the only way to end it is

992
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,170
somebody's got to kill somebody.
Right. That's basically what happens.

993
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,510
Is it,
I don't know if it is.

994
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:36,511
All I know is it's the end of the
podcast and I am on fucking vacation and,

995
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:38,194
um,

996
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,030
I want to thank everybody over all the
years is coming out to my standup shows.

997
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,460
Anybody ever heckled me?
Anybody over lapped,

998
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:50,380
anybody would just fucking showed
up, got a free fucking ticket. Um,

999
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,320
because all of those shows led to
the one that I had Saturday night.

1000
00:59:53,321 --> 00:59:56,550
What a fucking way to end.
I got one more gig that I am do.

1001
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:00,910
I am doing a New Year's eve
out here in, um, in, uh,

1002
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,640
in La, but it's not a road
gig. It's going to be great.

1003
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,140
It's gonna be the night
before the Rose Bowl.

1004
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,900
It's going to be the four
horsemen coming together again.

1005
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:13,620
I'm just going to be fucking
awesome. But, um, I dunno.

1006
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:17,130
I hope I was able to convey it.
I can't even tell you what, uh,

1007
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,330
I'll just fucking thrilled I was,
I still can't believe that it happened,

1008
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:25,230
but I know it happened because I was
totally present and I enjoyed the whole

1009
01:00:25,231 --> 01:00:28,140
thing and the, you know, it was
great. The light was so in my eyes,

1010
01:00:28,141 --> 01:00:32,100
I couldn't see how big it was.
I couldn't see everybody,

1011
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:36,810
but I could look up and see the
lights up at the top. And, uh,

1012
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:41,260
one of the coolest things ever.
My comedy career,

1013
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:45,340
at one point I was doing this Illuminati
act out like they were all sitting at a

1014
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:49,990
table talking about the
population problem. And I
actually sat down on the stool

1015
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:51,670
okay.

1016
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,700
And I was doing this creepy
fucking thing about them,

1017
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,650
thinking about how they
could get rid of people.

1018
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,650
And I was able to bring the
whole fucking room down.

1019
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:03,250
Like I was in a fucking comedy club.
And as I was doing it,

1020
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,950
I was actually thinking like,
how fucking sick is this right now?

1021
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,830
It's like 12,000 people listening to me.

1022
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:13,090
I'm sitting down on a stool imitating
some lunatic in the Illuminati.

1023
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,770
How fucking fun is that? It
was, it's was indescribable.

1024
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,540
And anyways, please tell everybody,
you know, a lot F is for family.

1025
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:27,310
Um, I would really appreciate it.
Um, although after Saturday night,

1026
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,660
nobody owes me anything. But if you'd
like to, I would appreciate it because a,

1027
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:34,530
I think it's going to be a great show.
Um,

1028
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:39,730
a great TV series for many years to come
with any luck. All right. That's it.

1029
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:41,530
So I'm thankful early this year,
