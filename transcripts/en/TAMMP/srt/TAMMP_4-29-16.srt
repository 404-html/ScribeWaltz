1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:09,810
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast and just checking in on you.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,240
I'm just checking in on you.
Um,

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,230
I have no life. I don't know what to
talk about. I got no fucking life, man.

5
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,960
We're just right in this God damn show,
having a great time doing it, of course.

6
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:22,471
But,
uh,

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,610
I just stay in a writer's room and I stare
at a computer screen all day long and,

8
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,600
uh, my eyes were killing me yesterday. Uh,

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,070
I started looking around
the room and I noticed,

10
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,710
I think I'm the only one in the
room that doesn't wear glasses.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,640
That's like a, that's like earning
your stripes as a writer, as you are.

12
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,620
You actually, you wear glasses that, and
you can do that thing where you, you know,

13
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,860
you spend the fucking pen around your
finger and you can catch it. You know,

14
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:54,090
those, you know, friend of mine always
said mathletes could always do that,

15
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,210
you know, but, um, anyways,

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm going to do some standup
this weekend. Uh, we just, uh,

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,360
we just did the table
read for episode two. Uh,

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,990
Dave Kepner came in and just crushed it
as Bob Pogo is fucking awesome. And, uh,

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,550
you know, that's probably my most
favorite thing about the week, uh,

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,180
is doing the table reads because it's,

21
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:19,950
it feels like doing stand up in front
of a la live like crowd for those of you

22
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,770
not in the business.
It's basically after you write the thing,

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,100
you sit down and before you record it,
you basically,

24
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,090
you do it in front of a bunch of
people, um, who've invested in the show.

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,290
So they're hoping it's funny, but if it
isn't funny, they're not going to laugh.

26
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,500
So if they, if you get them laughing,
if you get industry industry,

27
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,150
people laugh and that's
always a big thing.

28
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,900
So we had a great table read
some very excited about that. Um,

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,490
and um, anyways, but that's not what
I want to talk about here today.

30
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:52,320
I got to tell you something I found the
other day, uh, when I was on youtube. Um,

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,830
any wrestling fans out there?
Ah,

32
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,730

Tony, Gloria and Larry's at Bisco.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Ivan put ski and Bulldog Brower and Pat
Patterson and Ted dibiase the Internet

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,480
intercontinental champion.

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,060
Mr Fuji, Mr [inaudible], the moon dogs.

36
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,690
Okay.

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,140
George the animal Steele superstar.
Billy Graham.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,040
Bob Backlund,
Bruno Sammartino.

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,310
Greg to Hammer Valentine.

40
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:30,870
I can't remember how many these fucking
guys are still remember Tony Atlas?

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,220
Okay.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,280
Jimmy superfly snuck up.
I still remember that finishing moves.

43
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:39,170
Tony Atlas would just fucking
basically do a military press with you.

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,300
He just pick you up over his head
and he fucking throw you right Andre.

45
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,420
The giant would just put his
giant fucking size 48 foot.

46
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,080
You throw you off the ropes and just stick
it right in your face and he'd sit on

47
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:55,230
ya. I've been put ski,
had the Polish Hammer.

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,710
Greg Valentine had to
figure four leg lock.

49
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,460
That's the first time
ever throw out my back.

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,500
This kid when I was in fourth grade,

51
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:05,770
showed me how to do the figure four leg
lock by putting me into it and it was

52
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:10,240
fucking killing my knee and I was
trying to get up to, to get my free,

53
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,670
my leg from putting
pressure on my kneecap.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,750
And as the first time I fucked up my
lower back that have bad backs since the

55
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,010
lower, since the, uh, bad, lower
back since the, uh, the fourth grade.

56
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,663
MMM.

57
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,510
Chief Jay Strongbow would
do the fucking rain dance.

58
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,740
That wasn't too fucking racist was it?
Once he did that,

59
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,210
he went into this crazy fucking,

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,640
he couldn't feel pain anymore and then
he kicked the shit out of you. Uh,

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,780
all right.
Enough of that shit.

62
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,450
So I was just looking at some
of the old restaurants, um,

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,980
stuff that I used to watch, SD
Jones, special delivery Jones,

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,370
the guy never fucking one.
He was the most coolest fucking guy ever.

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,013
MMM.

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,810
Anyways, Mr Wonderful, Rowdy Roddy Piper.

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,720
I fucking love all those
guys. So anyways, um, I was,

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,910
I never heard of this before,
but you have it.

69
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,950
Those of you who aren't fans of wrestling,

70
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:09,900
and there's this thing called a
shoot match, which is basically,

71
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,210
you know, wrestling, it's
sports entertainment.

72
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,490
When I was a kid they used
to argue that it was real.

73
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,500
And then finally they said no it's fake.
But,

74
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,290
but what was great was
once they said it was fake,

75
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:23,070
they could actually talk about all
the real pain that they go through.

76
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,360
So I was kind of just
watching some youtube videos
about that and I came across

77
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:30,360
this stuff called his shoot match.
So I was like,

78
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:34,830
what the hell is this shoot match in
a shoot match is basically a wrestling

79
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:39,210
match where they're fake fighting and
then somebody gets pissed at somebody else

80
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,370
and it becomes a real fight.

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,810
And what usually happens from the few
that I saw is if the person's just not a

82
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,270
complete roid roided up psycho.

83
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,193
MMM.

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,140
What it really is is either
somebody is not selling your moves,

85
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:01,080
like I'm fake punching you and you're
just acting like it's not hurting.

86
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:06,020
So you making me look like an asshole
or somebody, you know, you are,

87
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:09,900
you're allowing somebody to throw you
and do a move and they botch it and fuck,

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,340
fuck you up in hurt you
and then you get mad. Um,

89
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,140
I saw one with this guy.

90
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:20,580
This kid was new when he went to
to execute some fucking throw,

91
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:21,870
and this guy was just a psycho.

92
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:25,230
He didn't look like he landed that bad
and he got up and just beat the fuck out

93
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:28,620
of this guy.
Just threw him head first out of the ring.

94
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,880
The guy landed on his fucking head
and we immediately had a concussion.

95
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,320
Then he picked the guy up and threw him
into the metal stairs and this guy kept

96
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,110
selling. I guess he didn't have
to sell the moves at that point,

97
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:43,930
but that one was fucking brutal. But
the funniest one. But she got to see,

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,640
and I'm having a link to it. It's
the great Antonio verse, Antonio.

99
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,880
I hope I say it right. So he doesn't
come over and slapped the shit out of me.

100
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,910
I knocky.
I'm a Japanese guy.

101
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:57,090
So the Great Antonio is this,

102
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,900
I can't even describe what he looks like.

103
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,901
He looks like a fucking troll with a page
boy haircut and he's just ridiculously

104
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:11,681
fat and he's wearing the ugliest mustard
colored yellow light sweat pants with

105
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,600
these military boots on.

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,710
I'm just not a good looking person.

107
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,200
And he's a wrestling,
this guy, Antonio Anakie,

108
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,090
who's a Japanese guy who looks like
a fucking movie star, you know,

109
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,200
he's got the old school movie star Chin,

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,830
he's got the Jack Lord Hawaii
five o fucking haircut.

111
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,360
He's in great shape.

112
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,570
So they start fucking wrestling
and a Raslan and you know,

113
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,560
the Japanese guy is,

114
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:46,910
is being a fucking professional and
the Great Antonio who I guess had a

115
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,450
reputation for not selling people's
moves and being selfish in the ring,

116
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,793
you know,

117
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,310
the Japanese guy would punch him in his
fat stomach and he wouldn't even move.

118
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:58,370
And then the f the fat that it would
keep like punching his stomach like it's

119
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:02,570
hard as a rock. And people were
laughing in the crowd. The fucking guy,

120
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,890
like the Japanese guy throws him off the
fucking ropes and the guy just sort of

121
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:10,280
stops, you know and doesn't
sell the fucking move.

122
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,520
And the Japanese guys looking at him like
what the fuck? And the crowds laughing.

123
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,240
He starts seeing the Japanese dude
looking at him like, dude, what the fuck?

124
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,740
It's a long story short,
they get a few minutes into the round,

125
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,390
the Japanese guy has been
selling everything the fat
fuck's doing the fat fucks

126
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,100
making the Japanese
guy look like an idiot.

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,650
So fat fuck gets the Japanese guy against
the ropes and he's punching almost

128
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:37,220
like the back of this guy's neck.
Super fucking hard.

129
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,850
And the guy takes like three of them
before he finally like blocks the fourth

130
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,750
one and then he just snaps like,
dude, what? Like fuck this.

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,110
And he just stands up and just open hands,

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,010
slap this fat fuck in the head
is hard as you possibly can.

133
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,500
And the Fed pageboy guy like turns
his head, it's fucking phenomenal.

134
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,680
And the Japanese guys going like
go making those like come on,

135
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,610
let's fucking fight.

136
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,180
And the Fed fuck still kind of like
thinking he's just going to take one.

137
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:08,900
He slaps him in the fucking head again,
then grabs his leg,

138
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,930
Japanese do just snaps,
fucking throws him on his belly,

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,790
boats them in the fucking head right now
the ref is going like, whoa, whoa, hey,

140
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,540
whoa.
The fat fucks crawling around like a dog.

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,450
And the Japanese guy boots
him in the head again.

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,980
Now the fat guy is like fucking plank and
he's laying down on the ground and the

143
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,060
Japanese guy boots him in the head
like another fucking six times.

144
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,110
It's almost attempted murder.
The fucking dude is a bloody mess.

145
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:38,500
They finally just called a match and um,

146
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,170
it was one of the great
pieces of justice I ever saw.

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,550
I didn't feel bad for the guy at all
when he was getting voted in the head.

148
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:50,310
I was dying laughing.
If you saw how hard this does,

149
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:54,620
fat fuck was punching this poor Japanese
guy in the back of his neck and he,

150
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:58,380
that guy taking it like a
pro and finished. Finally,
he was just like, what the,

151
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,600
cause it was all, he was like,
he was hitting him for real. Um,

152
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,220
and he wasn't selling his moves.
So you got, I'm, I'm going to, um,

153
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,700
have a link for it. If anybody else
has some good ones up there. I,

154
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,780
it's just a whole new part of Youtube
that, uh, you know, if you're at work,

155
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,660
if you're bored right now, just
look it up yourself. Shoot matches.

156
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:19,110
S h o o t matches and uh,

157
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,680
there's just some legendary ones and um,
you know,

158
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,650
as much as they talked to wrestlers and
stuff, like I don't, I never hear him,

159
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,590
you know, I always hear, you know,
about doing the road and these,

160
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,460
these great matches that they had. And
then of course they talk about, you know,

161
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,280
you know, people get in
the sickness, you know,

162
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,860
getting addicted to painkillers
and drugs and all that shit.

163
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,350
They do all that type of shit. But, um,

164
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,570
nobody talks about all these fucking
wrestling matches out there that, uh,

165
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,570
suddenly, um, that's suddenly became real,

166
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:53,130
you know, so, um, I dunno. I hope
you enjoy it. That's all I could say.

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,180
But anyway, so let's get back to,
uh, let's get back to the podcast.

168
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,260
So basically everything that I'm going
to be talking about over the next couple

169
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,290
of months,

170
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,320
it's going to be whatever I look out
the window and see while we're writing

171
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,220
emphasis for family.

172
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,700
So anyways, um, yeah,

173
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,370
the day we're in the writer's room
actually yesterday and all of a sudden we

174
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,650
just hear like this fucking commotion,
right?

175
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,160
And we look out our windows in,

176
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:25,161
there's all these protesters just
walking down the fucking taking up like a

177
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,040
street, you a lane of the
street, like, uh, you know,

178
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,790
like bike riders do now. You know what
I mean? When they ride down the street,

179
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,940
if there's two of them rather
than riding single file,

180
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:38,670
they ride side by side because
they want to talk and you know,

181
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,760
fuck the 50 cars that are behind
him. Oh. And then by the way,

182
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:46,470
if they actually get hit, it's this major
fucking tragedy. Like, oh my God can,

183
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,900
can you fucking believe that happened?
Yes,

184
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,720
I can totally believe
that happened completely.

185
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,980
A bicycle is simply a
motorcycle without an engine.

186
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,390
That's what you're riding around on it.

187
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,140
But I know you dressed up like you're
in the Tour de France, you know,

188
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,200
you feel in a little European
like that dude and breaking away.

189
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,740
Maybe you're speaking in Italian and
you kind of forget that you're riding a

190
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:12,741
bicycle out in the street in Los Angeles
home to arguably some of the worst

191
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,280
drivers on the planet.
All right?

192
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,550
And I've always gone off on technology
and Shit and saying, I don't like it.

193
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:24,480
Saying like we had enough technology
somewhere around the early nineties we

194
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,690
should have stopped right about there.
You let people die off.

195
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,590
Stop trying to cure fucking diseases.
Stop.

196
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,450
Make a new technology that
everybody has to go out and go buy.

197
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,350
Let's just stop right
fucking here. Okay. I mean,

198
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,110
take you remember the early nineties
it was fucking great. It was fine.

199
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,060
Cars for fast enough.
Everything was fine.

200
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,700
He didn't have to go
any further than that.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,120
Wasn't it better when everybody wasn't
on the fucking Internet? I think it was.

202
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,130
Even though I'm sitting here
on the Internet right now,

203
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:54,150
I'd be willing to walk away from
this shit. It's a great time.

204
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,720
Everything you did wasn't filmed.
It wasn't fucking recorded.

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,970
There wasn't some satellite point in that.

206
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:02,790
You're tracking you down the street
as you try to get to a dairy queen,

207
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,820
but also the Illuminati can fucking take
you out cause they probably own that

208
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:07,290
satellite,
you know,

209
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,850
turn on some chip in your car and make
it drive into a fucking tree. You know,

210
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,220
make white people. These are very
mainstream stories here. Um, anyways,

211
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,710
um,
these fucking proud.

212
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:22,800
They must have had a permit because it
was a cop in front of them in behind them

213
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,970
and they're just walking down the
street and I got to tell you something.

214
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,690
All right, I'm all for the working
man. I'm all for that type of shit.

215
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,800
But the second you go out in the fucking
street and you start blocking traffic,

216
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,980
I don't give a shit. If you trying to
save babies, I hate you and I want to,

217
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:42,570
I want to rent a cement truck and run you
over. Like I was sitting in an office.

218
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,800
They weren't causing me any trouble
and just the empathy that I had for the

219
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:51,690
people trying to drive around them made
me want somebody to just fish tail into

220
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:55,910
the fucking crowd.
So if you've ever been in a protest,

221
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,150
let me ask you this question.

222
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,933
Is it

223
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,300
the objective to not only call attention
to whatever it is you're complaining

224
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,230
about,
but then don't you want people to

225
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,433
listen

226
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,560
and then be like, Oh wow, I
didn't know that was going on.

227
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,853
You know,

228
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,870
so why would you annoy the shit out of
everybody by like clogging up traffic?

229
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,210
To me,
it's no different than fucking terrorists.

230
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,270
A lot of times whatever terrorist are
bitching about, I'm like, yeah, I could.

231
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,220
I totally understand why
you're upset about that,

232
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,420
but the then go and blow up a bunch of
innocent people. I'm just like, yeah,

233
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:41,470
but that's not the way you solve it.
Right.

234
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,610
My office simplifying this. It's like we
don't fly over there and drop bombs it,

235
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,210
oops. Did that land on your baby? Yeah,
we were trying to get the bad guy. Sorry.

236
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,550
Your baby was within a 30
mile radius. I Dunno. Um,

237
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,830
anyways, do you guys have that?
Do you have, do you have like,

238
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,150
like I actually enjoy riding a bike,
but, uh, I'm an old school bike rider.

239
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,860
Like I ride up on the sidewalk. I
don't wear a helmet. Um, you know,

240
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:09,610
I don't ride 90 miles an hour down the
sidewalk and I don't care when people who

241
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:12,580
walk on the sidewalk give me a
fucking dirty look. It's just like,

242
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm not going out there.

243
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,270
I'm not going out there and traffic
because I know everybody out there is like

244
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,630
me and they're texting while they're
driving or they're fucking air drumming.

245
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,320
You know, God knows how many people
are out there on prescription pills.

246
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,470
To go out there on a fucking
motorcycle without an engine is,

247
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,010
is really fucking stupid.

248
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,810
Okay.

249
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,280
Yeah. And um, I feel like this
thing was like bike riders.

250
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:44,080
They have this thing where they feel
like they're these victims and uh, I,

251
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,780
I find them way,
way more hostile.

252
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,420
Okay.

253
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,320
Considering the position that they're
in and they had this whole fucking,

254
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:54,800
you will respect me and I have just
as much as of right to be out here.

255
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:58,190
What should do you do? I mean,
even though there is no bike lane,

256
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:58,880
they just painted,

257
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,780
painted a bicycle on the fucking street
so they could get the federal grant.

258
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,130
That's the reason why they do that
shit. Right. And then, uh, you know,

259
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,380
all right,
so you have a right to be out there,

260
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:13,190
but then you have to obey the rules
of the road. And 99% a year, don't,

261
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,090
when's the last time you saw a guy in a
bicycle actually stop at a fucking red

262
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:21,740
light? They never do. They never
do. They fucking look both ways.

263
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:25,100
They fucking glide right through the
fucking thing. And then if they get hit,

264
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:28,370
then they frost the bicycle. Like,
oh, can you believe that happened?

265
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,050
What a poor baby. Um, I dunno.

266
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,710
I have to tell you the people who ride
bicycles out here and in Los Angeles or

267
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:40,370
ride their fucking minds and I am so
anti those fucking cars that are going to

268
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:43,070
drive themselves.
Um,

269
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,410
until I go on the highways out here in
Los Angeles, I'm just like, you know what?

270
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:50,840
I really think it should be. I think
if you, if you suck at driving,

271
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,190
they should just take your right to
drive away. You can still have a car,

272
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:59,600
but the car will drive for you because
you suck at it. You know what I mean?

273
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,460
But I think if you're
actually a decent driver,

274
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,730
you should then be allowed
to continue driving.

275
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,530
So I think if you got rid of people
who suck the driving right off the bat,

276
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,700
conservatively speaking,
I'd say that's at least 30% of drivers,

277
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,550
you know? And then I think
that middle, you know,

278
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,600
30 the 35%,

279
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,750
we'll just have the option because
there's a lot of people that are actually

280
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,100
decent and driving. But
if they're like, dude,

281
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:30,101
if I could just fucking take a nap and
just sleep on the way to work for 45

282
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:35,230
minutes and just wake up when I there, I
would rather do that. So you figure it,

283
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,260
at least half of them are going to do
it initially and then a half of those

284
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,390
halfs are going to be like,

285
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,550
well he has a self driving car. I I,
you know, grass is always greener.

286
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:47,510
I want one of those two.

287
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:50,840
And then I think you'll just basically
get down to 18% of people that she truly

288
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:55,710
enjoyed driving and we'll get
our own lane book. This is my,

289
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,520
my drink, we get our own lane, we
get to drive as fast as we want.

290
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,450
And you guys had just all in robot cars,
you know,

291
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,150
and then everybody who actually
still continues to drive,

292
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,660
those are the people that, you know, when
they're the first guy to make a left,

293
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,460
they get way out to the intersection.

294
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,970
They feel a sense of responsibility that
two cars behind them, we'll make it.

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
Those types of people. You
know, those people that,

296
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,000
that realized the further left you go,
the faster you go.

297
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,270
And if somebody is on your bumper, you
don't slam on the brakes, she get over,

298
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,360
that person's, obviously I'm in
more of a here a hurry than you are.

299
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,940
You fucking let them go. Those were,
that's probably 18% of drivers.

300
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,970
Wouldn't you say you like how I just
paid it myself as the fucking heroin,

301
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,530
all that. Oh yeah. I'm one of the guys.

302
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm one of the guys that knows how
to do the things correctly. Um,

303
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,380
anyways, I hope this hasn't been too
quiet. Let's plow ahead here. Um,

304
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,100
I am over. Oh, by the way, I'm
over the whole fucking Tom Brady.

305
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,300
I actually have a buddy of
mine that works in the, uh,

306
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,390
I can't say where he works, but just he
basically broke it down and say, listen,

307
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,030
this is not a personal
thing against the Patriots.

308
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:03,720
What it is is this is a corporation
thing versus the employees.

309
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:07,320
And if the corporation says this is
what's going to happen in the employee is

310
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,610
able to go around that,

311
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,790
then they get then that you got
the nuts running in the nuthouse.

312
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,900
So basically Tom Brady was
acquitted of any sort of cheating,

313
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,350
but this second trial,
yes, he was look it up.

314
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,940
This second trial was, or at very
least he was never convicted of that.

315
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,520
Um,
this second trial was,

316
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:31,521
was more about does a corporation have
a right to discipline its employees?

317
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,320
So you know what happened to Tom
Brady outside in the real world,

318
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,920
in the United States of America,
it wouldn't even have made it to trial.

319
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,160
All right, but with the lack of
fucking evidence that yeah, they had,

320
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,260
okay. The, on the other side, um,

321
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,160
you have within a corporation,

322
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:59,520
a corporation operates the
way a corporation operates.

323
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,360
So they should be allowed to run there.
But that's what it was about.

324
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,760
Are we as a corporation allowed
to discipline our employees?

325
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,340
Are they able to go
outside the corporation?

326
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,020
Are we going to have to
fucking deal with that?

327
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,200
And it was a big deal for the suits in
the NFL to win that because if Tom Brady

328
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:19,710
wins that thing,

329
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,860
then every fucking suspension a player
could simply take it outside of the NFL

330
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,790
and it really, um, whittles down
the level of power that they have.

331
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,230
So I got to actually be honest with you,

332
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,400
I actually understand now I
understand why the NFL did that.

333
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,200
And you know, if they got to throw Tom
Brady under the fucking bus than so be it.

334
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:43,980
Now I know a lot of you guys out there
think I'm skirting the fucking issue as

335
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,490
far as like, oh, he deflated. I'm not
saying it didn't deflate the fucking ball,

336
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,630
but that's not why the colts lost
by 35 fucking points. I said,

337
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,820
this is Zillion fucking times.
You know,

338
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:55,630
Andrew Luck shouldn't
even be on the colts.

339
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,270
The colts actually tried the season
before he was available in the draft,

340
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:03,630
but they tanked the whole
fucking season. And um, I dunno,

341
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,380
just the amount of attention that
Tom Brady gets versus, you know,

342
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,400
you know,

343
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,560
have an HGH delivered to your
fucking house in your wife's name.

344
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:16,410
And then you sit there in front of the
Superbowl media for two weeks and it's

345
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,400
not even brought up.

346
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,230
And then you quote Forrest Gump and
ride off into the sunset and then

347
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:26,080
everybody's cool with it. Um,
whatever, that's all I would have.

348
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,390
What the fuck are you gonna do?
So anyways, plowing ahead here.

349
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,690
Plowing ahead. Um, let me do it.

350
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,130
Read a little bit of advertising here
and then I'm going to get the fuck out of

351
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:39,690
here and go stare at a computer
screen. All God Damn Day. Um, on it.

352
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:44,240
Everybody. Joe Rogan's,
great company here, a Alpha
brain instant from on. It is,

353
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:48,520

free drink mix that helps support memory,

354
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,350
focus and processing speed.

355
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,340
The Boston Center for memory conducted
a double blind studies showing its

356
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:57,840
effectiveness. I don't know what a double
blind study is, but that sounds, uh,

357
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,570
that sounds like all checks
and balances Cleo. So Matt,

358
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,630
a buddy fucking itch and up a storm.
Um,

athletes like a Bodie, Miller,

360
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,420
Brian Cushing,
and Jonathan Tabes.

361
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,630
But anyone can benefit from the
effects of Alpha brain instant,

362
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,020
simply mixed a stick packet of Alpha brain

feeling the effects immediately.

but it was instantly also depressing
not to see Chicago when it, because uh,

429
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,440
then need, you don't get
to watch, you know, all the
great players that they have,

430
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,860
tapes, cane, Dunkin keys
and all those guys. Um,

431
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,060
it's weird to see the Black Hawks and
the kings out in the first round and look

432
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:18,800
who's coming up on the outside.

433
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,150
Now this French sake of San Jose sharks,
the fucking,

434
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,700
I mean their logo should literally be
somebody choking on a piece of fucking

435
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:32,720
steak. You know, I don't know why
steak but just choking on something.

436
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't think you could find a team that's
won more hockey games and left in the

437
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:41,300
first round or just not want a cup.

438
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
I don't know what it is
about the San Jose sharks.

439
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:49,580
I just don't have any sympathy for them
or their fucking fence. I don't know why.

440
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,590
I think it has to do with that teal
color that they have. You know,

441
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:59,510
maybe it's cause the kings got
rid of their, their fucking,
you know, royal colors,

442
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,040
the Laker colors that they had
and they took basically black,

443
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,810
white and gray because you know,

444
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:10,220
you'd think the sharks would
have like a gray looking uniform.

445
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:14,360
You think if you had, like, if he came
up with a killer name, like the sharks,

446
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,020
like that animal, that fish there
was just sitting there on the table.

447
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,500
Because you know, you know the
deal with sports teams, there's,

448
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,550
there's only so many ferocious fucking
animals to pick from. You know,

449
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,010
and then once that goes out the window,

450
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:32,690
then you kind of got to talk about
like the jobs people do. Like a,

451
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,980
with the packers.
Yeah.

452
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:37,640
Everybody pack stuff up here and where
the fucking these guys or those guys,

453
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:40,400
you know,
and then when you're really out of names,

454
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:44,820
that's when you start naming teams after
like weather, right? The higher change,

455
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,880
the heat, the thunder, right.

456
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,450
The mysteries, whatever the fuck you
come, flurries the Florida flurries,

457
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,550
that wouldn't make sense. It
doesn't snow down there. Um,

458
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,100
Florida Sun showers,
it's just really going to be bad.

459
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,640
That's why you can't go beyond 30 teams
and he's fucking leak, you know, or 32,

460
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:08,550
I guess that's where we're up to.
But sharks was just sitting there,

461
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,690
just sitting there on the
table. And I remember thinking
like, Oh wow, the shocks,

462
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:15,480
it's a great name. I can't wait to see
that uniform. And it was like, bump,

463
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:20,400
bump a bomb. Ooh, it's a shark. And he's
biting a hockey stick and half. Well,

464
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:24,210
yeah, then you're going to get a penalty
for, for slashing and today's Nhl,

465
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,450
right. Second, the stick
breaks automatically. Um,
I'm sorry. I don't know.

466
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,400
I don't know what it is. I just don't, uh,

467
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,640
this is where I have
sympathy for the shark fans.

468
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,820
I know what it's like to root for a
fucking team year in and year out and they

469
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:41,580
fucking blow it. I don't know what
it's like for the last 15 years.

470
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:44,410
All of a sudden my hell turned into a,

471
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,780
a fucking paradise because everybody
started fucking winning. But before then,

472
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,291
you know,

473
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:53,880
I was a red sox fan living in New York
City with all that curse of the Babe Shit

474
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:58,380
going on, you know, Boston sports,
we're in the fucking shitter.

475
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,750
Basically.
When I was growing up,

476
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:05,490
we had the Boston Celtics and then
up to 86 and then once Len bias died,

477
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,560
um, and then Reggie Lewis died. I
mean, the whole thing just, it just,

478
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:14,160
the wheels fell off for like
20 fucking years. But um,

479
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,510
fortunately nowadays you can go out and
buy a championship, which we did in 2007.

480
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,250
Um, anyways, so I'm just trying to
say congratulations to St Louis.

481
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,170
Now my two favorite teams out west,

482
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:29,430
the stars and the blues are
playing each other and um,

483
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,820
I think I'm going to stick with
the blues just cause I don't know,

484
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,580
I just worked St Louis,
I saw how excited they were and you know,

485
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,500
I like the stars because I used to like
the Minnesota north stars and I liked

486
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,210
the people on the stars,
but I'm not into their fans either.

487
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,780
You Know Dallas fans,
at the end of the fucking day,

488
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,640
you don't give a fuck about the stars.

489
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,680
There's only one star in Dallas and
that's the one on the side of the cowboys

490
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,550
helmet. You know, it's
fucking true yet out.

491
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:01,140
That's all you give a fuck about this
beautiful ladies coming out and they're

492
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,630
little hoary cherries.
Charlie's angel outfits.

493
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,760
That's what you give a fuck about that.
You give a fuck about that.

494
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:10,560
And your shiny four door pickup
truck that's never seen dirt, right?

495
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,490
Come in there with your
fake tid fucking botox,

496
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,800
Dolly Parton fucking hair check going
down the street looking like a couple of

497
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:23,400
televangelists. That's what you do
out there in Dallas in the big D.

498
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:26,960
Isn't that what you do? I know.
I'm just fucking with you. Um,

499
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,630
the one great thing though, I
do like, you know, something,

500
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:35,280
I can't say I'm totally anti
technology because uh, I do love Tivo,

501
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,910
but back in the day I also had a
VCR so I could've take games. Right?

502
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,670
I'm saying like the one
great thing that you,

503
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,580
thing that I have in the writer's
room as we're doing all the work no,

504
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,210
is the excitement was
right around five o'clock.

505
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,850
I know we only got a couple hours left
and that whatever game I want to watch is

506
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:58,360
currently being taping and that being
taped and I don't go on Twitter.

507
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,850
I don't look at my phone or anything
that I had just shut it off and uh,

508
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm able to come home and watch all
these fucking great series and uh,

509
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,050
it's just the best, you know,
actually retweeted those civic,

510
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,230
you guys see that thing on Twitter?
Not that dude becoming a hockey fan.

511
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,940
It's fucking black dude is hilarious.
Like he goes, you know what,

512
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,470
I'm going to give this hockey shit to try.

513
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,070
And he just starts live tweeting game
seven of the blues and the Black Caucus

514
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:29,320
and I guess he decided to root for the
blues and he was just tweeting this

515
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:31,690
hilarious shit.
Like what the fuck is a power play?

516
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,590
I don't know who this cane guy is,
but we got to stop this motherfucker.

517
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,180
And then towards the end
of the game he goes, what?

518
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:40,780
So like the goalie just leaves.

519
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,240
Then the best question he ever asked,
I've ever heard a hockey goes for real.

520
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,560
Why don't, why doesn't the whole other
team just stand in front of that net?

521
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,650
You know when you're up by one and the
just shooting like, why don't you do that?

522
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,650
That's fucking hilarious.
Um,

523
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,890
that's just someone who's never gotten
hit in the foot with the fucking puck.

524
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,310
It's like you really went up, I watched
somebody block a shot like I just,

525
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,180
the fucking balls that that takes
you do that and pick up hockey.

526
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,240
You're going to be limping for the rest
of the fucking week to watch these guys

527
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:14,530
blocking NHL shot. They're
out of their minds. But, um,

528
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,190
anyways, I'm up to 30 minutes here. I
got to kind of cut this thing short.

529
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:23,110
I know I usually do a little bit more
time than this, but I gotta I gotta go,

530
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:26,140
I gotta go to work. Oh,
Billy goes to work every day.

531
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,740
Eight a fucking salad every day at lunch.
That's what I do.

532
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,900
They like a big fucking pussy
every fucking day. Um, and
I'm actually doing okay.

533
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,450
And I tried to lose two pounds this week,
which I think I did,

534
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:41,310
but I had a Burrito last night,
so I only lost like a fucking pounds.

535
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:46,311
So next week I have to be down to one 76
going to buckle down over this weekend

536
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,830
and fucking workout and um,
get myself back down to about a buck 70.

537
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,420
Um, by the way, I think the
Celtics a playing tonight,

538
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,760
I think game six, that's obviously
a must win. We're winning at home,

539
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:03,880
but we're getting pounded.
We got fucking pounded that last game.

540
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,360
It's like a joke or is almost we almost
losing by fucking 30 but you know,

541
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:10,420
we're a young team. We'll see hopefully
next year with all our draft picks.

542
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:14,290
Maybe we'll get Kevin Durant or that
uni brow guy from fucking New Orleans.

543
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,220
Although I don't think either
one of those are good. You know,

544
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,870
as far as for the league,

545
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,260
I think to ranch should stay in Oklahoma
and I think uni brow guys should stay

546
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:27,590
in New Orleans. Doesn't that make sense?
My out of my fucking mind to think that,

547
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,220
that if you come in with the team,
Yada fucking,

548
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:33,070
unless that fucking you over like Shaq,
Shaq should have stayed with the magic,

549
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,700
you know, shouldn't it came out and
just piled on with the fucking Lakers?

550
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,433
Look what happened.

551
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,870
You went a couple of championships and
then he threw out his neck celebrating as

552
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:44,510
he went down. The Courtney
was never the same. All right,

553
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:47,390
let me do a couple more reads here and
then I gotta get Outta here. All right,

554
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,030
hallux. He likes h. E. L. I. X.

555
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,010
What is it about buying a mattress
that leaves you feeling violated? Well,

556
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:59,900
I dunno what the fuck happened to you
at the store? Jesus Christ. It violated.

557
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:03,140
That's a really strong word.
Especially when you have a mattress.

558
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:06,530
I was phased out.
I heard them unbuckle his pants.

559
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,860
Um, is it, is it the pushy sales people,

560
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,810
the fake president day sales or the fact
that you know you'll regret what you

561
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:19,700
bought as you do the walk of shame out of
the mattress store these days are over.

562
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:22,970
Thanks to helic sleep where
you can buy a mattress online,

563
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,210
customized for you for hundreds
of dollars instead of thousand,

564
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:28,010
go to [inaudible] dot

helic sleep.com/birth all right.

579
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,530
I said it both ways throughout the
whole thing. All right, tracker,

580
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,200
fucking train tracker, smartphones,
smack cast, Matt Holmes.

581
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,330
Technology has made everything smart,

582
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,940
but losing his stuff's still
makes people feel really stupid.

583
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:36,140
Tracker makes losing things. That thing
of the past tracker is a called tracker.

584
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,340
I they haven't said it enough.
Here.

585
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,110
Tracker is a coin size device that
locates misplaced keys, wallets, bags,

586
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:46,520
computers, anything in seconds. Just
pair of tracker to your smartphone,

587
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,420
attach it to anything and find his
precise location with the tap of a button.

588
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,640
It's that easy. Why don't I have
one of these fucking things?

589
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:55,370
I lose my phone all the time.
Lose your phone. There you go.

590
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:59,990
Press the button on tracker and your
phone rings even when it's on silent with

591
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:04,610
over 1.5 million devices tracker as the
largest crowd gps network in the world.

592

um,

602
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,560
which at the end of the
day is just a state school,

603
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,370
so they should get over themselves. All
right, that's a podcast for this Thursday.

604
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,190
Have a wonderful weekend.
You cons.

605
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,980
If our you're protesting and you want
my support, stay up on the sidewalk.

606
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,390
If you're riding a bicycle,

607
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:01,110
please be careful and ride single file
and have some fucking courtesy for the

608
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:04,110
people behind you. And if there's a red
light, why don't you fucking stop it?

609
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,350
The thing. Okay. It stopped wearing
aerodynamic shit. All right.

610
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,820
It doesn't make you any faster and you,
there's nothing at stake. All right.

611
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,420
All right. Enjoy the music and the,
uh, the highlights from podcasts.

612
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,643
True.

613
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,070
Hey,
what's going on the Monday morning podcast

614
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,320
that I'm doing it seven 30
at night Pacific coast time.

615
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,300
So it's still 10 30 on east
coast. So it's still Monday. Uh,

616
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,470
it's going on with me. I'm cooking
fish. It's what I'm doing right now.

617
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,461
Cooking fish.

618
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:07,670
And I'm steaming some Broccoli cause
I have to be in shape next week.

619
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,520
Why you ask?
Because on November 10th,

620
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,930
I'm taping my one hour comedy special,

621
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,330
uh, for a DVD. I, you like that segue
right out of the fish and Broccoli,

622
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,320
right into the goddamn comedy.
Jesus Christ. I'm a professional.

623
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,850
Um, and this is the deal, man. I just, if
you guys want to go, the tickets are free.

624
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,890
Yes, they are free. All right. And, uh,

625
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:38,860
I sent out a bulletin and a,
one of the problems I'm having is,

626
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,060
um,
I you have to do,

627
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,880
you just go to Belper at Broadway video
and just write bill burrs and capitals,

628
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,190
Bill Burr at Broadway video.
Just request your tickets,

629
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:52,420
leave your name and your phone number.
It's all in the bulletin. But you know,

630
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
people don't like to read.

631
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:58,000
So what they're doing is they're
reading the first quarter of it and then

632
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:01,060
they're sending me the
email with their name,

633
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,100
with their requests and their
phone numbers. So the comedian,

634
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,040
I'm going to have to call
them and say some stupid shit.

635
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,290
Now I don't have those tens of minutes
for my phone. What the fuck am I kidding?

636
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,010
I think I had the worst plan ever.

637
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,110
I probably made like seven phone calls
last month and I've got a $380 cell phone

638
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:25,111
bill screamed like a bitch
echoed in my fucking living room.

639
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,930
Um, yeah. So that's the deal. So, uh,

640
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,530
anybody in the New York City area that
wants to come out or I don't know if

641
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:35,830
you're going to be in New York
and you want to come down. Um,

642
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,450
I'm taping my special and I obviously
don't want to take my special in front of

643
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:42,060
40 people.
Uh,

644
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,370
it's a nice big theater
and nice and cushy and uh,

645
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,340
I want to make you laugh so seriously.
Go to bill burr at Broadway,

646
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:54,760
video.com to get your tickets.

647
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,670
And uh, with that I think I'm done. Um,

648
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,510
I think I'm done whoring out my stuff.
Is that it?

649
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,600
I don't know. It's like I got
one other thing here. Goddammit.

650
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,270
I'm never organized for these things.
Really.

651
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:14,070
Not My cds available on a

652
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,030
God. Listen to the little balls right now.
This is fucking brutal. Oh, here we go.

653
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,810
Yeah.
People who want to get the extra,

654
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,770

What are records.com backslash [inaudible]
backslash this God discography?

658
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,800
Discog once you say a d disco
and then Graffy. How about that?

659
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,080

Html.

662
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,270
Is anybody out there scrolling that down
like fucking radar O'Reilly right now?

663
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,930
Um, all right. Yeah, so that's the deal.

664
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:02,830
So I got my DVD taping is on December,
November 10th

665
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,440
November 10th this is the,

666
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:09,040
I am the worst at this shit and the
worst at this shit. If you know what,

667
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,870
just go on my page.
If you click down,

668
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:13,420
what it's going to do is it's
going to take you to my website.

669
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,170
It's going to take you on a little journey
to a place I called [inaudible] dot

670
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:22,171
com and you just click on upcoming shows
and then just click on November 17th

671
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,790
and then you don't have to
listen to me anymore. In fact,

672
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:29,320
just hit stop and just do that right now
and there won't be any more confusion.

673
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,130
Just read the whole email though,
and bill burr at Broadway video.

674
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,830
All right there.
I said at 98 times,

675
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:40,190
then I just make my fucking
Broccoli all soggy. I did.

676
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,260
Who Steamed Broccoli and does a
podcast. You know, who does I do. I do.

677
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:47,480
You think Rodney Dangerfield of it?
Did some shit like that.

678
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,210
I mean probably do some blow,
but it was the 80s. Okay.

679
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,560
I would have been on blow if
it was the 80 [inaudible].

680
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,650
Now I'm just on crystal
meth. Hey. Oh, last, uh,

681
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,290
last time I did a podcast also
people said, you know, these things,

682
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:07,750
I just sort of meander. Know
I cook, I cook fish, I a,

683
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,150
I seem shit.
I drive my car and you know,

684
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:16,130
I got a new people I'm running out
of stuff to talk about. You know?

685
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:20,600
I really thought that my
life was interesting enough
that once a week I could

686
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:22,520
babble about it for 10 minutes.
And you know what?

687
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,500
I realize nobody's at interesting.
Nobody is that fucking interesting.

688
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:31,190
You know, like how I did that. Rather
than just taking it myself and just say,

689
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,080
you know what? I'm really
not that interesting. A guy.

690
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,160
I dragged everybody down with me,
including you. Listen to this.

691
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,120
I even said that you are not that
interesting. You realize that what a Dick.

692
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,850
Right. All right, so people
sent me some questions.

693
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
I'm going to try to answer
these things honestly,

694
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,000
if I count so you can get
to know me a little bit.

695
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,460
All right. Where did this
guy, right? This Guy Brad,

696
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,810
the fuck names a kick, Brad. You
know what I mean? That's like,

697
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:03,350
you don't even give a shit. It's not.
It's like you don't want to be popular.

698
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,010
You don't want him to get the shit kicked
out of him. He just, it was just like,

699
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:11,070
you know, do you want fries? Yeah. Yeah.
Like a fries. What do you want to see?

700
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,380
What do you want to call it,
kid? Hey Brad. Yeah, Brad is,

701
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,280
Brad wants to know,
do you ever feel like you have time off?

702
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,540
Wait a sec. I can't read
out loud that. Well.

703
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,680
Do you ever feel like you have time off
or does everyone you meet expect you to

704
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:32,630
make them laugh on call
Brad?

705
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,520
You know what, that fucking sentence
goes in three different directions.

706
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,790
It's like when a plane is doing an s
pattern because there's too many God damn

707
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:44,990
people in the world and they don't
want to go into a holding pattern.

708
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,360
That's what you're fucking,
you just did the DVD.

709
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,690
I don't know the sentence version
of my fucking flight into Newark.

710
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,940
Do you ever feel like you have time off?

711
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:57,200
I think it's going to be about going
on vacation or does everyone you meet

712
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:02,201
expect you to make them laugh
on call the mean on Cue bread.

713
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,510
But I got a question for you.

714
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:10,280
Where the fuck did you go to school
and learn how to communicate?

715
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,300
Thought two sentences. Is that a run on
it? No, it isn't. I don't think it is.

716
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,350
Do you ever feel like you have time off
or does everyone you meet expect you to

717
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,930
make them laugh on call on call?

718
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:23,800
Like what am a nursing you
asking me if I do like, uh,

719
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,850
like benefits for sick people?
Yeah, I do. I do those,

720
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,681
I know what he's saying.

721
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:34,200
He do you have you ever feel like you can
just relax and not be a Zany douchebag?

722
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,810
Yeah. Offstage? Uh, yeah, I, I don't,

723
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,540
I don't walk around with
a lampshade on my head,

724
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,620
if that's what you were asking me.
Um, I actually know, I do find,

725
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:50,850
I find people try to make me laugh and
they come up to me and they tell me

726
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:55,530
horrific jokes
and then when they're done with them,

727
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,600
if I can even guess when they're done.

728
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,690
That's the worst part is when somebody
tells you a joke and it's so bad,

729
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:02,190
you still think they're
in the middle of it.

730
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,570
So you're still sitting there with your
eyebrows up. You know, when you do that,

731
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:10,080
when you're, when you're, you're trying,
like when you know somebody sucks,

732
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,460
whatever they're doing
sucks, but you don't have the
balls to just stare at them.

733
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,260
Like your story sucks, but you
can't fake like, it's interesting.

734
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:22,960
So the only way to do it,
you just put your eyebrows up
like, uh Huh. Yeah. Uh Huh.

735
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,660
And then he's just staring at you and
it's over and you're sitting there with

736
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:32,100
your eyebrows up by your fucking hair
line and you realize that your moment to

737
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:36,690
laugh was, uh, it has come and gone.
That's what I have had people tell me.

738
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:37,524
They tell me awful,

739
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,610
awful jokes and then they tell me about
some guy they work with and be and

740
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:44,790
they're like, oh my God, you,
you got to put this in your act.

741
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,610
I went with this Guy Mac,
right.

742
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,620
And every day each chicken
salad and then pictures,

743
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:55,260
picture fucking 20 minutes of that

744
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,900
as you're standing in an airport trying
to hear when they're boarding zone seven

745
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,220
or whatever the fuck they work it out
because that's what ends up happening.

746
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,640
So no, I don't feel like
I have to be on offstage.

747
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,280
I just try to chill out and uh,

748
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:15,180
I certainly don't do it around my family
cause anytime I even remotely fit funny

749
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:19,110
around my family, they break
my balls. They don't even
laugh to just go, oh really?

750
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,290
That's good bill. You're going to
put that in your act. It count.

751
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,430
Um, okay. That was question number one.

752
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,500
And I guess that's how
I'm going to do them.

753
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:30,570
I'm going to make fun of how people ask
me questions and I'm going to shit on

754
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:35,160
their lives because I'm not happy with
my own on some fucked up level. Oh fuck.

755
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:38,250
Seven 55. How much a
fisherman it though? Uh,

756
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,400
what kind of fish and I think
it's called Talia, I don't know.

757
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,690
Get some lemon zest on it or something.
I Dunno what the fuck it is.

758
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,410
I'm eating like a, uh, an
Asian in a communist country.
People who are in Greek,

759
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:53,910
God Damn Shit. Unless time
yourself fat Asian. Honestly,

760
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,620
the only time you ever see a fat Asian,

761
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:57,750
they're hanging out with other white
people and they're walking out of

762
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:02,650
Mcdonald's. So if anybody
Asian is listening, stop
hanging out with us because uh,

763
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,310
you know, nine out of 10 of us are
going to a fucking cuckoo room.

764
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,850
Um, all right. Uh, okay.

765
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:14,430
This brings me to my question.
Here is this guy, what is this?

766
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:19,970
What is your worst slash funniest
experience in dealing with the comedy club

767
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,940
owner?
I also,

768
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,160
have you ever broken the news to a
comedian that he just isn't that funny?

769
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,050
If not, how often you want
to, that's a great question.

770
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,060
Um, as far as the club owners, the worst
in front of his experiences, too many,

771
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,220
too many of them.
Uh,

772
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,320
the most recently is I worked for
this psycho up in Seattle who, uh,

773
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,510
he brings me into town. He's going to pay
me a disgusting amount of money, right?

774
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,840
So I need to sell tickets and this
guy doesn't advertise the show at all,

775
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,350
so I don't sell any tickets.

776
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,630
So then he yells at my management
company, you know, I mean,

777
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,780
even if you had Jesus Christ
plan at your club, you know,

778
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:15,670
you couldn't just put his name out on
the marquee and have somebody, you know,

779
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:18,700
you need at least have to have somebody
with a fucking sandwich board walking up

780
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:22,270
and down the street to let, let you know
that the son of God is down the street.

781
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:26,770
Jesus Christ would have a difficult time
selling out a club without advertising.

782
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,010
He'd have to be doing
miracles on the corner.

783
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:35,011
Like one of those fucking David blame
guys hanging upside down in a cube of ice

784
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:38,800
or some shit. Trying to get people to come
down there. Okay, that's the son of God.

785
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:43,180
That's what he would have to do. Okay,
now you're talking about little old me,

786
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,133
right?

787
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,980
But thank God this Guy Marty reamer up
there put me on the radio and then we

788
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:50,740
sold a bunch of tickets and then the guy,
you know,

789
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:54,100
he does like a one 80 and all of a sudden
he loves me and he's one of these guys.

790
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:56,560
He's such as psycho.
I don't even care if he fucking,

791
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,270
here's this because he's
a psycho and psychos have,

792
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,480
they don't, they don't remember
anything. He'll be mad.

793
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:08,770
They know throw a stapler at his assistant
that he's underpaying and then he'll

794
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,270
come to like when David banner
comes back from being the hall can,

795
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:14,970
you won't even remember that
I said this shit. All right.

796
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,760
So if you are listening all that shit
you said to my management company,

797
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,500
it got back to me.
Okay.

798
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,590
Fucking fucking psycho. Psycho. He had
a comb over to God. Those are the worst.

799
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,000
Who Do you think you're
fooling? Um, all right.

800
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,600
Oh, the other one. Have you ever broken
the news to a comedian that he just,

801
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:38,920
isn't that funny? If not, how often do
you want to, I'll tell you right now,

802
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:43,840
I would never do that to somebody.
I would never do that to somebody.

803
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:47,700
I, uh, I don't think
somebody is funny. I just,

804
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,920
I keep it to myself because there's been
a lot of people who've really sucked

805
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:58,150
for a long time and then all of a
sudden they figure out how to be funny.

806
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,270
And, uh, I dunno.

807
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,420
I look at everybody like they're
like me when I started out with who,

808
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:09,100
other than when I started out,
I had no confidence and a,

809
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,050
you know,
I,

810
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,980
if one person is some established
comedian came up to me and said that they

811
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:19,840
didn't wait a minute, somebody did
that. Somebody did come up to me.

812
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,580
That's right.
It is Vietnam comedy flashback.

813
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,990
I was working then the comedy
in Boston, Massachusetts. This,

814
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:33,440
how long ago was,
I had a big Red Afro.

815
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:39,610
I was wearing a striped shirt with
a vest member in the mid nineties.

816
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,750
He's white. His grunge was starting
to die, but it was before in sync.

817
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:45,860
And the boy band thing,

818
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:50,861
it's sorta a letter on like the sublime
era and that people like for half a

819
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,140
second,
we're willing to invest.

820
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,840
It's just one of those that's like
when black people try to make a pink,

821
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,670
that color member,
they were like,

822
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,430
subs were wearing tank for
like a week and a half.

823
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,370
I remember seeing that thinking if black
people pull this off, that's, that's it.

824
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:16,220
That's a game set match. There was
nothing that they cannot make. Cool.

825
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,920
And that shit went away real quick.
Well,

826
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:23,540
the white version of that was vests.
Okay.

827
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,370
I know a lot of people
fucking laughing at you,

828
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:30,230
but if there's other people my age
out there, late 30, [inaudible] to 40,

829
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:35,090
you remember it, you had
it on and uh, you know,

830
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,350
it's right after doc Martins.
It was the bridge, the vest. Oh,

831
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:43,650
I get to the fucking point of the story.
Jesus Christ. All right. So anyways,

832
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:44,750
so that's what I'm wearing.

833
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:50,950
I go on stage and I kill and I get off
stage and then there's other comedian

834
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,050
comes up and he's like,
he's a red head too,

835
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,150
but he's like 60 years old.

836
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:05,050
He's basically me in 40 years at the
time when he came up to me and uh,

837
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,940
and he just came up to me and he
just like, you know what I mean,

838
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,820
you to set up there, then it
was all bullshit. You know,

839
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:16,250
you just day you're jumping
around and blah, blah blah.

840
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,810
And he just shit all over my act.
You know,

841
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:23,990
you have a watch the discovery channel
with some sort of fucking Willdabeast

842
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:28,340
trying to market to territory.
That's what he did to my act. And uh,

843
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,930
everything he was saying was
like a punch through my chest,

844
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:36,800
pass my heart and into my soul and uh,

845
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,030
it was fucking brutal.
Then I still had a day job,

846
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,320
so I had to go back to work for
like three days before my next show.

847
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,550
And all I'm hearing in my head is this
guy's voice telling me that I suck.

848
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,180
And like back then I had
such little confidence,

849
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:56,620
I just took what anybody
said to me as law.

850
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:01,310
So they said I sucked and I sucked. I
didn't have the brains to be like, well,

851
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,420
it's just an old bitter comic. He used
to be a young red head and now you know,

852
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,900
a not so young anymore. And uh, you know,

853
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:12,530
he's a little drunk and he's been a
Douche. This has nothing to do with me.

854
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:16,980
I didn't know how to do that back then.
I was like, oh my God, somebody would,

855
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:18,980
TV credits thinks I suck,

856
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,250
so therefore I must suck.
So whatever, fast forward,

857
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,030
that's why I'd never do it to somebody.
I would never do that.

858
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,190
I wouldn't want to make somebody feel
like that. Now if you heckle me, you know,

859
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,580
all bets are off. I don't give
a shit. I wants to make you, uh,

860
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,300
just short of suicidal. I'm sure
that's kind of childish. But, uh,

861
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,580
that's it. So to answer your question
now, I don't say that and uh,

862
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:46,440
I gotta be honest with you.

863
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:49,650
I hate watching people bond
and unless it's my friends,

864
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,580
if it's a friend of mine and who's funny
and I watched him go up there and try a

865
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:54,414
new joke,

866
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:58,840
especially if it's a high energy
joke and they end with this big Ted,

867
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:00,810
I look on their face and they get nothing.

868
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,960
I can tell you that
nothing makes a comedian.

869
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,580
The civilian version of that
is watching a good friend.

870
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:11,310
He goes fall down a flight of stairs.
I mean it's just fucking hilarious.

871
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:15,400
No matter even if they dislocate
their shoulder or whatever, you know,

872
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,670
at some point as you're
driving them to the hospital,

873
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,790
you're going to have to turn and look
out the driver's side window and you,

874
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,010
you got to kind of laugh.
You know this, you know,

875
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:30,150
you do it subtly cause you're like him.
He's your friend, right? Jesus Christ.

876
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,660
Could I take longer to answer a fucking
question? Was trying to get quicker.

877
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,770
Uh, where do we go here?
What do we got next?

878
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,030
When are we getting the next one? It's
a couple more of these. All right. Um,

879
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,440
what's your most embarrassing moment
on stage or in life? Jesus Christ.

880
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,990
I don't know.
I block them out at this point.

881
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,810
Had somebody throw a dinner roll at me.
Does that count?

882
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,750
Dental floss thrown at me? If you look
on my website, I get fucking somebody

883
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,740
who a doughnut at me. I mean, I dunno. So
he sold ice had me, uh, I, you know what,

884
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:10,410
probably the first time I bombed
in front of an all black crowd.

885
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,430
Maybe that was the fucking, that was the
worst famine in front of a white crowd.

886
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:18,240
Sucks enough.
But like you just feel like you suck,

887
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,690
but when you bomb and you're the only
white guy in the room when you bomb it and

888
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,550
you really feel like you're bombing for
the entire white race and you're also

889
00:55:26,551 --> 00:55:30,810
reinforcing the stereotype
that white people aren't funny.

890
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:35,190
And it was just the worst. And I was
standing up there first job bombed.

891
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,980
I ran to the second joke,
the next joke bombed.

892
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,430
At this point I have like dry mouth,

893
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,780
like I can't even explain it.
Just, you know when like concrete,

894
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,220
I dunno when it gets so dry you can,
you can break it off and it seemed that,

895
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,510
you know that little powdered miss.

896
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,050
Just imagine if you just took a whole
handful of I'm stuck in, in your mouth.

897
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:59,820
That's how dry my mouth was and for
some reason no one was heckling.

898
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,420
They would just sort of sitting
there just looking around is it,

899
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:06,900
the show hadn't even started,
which it had been.

900
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,960
It'd been going great for like an hour
and I went into my third joke in total

901
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:18,240
panic mode, trapped in my act,
just mobile, blah blah blah,

902
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,710
blah,
blabbing on.

903
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,380
And then all of a sudden in
the back is big black girl.

904
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,770
He cheating on those voices. She
didn't, she wasn't even saying it loud,

905
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:29,830
but if you could just a hot summer day
and it just carried throughout the club.

906
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,700
As I'm up there babbling
on in dead silence,

907
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,360
I just hear her clear as day just go,

908
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:42,610
I ain't left yet.
And the whole place just started laughing.

909
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,840
It was like a whole nother show was
going on while I was still up there in my

910
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:50,380
act and I was so green.

911
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:53,470
I didn't know what to do when I should
have done was addressing, but I didn't.

912
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:58,570
I continue doing my act, which made
them laugh at me even more. It was,

913
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:02,850
it was absolutely humiliating,
but I got to admit,

914
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,200
I didn't really think about it until
you asked me that fucking question.

915
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:10,201
So either I'm over it or I'm
just the only complete denial.

916
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,050
Okay. Why are you still single? Uh,

917
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,670
cause I'm a psycho and
if you don't know that,

918
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:22,720
listen to my podcasts. Listen
to this one, right? I'll fight.

919
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:27,760
I keep forgetting to take the Goddamn
Fisher. Um, anyways. All right.

920
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:32,650
I think it's time for me to eat
like an Asian in a communist country.

921
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,100
I tell him, if you want to get shredded,
man, that's what I'm telling you, man.

922
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:40,100
You don't want to fucking fuck all these
stupid other diets. One of the that did

923
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,860
the South Beach, Manhattan beach,
it's always like a beach, right?

924
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,080
All that bullshit. You don't need
to do that. That's what you do.

925
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:53,150
You eat like somebody in Asia just
squatting down on the side of the road in

926
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:58,930
some Zen, like, you know those
Buddhist monks, you know,
you ever seen a fat monkey?

927
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:01,450
You just don't see it.
A Buddhist monk. Okay,

928
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:04,690
but you got those friar tuck white
ones. The fat man. It's just,

929
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:07,510
I don't know what it is.
It sits up.

930
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:11,950
We got that double cheeseburger
thing going on, you know, but, uh,

931
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,840
I, you know what, I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about this point.

932
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,030
All right, so I'm going
to wrap this up. Uh,

933
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,770
I want to thank everybody who listened
to in called into the uninformed show.

934
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,000
Uh, the, the radio show I do
with Joe to Rosa. And, uh,

935
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:32,080
that's quickly becoming one of the most
fun things that I do here. And, uh,

936
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,790
and the entertainment world.
We did a Halloween show and real quick,

937
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:39,550
so we had on a, uh, a real live, which,

938
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:45,340
and a couple of people from the Church
of Satan because we wanted to learn about

939
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:47,350
that shit. And I get, it was unbelievable.

940
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,540
They were the most boring fucking people.

941
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,070
I've New People in the Church of Satan
evidently don't believe in the devil.

942
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,980
The, they just don't like. Nah.

943
00:58:56,981 --> 00:59:01,270
The Church of Satan is just giving into
the desires you want to be and do and

944
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:06,970
yeah. You know, I stop at Red Lights
and a, I yield to pedestrians.

945
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,380
It was the most excruciating hour
of radio I think I've ever done.

946
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,960
But we did have the drum battle.
Me and Joe to Rosa,

947
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,010
uh, go to uninformed radio.com.
Later on this week, we have the, uh,

948
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:25,810
the video up Joe one the
plane through the song part,

949
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:29,870
and then I won the freestyle so you can
vote and see which one of us is better.

950
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:34,810
You know, it's, I know it's kind of
fucking gay, but we had a good time. Um,

951
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:35,661
so that's it.

952
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:40,661
I'm going to be in Las Vegas on
November 17th doing at Caesar's palace.

953
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,970
Jeez, it's so beautiful in here,
isn't it? I wish I had a toga.

954
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,380
Fucking hate casinos. They have
the ugliest goddamn rugs. I mean,

955
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:56,140
the what they must pay per
square footage for a casino rug.

956
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,010
If it's just fucking, it's mind
boggling. How ugly it is, you know,

957
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:02,190
got the bid yet.
Drink it.

958
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,720
Why didn't I buy those myths to help you
take a hot plate out and you guys won't

959
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:10,040
listen to me. Take a hot plate
out with a couple of districts.

960
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,960
I can burn myself and the fucking
podcast him. See if this is,

961
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:19,540
don't fuck. Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

962
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:24,290
ow. Shit done. You know the worst
thing about cooking a white fish?

963
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:29,030
You have no fucking idea
when has done right.

964
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:30,880
You know what?
I think I'm really trashy.

965
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,710
White people on this may
find Asians a little bit.

966
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,740
I'm talking about how fucking fat
white people are and uh, wait a second,

967
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:43,490
is that done? Oh Shit. That's gone. Look
at debt. Oh, would you look at that?

968
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,630
If I was Emeril right now, Emeril
Lagasse I, I would fucking,

969
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:53,510
I would take some chocolate chips and
throw them on top and go back and start

970
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:57,490
screaming just to get the crowd going.
I fucking hate that show. All right.

971
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,650
If you want to watch [inaudible] who
got you watched the essence of Emma?

972
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,900
Cause then he's just
sitting there cooking.

973
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:07,280
If you watch Emeril live or
whatever his show is to do,

974
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,590
he, he's like, he's got to entertain
people. Once you have a studio audience,

975
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:14,870
do you have noticed that? Then all of
a sudden you just got to dumb it down.

976
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,320
You can't cook anymore. Now you've
got to be like, I got some shit.

977
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,860
Everybody starts applauding. Like they
can't afford it. They know it's sugar.

978
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:29,000
Okay? You get it for
free at a diner, right?

979
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:30,110
You're not kicking it up a notch.

980
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:33,770
You making people fatter
and you contributing to the
diabetes and this goddamn

981
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:37,520
country. All right Emma. So why don't
you fucking take it down a few notches.

982
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,560
And uh, what about the musicians? He
actually has musicians on that show.

983
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,130
Jesus Christ. And you know, when you
start out to be a musician, you think,

984
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:49,040
you know, I dunno, you're
gonna to fucking play arenas.

985
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,350
But if you're going to do the TV thing,

986
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:54,730
maybe you'll be in the Conan
band or the tonight show band.

987
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:55,880
You really don't think you're going to be

988
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,400
playing your flute while,
you know,

989
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:04,070
in between some guy teaching
somebody how to make Lasagna.

990
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,240
Why does she make me feel better about
myself and my career? Anyways, that's it.

991
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:12,920
Go to bill burr at Broadway,
video.com for the tickets. Uh,

992
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:15,950
police come out to the show.
I've got a lot of new stuff.

993
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:19,850
I haven't been in New York for
a minute and uh, come on down.

994
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,250
Seven 45, November 10th.
Come down an hour early.

995
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:29,060
I will make you laugh. That is what
I do. So that's it guys. All right,

996
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,940
keep the questions,
comment. Oh wait a minute.

997
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,180
Congratulations to the Boston red sox.
We wanted again.

998
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,000
And uh,

999
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:42,110
I want to apologize to every other team
in the league that isn't the red sox or

1000
01:02:42,111 --> 01:02:45,290
the Yankees, cause that's all that
ESPN seems to talk about. I mean,

1001
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,700
it's ridiculous.
I mean,

1002
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:50,540
we want it last night and I just sit
through 20 minutes a shit of what that

1003
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:54,290
means to the god Damn Yankees. Who gives
a fuck? What does it mean to the Indians?

1004
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,960
What does it mean to the angels? What does
it mean to fucking them? Other people,

1005
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,900
they don't count. They
don't count. You know,

1006
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,960
that's how ESPN treats
the rest of the league.

1007
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:07,961
They treat the red sox and
the Yankees like they're,

1008
01:03:08,211 --> 01:03:11,690
they're real kids and they treat
everybody else like stepchildren.

1009
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:16,610
It's like you have to see that family
that adopted those kids and they kept the

1010
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:21,530
check and they didn't feed the kids
and they said they're regular kids.

1011
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,920
You know, if ESPN adopted children,
that's, that's what they do.

1012
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,630
Doesn't even fucking make sense.
Not yet.

1013
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:35,090
My is all soggy kids there anything
worse than that? Now when you do that,

1014
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,630
what you've done is you've boiled
all the new nutrients out of it.

1015
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,710
So what I'm doing here is I'm
just eating green, soggy shit.

1016
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,750
That's disgusting. The fish is great
though. Fish is great. All right.

1017
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:50,480
There's a lesson for you. Never Seen
Broccoli when you're doing a podcast.

1018
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:54,320
All right. Come on down to my taping. If
you can't make that come out to Vegas,

1019
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,960
you can't make that.
I'll probably end up in your area.

1020
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,220
Please send me more questions.

1021
01:03:58,221 --> 01:04:01,650
Thank you everybody for listening
and giving a shit about that.

1022
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,260
What I do means a lot to me.
Have a great week.

1023
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:36,051
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

1024
