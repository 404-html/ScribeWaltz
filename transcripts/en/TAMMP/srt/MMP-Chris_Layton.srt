1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,670
Hey, what's going on is bill burr
and it is the Monday morning podcast.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,730
Uh, I dunno when I think this is going
to be a special episode or maybe it's for

3
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:12,840
Monday. What would that be?
The 19th, I don't know what,

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,480
I'm a little out of sorts because I've
got to do a bunch of traveling this week.

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,530
A flat in New York. Come back and then
I'll let you bullshit. So, uh, anyways,

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,980
we have a special guest
every once in a while.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,520
I take a break from rambling to
myself in my underwear there.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,370
I'm at my house and um, you
know, drive my wife nuts.

9
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:37,140
So a this week we actually
have legendary drummer,

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,160
musician, human being from a Stevie
Ray Vaughan and double trouble.

11
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,760
Please welcome Mr Chris Latent.
What's going on, man? Hey Bill,

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,500
just hanging out in la.
I'm out here doing a project and um,

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
uh, again, awesome, right?

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,720
But I don't know if you're going to be
able to chew gum right up on the mic.

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,230
That curse. It'll drive people,
drive them nuts. Safe right there.

16
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,820
I'm already making you uncomfortable.
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

17
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:04,320
Up until that more than several times
now. All right, well first of all,

18
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,930
what brings you out right now?
We are in our Los Angeles.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,240
What brings you out here?
What are you working on?

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm doing a project called the rides and
that's a band that we put together and

21
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,930
we did a project to the same
project about a year and a half ago.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,530
The rides is myself, Bass
player, Kevin McCormick,

23
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,540
Lisbeth CSN and Jackson Brown.
And I'm very Goldberg, plays keys,

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,560
keyboards.
He was in the original electric flag.

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,420
I don't even know that. Mike
Bloomfield white back in the 60s. Um,

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,870
and then there's Kenny Wayne
Shepherd plays guitar and sings.

27
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,020
I saw you guys at the Greek you did this
summer. Yeah. That's absolutely ripped.

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,620
Yeah, he's ripping. Awesome.
What's it like to, uh,

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,460
Olin Stephens stills? He's in
there too. It was the other, yeah,

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,010
he's the last but not least.

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,900
And that's the band and
we're making a record and it,

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,370
this is your second one or you're the
first one? This is the second one. Yeah.

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,020
Second one that you got done is called
the rights. All right. D s right. Okay.

34
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,070
Now what, what type of music are we
looking at here? It's guitar driven.

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,780
It's blues. It's, you know, it's
original songs for the most part.

36
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,230
How do you, how do you know
why Steven Stills? Uh, well,

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,710
I know him through Kenny because I worked
with Kenny a lot and we go back many,

38
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:21,150
many years. Um, personally, I
know Steven is because of this.

39
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:25,050
I was asked, they talked about it
and asked me to join the whole idea.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,550
What's that like? Just as, I
don't know if I, I, if, you know,

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,940
I played drums as a hobby and I'm
horrific. So I always wondered like,

42
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:36,900
I've always had unbelievable
admiration for a true musicians.

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,640
What is it that you do
you get that failing?

44
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,170
Like when you're sitting in the studio,

45
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,760
you're counting off a
song and you look on,

46
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,280
over at the side of Stephen Stills head.
Do you ever just think,

47
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,940
how the hell did I get here? Well, yeah, I
think that way about a lot of things. Um,

48
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,560
because, you know, growing up I was a huge
Stephen stills fan, Crosby, stills, Nash,

49
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,900
and young and right.
You know, Dallas Taylor,

50
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,090
who was the drummer in the
band way back when. I mean,

51
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:57,970
these are the things we're replacing our,

52
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:01,930
I've got my licks and I'll listen to
guitar sounds and songs and song writing.

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,430
I was like, awesome. It's like legendary.
Talk about legendary, you know,

54
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,000
and then you're,

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,570
and then I'm sitting there and I'm
looking over there and he's counting off a

56
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,680
song or having meat count off the som
going, wait a minute, how did I get here?

57
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,900
How do you stay calm in that moment?

58
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,390
Because I would sit there and I would
have like a resting face that you would

59
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,590
know that I was freaking out.
But inside of you, like, Oh, I

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,260
can breathe deeply and slowly
she wouldn't be here.

61
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,800
Now it's all good. You know?
I've had a long career,

62
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:36,460
so I've worked long and hard to get your
southern girl, you know, I deserve this,

63
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,710
I deserve it as well.
As much as I wouldn't deserve it,

64
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,780
but I'm grateful that I've got it.
That's awesome.

65
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,980
You can feel that because I've
never felt I deserve this. I,

66
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,340
unless it's something bad, like something
comes back to bite me in the ass.

67
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,460
I'm like, you know, I'm an asshole.

68
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,890
But like, I don't think I've, I've, uh,

69
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,250
I had a buddy of mine recently wanted
to go out and go buy himself a nice car

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,400
and I gave him a halftime speech
to go out and do it because a,

71
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm trying to get my,
I got that,

72
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,900
that Catholic guilt thing where I can
buy my wife anything. But uh, but uh,

73
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,590
you know, if I was going to go by myself,
by the way, you pulled up in there? Yeah.

74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,900
A Hemi, a Chrysler Hemi
station wagon. Yeah. Which I,

75
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:18,310
I've been trying to defend the station
wagon to my listeners. Most of them,

76
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:22,610
90% of them are not having it. This
is sports car bill. It's a sports car.

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,250
It is. No, but I like, it's
a sleeper. No, it is my mom,

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,090
my wife calls it to the thug car.
She goes,

79
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,000
he's going out in your thug car
to dance. Like, you know, um,

80
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,400
did you get the station wagon so you
can throw your drums in the back and all

81
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,910
that stuff? Yeah. You know what?

82
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,660
Every car that I get somehow is
motivated by that idea because you know,

83
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,110
you know, I do all
kinds of work, you know,

84
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,660
but it all comes down to the
very first work. I do this,

85
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,830
can I get my drums in the car?
Right.

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,750
And you'd get them easily at
a station wagon. Which shift?
What's your, your first,

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,460
uh, your first vehicle? You have a
head. The first one that I bought,

88
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:00,020
cause I know you're a big car guy,
you got to look a Shelby Mustang and,

89
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:01,750
and stuff like that
coming to blow your mind.

90
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,010
It was a Datsun five 10 station wagon.
Oh Jesus.

91
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,450
It's before they were called
Nissan over here. I remember that.

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,610
Dotson Dotson five 10,
you know,

93
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,890
it was a guy who does drag races with
one of those and he hits all electric of

94
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,560
seeing that then. And he was saying like,
it's a five, 10. I have seen that. Yeah,

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,310
that's that one where they started to
slope the back end and it's like they just

96
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,720
said, fuck it. We don't have enough time.

97
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,930
And they just sliced off the back
is not how it looks. Well, it was a,

98
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:30,370
it was a coupe or a a four door
sedan is what it was. Oh No, no,

99
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,450
five 10 what am I talking about?

100
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,780
I love that the five 10 we can build this
in the station wagon was in Tom p two

101
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:39,130
10 [inaudible]. Yeah, no, no,
no, no, no. Sorry. My mistake.

102
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm still an acid.

103
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,100
Going to be times I said that I loved
that car and I can't and I'm so psyched

104
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:45,340
that I'm actually sitting here talking to
you like I'm freaking out a little bit.

105
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,640
You had to five tenants. Such a bad
ass car. Did you have the two door?

106
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,100
The four door? Well, I had the
station wagons. It was a four door.

107
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,730
You had a four a station.
Yeah.

108
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,980
All I ever did was put the key in
it and put gas in. I had the car for

109
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,360
like four years and it was,
you know,

110
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:03,620
it was when I moved to Austin from
Corpus Christi, Texas. I just said,

111
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,090
I'm out of here.
And I went to Austin,

112
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,400
I'll put all my stuff in that
car and I took off. And um,
how Lo, how old were you?

113
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,860
I was, uh, just turned
19. So 19 years old.

114
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,130
You gotta you gotta Datsun Five,
10,

115
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:19,160
four door station where you live in Corpus
Christi and you've been playing drums,

116
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,870
parent's house and that type of stuff,

117
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,780
listening to all these guys that
you eventually would play with. Yes.

118
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,970
And what happens you
basically as a musician,

119
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:30,620
because it fascinates me as a
comedian. Like when I started out, um,

120
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,041
you know,

121
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,400
it was all about getting on at Nick's
comedy stop and the Comedy Connection and

122
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,650
Dick is comedy club and
getting established there.

123
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:41,450
And then that becomes that moment where
you've done that and you dislike I now

124
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:46,010
what? Yeah. Now where do I go that that
must happen? Music musically too. Yeah.

125
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,671
You know,
it was,

126
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:51,671
I was in corpus and my father had died
and I looked around and I've been to

127
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,570
Austin to visit my sister who was a
university of Texas three or four years

128
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:01,340
earlier. And I woke up one day, I
was in music school in Corpus and um,

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,791
it's funny,

130
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,180
I just saw whiplash and I had this drum
instructor who I went in to take with

131
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,210
him cause he's one of the best guys and
rudimental middle playing. They said,

132
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,820
you're holding you sticks
wrong. I said, he said,

133
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,520
I want you to hold them traditional,
you know, military style setting.

134
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't do that anymore. He said,
yeah, you're holding them wrong.

135
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,440
It was a French match grew up.
I said,

136
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,300
well Billy Cobham holds
his sticks like this.

137
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,850
And I had been doing that
right since I was a kid.

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,260
And just to let our listeners know, if
he ever watch like a drummer play, he,

139
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
does he pick them up the
way you naturally would?

140
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,750
Would she grab them both the same way
and then as that other way where the left

141
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,360
hand, if you're right handed drummer, it's
sort of lane sideways across your hand.

142
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,000
That's considered traditional.
The other's called match,

143
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,990
it's called mass group
and there's very styles.

144
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,910
But the thing was because
of marching drums, you know,

145
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:45,540
like in military operations, the other
drum hung to hang hung to the side.

146
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,720
So the stick hit perfect when
you held to the left hand. Right.

147
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,990
Cause the drum would hang to one side.

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,190
So you hold that hand held the stick
that way in the hand. That's, you know,

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,240
on the side of the groom, I mean the
other side. Okay. Anyway, so, and he says,

150
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,390
I see. So I don't care how Billy
Cobham holds his drum sticks. He goes,

151
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,120
you're not going to hold them that way.
I said, hey, you know what, I'm done.

152
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,900
And I got up and I walked out and
I woke up. No, I'm, I'm, you know,

153
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,690
I'm just sliding like whiplash. I'm just
sitting there watching the goods. Like,

154
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,390
Dude, you've got the talent. You don't
need to sit here and get yelled at.

155
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,780
I'm not saying it wasn't tremendous
performance by the guy from the insurance

156
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,870
commercials. What are they? I don't
know what his name is, but he's awesome.

157
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,510
He's awesome. Bump bump. But
it also goes to show you,

158
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,000
that's like that thing
with acting that you what?

159
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,390
Just UA handcuffed by the material.
Like if this guy doesn't get that script,

160
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,670
he just has to keep going. Like, uh,

161
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,570
whatever the hell he says in
those commercials. No, no.

162
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,610
So I get in my mock up the next day and
I go, you know what, I'm Outta here.

163
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,510
I'm going to Austin. And that place
was awesome. One of those, did you,

164
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,750
now did you say that to the teacher?
Not as he's screaming at you,

165
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,510
Michael Douglas and uh, no. Went back the
next day and I went to all my teachers.

166
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,450
I said, hey, I don't care
what you're going to do with
my grades. I'm Outta here.

167
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:53,360
And they go, when you leave, and I
go right now, leave the building.

168
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,040
I got the car packed and I'm on my way.
Do

169
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,250
whatever you want to have my grades
or any of that stuff. I got to go now.

170
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:02,970
What now will you always like
that sort of strong person?

171
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:07,530
Because I think if I was 19 years old and
if some guy like the dude and whiplash

172
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:11,340
said, you know, the holding your sticks
wrong, I would be like, oh, okay.

173
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,870
And then when as he yelled
at me, I'd be like, you're
right. I know I am. Well Shit,

174
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,270
you said, we touched on this a
minute ago when you said that,

175
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,970
because when I said I deserve
this, like, oh, did I say that?

176
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,920
Because I've been trying to work over my
Catholic guilt too, you know. Um, so I,

177
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:26,820
you know,
sometimes I go,

178
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,150
I deserve way more than I got and I
don't really deserve with anything that I

179
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:34,740
even have that pendulum swings done.
Swing is wide these days.

180
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,970
So that's the good news.

181
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,960
But not always kind of been defiant in
a contrarion and a bunch of other stuff

182
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,270
with some good stuff. But um, no,

183
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,840
that was easy because something
told me you need to get outta here.

184
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:49,250
There's something for you there
that you're not gonna find.

185
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,270
A lot of people feel that, but
they don't act on it. Like I,

186
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,240
I do both. Like I have times where I have
this feeling, I'm just like, what, dude?

187
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,590
Fuck you.
I'm out of here.

188
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,560
And then I have other times where
that voice is screaming at me,

189
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,400
waking me up at night. I'm grinding my
teeth and I still like ignore it. Like I,

190
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,580
I could not, I'm not, this
year's the first year, um,

191
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,610
this year we're three weeks into it.
I mean,

192
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,180
in the last year I've really started to
listen to my gut and if I meet somebody

193
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,530
and my, despite what they're doing and
all their accolades and everything,

194
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:24,270
if my gut has that feeling of like,
do this, this isn't right, I, I've,

195
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,600
I've walked away from it. And two of the
things that it really came back like,

196
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,190
wow, man, I was, I was right on that one.

197
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,210
So it took me almost 50 years
to figure that out. But, uh,

198
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,830
so I'm always like, uh, drawn to
stories like that. So then you, you,

199
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:42,450
you leave, you say fuck that
these two, the whiplash guy. Yeah.

200
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,261
So I got,
you know,

201
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:46,130
it's funny you said that because I mean
kind of aren't we like that? I'll go the,

202
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,441
the,
the,

203
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:50,370
the best thing that I can do is when I
had that intuition that's attached to

204
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,900
some kind of passion to actually
listen to that as opposed to, God,

205
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,940
I fucked that up. I better do something
different. That's a big turning point.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Right? And that's what
happened. Right? Then I went,

207
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,330
I don't know why I'm going there.

208
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,180
All I know is that something
tells me that I need to go there.

209
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,290
So it took the 200 bucks.

210
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,920
I had my pocket for peace drum kit in
about six changes of clothes and I just

211
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:11,760
took off and drove there.
So you drive and then you show up.

212
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,320
I always try to encourage people who
listened to this podcast to, you know,

213
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,630
if it's not the wrong with being
in a cubicle and doing that,

214
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,860
but if you don't want to do it,

215
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,970
you have this thing telling you to
throw six shirts into a car and drive

216
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:28,710
somewhere that you should do it. Um, so
you, when you show up, you have no way to,

217
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:31,500
and this is the big questions people
always have when it comes to following a

218
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:36,140
dream is like, then they're always like,
and then what? And it's kind of like,

219
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,060
what would you say? He just figure
it out as you get there. Yeah.

220
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:43,650
You know the thing that you have to keep
working and you don't give up and you

221
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:44,610
follow that intuition,

222
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,490
you pass some common sense
and pay attention to the
things right in front of you.

223
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,700
I go, you mostly think some work out? I
mean, they work out one way or the other.

224
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,410
So how long did you sleep in your
car for? Well, I didn't this,

225
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,220
see there were some guys

226
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,490
that had, that had a band up in Austin.
They live in this little shack outside,

227
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,120
a little town called Maine or Texas.
It was fifth 14 miles outside Austin.

228
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,640
They said they'd just come back a
few weeks earlier. They get, yeah,

229
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:07,270
we abandoned the place and they go, it's
got the rest of the rent paid. I went,

230
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,050
can I get the key to that joint? Okay.
That's some of those deals where you go,

231
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,990
Huh, I can maybe use that if you want
to give it to me if it's rent's paid.

232
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,590
So I went there and it was outside and I
had nothing. I was sitting there going,

233
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,430
get now what? You know firstly what the
rent was paid for, how long? 14 days.

234
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,460
That was paid for like another couple of
weeks. And I had some guys who said, hey,

235
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,900
why don't we go up there?
Let's go up there.

236
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:26,920
So the idea was that we were going to,

237
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,650
we were going to have a balanced as it
come on up there. I'm going, let's go.

238
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,950
We can have their old house and Blah.
So we did that. Nobody had anything.

239
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:36,120
And we kind of sat around and p jammed
in the, in the, in the house, you know,

240
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,010
we didn't really ever do
anything except that. Meanwhile,

241
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:42,130
when the guy went and got
a job and another guy went
and got a job and you know,

242
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,580
I had the only car,
I drove a guy to his job and he picked,

243
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,790
he covered my rent the next month
because we were out there for a couple of

244
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,680
months. Right. Um, you know, the
story could get really long. No, no,

245
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,410
no. This is all fascinating. What, what
kind of kid were you playing at that time?

246
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,730
I had a Gretsch Kit. You did an a four
piece Gretsch kit. What do you play now?

247
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:04,210
You lead with gay? Well, I play
Ludwig on a play fives. I played both.

248
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,450
I played both of them. Oh,
okay. I was a Ludwig Guy.

249
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,880
My very first kid I played was Ludwig,
Ludwig and Zildjian, which was basically,

250
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,750
that was the Cadillac of back
then before all these, uh,

251
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,960
for the Japanese companies. And uh,
yeah. You know, I mean, Mitch Mitchell,

252
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,930
I heard that and well, what's he doing? I,
and I saw a picture, I'm like, yeah man,

253
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,650
you know that's right. Because we was
the top and over there. What was it?

254
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,860
Premiered drums over in England. Premiere
England. Yeah, he played those two books.

255
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,130
Premiere. Right. You know, and then there
was Yamaha and parole, all the work.

256
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,570
And you know,
we're around for a while,

257
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:37,890
but when the like everything else they
finally got here. Right. You know?

258
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,340
So how long before you got into an actual
situation after you moved to Austin

259
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:47,170
that you were in a band, you guys were
playing in the clubs, you could eat and a,

260
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:52,120
you could make your rent.
That was two years later.

261
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,680
Two years later now will you one of
those guys we did you just like as far as

262
00:13:56,681 --> 00:14:00,220
like other musicians
seeing you and being like,

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,370
I want to play with this guy or that's
the kind of guy because the drums or the

264
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:06,130
foundation,
did you have a style that that,

265
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,500
did you have to go out and
shake a bunch of hands?

266
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,990
Are you one of those guys that sat down
and play it and people just like that

267
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,710
guy can play. Well, here's what
happened. One of the guys that came back,

268
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,520
it came up later, it can be in that
band. And then immediately, you know,

269
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,110
we know it didn't have a band,
was a sax player. He lives here.

270
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,130
Joe Sublett looser in La and
he got a Gig with a, with a,

271
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,100
with a band called Paul Ryan,
the cobras.

272
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,160
And there was another band called
grease the wheels who were looking for a

273
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,170
drummer and I didn't really have a Gig.
And he said,

274
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,060
you ought to check out my roommate.
He's really good.

275
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:36,400
So I went and auditioned a much with
a bunch of other guys and they said,

276
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:40,150
you got the Gig. That's where I started
making a steady paycheck paper on Friday.

277
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,470
You know, right now because you needed
that gig where you extra nervous.

278
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,290
It's one of your first gigs.
So, you know, I mean more,

279
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,880
more nervous than I was just to begin
with about live. But you know, I'm,

280
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,960
the only thing was that
one of those things,

281
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,040
because you were always playing
with other people that you,

282
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,360
you didn't feel the nerves. You
know what? Well not, I mean, I,

283
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,140
I mean I'd still do now you're talking
about looking over at Stephen stills

284
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,430
aren't going like shit, you know, let
me get the right field. This like, no,

285
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:09,230
it's this way. It's every day. And I was
like a, you know, that's a daily thing.

286
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:13,040
Like, you know, I look for something
that helps call me, you know,

287
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,990
it keeps me in the moment,
you know?

288
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,790
But you have those moments where
you stepping out on stage Guy Shit,

289
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,090
I hope I do good. You know, and I will
do. I know I got it. I don't know.

290
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,640
Maybe I can yeah. About
whatever. We haven't gotten
lost in a song. Hopefully like,

291
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,200
no, I don't mean in a good
way. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I
do this show, I do this show.

292
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:34,370
It's called the goddamn comedy jam.
It's a really cool thing.

293
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,570
It's funny you went romantic.
Yes. All the time. No, it's true.

294
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,350
I've met like, like, so
what happens? Basically it,

295
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,200
he knows a lot of comedians like myself
that play instruments and you know,

296
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:49,310
wish that they had your abilities
on whatever instruments. And uh,

297
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,330
we ended up becoming comedians.
So Scott [inaudible] and Myers,

298
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,960
he has this comedy show where you go up,
you do 10,

299
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,480
15 minutes and tell stories about going
to conscious and then you go back,

300
00:15:56,481 --> 00:16:00,140
you jam with the band, either play guitar,
you sing, he played drums. So I, uh,

301
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,270
I've done it like three times,
did it last night.

302
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,960
And sometimes I find myself so
listening to the bass player,

303
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:12,350
so I stay on time. I forget,
I'm not listening to the lyrics.

304
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,510
And like this song we played last night,

305
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:17,990
the chorus went around twice the first
time and only went around once before.

306
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,750
I went to the bridge a second time. And
I'm literally in the middle of it going,

307
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,930
is this the first time or the
second time we played this?

308
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,310
Has that happened to you? Well,
yeah, but you know what, you're,

309
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:29,630
you know that here's the thing
is after enough experience,

310
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,100
and Stevie's to say that she said,

311
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:34,370
if we just make our ears
real big and pay attention,

312
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,160
we have the tools and we'll be all right.

313
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,710
And while he bought her find about that,

314
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:41,230
not what I find that
about that as a ratio.

315
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,390
The other thing is I can really be
front running the deal. Right. You know,

316
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:47,340
it's no different than, you
know, quarterback who's he's
taking the snap and the,

317
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,680
and the receivers already down the,

318
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,090
down the field and he's
throwing the ball or you go,

319
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:53,480
the guy's not down there
yet. Right. You know,

320
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,520
so when the guy gets down there
and I'll see what's going on,

321
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:58,220
then you act in the moment. And that's,
I mean, that's really what, what I do,

322
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:00,890
everything's about living in them in the,
in the incident.

323
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,190
And if you're listening to everybody,
unless nobody knows what's going on,

324
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,550
you'll all do it together or whatever
it is, we'll be fine. And if it's not,

325
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,130
you go back and retool and figure
out what you did wrong together.

326
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,000
What's the worst example you have of
like being up on a bandstand and nobody

327
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:17,370
knew what was going on and they're all
looking back at you like what he had,

328
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,690
did it all just fall down the stairs
there? Do you want me to hold the fake it,

329
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,920
we started this Hendricks story.
I do these tours. I wish, man,

330
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,070
I wish this could I just
seeing the look on your face.

331
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,830
You like this 600 yards staring Islam.
Uh Ah.

332
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,760
Okay. Yeah, we had thinking about,

333
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,760
I was thinking the first thing
that came to my mind, I do,

334
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm the drummer for the experience Hendrix
tours, which I played with everybody,

335
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,860
right?
That's like three hours long.

336
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,580
And we did this one tour that started
in DC and the idea was, you know,

337
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,950
everybody knows Jimmy Hendrix songs and
we'll just all show up and you know,

338
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,400
and we go, we got this, we got this in
her employment, these guys and what,

339
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,830
how does he do it and does he do it
the same way, you know, whatever.

340
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,940
And so we go out there, they're
sold out houses. Like, as this,

341
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,550
I'm counting off the song, guys are
going to buy keys sitting on, you know,

342
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,690
like you gotta be kidding me. Oh No.
It's like train wreck after train wreck.

343
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:08,970
And they're not only looking
at me, but you know, I'm going,

344
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,420
I thought this is where it goes to
the, the chorus. But how come you're,

345
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,270
what do you do?
You know,

346
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,110
they're looking at me and I'm looking
at them and you know, this whole thing,

347
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,720
it's like everybody's up there
with their pants down, you know,

348
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:23,370
and everybody in the audience, how
many people are watching 4,000. Oh,

349
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:27,810
Jayson. And they're like,
with their mouths open going,
I pay $250 for the seat.

350
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,570
What are y'all doing up there? You know,
and it's just like mayhem. I'm going to,

351
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,860
uh, you know, I know
how many gigs, I mean,

352
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,350
I imagine after that you guys just said
immediately went to the practice room.

353
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,920
We work that out. Well, yeah, but yeah,
but then, but then you're on the tour,

354
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,360
so it's like your gig and every day.

355
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,580
And so you used the catch as
catch can sound check. Hey,

356
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,660
let's get together in this room.

357
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:49,560
Let me show you what I was thinking about
that on that song. And you know, for me,

358
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm listening to everybody cause
there was, hey, let's do this. Hey,

359
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:52,770
let's don't do that. I'm going, okay,

360
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:55,860
let me keep it straight because then
a few hours we're going to go hit.

361
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,940
And how long did it take for you guys to,
to whip that into shape? I don't know,

362
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:04,740
eight or nine years. That's a
work in progress. But I mean,

363
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,360
to the point that people in the crowd,

364
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,720
novices weren't noticing the look of
panic or be it in the wrong key and oh,

365
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,970
it took us a few shows. But you know,
that's the thing. It becomes personal.

366
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,940
You know, you do your work and you do
something. I don't know if that, you know,

367
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,060
sometimes that's funny. And you got, it
could have been funnier. I, and you know,

368
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,760
it could be better, but the thing
about me is I'm up to it by myself. So,

369
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,350
even if I'm falling off the rails,

370
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,720
whatever direction I decided to go
into to, uh, to try and right the ship,

371
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,620
it's 100% of the performance up
there are going in that direction.

372
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:37,590
So at least it looks good cause it's
just me. So whatever decision I make,

373
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,910
it's not like I'm looking
at the bass player and he,
he goes left and I go right.

374
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:44,720
And the whole thing falls down. Like
I've, I've always been amazed at,

375
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,590
but let me get back to,
cause you already brought up Stevie,

376
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,990
I know there's listeners going like they
want to hear those stories. So anyways,

377
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:52,890
so two years in you get, um, you get a,

378
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,460
you getting a pay check and all
that. You, you, you're working in 21,

379
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,040
22 at that point, 20 years
old. So here's what, you know,

380
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:03,810
2020 almost 21 my roommate
says he got to come out,

381
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,840
see our band, you know, I said, yeah,
yeah, but I've been working all the time.

382
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,270
So it was a Tuesday night
and I went out to go see him.

383
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,780
And this is interesting because when I
walked up to a place called Soak Creek

384
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:15,570
saloon and it was a big
old frame house then got,

385
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,600
and it was just a club out
in the country and I walk up,

386
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,130
I hear the Mamet man's house,

387
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:24,300
grandma and I heard this guitar town that
wasn't any louder than the rest of the

388
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,230
band through the wall,

389
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,570
but I could hear it like it was like
right there in my ear. I'm a tough one.

390
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,490
Is that?
Yeah.

391
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,170
And I walked through the door
and I turn and my guy go, right.

392
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,190
My eyes went right to Stevie on with that
guy is fascinating and I was seeing a

393
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:40,590
lot of people, but I'm went,
there's something about this guy.

394
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,270
I go out the next lap,

395
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,320
I go out the next week and to go see
him again because I'm really digging the

396
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:51,290
band and their late and my roommate turns
to the guys and when to get my mom to

397
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,290
get my, why don't we get my
roommate up here? He goes,

398
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,500
really good drum the gang and then
I'll sweat for Rodney. So some more,

399
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,400
a little more time goes mom, places
packing the God, God get him up here.

400
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,180
So I get up there and I play like four
songs with them and I'll look over and

401
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,570
Steve, he's kind of looking over shoulder,
kind of giving me the wink, you know,

402
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,140
and the very next day, nice.
He comes over to the apartment,

403
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:14,710
he walks in on me and I'm playing along
to this Donny Hathaway live record.

404
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,680
Everything is everything. Willie
Weeks and Freddie Wyatt and I'm like,

405
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:18,461
it all settled,
look up,

406
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:22,870
but he's like standing like four inches
from me and it startled me. Went, no man,

407
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:26,130
go ahead. Oh Man. He goes, what? Donny
Hathaway. Huh? I go, yeah, he goes,

408
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,950
ask one of my favorite records.
So we started chatting and
I tell him, I said, man,

409
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:34,300
I love to work with you. So I think
that we could do some great stuff.

410
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,150
What was it like that, that first
time when you played those four songs?

411
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,000
I know you've taken in the whole band.
I know. It's just like, all right,

412
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,950
the next drama is going to show up.
I don't know how that works,

413
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,690
if he's going to be upset that
you weren't as drums or whatever,

414
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:48,370
but where you still had that
feeling as Stevie's playing? I mean,

415
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:51,280
I didn't know what was the context
of the band? Was there a singer?

416
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:55,090
Was Stevie singing and was,
was he just a considered like a side man?

417
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:55,810
Guitar player?

418
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,690
He was a side of me and kind of featured
Solos and he's saying like he's saying

419
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:02,890
a song. There was two guitar players,
there was a bass player, a drummer,

420
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,300
singer, solo singer, um, and a sax
player. Then my friend, my roommate,

421
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,580
Joe sublet. Okay. And where,

422
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:14,560
where was Stevie's playing at that point
was very r and B, like, you know, he'd,

423
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,410
he'd come from Dallas and
his brother Jimmy had really,

424
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,430
when he heard Jimmy played guitar,
thought maybe ought to do right.

425
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,480
So he was thinking, I was like, you know,
it was like Freddie King and uh, you know,

426
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,830
Eddie Taylor, Jimmy Reed and slim Harpo
and a bunch of BB king. Freddy was,

427
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,320
was his playing at the
level at that point already.

428
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,540
We like this guy is going to be
one of the greats of all time.

429
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,510
Well you know what, he was just
fabulous anyway. You know what I mean?

430
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,330
But he wasn't as out front and,

431
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:43,030
and grandiose is the
really the wrong word.

432
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,760
I know you can do anything he
wanted to do, but he what he did,

433
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:48,610
he could play one note and he went,
that's the coolest note I've ever heard.

434
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:50,810
He's just going back home,
you know,

435
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,060
and just had it or recordings of
him when he was like 12 years old.

436
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:57,910
And he was like, when he was, he sounded
like Eric Clapton cause he was like,

437
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,640
you know, because yeah, he was
playing Eric Clapton looks like a,

438
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,490
that sounds like Eric Club goes
ceviche 12, you know, so it's like,

439
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,780
so he could just say, you know
what, I hated that. It's like,

440
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,190
just pick anything up and sound fabulous.

441
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,760
Know I know that God so did,
um,

442
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,450
so then he's standing there and like,
so at that point,

443
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:20,410
I mean it's weird because he's just
a guy named Stevie, Stevie Vaughn,

444
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,900
Stevie Vaughn at that point.
Okay. And this is probably like,

445
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,900
what are we talking at this point?
Mid Seventies, late seventies is 19.

446
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,670
This is like late, early 1977, 77.

447
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,400
So he's still wearing like that
sort of that big skully cap.

448
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:36,340
He didn't have in bowling
shirts and you know,

449
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,140
Brogan shoes and you know,
pleated pants and stuff. So at,

450
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,260
so at that point when he,
uh, he says, um, you know,

451
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:48,500
that that's one of his favorite records.
So where did it go from there? Well,

452
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:52,870
he left. Um, the two, fast forward some,

453
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,790
a woman living on Barton
is a singer in Texas,

454
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,580
pulled him out of the cobras to start
a band called triple threat review.

455
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,450
That lasted like five or six months and
then it blew apart and it turned into

456
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:04,250
double trouble.
And that's when I came in.

457
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,760
He asked me to say we want to
play in our band. So in, in a,

458
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:10,580
in a fast evolution, you
know, eventually ended up,

459
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,310
it was Stevie and myself
and Tommy Shannon. I mean,
there's stories of all this,

460
00:24:15,311 --> 00:24:19,160
but you know, but that became
the trio that, you know,

461
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,690
that speaks in that light.
The front.

462
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,490
I know you've probably
answered this a zillion times,

463
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:26,450
but what was that like the first time
you guys all got together in a room when

464
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:30,620
it was just the three of you and there
was all that space now Stevie to play?

465
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,810
Well, that's when his guitar plan started
changing because he was, you know,

466
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:35,510
he's mean to me is a musical genius.

467
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:37,490
And then he followed
that intuition perfectly.

468
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,430
The thing we were just talking
about and that he went,

469
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,340
he knew that he couldn't
be in a trio format,

470
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,950
he couldn't be just a rhythm and
rhythm and Blues Guitar Player.

471
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,060
So he immediately,

472
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,940
he started incorporating solos and
rhythm all into one kind of thing,

473
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:51,590
which sounded like two
or three guitar players,

474
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,640
like a four or five piece band and
three with three guys. And he was,

475
00:24:55,641 --> 00:25:00,110
now he was singing because he was singing
all the songs and he develops quickly.

476
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,360
You know, his thing
developed very, very quickly.

477
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:04,020
So now we kind of start stepping out.
But the,

478
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,100
the part of the reason that we went from
a five piece band with three piece band

479
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:10,040
is that some have said Manyatta
do like a Jimmy Hendrix tune.

480
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,820
So we did I that guys sounds
like Hendrix and then everyone.

481
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,780
So the first one you guys did,
we did,

482
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,560
well we did voted child and we did
it forever. We did at our whole life.

483
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,690
But we did, you know, we'd,

484
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:22,670
we'd do a gig every once in a while
where we do all Hendricks Stub,

485
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:26,480
manic depression and hey Joe and,
and uh, you know, it has been,

486
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,700
everybody else in the band was like,
don't play that shit. You know,

487
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:33,070
we're a blues band, you know, and it
just kind of, the rub came to, became a,

488
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,270
a wedge has really kind of what happened
on the musical side of all that was, oh,

489
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,260
was that like a Texas Blues
purists saying, yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,020
We don't do that shit around
here. You know, we played blues,

491
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,260
played appropriately and there's
a lot of great traditional,

492
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,280
a great upholding of tradition in
Texas till lots of different things.

493
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,230
But you know,
we were the ones that were like,

494
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,900
we were in the white kind of a little bit
outcast cause like if we're doing this

495
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,840
wild shit, we're playing too
loud playing Jimi Hendrix songs.

496
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,040
We started doing superstition by Stevie
wonder cause we discovered we were big

497
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,950
fans of all these people and people
like yeah, no it's blues and,

498
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,110
and and I'm thinking I must have been
exciting for you because just sitting in

499
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:15,560
with a blues band after
a while is a drummer.

500
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:18,920
I mean that can get monotonous is
trying to play it like a how many,

501
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:20,420
how many different ways
can you play a shuffle?

502
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:23,660
And I'm sure you could say a thousand
but I'm just saying just sitting in with

503
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:24,630
the like I never,
I've ever,

504
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,130
I mean it's ridiculous that I'm even
trying to relate to you on this level,

505
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:31,350
but anytime I've sat in and when people
start playing blues at Bomp Bomp bomp

506
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:35,630
dump on and you just sit in back then
it's like I want to kill myself after one

507
00:26:35,631 --> 00:26:38,630
and a half songs. You might need
to examine that more deeply.

508
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,560
You know what? It's funny because
I tell people, they go, hey,

509
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,070
you know this and that
about your Microsoft

510
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,240
only know like four beats.

511
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:48,660
But I know a lot of different ways
to play the same four beats. I mean,

512
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:50,100
and shuffles or like endless.

513
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,050
And that's what's actually
beautiful about them to me.

514
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:56,070
And I didn't know this until I started
doing that and somebody said, hey man,

515
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,170
check this out. I mean, out on the spot.
Right. You know, metaphorically, you know?

516
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:05,610
And they went, no, no, no, no, no, no,
you're going cooking. Good con cocoon.

517
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:10,390
But it's really Putin, Pataki, Pataki
platoon. I was like, Gah Gah, Gah,

518
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,990
Gah, Gah, Gah. Oh Wow. It's like
endless varieties. Like it's like,

519
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,300
how do you make a stew? It's like, Nah,
it's meat and potatoes and care. So yeah.

520
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,910
What about all the other shit in between
that makes it something really great or

521
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:24,530
something like just fucking meat
and potatoes and carrots, you know?

522
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,010
And that's kind of that simple really,

523
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:30,960
or that complex or the only way I
can compare that to what I do is,

524
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,980
uh, I guess if you take a joke
and you can just do the joke,

525
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:37,470
you can just stand there and say it.
You can act it out.

526
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,730
You can have two characters in it talking
and you can end up basically taking

527
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:45,990
something that was essentially a shit
joke. Oh, Riddick joke or whatever.

528
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:49,830
And you can, you can actually
flesh it out into a piece,

529
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
which I guess I don't know what,

530
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,330
there's really no definitions and comedies
like when it makes a bit what makes a

531
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:58,170
piece, but you can, you can have
a little performance piece, um,

532
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,960
out of that. And uh, I've always,

533
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:04,740
I've just had such an admiration
for them for like musicians,

534
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,380
your guys' ability to, uh,
like I don't feel like,

535
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,440
like what I do as far as this like talking
and that type does everybody talks.

536
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,540
So it's kind of like your
jam and all day with people.

537
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,930
So you can immediately think
something and then say it.

538
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:19,650
The fact that you guys can do
that musically, like sonically.

539
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Think of think of Phil or think a lick
and then just as you're thinking it,

540
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,800
play it the way. If I thought it,
whatever words I'm saying right now,

541
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:33,680
I mean to me like that is,
is is when you like really master like a,

542
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,060
an instrument or something like that.
You know what's funny?

543
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,960
When I saw your show in Austin, you came
out talking about the, about dogs balls,

544
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,010
you know?
Yeah.

545
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,630
He's cutting up balls off and I
thought that's funny as shit. And I go,

546
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:49,380
that's true. You know, we got a dog and my
wife, so we got to get him fixed. I went,

547
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,280
can we let him have him tear off one piece
before it? She's like, no, no, no, no,

548
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,151
but I'm thinking about it.

549
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:57,200
You said it and I actually related to
that skit to somebody else and they're

550
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,260
like, so what's the deal? I was like, it
was funny as shit when he said it. Yeah.

551
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,960
That's like when I tried to play is
now Chris plays it. It sounds awesome.

552
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:09,060
Now it's like fuck.
Gives you the chills when I play,

553
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,970
it makes people go shadow off.
Oh God.

554
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,770
How much longer you have playing
like all, all of that stuff. So, uh,

555
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:20,580
so you Tommy and Stevie play
and then eventually, uh Huh.

556
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,590
So how long did you do jam
for? Like I know like, um,

557
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,180
I know I'm going through all this shit.
I'm,

558
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,590
I'm getting self conscious here that
I'm dragging you through the same. Nah,

559
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,500
that's okay. I haven't, you know,

560
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm going to try to ask
different questions and
everybody knows the story that

561
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:35,520
David Bowie stuff and all of that,
you know, David Bowie's, you actually,

562
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,970
would you mind telling the getting booed
and France thing just because people

563
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:42,040
know me for getting booed and Philly? No.
Ugh. Yeah. Got to tell you this. This was

564
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,920
Larry's cause the woman Lou Ann Barton,
I have to say it,

565
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:48,340
we fired her for the band for misconduct,
if you will.

566
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,890
And she gets a big record deal
from Jerry Wexler. Wait, wait,

567
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,190
where was she in the band? She was, yeah,

568
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,480
she was originally in double trouble for
just a little bit and she was the lead

569
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:01,480
singer. She's saying most
all of the material. Okay.

570
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,340
So she's out of the band.
She gets a deal with Jerry Wexler,

571
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,190
discovers her in New York, gets her
deal on Electra. She does this records,

572
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,580
get the muscle shoals rhythm section.
Uh, Don Frye sings all these,

573
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,780
all of these people come in. So went to
a record release comes to be, she goes,

574
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,950
she goes, you guys want to play my
record release party? I was like,

575
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,460
yeah, you let her go. Yeah, no, not right.

576
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,100
She didn't, did she do it out of spite
you think, you know? Hell, I don't know.

577
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,200
You know, maybe I could call
her and ask her, but um,

578
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,190
but were there playing and Jerry Wexler's
there and he's like out there dancing

579
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:39,880
and he says, great
band. Um, you know what?

580
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,770
You guys need to go to
Montreux Switzerland. He goes,

581
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,410
I'm going to call my friend Claude nobs.
I'm going to talk to him about all this.

582
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:48,070
Well, he does it short over a couple of
days later, we get an invitation to go.

583
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,630
I got a spot. We never been signed.
That kid was in Switzerland.

584
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:55,780
It wasn't in France now. Yeah, it was
Montreux Switzerland. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,420
All these years I thought it was
friends and, well, here we go. Okay.

586
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,010
So we go and we're the only electric band
on this night because he just slotted

587
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:06,340
us in because there was a time slot
and it's a jazz festival. Well,

588
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:08,400
you know [inaudible], he's speaking
Montreaux jazz. And if they come,

589
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,260
they'll call it international
music festivals.

590
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,690
It's kind of a mix of a lot of stuff. But
that night was all like Acoustic Blues,

591
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,710
upright and piano and guitar sitting
on stools and that kind of thing.

592
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,070
Traditional, traditional,
there's that word again.

593
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,090
We get up coming back to haunt you guys
to haunt us against. So we get up there,

594
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,760
we got all these electric instruments
and stuff and we start playing.

595
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,530
And people were like, you
think like, they're like,

596
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:33,880
they're sitting in a hurricane
or something. And they're
like, I think a pool,

597
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,060
you know, was like, and
we're like, shit, we plan.

598
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,510
I've seen that you can actually get
this on DVD. And, yeah, no it's,

599
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,100
and it's a bummer because, see where,
but birdwalk in Texas making like three,

600
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,820
four or $500 a gig and our man,

601
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,030
the owners of our management group
loaned us 15 grand to do this whole trip.

602
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,730
We mean we took everything over there
cause we can't be without our gear,

603
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:57,490
you know. Wow. Um, and we're,

604
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:00,790
we're sitting backstage and
Stevie looks at me, he goes, well,

605
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,240
I didn't think we sounded that bad.
I don't want, I didn't hate her.

606
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,040
And though it sounds like, yeah.
And they go, Eh, David Bell,

607
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,280
he would like to meet with you.
Ahmet which David Bowie.

608
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:16,780
And they went the Mr. David Bowie, the
accountant, the rockstars. David Bowie.

609
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:20,450
The wrestler. Yeah. And so
that's kind of how that started.

610
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,890
We were there another night. We played
downstairs, we didn't have a Gig,

611
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:28,330
we were just lolly gagging on this loan.
And so we, we play down in the musicians.

612
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:30,710
Bart's with Jackson Brown and
his guys came through and he say,

613
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:33,850
you're ever in La, you can
have my studio, which we did.

614
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,880
We just recorded some tapes and you know,
all this,

615
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,950
there was a whole bunch to the story,
but they just kind of sat there until we,

616
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,330
back to John Hammond said, hey,
Stevie's looking to do this thing,

617
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:46,530
but we got these tapes that we recorded
a legitimate types and he's in,

618
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,620
John Hammond was our, he was our, our
white knight. He was our champion.

619
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:51,360
He loved all of us.
He loved the band.

620
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:53,640
He thought Steve was one of the greatest
guitar players you've heard since

621
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:58,050
Robert Johnson. Wow. And he
went to, he went to epic, Sony,

622
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,550
epic, cvs. He is me. And there was a
guy there, Greg Geller, he said, Greg,

623
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,730
you need to sign these guys up. And
they said, yeah, I'll do it. He goes,

624
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:07,980
I'm getting ready to get fired anyway
because I'm going to reissue the whole

625
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:10,890
okay label cause it's been
out of circulation. They're
gonna fire me for that.

626
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:14,640
So I'll let them also far me for this.
And he did that and that's what happened.

627
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,010
And the record came
out. And, um, you know,

628
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:19,320
Stevie didn't go work with
Bowie after the record,

629
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:23,010
didn't do the tour and off
we were, you know, now you,

630
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,560
what I loved about that whole,
that whole watching

631
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,290
the concert footage of you guys when you
get booed there in Switzerland for all

632
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,040
these years,
I thought it was France,

633
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,570
is the fact that you could
see it affecting you guys.

634
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,260
Cause you guys would play the song and
then an end, the bu or whatever they,

635
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,010
they boo. And then,
but then when you guys,

636
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,850
you guys come one time he saw Stevie
shoulders kind of slump a little bit,

637
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:50,870
but the second he goes to do a song,
you count off the song you guys played.

638
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,560
You didn't hold back at all and he just
went just as hard. All you guys, uh,

639
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,540
if you didn't hear this,
that does the sound of the crowd,

640
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,900
you would think that the way you
guys were playing, that you would,

641
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,890
doing what you always did,
which was, was kill it.

642
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,630
And I got a lot of inspiration out of,

643
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,660
out of watching that I'm just doing
what I do or are auditioning herself.

644
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,400
You know the,
sometimes I get these acting gigs,

645
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,250
I got to do some crazy stuff that I'm
sitting there and you had going like,

646
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:20,120
oh my God, this is outside my comfort
zone. And like seeing stuff like that,

647
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,790
it's just like,
just plow through this.

648
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,310
Um, fuck them. You know what,

649
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:29,330
that was inspirational to me because I
learned something there and I saw it in

650
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:33,860
action. It wasn't told to me is that
he had this passion and commitment.

651
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:37,100
He was sitting over there on the couch
playing the guitar or he'd have, he put,

652
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,100
he put the same thing into it as he is.

653
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,230
He would if we were playing for over
100,000 people because that's just how he

654
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:46,040
lived. And I'm like, man, that's a great
example. You know, cause like, yeah,

655
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,350
I kind of do this. I'm going to
see when the stakes get higher.

656
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:51,860
I'll kind of put a little bit more juice
into that kind of wishy washy and as he

657
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:55,250
was like full on 110% all the time.

658
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,060
So when you guys are riding on a tour bus,
when he's noodling around,

659
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:01,610
it sounds like he's already
playing the show. Yeah,

660
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:04,850
because he's got the same passion and
the focus and the commitment to what he's

661
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,850
doing as he's not
performing. You know? I mean,

662
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:11,120
he's not jumping to been incredible
to be as awesome as, I mean, you know,

663
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:14,690
like I was spoiled right off the bat.
You know, it's like I go, you know,

664
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:18,380
this is early in my career and I was 20
I talked to Mitch Mitchell about this,

665
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,480
about the, you know, the death
of Jimmy Hendrickson is like,

666
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,500
it's a hard deal when you lose somebody
like that and you, you were, you come to,

667
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,010
in my case, I came to go, you know, I was
grateful that I had the whole experience.

668
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,540
I think it was a hard thing to lose,

669
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,400
but there were so many
things that I got from that.

670
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:34,790
Just simple lessons and you know, I
think they were in me, they'd been,

671
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:37,010
they'd been demonstrated but
they hadn't really taken root.

672
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,200
But when you live them and you got,
man,

673
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:42,640
this is a great way to be and you see
that you get the result on every level.

674
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,230
We're talking about money,
success.

675
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,940
Our success was that our
music was successful to us.
It meant everything to us.

676
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,940
We had a great time doing it
together and that you just go,

677
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,530
this is it's self evident
right now and you know,

678
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,200
and somebody leads that typically
somebody is there to show you something.

679
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,540
You Go, wow, you know what,
I dig that, that touch me.

680
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,110
That meant something and I'm going
to grab onto that and that's,

681
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,820
these are the great things in life.

682
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,760
And then unfortunately you
don't really fully know

683
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,480
realize it after they just,
this the profoundness of losing somebody.

684
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:18,070
I lost a great friend of Patrice O'Neal
a few years ago and he was the guy like

685
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:21,970
I would compare like he was like Stevie
Ray Vaughan level guy accepted when like

686
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,840
stand up and um, you know,
you just don't expect him.

687
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:27,220
He was like 41 years old.

688
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:30,130
You're not thinking that this is going
to be the last time I get to see him

689
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:33,160
perform and, and that type of
thing. So it ends up having a,

690
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,860
when you really go back and examine
the whole x basically experienced,

691
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:40,030
because I don't know if
Stevie was the same thing,

692
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,970
like being friends with Patrice
was beyond being friends with them.

693
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:44,370
It was like it you,

694
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:49,060
you walked out in public with him
and him just messing with people.

695
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:51,590
Was this experience that like I,
I,

696
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,880
I've tried to tell the stories on the
podcast and try to explain what it was

697
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:58,960
like. You just can't, when
you're around that level of, uh,

698
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,900
artists or just,
just greatness.

699
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,030
I know their words
where there on for Zena.

700
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,590
But that's that thing that you don't know
what you got until it's gone. You know?

701
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:11,530
It's Cliche as hell, but it's
true. You know? That's why
it sticks. It's like, man,

702
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:13,000
that was fabulous.

703
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,320
Yeah. I learned that awful
lesson that like, you're like
your friends, that's like,

704
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,020
I can't explain that the
friendship is not yours. It's like,

705
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,910
it's like this thing that's given to you
and you just have to enjoy it and then

706
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,170
you got to be enjoying it because it's
just taken away or it goes in a different

707
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,720
direction, whatever you want to say. And
then you just kind of left there like,

708
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,860
you know,

709
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,100
well, you know, living in the moment,
being able to actually live in the moment,

710
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,240
I don't know,

711
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,720
to be grateful for your surroundings
cause we can get you don't get on my pity

712
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:46,590
party and all this shit and go back to
my Catholic guilt and shame and all like,

713
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,650
ah, you know, you know, and I mean
it's true. I mean Stevie, I was like,

714
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:53,010
when after he died I was like, God,
that guy really meant a lot in my life.

715
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:57,090
And I go half the time I
wanted to strangle him and
I go, we were like brothers,

716
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,910
like the Bro, you know, he was like a
brother. I never had, he had a brother,

717
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:03,210
you know, a real brother and, but I
go, you know, it was, it's everything.

718
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,280
It's always everything.
There's the, our, our,

719
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,920
our perception of the good
and the bad or whatever it is.

720
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:11,640
But essentially it's like I go,
everything was wonderful.

721
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,020
It was life and it was really wonderful.
I always wondered like, that's the time,

722
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,540
like, you know, the loneliness
of being a comedian on the road.

723
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,990
But whenever I hear stories of yeah,

724
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,160
hands, you know, being in a van
together, just traveling and,

725
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,170
and you know, just all the
shit that you guys go through.

726
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:31,020
Like I've traveled with other
comedians and stuff and there's like,

727
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,230
there's that thing where you just have
to, after a while it'd be like, okay,

728
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,990
this is going to be, the guy is going
to be the addict. There's going to be,

729
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:40,810
the Pussy Hound is going
to be the ego maniac.

730
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,830
The dude who's got to sleep til four,
like there's just going to be the end.

731
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:48,460
You got to understand that
you're that guy somehow,

732
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,320
but you can't see it
because you're in yourself.

733
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:53,830
So you're slowly something you are
doing that is annoying the shit out of

734
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,820
somebody else. And you have to somehow,
uh, like I gotta be honest with you,

735
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,190
like after a year, so of touring
with other comics and everything.

736
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:04,840
This past year I did a tour with
this comic Paul Versey and, um,

737
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,170
he's a New York guy. I'm a Boston guy.
What else? You always argue sports.

738
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,150
And we went up to,
uh,

739
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,740
toward all of Canada and we basically
spent every waking moment essentially with

740
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,080
each other for about 10 days.

741
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,120
And we never argued once and all I,
it was just through years of being,

742
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:25,380
he's also a really easy guy to get
along with, but we just, we had it,

743
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:27,640
we ended up having a couple
of inside jokes that we had,

744
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,020
which always seems bands always have
like inside jokes and you're on catch

745
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:36,010
phrases and we just kind of tore
through Canada making each other laugh,

746
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,880
uh, throughout the whole thing. And,
uh, and it wasn't until the end,

747
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:42,540
he actually first he actually mentioned,
he's like, dude, do you realize we've,

748
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:45,370
we've been,
we've done like 20 shows together,

749
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,220
taught all over this God Damn Tundra.
We haven't argued once. And I was, ah,

750
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:51,700
you know,

751
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,240
I didn't even notice that we're doing
this stupid fake crying thing that was

752
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:58,090
just making each other laugh.
Just saying over the top sensitive stuff.

753
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:01,690
Like I just really liked he was a
friend. Oh, it's that dumb shit. Oh,

754
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,150
we had all that stuff. Just kept
you going. Then you have the wheel.

755
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,490
We had like these alternate
personalities when we,

756
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:10,420
when we realized that we were like really
going insane on each other. You know,

757
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:15,400
mom was Harold as, oh, he called
me and I would watch hell would do.

758
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:19,470
And I go, I don't know what you
do and Brady in the Brady Boyd,

759
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,360
you should trying to have a
good Tom, you know, and we get,

760
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,410
and we would actually stay
in these characters for like
an hour. I'm going, God,

761
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:29,320
how sick Arlene.
And then we come out of them.

762
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:33,220
We could actually live with
our circumstances because
you know, it gets tight.

763
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,330
You know, you're there. You realize like
not only is that genius comedically,

764
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:40,600
that's also if I had some sodas,
you know, psychology background,

765
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:45,400
that's also probably red flags of slowly
going insane. No, I am insane. I'm,

766
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,460
I'm, I think I've been actually somewhat
restored to sanity, but you know,

767
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:52,780
I'm still working on it. Right. That all
goes to the seven deadly sins, you know,

768
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:55,690
and tried to sort it out over
your bill. Oh, I know. Jesus.

769
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,390
Don't even talk to me
about those. What, what is,

770
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,490
what's the longest time you
ever spent out on tour? Oh,

771
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,300
shout because you guys like people
always to say to Comedians, hey,

772
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:06,610
you're doing a tour a year on
tour. And it's like, you know,

773
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:09,430
the most I'll ever be gone as a
week and a half, maybe two weeks.

774
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,810
But you guys lets it. Yeah.
Gotcha. And all I gotta do,

775
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,830
all they gotta do is, yeah, let's
deal with the insanity, my own mind.

776
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,720
I don't have to deal with other people's,

777
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,900
like once you kind of figure yourself out,
you know,

778
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,380
when you can kind of see
what demons you give into.

779
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,180
And of course you got to ride that for
a while and keep fucking up and running

780
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,190
to the brick wall.
But then hopefully you grow from it.

781
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,070
You can kind of manage your
own a little bit, but you

782
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,640
guys like, I mean how many
fucking bands out there I did,

783
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,890
they broke up and then they needed to
get back together for money and they get

784
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:42,560
back together from money and within six
months they go right back to where they

785
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,080
were emotionally 30 years earlier.

786
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,930
And I got a whole thing on
that but I won't get into that.

787
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,660
But to answer your question,
um,

788
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:55,010
we never came off the road and using
double trouble isn't the answer to the

789
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:58,580
question. You know, when Texas flood
came out and we started touring,

790
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,960
we were like for nine years
we virtually never came home.

791
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,690
I mean I'd go out for it,
we'd go out for like two months.

792
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:09,090
I come home for like four days and go
to Europe for like five weeks and kill

793
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,180
like a week. How do you pay your bills?
How do you pay your taxes? You know,

794
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,730
while I had a business manager and
account and I've got a great wife at home,

795
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,750
I've been married for 29 years and she
kept the whole household together and she

796
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:25,370
was all right with you being on guns. I
think she's know she'd be like, uh, great,

797
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,890
your home. And then like a few days and
she goes, when are you leaving again?

798
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,310
You know, I'm like, no, it was good. That
was awesome. My wife, she'll be like,

799
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,580
can you be doing stand up tonight?
Yeah.

800
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,360
Usually when there's a TV show on that
she wants to watch and I sit down and I

801
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,700
can't keep my mouth shut. I'm literally
like a five year old and I sit down. I,

802
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:43,400
I'm either going to be making noise,

803
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,220
doing something or I'm going
to be talking to the TV,

804
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:50,900
like it's a person and uh, like,
I don't know. Do you find like,

805
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,930
do you get like scatterbrained if you
go on the road too long and you finally

806
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:56,570
get, can't like shut it
off? Oh, well yeah. I mean,

807
00:42:56,571 --> 00:43:00,650
it happens both ways for me because when
I come home, you know, like she said,

808
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:03,690
I was just talking to her, my wife
Betty, she said she's, you know,

809
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,590
it's apparently been nice since
you've been gone, you know,

810
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,820
and you know what she says that with
all the love and are hard because I get

811
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,130
home and I'm like bouncing all
over the place and she's, you know,

812
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,370
everybody gets their own life.
Everybody has their own. I see.

813
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,890
Like you run back into the house and
they're like, Hey, I'm home. And they go,

814
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,830
oh hang on a minute. Yeah. Then
a different vibe going on here.

815
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:25,130
Since you've been gone let you try to
like assimilate back into the general

816
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,620
culture, you know, other than it's my
kingdom and I'm busting it, you know,

817
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,590
so no, I get it. You know, since I
mean it works, you know, you don't,

818
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,550
you know what I've always,

819
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,530
I think instinctively know that I've
needed to have with my house is I need a

820
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,720
room over the garage. And I feel like
when I come home and it's almost like,

821
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,320
you know,

822
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,700
if you have like the Benz except you're
coming off the rose and they just send

823
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:53,450
you into that room and you got a TV,
you've got something to work out,

824
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:54,590
like an elliptical machine,

825
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:58,760
just something and you gotta like
just slowly ease your way back into

826
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:03,100
civilization. Bill, I'm not
one, I highly recommend that.

827
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,410
That very thing you just described.
It works pretty well.

828
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,240
Well let's hear about it.
What isn't it?

829
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,680
Well I've got another house in
Austin and I've got my studio there,

830
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,610
so I go over there and do my thing when
I'm referring to at least have a place

831
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:20,270
in the country outside of Austin had a
guest house studio that was about 150

832
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:23,600
feet from the main house.
So when I come back I'd go over there.

833
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,300
That's where did all my workout at a
pool outside now go swim and you know,

834
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,980
do my thing. So that kind of
like go there, go to the house,

835
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,020
stay there or go to the,
you know,

836
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,780
it was right to not just kind of like,

837
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,910
just be like a truck busting through
the wall coming home. I know strangers,

838
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,310
that's your own damn house. I know
that's my take on it. You know,

839
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,990
you could hear the other side to
see if it go he's full of Shit.

840
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:46,320
That's not how it worked. But if
that's how I saw it and that's what I,

841
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:48,480
that's how I used it.
Well let me,

842
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:50,900
I'm going to ask you a couple of
questions here. See what we get.

843
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:55,170
We got left here, cruising along here.
Um, so maybe a couple break it up for you.

844
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:58,020
Some non musical questions.

845
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:01,410
Cause I'm sure obviously
people have actually the same
damn questions I've asked

846
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:05,010
you. Uh, I saw this thing in the news.
My listeners were asking me about it.

847
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:08,310
There's this billionaire is getting
a divorce, right? He married,

848
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,930
he married this woman.
He had a company,

849
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,240
it was worth like 50 million
bucks in a oil company.

850
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,240
They've been together for 20
something years. They get a divorce.

851
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,010
He writes her a check for
just under a billion dollars.

852
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,610
Who was 990 something million or
980 something million, something,

853
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:26,970
something in like 31 cents,
something crazy. They had worked out.

854
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,500
He writes her the check,

855
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,360
the check for almost a billion dollars
and she turned it down. Who says, I don't,

856
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,980
I don't know from Texas. They might be,
they might be. Her thing is that he's,

857
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:42,810
his company's worth 20 million bucks
now and she's only getting $1 billion.

858
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,490
She's entitled to more because she helped
support him through all of those years.

859
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,670
What, what, what, what is your,
uh, he got rubbing your head.

860
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,020
What is your take on that?
Oh,

861
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:55,050
I had a friend who got divorced when Tom
and he said, God dangit. He goes, my wife,

862
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:59,520
he goes, you know what? Here's, here's
the deal. He goes, she goes, she told me,

863
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:00,300
she goes,
what's,

864
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,300
what's your hours is mine and what's
mine is mine and what's yours is mine and

865
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:08,760
maybe more so like, oh, I
don't know. I mean, what,

866
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:11,370
why did they think I wish I should
have had a female on this? Like,

867
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,050
why do they like,

868
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,520
you know what I feel when I look at that
thing that is not even about money. No,

869
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:18,460
it's not.
It's,

870
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,600
it's like Kevin Spacey's thing on House
of cards when he turns towards the

871
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:26,320
camera and he says sex is about
everything other than sex. You know,

872
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:30,300
y'all are going, it's not really a dye
can't put dollars and cents on a really.

873
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:34,200
But when all that deep,
they want you to feel pain.

874
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,550
And the thing about it,

875
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:38,390
you know what I think this guide that I
think the reason why she didn't take big

876
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,460
take that money is because that
guy fucked up. First of all,

877
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:45,300
they showed the check on TV cause
eventually she cashed it because she had,

878
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:48,670
she needs money to live,
which is hilarious. Um,

879
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,760
it's like you've got enough money to
live 10 20 lifestyles the way Mc hammer

880
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:58,640
lived. Yeah. He could actually, she
could actually save Oakland, um,

881
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,060
with that kind of money. But
he, uh, she, this dude just,

882
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:04,220
he wrote it on like a personal,

883
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,290
it wasn't even like on like a being like
a business checks, a little bit longer,

884
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,410
bigger sums.

885
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:12,780
This guy took it out on just like some
regular like eat the same checkbook if

886
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,930
you live in let's two week,
that's insulting a little.
And that's what he did.

887
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,310
And he wrote her name and just went
scribble, scribble, scribble a tear.

888
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,510
Here you go. And I imagined she walked
out and was just like, wait a minute.

889
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,300
So that's it. So I get it. I
mean, I know I've got $1 billion.

890
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,160
This motherfucker has billion dollars.
He's

891
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,020
all this shit.
He's ugly.

892
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,100
But with that money he's going to be
able to get himself a hot piece that will

893
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:37,780
at least pretend to like him.

894
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,840
He's got enough money for
every Ferrari on the planet.

895
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,670
I was like another billion
coming down the road to me. Yeah.

896
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:47,380
Like this guy is not going to
feel any sort of pain whatsoever.

897
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,950
I'm not okay with that.
So everybody is watching this going,

898
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,810
this woman is a gold digging whores and I,
I think it has to do,

899
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,000
not a whore gold digger, but like I
think it has to do more with a emotion.

900
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, we lost everything. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, I, that's, I mean,

901
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:04,120
I don't know anything other
than if my wife divorced me,

902
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:08,560
I guess she's been by me for a years ago
and I mean, if it was something like,

903
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:11,770
you know, Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned. I don't know what the guy did.

904
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:15,330
I don't know anything about any of
that. But I go, if she felt really like,

905
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,030
like I had done something to go, she like,
Hey, I've been here for years, you know,

906
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,040
supporting this thing. Right.
You know, that's my time.

907
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,190
I can only speak to my own
personal experience. I had never,

908
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,540
and I'm not in divorce, I'm happily
married and thank God for that.

909
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:32,260
I'm grateful that I am. But you know, I
don't know. I mean, you know, I don't,

910
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:33,910
I don't know what all
that means other than,

911
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,620
than feelings have no real
pressure on them. Or they do.

912
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,430
Maybe they do and it's not enough.
You know,

913
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,770
he should have let her down easy or God,

914
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,340
he should've just fake cried
as he was riding it. Be just,

915
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:52,570
he should have shown some sort
of pain and he didn't, uh,

916
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,160
he probably sat with his eyebrows up and
you know, looking through. It was dumb.

917
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:00,640
Reading glasses. How much you watch. I'll
throw in another million. There you go.

918
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,960
All right sweetheart. See you.
That's what I don't know. Yeah,

919
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,160
it's great that you've been married
for how long? 29 years. 29 years.

920
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:13,450
That's amazing. Can you pay you just to
keep it going? Yeah. Yeah. So far so good.

921
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,090
I did bring you something cause I thought
bill is going to want to talk about

922
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:19,900
football. So I got you a little cookie
today. I know. We are actually a,

923
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:24,100
I gotta check to study. Got
me Cook because he knows that
I bake. I know. Yeah. No,

924
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:28,930
that's that thing too. Yeah. Oh
it's the shape of a little football.

925
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:32,020
But Mike, we got to get a picture
of this. I got to tell you,

926
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,100
this is the most adorable thing
another man has ever gone.

927
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,380
Larry, are you a big football
fan? No. You brought, no,

928
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,150
that's why I brought you the
cookie because they'll thought,

929
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,750
and I actually broached the subject.
I go, you know I'm, I've been,

930
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm a Green Bay fan. She says,
people in Texas here, there,

931
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,000
I liked green bay because they're
owned by the people in Green Bay.

932
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,990
I love that idea. That's a great
answer. I love that answer. I love that.

933
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:58,120
It's not the billionaire that
cause I'm going to buy me my,

934
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:01,360
my own team or whatever. That's
fine too. But I love that.

935
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,020
I breakfast her one morning and the fry
cooks like, yeah, I own like a share.

936
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:08,500
I was like, right on man. He goes, I'm
a route and forum going. I love that.

937
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,950
But how does that work? He owns
a share, but it's not like a,

938
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,580
they call them up and be like, how much
money should we give Aaron Rodgers?

939
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:20,440
I only know says this. I
Dunno. I Dunno, but saw, yeah,

940
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,940
he might want to talk about
football and you know,

941
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,560
I love a good football game as much as
anybody because I was at Starbucks and

942
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:29,720
I'll look down, I saw the football
cooking ware. That's for Bill Burr.

943
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,760
I'm going to get him a cookie.
You're always going with your gut.

944
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,730
This is ridiculous, man. I can't believe
that you're doing my podcast. And he goes,

945
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:41,420
you brought me a cookie and then
you brought me, uh, you know, I,

946
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:45,110
last time I saw you when you were
playing the Greek Kenny Wayne Shepherd a,

947
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:48,920
I brought you my uh,
my Carnegie Hall Album,

948
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,760
which you guys played, right?
Hey, you guys bought the
Mariachi suits. That's the,

949
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,070
I know a little bit about your band,

950
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,860
but I think I'm going to give him that
suit to the rock and roll hall of fame

951
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:58,940
because we just got inducted.

952
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,540
We're going Stevie Ray Vaughan and double
trouble or being stuck right this year.

953
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,550
And they called about some stuff.
I thought I was thinking about the,

954
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,010
you get that suit that I played it.

955
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,540
I had made Jesus that took
them long enough on it. It's
beyond me. I don't know.

956
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:12,800
You know what we did?
We stopped doing that.

957
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:16,740
We see what we were doing 25 years ago and
somebody said, hey, guess what? I'll go,

958
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,100
the people did it. The people who
vote in the, in the, in the, in the,

959
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:24,260
the general public gave us 18 and a half
million votes. If you talked to Tommy,

960
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:26,060
do you guys think, yeah, you
guys going to play when you,

961
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,180
and yet we're going to play. Who, uh,
who are you going to get to sit in?

962
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,950
That's secret.
Now we don't know where it's,

963
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:35,490
we're still kind of sorting all that
out. We don't know. Exactly, seriously.

964
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,300
You know,
you guys had the respect of everybody.

965
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:42,290
So I would think that all the usual
suspects that you guys played for and then

966
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:47,280
some, there's some suspicious people
out there. Hey, I got that GME. Yes,

967
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,590
Eric. Well, there's all, you know, we
know we, we know all these people. And so,

968
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,300
you know, when I would think there's
all these younger players, yeah,

969
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,520
I would want to John Mayer and
those guys would want to come. Uh,

970
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,630
I bet you would think just
a test testament to the
music that you guys put out.

971
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,050
Um, they would all want to play
with you. So what do I got here?

972
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,530
So I was just mentioning that
I gave you my, uh, on vinyl,

973
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,740
my album from a Carnegie hall.

974
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,530
Now you brought me Stevie Ray Vaughan
and double trouble trouble, uh,

975
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:19,130
Texas hurricane. This looks like there's
like 10 records and you know, well,

976
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:22,080
let me tell you why. Look set me.
Tell you why that's so big. Um,

977
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:27,140
it's funny because I had, I saw that sit
in my studio and you gave me that vinyl.

978
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:28,310
I'm uh, yeah, I'm just,

979
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,520
I'm going to take that to him
because of what we've talked about.

980
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,520
And that right there is a 200 gram vinyl
of are the definitive box set that's,

981
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,640
those are 45 rpm disk.

982
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:43,550
So it doesn't get any better than
that unless she were in the studio,

983
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,990
which they're all 45. No, no. It's a no,
it's a regular 12 inch like an album,

984
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:52,580
but it spins it 45 rpm. That's why
there's so much so many disks in there.

985
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,360
Oh my God. Now, so what does that do?
Does that make the sound quality? Yeah,

986
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,550
it's better than 33 and a third.

987
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,250
I love this as this is shit cause I don't
know any of that. No. You know what?

988
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,010
You put that on your stereo in, in,
in whatever you liked about our music.

989
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:10,730
It, there's no way that it can sound
any better than what's in that box.

990
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,280
And that's for sale. I mean that's
that. We just came out with that.

991
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,320
You can get those wherever,
wherever they,

992
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,070
where you can buy vinyl or
acoustic sounds and Salina, Kansas,

993
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,430
you can get the suboxone and
33 and a third or 45 rpm.

994
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:26,030
The 45 rpm is like the cream of
the crop. All right, so I gotta I

995
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,230
got, I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say that this is going to be a

996
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:31,050
collector's item at some point. I can't
believe that you gave this to me minutes.

997
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,220
All I gave you was I didn't pay much
for it. Only blood, sweat do I gave you,

998
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:38,180
I gave you a bunch of Shit and
Dick Jokes on a record. High Man.

999
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,720
Exquisite sound by the way.
I want it to be a comedian.

1000
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:46,530
When I was a kid I wanted to
be a comedian. Is that right?
Yeah. People said, well,

1001
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:47,790
you're already a smart ass.

1002
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,540
Maybe you can actually say something
intelligent and turn that into, you know,

1003
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,060
real comedy that you go, Oh, did you
like when you were growing up? Oh,

1004
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:57,990
well you know, let's talk
comedy here, Chris. Well, you
know, I like Richard Pryor.

1005
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:02,010
Love Jonathan Winters. Did you ever get
to see prior in concert? No, I didn't.

1006
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,160
Did you see Jonathan Winters?
No. I saw him on TV and you know,

1007
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,900
the tapes and whatnot. George Carlin.
George Carlin was like heavy. Yeah.

1008
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,710
Um, yeah, he was probably the most, uh,

1009
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,290
and I don't know,

1010
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,930
I'm trying to think of anybody that
was more prolific as far as it did.

1011
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:21,990
It did stand up like all these guys
now who are just putting out special,

1012
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:24,060
special, special man. I'm
trying to do it too was a,

1013
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,410
that's all he was the one that showed
that that was possible. That every two,

1014
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:32,210
three years, you know, you could, I mean,

1015
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,700
you can't come up with an hour like his
button. I mean, it was possible to have a,

1016
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,470
a at least an hour that was special
worthy, that was worthy of being, uh,

1017
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:46,110
recorded. Um, I dunno man, like,
uh, that guy for me was, you know,

1018
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,760
for me it was always,
it was prior Carlin Cosby Kinison.

1019
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,240
Uh, then all those older guys that
I watched with my dad foster Brooks,

1020
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,410
Martin and Lewis Shecky
Greene election fuck up.

1021
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,210
You know who I loved that I stumbled
upon. Um, over the Christmas break. You,

1022
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:07,070
have you ever seen a, it's a mad, mad,
mad, mad world. Yes. Long time ago. Yeah.

1023
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,890
I, that's one of my favorite movies and
every once in a while I got to own that

1024
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,230
thing for some reason I don't own it.
And I saw a,

1025
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,230
I watched it and there's a guy in there,
this comedian,

1026
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:18,200
Dick Shawn addiction on nine.

1027
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:22,530
Dick Shawn plays the guy that he thinks
somebody is doing something bad to his

1028
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:24,060
mother and he's driving,
he's trying to,

1029
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,370
he's trying to catch Milton Berle and
there's a clip of him that just when he's

1030
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:33,510
dancing with this woman and just the
over the top emotion of him. And uh,

1031
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:36,960
I watched some of his standup and he was
really kind of ahead of his time with

1032
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:41,130
like the physicality,
the repeating and like the cadence,

1033
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:43,140
the way he performed his stuff.

1034
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,780
And it kind of from when I was
able to read up on the guy,

1035
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:50,760
he was like a comic's comic, never quite
hit the, uh, the mainstream. And uh,

1036
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,160
had a really crazy, uh, when he died,

1037
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:56,800
he actually died on stage
doing a gig down, uh,

1038
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,360
one of the colleges down in San Diego
and he's literally on stage and you know,

1039
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:03,490
he was doing a bunch of physical stuff,
making people laugh. And then he had a,

1040
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,100
he had a heart attack,

1041
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,540
did like a face plant and he's just
lying there and people feel like three

1042
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:13,350
minutes. That was part of
the act. It sounds like a
drummer death certain oh yeah,

1043
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,280
yeah. I'm under a number of
drivers of diet on stage.

1044
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,250
You thought there's a reason for that?
Oh, I don't know, man. Got Shot, you know,

1045
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:25,530
I know there's a good shot on stage.
I'll he got shot up. No, no, no, no,

1046
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:28,980
no. Um, I thought he got shit
done. No, no, no, no. Sorry.

1047
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,230
Okay.

1048
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,700
Oh, now I'm confused on, into the memory
banks. No, there was nothing there. Um,

1049
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,090
he sounded like me right now.
No, I'm so serious. Like, Oh,

1050
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,700
who got shot and who just
died of a heart attack? Um,

1051
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,880
a guy in Canada play with a
friend of mine. He did die
in the middle of the show.

1052
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:49,750
He turned around, he said, he said,
hey, come on man. Pick up the beat.

1053
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:52,360
And the guy kept slowing down. All of
a sudden everything came crashing down.

1054
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:56,350
The guy like just died. Oh God.
Was he a big guy? He was a big guy,

1055
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,990
but he fell into the drum kit and it,
he hit the guy in the back of the legs.

1056
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:03,991
All of a sudden there was no music come
who got shot on stage was the comedian

1057
00:57:04,061 --> 00:57:09,000
and the lugs that death go
out. I'll laugh. Something,

1058
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,580
you know, that's an age falling into
a drum. Kits are always fun I guess,

1059
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,800
unless you don't get back up.
But uh,

1060
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,720
I don't know why I spun
it in that direction,

1061
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:18,970
but basically the guy was laying
there and people yell, no, you know,

1062
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,780
take his wallet thinking he was
just joking with the guy was yeah,

1063
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:25,480
it was literally dying right in
front of them. So, all right,

1064
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:30,310
so I slogged you through all your old
stuff. You were a sport about it. What's,

1065
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:34,100
uh, what do you got? You got the
Stevens still thing coming up, but we,

1066
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,730
where can we see, where can people
see you live? The man that, uh,

1067
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,870
hadn't knows an endless
way to play a shuffle.

1068
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,240
You know what I should tell
it should have had that ready.

1069
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:45,880
I didn't know you'd ask that. I'm
going to be done. So it's funny,

1070
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,940
all great artists never know where the,
where they're going to be.

1071
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,940
The worst promoters ever.
So good.

1072
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:55,240
If you're a hack coming in here
and I swear to God you would have,

1073
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:56,340
you'd have it all.
You would,

1074
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:00,670
you would have handed me a one sheet of
all the bullet points that you wanted to

1075
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:04,480
hit a, I'm telling you, well,
lump bullet it out. Do you have,

1076
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,550
do you have an idea of when
you're touring again? Yeah. Well,

1077
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:07,830
there's something to do.
A few shows in,

1078
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,990
in early February out here with Kenny
Wayne Shepherd over going to be in the

1079
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:14,860
southern, the La area. I think
we're doing a Gora. Okay. Uh,

1080
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:19,270
the Canyon Club are doing, who's that?
Who's that? That keyboard player young.

1081
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:22,360
But he looked like Burton young.
That was hilarious.

1082
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,450
One with somebody called me up in the,
and I listened to that and I was like,

1083
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,470
his name is Riley Osborne.
Riley Osborne,

1084
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,660
greatest keyboard player I ever saw him.
He's awesome.

1085
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:36,220
I call him the Humphrey Bogart of
piano. I mean, he's like, yeah. Yeah.

1086
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:40,630
Who said that about me? I said, Bill
Barry goes, it was a Fox that I go,

1087
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,320
he's a comedian. He goes Murray Young. He
was, I guess I kind of do look like him.

1088
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,770
Oh God, I already pissed the guy. I
just waste, he's pissed off anyway,

1089
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:53,170
so it's okay. When I love was when
he was his time to take a solo.

1090
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:57,560
Just how he just went in so many
different just effortlessly. It just I,

1091
00:58:57,561 --> 00:58:59,890
I don't know, just watching
you. One of my favorite thing,

1092
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,560
not only to watch a great musician is the,

1093
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:05,210
that extra added that he makes
it look like he's not even,

1094
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:08,800
they're not even trying and I was
watching you the way you will play in the

1095
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:12,720
shuffle and just the whole thing that
you were doing like just always been a

1096
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,100
trans fixed.
Some of the stuff that I loved,

1097
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,980
wish I could hear you play more as like
the some of the jazz drum he did on

1098
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:19,390
stank swaying and that type of thing.

1099
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:22,790
It's like you really had
and what was great. That was
all the licks that you had,

1100
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,830
knowing that you had those in the bag,

1101
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:27,470
but you played for the song
on a lot of those other ones.

1102
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:31,130
We just played straight and sit back and
let Stevie, you know, run with it. It was,

1103
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,240
I don't know, I've just tremendous amount
of respect for you, uh, as a musician.

1104
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:38,570
And now as I'm starting to get to know
you obviously as a person and I hope that

1105
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:40,430
I'm going to be able to get
out to Austin this year.

1106
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,480
I might be going out there and March for
south by southwest to promote the all

1107
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,660
things comedy network here and a,
if you're around,

1108
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:51,890
if you'd like to come out to the
show, uh, you know, come on down.

1109
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,040
The only stipulation is you got to bring
your Shelby. I want to see it. Okay.

1110
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:57,710
That can be arranged because I'd be done.
All right. All right. But everybody,

1111
00:59:57,711 --> 01:00:01,610

1114
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,120
All right. Hey, you didn't
go anywhere, did you?

1115
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,620
I'm still here with Chris late
and I forgot to bring something.

1116
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:15,560
And this is the first Monday
morning podcast epilogue,

1117
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:20,150
just like the old streets of
San Francisco. Uh, you also
brought me a jar of Lard,

1118
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,230
pure pork leaf lard. Keep
refrigerated. What is this a,

1119
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:28,910
what is behind this? I brought it to
you because I saw your pie crust. Oh,

1120
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:33,740

the track, the old school train,

1121
01:00:33,741 --> 01:00:36,170

pastry. And I, you know,

1122
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,980

but somebody as a chef steel,

1123

1124
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:46,790
When you make your pie crust and you
can fry fried chicken in it or whatever,

1125
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,870
you know, it's awesome. And this
is called Dai de Doo. It's dyed Ui.

and stuff. Who processed. Do Di do a,
