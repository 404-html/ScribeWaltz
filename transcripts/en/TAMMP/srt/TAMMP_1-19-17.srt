1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,740
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast data.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,830
Just checking in on you.
Ah,

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,540
just checking in on your week.
How's it go?

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:21,640
One hour you're slogging
your way through another one,

6
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:25,720
settling in to 2017 as it had been.

7
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:29,740
Everything that you expected so far,
are you still going to the gym?

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,920
Have you have or are you sticking with
your, I'm not going to take the bait,

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,530
you know, with your, your,
whatever the fuck you're
dating, whatever you're rent to,

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,370
whatever you have led into
your fucking apartment.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,350
Be it a flat, a one bedroom
of fucking a studio. I mean,

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,670
or a fucking maybe got a little house,
you know?

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,760
Do you know that's one of the
top reasons people get a house.

14
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,190
It's because they fall in love with
somebody and the only way to keep it going

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,240
is there has to be another room
for you to walk into. You know,

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,280
there has to be a door that you
could walk through and close. See,

17
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:16,570
you just can't see the person. Even if he
can hear him. You just need that space.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,100
That's what it is,

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,140
which really shows you what con's
super rich people are considering.

20
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:27,760
They have a fucking mansion,
you know, and it's still not,

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,950
it's still not enough
room for them to get away.

22
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:34,480
They get divorced left and
right. You know, or this is,
they go into another room.

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,970
Right. And, but there's
always somebody in there,

24
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,240
somebody's Dustin off of
vase or some shit. See,

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,270
you can't just have that alone time to
just go in there and just sort of yell,

26
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:49,030
whisper. Right. You can't do it.

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,870
Um, I wonder if your spouse ever
saw or your boyfriend, girlfriend,

28
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,100
whatever the fucking issue were to

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,310
ever saw a highlight reel of the shit
that you said when you got into your car

30
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,230
after a fucking disagreement.
Um,

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,170
it would either be the funniest shit
I think with me and my wife would be

32
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:18,310
fucking hilarious. Uh, I think her shit
about me, we hilarious. Mine wouldn't be,

33
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,930
you know, you know, cause I'm angry
because I'm the guy. Cause what?

34
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:26,620
Cause we're always raw, you know,
according to those doctor Phil shows,

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,580
we don't have a fucking leg
to stand on. Um, anyways,

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,420
speaking of which, you
know what? I got to admit,

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,730
I actually watched three
days in a row of whale. Oh,

38
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,210
for Jan and I missed it last night.
And uh, I was actually upset.

39
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:46,660
I think I'm actually gonna put
that on my DVR to record the show.

40
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,490
There's just something so
mindlessly fun about that show.

41
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:55,630
He just sit there and you try to
yell the letters with them. Hey,

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,900
there's t um,

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,110
okay.

44
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,670
And jeopardy.
I'm telling you right now,

45
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,850
I'm so sick of people thinking that
people in jeopardy of fucking smart,

46
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:12,350
those people are nerds. Okay.
The book smart. No, nobody.

47
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:16,460
I've never seen one person on that show
look like they have any sort of a vision.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,020
Okay, you give him a fucking book.
Yeah, they're going to read it in a day.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,070
They're going to retain 80% of the
information and then some day, you know,

50
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,020
at a cocktail party or a game show,

51
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:29,150
they're going to puke it up
when you fucking go, Hey,

52
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:33,410
what's the capitol of fucking Tanzania?

53
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,670
That's even a country.

54
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,580
They'll fucking tell you what it
is and what the state bird is.

55
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,110
You know what I mean? They end the day,
know some shit about classical music.

56
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:45,830
They all his fucking trivial.
It's trivial shit to be honest with you.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,430
It's just shit. You know,
the only purpose for no one,

58
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,480
like 90% of the shit that they have on
that show, if you really think about it,

59
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:57,500
it just, it doesn't help
you in your life, you know,

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,670
depending on what you're looking to do.
I mean,

61
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,830
if you want to make like a
zillion dollars, it's like no one,

62
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,560
all that shit does not help
you. Like, wow, this guy knows,

63
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:09,460
or this woman knows a lot of
shit. Yeah, but what, what do,

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,520
what do you know about
you fucking baroque music?

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,560
You know,
you go to crossword puzzles,

66
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,223
I'm telling you,

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,770
you got to have a different kind of smart,

68
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:25,670
you got to have Donald Trump intelligence.
Okay?

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,620
And what you need to learn how to do
is you have to learn how to mobilize

70
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,620
morons.

71
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:34,963
You know,

72
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,770
and I'm not saying just because you
voted for Donald Trump, you're Maura,

73
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,690
but you know what I mean?
I'm talking about,

74
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,380
yeah,

75
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,950
I'm talking about the kinds of people
that would be excited if like Mayweather

76
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,900
fought Conor McGregor,
you know,

77
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,750
not seeing that for what
the fuck it's going to be,

78
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:57,751
which is basically about 12 people
vacuuming $100 a zillion people's pockets.

79
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,930
Why would you want to see that?
It's like that is a lose lose,

80
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,570
right? If they have that fight and
it's, it's going to be boxing only,

81
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,490
it's going to, it's over. If it's,
if it's going to be MMA rules,

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,550
Mayweather's going to lose.
It's going to be over in two seconds.

83
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,010
It's the stupidest fucking thing.
You know what it goes back to?

84
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,820
It goes back like that fight.
We'll, we'll, if that happens,

85
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,850
will be no different than when fucking
Bobby Riggs played tennis against Billie

86
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,760
Jean King.
At least he was a fucking tennis player.

87
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,563
You know,

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,290
I would say it'd be more like when
Muhammad Ali fought Lowel Zaida

89
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,280
that's not fair. Somebody compared to
a Muhammad Ali fought like the best,

90
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,480
you know, uh, Japanese
wrestlers in like 1976 now,

91
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,710
I'm assuming it was actually real
wrestling and not like the fake shit where

92
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,010
they still fucking break their necks. But
you know what I mean? The predetermined,

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,760
um, is it, was it Bobby Riggs? I
think that that was the guy's name.

94
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,160
The guy played bill fight a fight.
I mean,

95
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,380
fucking played tennis against
Billy Jean King. You know,

96
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:12,830
it was so fucking pathetic about that
is that was considered a big victory for

97
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,831
women that the best tennis female tennis
player in her fucking prime beat like a

98
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,870
fucking 57 year old former champion

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,130
is the thing though. He was winning
games. He actually didn't do that bad.

100
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,490
And then years later there
was stuff that came out,

101
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:36,450
said he was a degenerate gambler
and that he possibly, you know,

102
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,760
could have placed a bet on Billie Jean
King made it look good for a minute and

103
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:44,740
then fucking, I dunno
what someone is. Yeah,

104
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,540
buddy of mine was talking about that.
See the,

105
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,390
you know Dana Way off from both 25
million bucks. Of course he did.

106
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,860
Of course he did because he's going to
find 50 million fucking idiots to give

107
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,500
him a hundred bucks.
Um,

108
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,010
anyways. Yeah. What would you, you know,

109
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,660
would you want to see a baker get involved
in a, a cooking contest with, okay,

110
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:09,390
we're going to smoke meat today.
We've got a champion guy fucking,

111
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,270
and he's won every smoking the meat
comp I can contest. He's going against.

112
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:19,130
The Gal makes cupcakes.
They're both in the kitchen.

113
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,460
They're both making food.
But I guess the other guys outside,

114
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:25,460
you know what I mean? It's
just two completely different
fucking fix. All right.

115
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,750
Um, anyways, and that's
what Donald Trump did.

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,650
Donald Trump was able to fucking do that.
He got enough of them together.

117
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,980
And that's what you need to do. All
right. And I'll tell you right now,

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,190
I haven't yet to see a contestant on
jeopardy who can even remotely get the

119
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,690
mouth breathers.

120
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,770
They key to get the fucking heard moving
towards whatever cliff you'd want them

121
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:53,810
to fucking topple over. They
don't have it. You know,

122
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:58,490
just sitting there going like, uh,
you know, I'll take a, I dunno,

123
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,810
I'll take ancient Indian
construction for $700.

124
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,390
Uh, this structure was, uh, well,

125
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
one of the most popular for lack of a
plan was there in the 60. [inaudible].

126
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,280
What is a wigwam?
Uh,

127
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,310
let me get door hinges
from Switzerland Circa of,

128
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,030
uh,
Jesus crisis 32nd birthday for 200.

129
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,800
You're not going to fucking get anywhere
or maybe I'm just insecure when I watch

130
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:31,550
it. All right, let's go. Let's get, maybe
we're getting to the real shit here,

131
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,540
by the way. I have a Boston Detroit
came on in the fucking background.

132
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,470
You know what's hilarious as they just
showed a skyline and I think I saw the

133
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:43,100
casino I played right across
the fucking way, you know,

134
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:46,160
we had just into Canada.
You know,

135
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,080
um, Jesus Christ, the Bruins
play in the island is holy shit.

136
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,220
What a shit show that was.

137
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,040
That was one of the worst games I've seen
them play in a long, long fucking time.

138
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,850
Got smoked four to nothing and now much
of the Redwings and all of a sudden they

139
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,780
come out, they're ready to play.
And you got to ask yourself,

140
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,890
where is this night in and night?
Um,

141
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,980
I honestly didn't know.
They tearing down Joe Louis Arena.

142
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,780
They're saying this is the last
Bruins regular season game ever, um,

143
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,200
against, uh, against the Redwings here
at Joe Louis Arena. That's I, you know,

144
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:26,000
and I got a chance to go to that one. I
went to a, believe it or not, I went to a,

145
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,390
uh, red wings Penguin's game in, uh,

146
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,590
I don't know how many years ago.

147
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:36,480
And I quickly learned that you have to
sit back in that stadium if you fucking

148
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,760
lean forward and everyone
behind you has to lean forward.

149
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:42,870
It's like there was all these fucking
rules, but because I'm a considerate con,

150
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,880
I was able to figure it out by halfway,
you know,

151
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,520
halfway through the first period,
you know,

152
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,440
with people screaming at me from
behind and I was like, all right,

153
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,670
I get this shit,
I get it.

154
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,060
But it's just one of these
fucked up arenas where you
can't even stand up if you

155
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,830
stand up and applaud the play.

156
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,070
Half your head is blocking the TV
screen of whatever the TV camera.

157
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,570
Um, but anyways, I want to say this,

158
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,800
this'll be the third. This is the
second one they're going to get rid of.

159
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,680
And then the next one will be their third.
They played,

160
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,520
it was at Olympia or something like that,
which I have no recollection of really.

161
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,081
I don't think.

162
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,200
I think the first time I remember watching
the fucking Redwings was the early

163
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,240
eighties and I think in the late
seventies they get rid of that one.

164
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh see this is some, this right
here. This is some shit on jeopardy.

165
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,840
I'll take a arenas,

166
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,620
former arenas that sports
franchises played in.

167
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,110
What is county stadium? Excellent.
What does that get you in life?

168
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,330
You know,
when it gets you a kit,

169
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:48,930
you sitting in your fucking pajamas doing
a God damn podcast Thursday morning,

170
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,610
that's where it gets you. Um, so
anyways, I haven't been doing shit,

171
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,190
no kid yet. So you know,
we're coming right up on going
full term. So I think, uh,

172
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,540
you know, we're going to have to induce
or something like that. But either way,

173
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,910
most likely, you know, barring
some sort of like a miracle,

174
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,610
I should be dead next week. I think
it finally goes down that all right.

175
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,880
And then my whole perspective changes.
What are you guys going to do if I really,

176
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,140
you know, there's some people have
kids, they don't fucking change it all.

177
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,120
And then there's other people that have
kids they change, which I think is shit,

178
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,500
right? But what do you guys do if I
just fuck if I go off the fucking rails,

179
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,170
you know, I stopped Carson, I stopped
saying, can't, you know what I mean?

180
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,360
I find God,
I reevaluate everything.

181
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:47,010
That fucking remotely makes me funny.
Nothing,

182
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,760
nothing for a third time.

183
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:54,670
Not Robs of all your humor,

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,090
like finding your savior,

185
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,730
you know what I mean? All of a
sudden you give a shit about people,

186
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,830
you know,
you have empathy.

187
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,690
You put yourself in other
people's position. Yeah.

188
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,060
Okay.

189
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,680
Which is also known as empathy.

190
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,100
Now I've seen it. I've seen it in the
past. I've seen, I've just seen too,

191
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,870
I've seen musicians, I've seen Comedians,
I've seen all of that. They find God.

192
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,850
They get away from, what the fuck got
you. Got You to the God damn dance.

193
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,750
All right. It ain't happening
with me. I'm calling it right now.

194
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,690
What do you think? I'm, you think I'm
going to start reading? I will read what?

195
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:39,380
I become a dead. You know, I'm going to
read these kids' books. Whichever Deli.

196
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:43,550
I don't even, I don't even get, I guess
that Caterpillar One's a classic book.

197
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:45,770
I never saw.
I never saw that one when I was a kid.

198
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,940
I liked to make way for ducklings.
I like where the wild things are.

199
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay.

200
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,810
Um, and that was it. And that
was the two books. I liked it.

201
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:56,441
And then other than that,

202
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,420
I liked fucking football cards
and not doing my homework.

203
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,620
That's what I enjoyed. Hey Dad, what did
you enjoy most about your childhood? Uh,

204
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,640
blowing off the assignment and the
challenge of pretending that I did it.

205
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,650
Uh, the next day in class, that's
what I remember joining the most.

206
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:19,600
I like drawing on desks.
Uh, getting in trouble,

207
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,370
going down to the principal's office
with a friend was always fun by yourself,

208
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,540
was a lonely experience, you know, sitting
on that bench waiting to go in there.

209
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,610
William, come on in it for a second. Uh,

210
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,030
Ms, uh, [inaudible] as Sarah said
to you at tech and they do it,

211
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:40,590
I'll let shit you just,
you just standing there going like,

212
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,710
why are you talking to me?

213
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:45,070
Like I can actually plead my case and
you're going to be on my fucking say, oh,

214
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,230
I didn't look at it that way ever.
Evidently the teacher was wrong.

215
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,990
Just give me the fucking detention.
You fucking cunt.

216
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,780
You know, it's funny, when I really
looked back, my, uh, the principal,

217
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,690
vice principal and my school, he's a
gavel leash to dole out the punishment.

218
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:04,691
He used to dress like the geek squad
guys who upon seeing a hidden figures

219
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,450
dressed like he worked at NASA,

220
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,453
you know,

221
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,760
I don't fucking know. Anyways,
what am I talking about here?

222
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,490
Let's plow ahead all we got some
football this weekend yet that worded,

223
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,250
you know what,
one of the,

224
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,250
one of the dangerous things to do when
you're watching NFL playoffs is not to

225
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,810
realize while you're watching it,

226
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,540
that the NFL season is almost over you.

227
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,230
So fucking excited that it's the playoffs.
Who's going to win?

228
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,590
I said this, I said, dad,
dude, I called it. I got,

229
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,970
I fucking put my kids' college
education on the Pittsburgh Steelers.

230
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,310
What the point?
Fuck it.

231
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,133
Okay.

232
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,840
42, Detroit. I mean,
42 Bruins. God dammit.

233
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,410
We needed to get that next one out in the
second period. Uh, you know, you know,

234
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,660
I swear to God with
fucking hockey nowadays,

235
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,540
the second they got rid of the red line,
there's no lead that's safe.

236
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,990
Back in the day you went up three goals.
The fucking game was over.

237
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,650
There was going to be like a fucking bench
clearing brawl because the other team

238
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:10,340
knew that they weren't going to
win. Right. So they sell high. Well,

239
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,280
if we're not going to beat you will
beat the shit out of you. And that,

240
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:17,060
that was hockey. That was the
hockey that I remembered. Um,

241
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,650
yeah.

242
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,560
Now you go up three to nothing
and it's, you know, for candidate,

243
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,960
you can go up three to nothing
and you go into the third period,

244
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,520
you can still be going into overtime.
So it was three, nothing Bruins.

245
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,700
Then three to one, then four
to one, and now it's 42.

246
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,750
Okay.

247
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,130
Yeah. Jesus Christ. Anyways,
um, you know something,

248
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:41,100
I've been meditating so much,
uh,

249
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,050
I just been consistently not by lot that
actually losing my shit now feels weird.

250
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:49,620
It just felt weird to scream. Fucking
cut there. I wasn't really mad.

251
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:54,180
It was just upset. One of
those two things. The same
thing, Bill. You know what,

252
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,400
go fuck yourself. Uh, anyways.

253
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,480
Anyway.
Yeah.

254
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
So you're watching the NFL playoffs and
you forget because you're so fucking

255
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:08,370
excited that it's the playoffs and you're
going to get to see somebody, you know,

256
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,930
the best teams play each other.
Next thing you know,

257
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,750
it's the super bowl and he gets you.

258
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:19,170
He gets your first taste of
no fucking football. When, uh,

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,540
there's that break between the,

260
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,140
for whatever fucking reason between the,
uh,

261
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,380
the NFC and AFC gene games,
championship games, and the Super Bowl,

262
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:30,720
you get that first Sunday that comes by,
you know,

263
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,770
back in the day they used to give
you the pro bowl ego Fuckos right?

264
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,693
Um,

265
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,120
is 22 people not really trying and that
was your first hand of, Oh wait a minute,

266
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,650
they're going to play the fucking super
bowl and then I have to sit here for

267
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,870
another six months with
no fucking football.

268
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,230
So what I'm saying is try to enjoy it.

269
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,300
There's only three football
games left in the year. You know,

270
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm not trying to ram actually raining
on the fucking parade here, but uh,

271
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,340
that's something I always forget.

272
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:04,650
And then all of a sudden the Superbowl's
over and then, then, you know,

273
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,220
you're not even thinking,
wow,

274
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:09,440
I can't believe this team beat that team
or this team loss, blah, blah, blah, blah,

275
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:10,230
blah.

276
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,250
And then next Sunday comes along and
you're sitting there on your front porch

277
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:17,300
waiting for your absentee father
that show up in the eight common,

278
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,220
he's not coming to the end of the summer.

279
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:23,190
You got to grow six inches and he finally
going to show up. Hey, what's up sport?

280
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,620
How you've been on a fuck.
Have you been, um, anyways,

281
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:32,050
let me read a little bit of
advertising here for this week. Um,

282
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,420
as it rained again last night,
rain,

283
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,860
rain pretty much all night
long, which is great, man.

284
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:44,850
We're just getting a ton of
fucking rain out here. And uh,

285
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,150
but I don't subscribe to that fucking
lunacy that the drought is over.

286
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,860
Yeah. In, in the, in the, in the near
future it is. Put it in the fucking net.

287
00:17:55,861 --> 00:18:00,090
You can't, uh, you come here,
come the Goddamn read books.

288
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,610
You can feel it.
I tell you right now,

289
00:18:04,611 --> 00:18:07,160
the next goal is the most important goal.
It's cake.

290
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,430
It's difference between five to two or 43.

291
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:14,000
Give a one team hope putting
the gave away. All right, let's,

292
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,060
let's read a little bit advertising here.
Oh,

293
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,080
[inaudible] Miyan d play
enough fucking red wings.

294
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:26,660
But Dude, dude, my Mondays,
Mondays losing them would be a sin.

295
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:30,950
Meaning not as a right man.
Fuck them with their red and white UNIS.

296
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,350
I don't like that. They're called
hockey town. It's a bad nickname.

297
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,070
And you shouldn't give one to your
fucking self. That's up to your friends.

298
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,540
Oh yeah. Why would you give yourself
a nickname? Cause you're reduced bag.

299
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,130
Why the do the two

300
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,380
hockey town?
It's a town that likes hockey.

301
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:54,990
Me undies.

302
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,440
Everybody this Valentine's Day give a
gift that they can unwrap again and again.

303
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,150
Matching underwear for me
on these Valentine's Day is
near and it's go time for

304
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:05,950
thoughtful gift counting beyond.

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,440
He says you covered with
limited edition matching,

306
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,160
matching pairs of undies
for you and yours. Okay. I
mean you are giving one day,

307
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:18,110
all my family members were going to walk
around like the fucking the Waltons. Ah,

308
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,100
has Valentine's Day. Got You stumped.
Okay. No it doesn't. I don't celebrate it.

309
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,930
I go out the next night when food costs,
what the fuck it should cost and the,

310
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,830
and the restaurants aren't
jam packed with people.

311
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,680
Forget the cliches and give
a gift that looks great,

312
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,620
feels great and will make everyone happy.
Me undies.

313
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,330
Fancy dinners and chocolates last
at night. Flowers last a week.

314
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:43,340
Shots fired this year.
Give the gift of looking great.

315
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,070
Feeling great every day with the
world's most comfortable underwear.

316
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,800
Heads up Valentine's Day,

317
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,860
February 14th if you haven't noticed
that every fucking year, your life,

318
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,690
don't panic. Get you a hat on and show
some love with me undies matching undies,

319
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,750
please include all of the following
points during your read. I read all the,

320
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,500
she fucking write it.
I'll read it.

321
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,460
Me undies or the perfect gift for
you and your Valentine this holiday.

322
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,650
They're unbelievably so oft and
come and limited edition prints. Oh,

323
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,320
so don't wear them.
These things could be worth money someday.

324
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,800
You know somebody's comment and 20
years is going to want to want to buy.

325
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:23,170
Some fucking never
opened before me undies.

326
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,480
You know like those stupid action
figures that grown fucking men.

327
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,191
You know,

328
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:32,490
they want to get the Millennium Falcon
still in the box and then they're going

329
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:36,840
to buy it and keep it in the box. Like
that's, that's their retirement plan.

330
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,280
That's how bad the bankers
have fucked over this country.

331
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,890
Hey, by the way, considering the
Federal Reserve is not a, uh,

332
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,570
it's private corporation.
Here's my question. Where
does the money, where do the,

333
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,370
what is your tax dollars go?
Your federal income tax dollars.

334
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:59,420
It goes to the Federal Reserve. What
do they spend that money on? I get it.

335
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,450
I get at a fucking state level that that's
allegedly going to go to fucking fix

336
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:08,210
and pothole. Let me get back to me on
me. Undies knows that your special,

337
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:10,130
someone deserves a special fabric,

338
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:13,790
which is why their underwear is
made exclusively out of modal,

339
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,690
modal of fabric with a touch
three times softer than cotton.

340
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,380
Beyond has a special limited
edition Valentine's undies,

341
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,740
which means you and your
Valentine's can match and yeah,

342
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,120
it's as cute as it sounds. Jesus
Christ. Yeah, that's great. Dress.

343
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,560
You dress your wife in the same underwear
as you and then go to make a move of

344
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:36,350
fucking weird. Is that
going to be, you know,

345
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,580
just wear the same boxers you have on,
gives a whole meeting to go fuck yourself,

346
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:47,090
doesn't it? And if for some reason you
and me undies aren't a perfect match,

347
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,490
they'll give you your money back
and let you keep the first pair.

348
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,650
There's no refund on a bad fancy dinner.
They offer free shipping.

349
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:58,880

353
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:14,810

mean? Where the fuck does that money go

354
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,300
in the end? If you're at the top
of the fucking Federal Reserve,

355
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,270
why would you pay taxes?
What do you,

356
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:29,030
what are you going to fucking
investigate yourself? Do you know any,

357
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,390
any money made past 11 million?
All right.

358
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,800
Say you're really fucking successful.
You come up with some sort of APP,

359
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,310
you know, you were smart
enough not to go on shark tank,

360
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:44,150
so they didn't buy it off you
for fucking $30. You know,

361
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,380
you retain the money. You
like that Facebook guy, right?

362
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,580
That little fucking cunt.
You know,

363
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,990
we stole the idea from all his fucking
Harvard people for probably, I don't know,

364
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:00,350
they're making money in oil in Iraq
now. You know, all his Harvard people,

365
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,400
you know, if they don't, if they don't
end up like being comedy writers,

366
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:06,980
they just kind of go around the world
doing horrible things, don't they?

367
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:11,840
Isn't that what all Ivy League people
do? You know, they start managing,

368
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,940
affirm that fucking cuts down the Amazon.

369
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,880
Oh, this is just sour grapes from someone
who couldn't even go to a community

370
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:27,350
college. Um, what was I
saying? Yeah. Like wait,

371
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,240
what do they use that money for?

372
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,960
If the Federal Reserve is in
fact a private corporation,

373
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,830
you give them the fucking money.
Where the fuck does it go? So our,

374
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:39,860
I was going to say, so after any
money you make after $11 million,

375
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:43,520
that money you already paid taxes on
that you then should just be able to give

376
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:48,170
the a kids nice. You just sit around
getting a drug habit. You know, if you,

377
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:50,930
if you make over 11 million bucks,
if you give it to them,

378
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,940
you then have your kids have to
pay 45% tax to the fucking IRS,

379
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,950
which means any sort of sizable fortune.
Okay.

380
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,250
The IRS gets 45% of that.

381
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,970
Every fucking sizable afforded a
Rod Kevin Durant under 90 million,

382
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,210
you know, provided, you know,
they don't blow their money,

383
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
which is something to be said too.
This is what you should do.

384
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,570
You should just go out and
blow your fucking cash,

385
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,960
but don't fucking blow it on stuff.

386
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,330
Just go around a regular
people and give it to them.

387
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,820
There's gotta be a way to turn it around.
You can't do that.

388
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:32,090
You can't give them out free this, that
kind of money. Actually. Maybe you could

389
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,170
then they get these psycho.
Fuck you. Oh, nice. Safe. Nice.

390
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,810
It it didn't save it.

391
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,550
Four or three. Ah, Jesus Christ.

392
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,350
Oh, you know how much of the
red wing fans and join this,

393
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:53,210
cause you know the fucking
outcome of this game, aren't you?

394
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,723
Okay.

395
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,800
Are we really going to blow
it three nothing to lead in
the first fucking period.

396
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:01,510
Is that what we're going
to do? Oh, that's great.

397
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:04,870
Everybody can fucking go behind
the net goal for the puck.

398
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,320
That looks like me playing pickup
hockey and I am a puck. Chase a jackass.

399
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:10,270
I have not played hockey and like,
well over a year.

400
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:13,060
I didn't play one slash two year.
I get hockey stuff.

401
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:17,710
Just sit in my God damn bag I
was supposed to play last week.

402
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,300
Yeah, it was just fucking eight.
Anyways, movement watches everybody.

403
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,990
Oh, it's going to say, yeah,
if he gave every, if every,

404
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,510
if every fucking say
that Facebook can right.

405
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,850
Just kind of gives away his
money just to regular people.

406
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,860
What would be great about that is that,
uh,

407
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,970
the first thing I would immediately do
is I would invest in whatever companies

408
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,110
make four wheelers,

409
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,303
right?

410
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,260
Jacuzzis jet skis.

411
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,700
Like the average fucking guy
who wins the lottery. I mean,

412
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:54,570
that's what they're going to buy.
You're going to get a Jacuzzi,

413
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:59,130
you're going to get a jet ski and you're
going to get a four wheeler. All right?

414
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,450
Then what else are they gonna do?

415
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:03,030
They're going to have that and know
what the fuck by George Foreman Grill.

416
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,661
I have no idea,

417
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:07,110
but the three out of four of those you'll
hit and the stock market, all right?

418
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,650
Then you get all these cards out there,
okay? They're not going to have to work,

419
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:13,890
which means they're going to be drunk
and they're going to get on these four

420
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:17,410
wheelers. They're going to tip over
and they're going to crush their,

421
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,090
their ribs will crush their,
their,

422
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,120
their vitals and the population
will start to go doubt.

423
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,190
Maybe.
Maybe that's what it is.

424
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:28,240
Maybe that's how the Illuminati
plants to thin out the herd. Um,

425

by two broke college kids.

427
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,870
I don't understand how you started

428
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,770

429
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,140
that wanted to wear stylists,
watches but couldn't afford them.

430
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,940
So they started their own watch company.

431
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,300
How is this like how you started?

432

458
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:21,101
hockey move so fucking fast to sit here
and try to announce what is going on and

459
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:25,850
then to try to know all
these God damn names. I mean,

460
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:28,370
I don't even know what countries,
half of these fucking people come from.

461
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,380
All I know is they have like the,
uh, you know, whatever they are,

462
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:36,500
wheel of fortune is over there.
I don't think anybody's buying any vials.

463
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,430
And I think, you know, over here
we're always like, give me an s,

464
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,450
let me see a t over there. It's
like, give me an h gimme a z,

465
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,030
like their fucking name.
Like the first,

466
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:51,320
like the first three letters would be
like c, h Z. It's like I'm supposed to,

467
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,770
I'm supposed to read that. Yeah. Bill,

468
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:59,300
you are disposed to have what it a
name like yours, bill or fucking Larry.

469
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,630
Excuse them for having a culture.
Um,

470
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,090
I don't give a shit that this,
that there's foreigners in this,

471
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:12,510
in the national hockey league that
was starting in Canada, you know,

472
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,840
the Goddamn league was started by
foreigners. Okay. And you know,

473
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,520
being a Trump supporter,

474
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:23,270
I never thought the NHL should have been
allowed to come into the United States

475
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,080
of America. Come on back in. Um,

476
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,380
yeah, I don't think that they should have
been allowed to come in here. You know,

477
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:33,820
and I hope when Donald Trump is a,

478
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,440
is done making that wall
between here and Mexico,

479
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,130
he then makes one between here and uh,
Canada.

480
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:43,600
So these God damn foreigners can stop
coming down here on their skates.

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,510
I would tell you by about the time I

544
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,483
you know.

545
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,660
Okay.

546
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,920
I bought a safe cause I had like, you
know, moved out and all that shit. Well,

547
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:07,770
shit moved out and moved out for 10
years and somebody hit me all fucking

548
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:12,480
paranoid. You know that if I lost
my birth certificate, my passport,

549
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,600
you know,

550
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,600
by done my first standup special and
I had the original like whatever the,

551
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,930
the master copy of it and
basically if that thing was gone,

552
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,170
I was afraid I was
fucked. Oh No. Break away.

553
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,680
They scored
four to four.

554
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,120
It was three to nothing. Then it was
three to one, then it was four to one,

555
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,390
then was 42 then it was 43
then it was four to four.

556
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,180
These fucking constant scored three goals.
We haven't scored anything.

557
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,560
How does, how does this
even happen? Oh yeah.

558
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,780
Our defenseman falls down. Yeah,
that'll do it. I got to tell you kids,

559
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,840
one of the big things you want to
void when you're playing team hockey,

560
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,930
it's the fucking,
we just fell down.

561
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,680
Ah, that's all right. That's
all right. All right. Anyways,

562
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,210
so I get this. I just got
this little fucking, you
know, it wasn't even that bad.

563
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:14,940
The fucking safe was like the
size of like a kitchen fridge.

564
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,250
I mean one of those little ones.
So you know what I mean?

565
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,680
One of those ones that you can
also use as like a nightstand.

566
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,060
So one of the things about getting a safe
is she don't want anybody to know that

567
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:27,870
you have it, you know, or a kind
of defeats the fucking purpose.

568
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,570
So these assholes come

569
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:31,790
okay

570
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,190
to fucking deliver the safe.

571
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,950
And I'm living on a second floor walk.

572
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,500
Okay.

573
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,220
It's what I'm in New York City, right?
I live in a second floor walkup,

574
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,700
which is great. So, um, you know, oh,

575
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:50,590
we just fuck it's gone.
Adam McQuaid.

576
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,560
Five to four.

577
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,333
Okay.

578
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,310
This game is shaping up.
Did anybody see that?

579
00:35:57,311 --> 00:36:02,170
Penguins fucking capitals game
eight to seven. Here we go.

580
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,150
The fuck is going. They didn't even play
in goal. He had a clean look at that too.

581
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,220
Oh, it tipped and then it bounced
between his fucking balls.

582
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,300
The old five hall there. Anyways,
so I'm living in New York City.

583
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,020
I got a second floor fucking walk up.
So I have these guys deliver it. Right.

584
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,280
And like I said, the thing is you
want nobody know that you have it.

585
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,440
Not only do you want
to have a fucking safe,

586
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,600
but you don't want anybody to know that
you have it because immediately you get

587
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:31,420
is safe.
People think you have bars of gold

588
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,150
worth half a million of whack in there.

589
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,940
We're just gonna fucking busted your
apartment and find a fucking, you know,

590
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:42,530
my birth certificate and
the fucking, you know, the,

591
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:46,240
the master to my first standup special.
So the dude shows up.

592
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:48,520
Now the thing about a
fucking safe is not only,

593
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:50,800
there's two things about a safe one,
you know,

594
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:53,290
once someone to be able to crack the safe,
you know,

595
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:56,080
pick the lock or whatever and
get in there. And number two,

596
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,090
you don't want it to be like,

597
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,470
you don't want someone to be able to
just be able to pick it up and leave with

598
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:05,140
it. So then they can go to their
house and take a fucking blow torch.

599
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:09,550
So it's gotta be really
fucking heavy. It's gotta be
hard to break into. And then,

600
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:11,620
you know, depending on
the thickness, you know,

601
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,920
it can survive a fire for
a specified amount of time.

602
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,970
So I get this basic fucking safe, you
know, I don't wait a couple, I don't know,

603
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,460
a couple of hundred pounds.
I don't know when it weighed.

604
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,730
And this fucking guy shows up with this.
I never seen this thing before.

605
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,140
It was an elected, an
electronic two wheeler. Okay.

606
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:31,300
And I lived in this old building to flow,
walk up.

607
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:35,560
He shows up like Saturday morning,
everybody's asleep in every step.

608
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,590
He press a button and it would
lift the safe up and then he,

609
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,231
I don't know.

610
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:44,620
And then the wheels would go up to the
next thing and it was the loudest fucking

611
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:45,940
noise ever. Every state. And we got here.

612
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,293
Yeah,

613
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,960
he did two flights of stairs and
everybody's open in their apartments,

614
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,950
looking out,

615
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,120
seeing the safe and then looking at me
and see me standing there with my fucking

616
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:08,490
door open.
Like nothing to see here.

617
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:12,600
Everybody just buying a
safe from my bars of gold.

618
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,740
I fucking was so convinced that my
apart what was going to get broken into.

619
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,470
Um, and then what was funny
when I went to move out,

620
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,500
I just had friends helped me move
out and we didn't have that thing.

621
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,390
So then I just had to leave the safe.

622
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,940
I just left to safe and gave
the person the combination.

623
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,200
And that's what happens to all safes.
Like wherever they get delivered to his,

624
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,130
where they fucking stay,
uh,

625
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,870
there never moved than haven't booked
because they're too fucking heavy and you

626
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:45,770
just, you just gotta say fuck it.
You leave him now leave it. Yeah. Um,

627
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,780
anyways, is that the podcast
for this week? I have no idea.

628
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:50,680
My wife's gonna kill me.

629
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:54,640
I screaming about every goal and a fucking
imitating somebody bringing us safe

630
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:59,170
up two flights of stairs. Excuse me.
I just belched that's that, you know,

631
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:03,970
something that's not a, that's not a
formula for a happy, for a happy marriage.

632
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,790
Anyways, that is a Thursday
afternoon, just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts.

633
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,720
I know what you want to, you want to
hear my predictions, don't ya? Um,

634
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,190
my prediction for Patriots Steelers. Ah,
I don't have a good feeling about it.

635
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,310
You know, I thought we looked
like shit against the Texans.

636
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:24,680
So I'm doing what every
Patriot fan is doing.

637
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm hoping that that was
our one bad playoff game.

638
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,520
Like you can do that in the playoffs.
So yeah,

639
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:35,210
you can do it if there's no JJ watts
and a, you got a rookie quarterback,

640
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,210
you know, I guess she can get away
with a bad fucking game. But, uh,

641
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,290
I was not impressed with our
offensive line last week.

642
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,890
And the Pittsburgh Steelers always have
a fucking great defense. So, you know,

643
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,040
big Ben, the Steelers
at due to beat us, man,

644
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:51,770
they haven't beat us in a big
game in a long time. But, uh,

645
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,460
I'm going to go with my hat and I'm going
to say the patriots are going to eat

646
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,353
out.

647
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,250
They're going to eke out a victory
at home and a Gillette stadium.

648
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,333
Yeah.

649
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,440
You know, that's, that's what I'm
open. I'm hoping we go up early.

650
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,851
That's what I'm hoping.

651
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:12,110
I don't want to see us try to play catch
up against those guys. Uh, alright.

652
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,931
And then what else we got?

653
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:17,010
We got the Falcons and we get
the Green Bay packers and uh,

654
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,470
am I going to disrespect the falcons
two weeks in a row? You know,

655
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:26,940
so I don't even know where this game is.
I'm going to pick a,

656
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,760
you know, something. If the
Falcons win, this would be Matt.

657
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:38,990
Ryan's like fucking finally
getting the respect he deserves.

658
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,740
Yeah.

659
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,430
Then he got an Aaron fucking Rogers.

660
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,350
Okay.

661
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,950
Is it in Green Bay? I, if it's in Green
Bay, I got to go with the packers.

662
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,900
I Dunno, they beat Seattle, but what
the fuck? Seattle was hurt. You know,

663
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:57,840
if they're the fucking up by
whoever the fuck it was came in,

664
00:40:57,841 --> 00:41:00,680
they're stepping on their quarterback's
foot. Gave him two points.

665
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,610
Let's see what we got here. This
is, this is how every gambler,

666
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,750
most gamblers makes their decisions
before they put their kids college tuition

667
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:12,890
down. This is right here is literally
the level of research that they'll do.

668
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,470
Where is that Gig? Is that in
Green Bay? It's in Georgia.

669
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,523
Ah,

670
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,223
okay.

671
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,070
This gets more interesting.
Wait a minute. Point spread.

672
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,653
Okay.

673
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,690
It's got a good spread.
What do you got here?

674
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,680
What do you got here at Green
Bay packers versus betting odds?

675
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:38,440
Just give me the fucking odds.
Falcons packers.

676
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,350
Why won't they do that? How can we, if
you say, what does this mean in German?

677
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:43,330
It just comes right up.
If he asked for the fucking,

678
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,620
okay.

679
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,690
They asked for the fucking odds.
I gotta Click on somebody's site.

680
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:50,840
That's so they get,
they get credit for uh,

681
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,760
for eyeballs and this
site, right. You know,

682
00:41:56,761 --> 00:41:59,960
this is such, this is why I hate the
fucking Internet sometimes. You Know Ali?

683
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,200
Okay, right there, right there.
Green Bay packers at death.

684
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,010
That was minus five and a half.
Shut up.

685
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,290
I don't even know what I'm doing.
And you want me to hit pause?

686
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:14,290
I'm not going to torture you guys
with this. Hold on a sec. All right.

687
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:18,220
Since the falcons open as five
and a half point favorites,

688
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,080
the total was 59.5 59 and
a half earlier in the week.

689
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,170
That's the over under according
to the sports book. All right.

690
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,720
I don't know shit about
either one of these teams.

691
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:29,930
Okay.

692
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,090
Oh, I tell you. Got To take the package
with the points. If you're betting,

693
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,380
you know what I mean? You're gonna
get Aaron Rodgers fucking six points,

694
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,120
almost six points.
Um,

695
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:48,440
fuck. I don't know shit. I'm going to say,

696
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:49,980
yeah,

697
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,200
do I do it?
Do I take a chance on the new guy?

698
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,660
There's a new quarterback in
town and he's failing. Good.

699
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,370
That was the theme to Alice. If you
guys ever watched that fucking show,

700
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:07,140
uh yeah. Fuck. I gotta go
Green Bay. Green Bay goes in,

701
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:10,980
breaks that fucking hearts,
you know. That's what I say.

702
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,610
They're going to go in there and
somehow they're going to get it done.

703
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,450
That's what I fucking, you know what?
I'm going to go with the tried and true.

704
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:20,790
I'm going to go Aaron Rodgers and
the Green Bay packers. There you go.

705
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,790
You heard it hear first from a standup
comedian who hasn't watched a lot of

706
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:28,200
football the last couple of years. All
right, so take your hard earned cash.

707
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,080
You know, put it on Aaron Rodgers.
Get yourself fired. A half points,

708
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:37,140
said a that doesn't work out.
Uh, you know, that's what
you get full listening to.

709
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,470
A stand up comedian. Go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend. You constant.

710
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:40,830
I'll talk to

711
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,663
you on Monday.

712
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,580
Hey everybody, what's going on? It's
still, it is the Monday morning podcast.

713
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,460
I believe it's January, January
19th. Martin Luther King Day.

714
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:03,050
Happy Martin Luther
King Day. Everybody. Um,

715
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,040
yeah, Obama's getting in this
week. I don't know if you noticed,

716
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,340
spent a lot of parties.
I gotta be honest with you.

717
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,341
I couldn't watch any of it and I heard
some reports of what was going to be

718
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:21,310
going on and I just got
like those embarrassing, uh,

719
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,813
you know,

720
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,990
I just heard that they were taking white
artists and black artists and putting

721
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,900
them together and uh,
you know,

722
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,650
that old tired thing like this
is kind of a scary thing or are,

723
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,220
you know,

724
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,820
now if they were having a white artists
and a black artists get together and

725
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,870
then beat the shit out of a
banker, then I would be like, okay,

726
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,070
now we're a,
we're getting somewhere.

727
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,560
But if you just going to put
James Taylor with fucking I,

728
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,410
you know, and then they're going to do
a folk that then turns into a rap of,

729
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:06,330
uh,
knowing the Carolina in my mind,

730
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,640
whatever the fuck it is.
You know what's funny?

731
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:12,930
I just sang the melody with
the wrong words. No, in my
mind, I'm going to Carolina.

732
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,410
I still fucking roller blade.

733
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,890
Um, [inaudible] James Taylor's
really into rollerblading.

734
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,530
I bet you didn't know that. Well,
listen, if you're new to my page,

735
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,070
let me get right off. Let me just
get right off on the right foot here.

736
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,030
This is going to be a rough one. I'm,
let me get off to the, on the right foot.

737
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,030
You know what? It's early and I
have to work out and I was like,

738
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,270
I gotta get this fucking thing out of
the way that sounds approaching this

739
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:42,420
podcast this week. I have to get
this thing out of the fucking way.

740
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,250
And I don't know about you guys,

741
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:48,060
but whenever I approach something like
I have to get this out of the way,

742
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:53,130
something suffers and it's usually the
quality. Okay. So I want all of you guys,

743
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:58,170
wherever you're at, to just lower
your fucking expectations, okay?

744
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,830
Because I am on,
let's get this out of the way.

745
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,900
Mowed this week.
All right,

746
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,980
button going hardcore with my workout.

747
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,960
Just had 98 proteins doing
this new fucking diet, man.

748
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:16,830
It's just fucking ridiculous.
It's ridiculous. But it's
working. It's working.

749
00:47:16,831 --> 00:47:18,120
But I know in the back of my head,

750
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,460
eventually you're going to
get to where you want bill,

751
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:23,250
and then you're got to go off the Diet
and then you gotta to fucking get,

752
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,080
you know, get a big Charlie Brown head
again. That's what's going to happen. Um,

753
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,030
but anyways,
the news page,

754
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,880
I'll do one of those diets where you
like weigh your food. Three nights,

755
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:39,280
it's a chicken dance answer. The primers
on cheese and ten eight egg whites,

756
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,910
which is a whole fucking Carden.
I swear to God. By the end of it,

757
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:47,680
you just want to Puke, but somehow
you lose weight. It's all like a,

758
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:51,520
it's like chemistry. Is that what it's
like bill? Is it really like chemistry?

759
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:55,420
Have you ever taken a chemistry
class? A why? No. No, I haven't.

760
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,320
Then how would you know? It's
like chemistry. You don't,

761
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,790
all right. That's what I'm doing.
Heckle in myself this week. Um, yeah.

762
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:06,790
You know something.
I'm already kind of a no bill.

763
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:10,840
Stick with what the fuck you wanted to.
Let's, let's have some sort of beginning,

764
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:13,720
middle and end to this
thing. All right. Okay.

765
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,170
Let's start with the basics.
If you new to my page,

766
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,220
I do one of these every single week.
I do it every single Monday.

767
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,180
People send me in questions and I
answered them to the best of my ability.

768
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,200
People send in their list of stuff that
they feel is underrated, overrated.

769
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,420
And lately much to my
pleasure is that the word?

770
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:36,910
I don't know.
Two full of protein.

771
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:41,020
I need some carbs to be able to pull
up the right fucking word here. Um,

772
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:43,690
I really enjoyed the fact that a lot of
people are weighing in on a lot of the

773
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,610
stuff that I'm talking about. Like, um,

774
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,510
and also introducing new
subjects because uh, you know,

775
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,970
I don't want to be doing the same shit.
You know,

776
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,050
it'd be doing this podcast 20
years from now and just being like,

777
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,460
oh,
battery power,

778
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,983
um,

779
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,300
underrated. Fucking, uh,
Gabe Kaplan's come back.

780
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,800
All right.
That was overrated.

781
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:19,210
Underrated in the year 2029 when
gay clamp with Kaplan will be 96.

782
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,700
Um, I saw him on the world series
of poker and wow, you know,

783
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,320
this had fucking aging thing where some
people try to prevent it and that's when

784
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:34,270
you get in trouble. You got to go with
it. You've got to use a Kido, you know,

785
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,130
you just, you just go with
it, you know, you know,

786
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,850
you know fucking Oh, by the way,

787
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:47,650
I also saw blazing saddles recently and
uh, two things I want to say is Gavi,

788
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,190
Johnson is the best fucking laugh.

789
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,390
I got in about three months,
absolutely dying, laughing.

790
00:49:55,391 --> 00:50:00,391
And if anybody can explain to me why the
actor who played Gabby Johnson made the

791
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:04,160
choice to start swinging his arms,
it's,

792
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,190
it's fucking genius.

793
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,430
And Gene Wilder has the most horrific
powdered wig comb over I have ever seen in

794
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:19,210
my life. What was that
bowling movie that, uh,

795
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,270
Bill Murray was in and they had
those really bad comb overs.

796
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,070
He puts them to shame. What the fuck
was the name of that movie? Candle?

797
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,813
Big 10.

798
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,730
The fuck was that movie called Gardner
Ball had something to do with Boeing.

799
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,090
I don't know these people right now
screaming at that dashboards in the car,

800
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,360
like they know the right answer. Like
you're going to get a star or something.

801
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,210
The fuck was the name of that
movie. All right. Anyways, um,

802
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,430
yeah, so I do one of these, every single
week is such a fucking mess. And uh,

803
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,470
I also hype shit that I have coming up.

804
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:58,940
Like these are my three big dates
that I have coming up this week.

805
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:03,530
I am at the Improv in Houston and a
surprisingly I've been getting a lot of

806
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:07,300
emails because I didn't draw a shit
last time. I was their mom, frogger.

807
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,630
And um,
you can go to Improv too.

808
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:14,790
Dot Com for tickets or you can just
click on the link right on my, uh,

809
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:15,920
run on my homepage,

810
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:20,000
which I imagine probably still says
that I'm going to be a Tampa this week,

811
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:21,860
which isn't true.
I just haven't changed it.

812
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,050
Really need to get a fucking assistant
that's on my list of shit to do. Um,

813
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,970
and February 6th,

814
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:34,060
I'm going to be at the
Wilbur Theater in Boston,

815
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,610
Massachusetts.
And then on the seventh,

816
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,440
I'm going to be out in chickopee Chicopee,
Massachusetts.

817
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,410
Um,
and then a couple of weekends after that,

818
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,900
I am going to be making my
debut appearance in Ogden, Utah.

819
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,530
So all you Mormons,
you know,

820
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,880
fucking come on down to the Goddamn show.
Why don't you,

821
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:03,230
when you're 18 wives come down to
the show and sit there and judge me.

822
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,130
You know, I'll tell
you, you know something.

823
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,170
I don't know anything about Mormons
other than Steve Young as a Mormon.

824
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,350
That's the only thing I know about him.
And you guys have a lot of wives and uh,

825
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,000
for some reason, when I think
about you, I think about the Amish,

826
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,580
which I know isn't true. I
know it's not fair. I actually,

827
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:23,060
there's a college out there
a long time ago and uh,

828
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,730
it was really weird,
like all the kids out there,

829
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:27,530
how like for pepper press they were,

830
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,240
this is out in front of sell tickets
in Utah by basically attacking the main

831
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:35,600
religion out there. That's real smart
though. No, it was just really weird.

832
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,980
I felt like I was in the footloose, you
know, people weren't allowed to dance.

833
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,690
They weren't allowed to fuck.
Anyways, let's get on with this.

834
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:47,240
This podcast is starting to lose momentum.
I can feel it.

835
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:50,510
I'm like fucking Steve Austin and the
beginning of $6 million man, you know,

836
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,630
she's breaking up. She's
breaking up. I can't hold it.

837
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,750
Steve Austin astronaut,

838
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:02,270
a man barely alive.
We can put on a new foot.

839
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,200
All right. Um, here's something that
somebody said to me recently. Um,

840
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,020
and this whole thing is judged because
basically I drive a Prius, which,

841
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,950
you know, driving a Prius yet
people really fucking judge you.

842
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:17,620
Like I pulled up in front of this,
uh,

843
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,380
just try to get an extra key made
from my apartment and I get up,

844
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,690
go and get out of my car.
And I was like,

845
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:26,880
pull up as these two douche bags with
green, green peace sweatshirts on.

846
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:32,640
And they immediately eyeball me, you
know, and I'm like, Oh God, right.

847
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:37,410
And I get out of the car and the girl
goes, I swear to God, she's like,

848
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,600
hey, their Prius driver. So I go,

849
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:45,660
he there chick with a green
peace sweatshirt, you know,

850
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,740
really what the country tone
in my voice as if to say,

851
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,390
I don't care about whales. Do you
know, maybe I'm just a tight fuck.

852
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,090
Who doesn't want to pay for gas?
Do you ever think about that?

853
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,280
But that doesn't stop her. She just
keeps coming at me. He has time.

854
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,430
He has hands. I go, no, no I
don't. She's like, you know,

855
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:10,230
he takes a second and I walked around
the corner and I want you to this key

856
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:14,790
place to get my, you know, my
key done. And uh, you know,

857
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,180
God does the key in to second.
I come walking back out,

858
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,650
I mean literally within the first,

859
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,160
the same two minutes of this woman
talking to me and I clearly didn't want to

860
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:27,630
talk to her and she sees me again and
she's still coming at me and she said some

861
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:31,980
shit like, come on, you know it's
your Prius driver. Just sign up.

862
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:37,050
It's easy peasy. What? She
said it's easy fucking Pz,

863
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:41,910
which made me want to go buy a bus and
take the muffler off of it. You know,

864
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,550
it's easy peasy. Goes to come on
and you drive a Prius. I'm like,

865
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:48,510
how do you even know this is mine? You
don't even know what's mine. You know,

866
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:53,280
fucking Twat hid away from me.
I don't know why. You know,

867
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:57,330
I really, I like animals. You know,

868
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,750
I really like animals and I enjoy
doing things to the environment,

869
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,950
but I don't like fucking people thinking
they know shit about them even though

870
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:09,210
she did in a way she did.
But just because I drive a Prius,

871
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,730
it doesn't mean I'm going to talk to
you and your stupid sweatshirt and,

872
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:17,490
and you know, sign up on your clipboard.
I don't want to fucking do that,

873
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,353
you know,

874
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,980
because if I do at some point I got to
listen to you use words like easy peasy.

875
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,460
It's where I'm like this fucking type a
psycho environmentalist and I just don't

876
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:33,260
get along with those
Bergen stock. It is. Ah,

877
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,110
I'm just getting annoyed now. Just
fucking talking. Hey tree is driver.

878
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,250
The thing I really want to say,

879
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:44,040
I'm just not going to say it because
it's just going to be to me. All right,

880
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,960
let's get on with it. So
anyway, so I drive it for you.

881
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:48,720
So this guy sends me something
about global warming.

882
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,410
I don't know where he says bill.
It's a,

883
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:56,790
it's about 10 degrees in New York City
now. And since you drive a Toyota Prius,

884
00:55:56,791 --> 00:56:01,020
I'm going to assume that you at
least believe somewhat in global,

885
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:05,640
global warming. And honestly with
you being a great cynical comic,

886
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:10,380
that shocks me. Okay. I like
how we just did that. How he,

887
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,340
uh, was patting me on the back
as he backhanded me in the face.

888
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,850
And honestly with you being
a great comic, wow, there's,

889
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:21,660
there goes my self esteem
that shocks me black.

890
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,590
Um, I hate when people fucking do that
when they give you a nice compliment.

891
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,520
So you know, thinking like lean,
you're going to come around it.

892
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:34,030
Their opinion like I'm some little
fucking dog and I just rolled over and now

893
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:37,360
you're going to give me a fucking
snack. All right. And honestly,

894
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:41,620
you being a great comic, that shocks
me. You have common sense enough, Jesus,

895
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:43,660
he's just throwing out
the compliments here.

896
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,390
It's almost like he wants
to change my opinion.

897
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:51,400
You have common sense enough to realize
things like self checkout lines being

898
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:56,610
the beginning phases of teaching us how
to do the job for free yet exclamation

899
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:57,640
point.

900
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,110
You don't spell any bullshit whatsoever
on listening to a guy like Al Gore

901
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,910
basically predicting some shit that he
claims is going to happen 50 years from

902
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:08,170
now.
Now you know what?

903
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:13,171
I love how at the beginning of this he
realized that he doesn't know my opinions

904
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:15,160
on global warming and he says,

905
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:17,770
I'm going to assume that you
at least somewhat belief.

906
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,590
And now two sentences later,

907
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:24,730
I totally fucking believe in
it until he can trash Al Gore.

908
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,650
Anyways, he says, my logic,

909
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,270
my logic just tells me that if anyone's
going to tell me that they know what the

910
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:35,980
world is going to be like a 2060, they're
full of shit. Nobody knows that shit.

911
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,970
Same as nobody knows what's going
to happen to you when you die. Um,

912
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,540
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. On and on and on.

913
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:48,250
And he trashed this basically a my
really gonna read out loud this long.

914
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,400
Okay, let me just try to blow
through this. Some 27 now.

915
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:56,401
I vividly vividly recall plenty of people
20 years ago guaranteeing flying cars

916
00:57:56,441 --> 00:58:01,240
by the year 2000. Really?
I don't remember that. Um,

917
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,380
20 years ago,
you're seven years old,

918
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,580
they will probably just fucking with you
once they still telling you that effect.

919
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:13,690
Fuck came down the chimney
and gave you the toys. Um,

920
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,870
I vividly remember that
when I was in the sandbox,

921
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:18,910
somebody saying that there
was going to be flying.

922
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,470
Did you go to a private school or all
your little friends running around in

923
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:24,870
sport coats?
Um,

924
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:29,790
and the closest thing we have to occur
that car instead of a close to we have

925
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:34,420
that car is instead of running on
gasoline, it runs on less gasoline and,

926
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,010
um, and a battery and is 85%
plastic. All right. First,

927
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:40,600
before we get into all of this shit,

928
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:46,010
one of my pet peeves about people who
argue against global warming is when it's

929
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:50,350
10 degrees out in January,
you know, January,

930
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:53,500
a winter month when it's supposed
to be fucking 10 degrees out,

931
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,540
you know, the big, you know, all of a
sudden it's, it's actually winter weather.

932
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,700
And then they're just like, well, I
just, that proves that. I mean it's,

933
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,100
it's fucking 10 degrees in January.
There you go.

934
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,060
So it was fucking 10 degrees in October,

935
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:16,480
you know, for a bunch of days in a
row for a bunch of years in a row.

936
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,270
And polar ice caps weren't fucking mouth.

937
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:24,170
The top of the world wasn't melting and
grizzly bears weren't mating with polar

938
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:26,060
bears,
you know,

939
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,570
then I would maybe believe your little
point about one day in January being

940
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,990
fucking 10 degrees or maybe a cold
spell and it's called the winner. Dude.

941
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,990
All right, you want to talk
about vividly remembering.

942
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,080
I remember vividly riding
on my bicycle back when,

943
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:44,780
uh,

944
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,730
when kids delivered papers before they
scared the shit out of us that everyone

945
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,120
was a fucking pedophile.

946
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,650
And before they printed billions of
dollars more with no gold behind it.

947
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,050
So now adults have to do that job.

948
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:03,350
They were fucking kid like me riding
around in that bicycle and it was so cold

949
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:03,471
out.

950
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:07,820
You fucking nostril stuck together and
they used to give you those ski masks and

951
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:10,700
your breadth would condensate or
whatever the fucking word was.

952
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,650
And then you had hocked
up against your nose.

953
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,480
I've definitely remember my brother
coming home, his hands were so cold.

954
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,590
He turned on hot water in the sink and
stuck them in there and they immediately

955
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:25,400
all cracked and became bloody.
And I laughed my ass off at Adam.

956
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,930
I vividly remember that. It's called
the fucking winter. All right,

957
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:34,610
so don't send me a fucking email about a
couple of days in January where it's 10

958
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:37,190
degrees out and you think
that that fucking disproves

959
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,970
would not look it. I don't,
I don't, I don't even how
to get in this fucking shit.

960
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:46,550
The reason why we don't have fucking
flying cars right now, I mean,

961
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:51,080
think about that. 6 billion people
all having cars that fly around.

962
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:54,920
How the fuck are you going to have roads?
You know what I mean?

963
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,200
And the reason why you have Prius's that
run half on gasoline and a little bit

964
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:04,340
on electricity is cause it. That's
all bullshit. It's a fucking scam.

965
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,420
All right? It's a better scan than
the car that they have out now,

966
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,510
but it's a fucking scam
because you're dealing with,

967
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:15,710
you're dealing with that robber baron
blue blood money that has been running

968
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:19,950
shit for 150 fucking years, and
they're not just going to go, oh,

969
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,580
they're the fucking cop of
the world's melting. Well,

970
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:23,960
let's do something about that.

971
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:27,650
They're going to incrementally
slide their way into something,

972
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,680
they're going to do the
least amount that's required.

973
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:35,390
A hybrid is a complete fucking scam
other than the emissions, you know,

974
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,330
the admissions are a lot better.
That's the big thing.

975
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:41,750
But as far as the gas mileage
and all that shit, it's bullshit.

976
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:47,150
You basically get 45 miles a gallon
if you're gliding down the street.

977
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:48,560
But that's true with all cars.

978
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:53,561
But the mere fact that corporations
are actually giving in now and um,

979
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,730
at the very least I love what they do
is they basically paint their packages

980
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:03,380
green and then psychologically like
there's a gas station, I think it's BP.

981
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:07,820
All of a sudden they went to like
green and yellow now and it's subtly,

982
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:11,390
I'm supposed to have to be thinking
about ethanol or some shit. Like wow,

983
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,940
grasses grade carness yellow gas is good,

984
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,860
it's stupid.
The whole is Jackie,

985
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:24,040
what you're dealing with dude is a ton of
politics in there. So to sit there and,

986
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:28,710
and look at it and you know, blast the
guy like Al Gore. Yeah. Al Gore, you know,

987
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,250
the guy, you know in defense of him
has always been into the environment.

988
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,480
One of his things when he was in office
was he tried to get the Supercar,

989
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,110
a car that got a hundred miles a gallon
and they just dragged their feet.

990
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,480
The big three dragged their feet and as a,
you know,

991
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:46,290
we're putting it together and
there's a finite amount of time.

992
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:48,330
Someone's in office,
he was in office for eight years.

993
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,580
They just dragged their feet for eight
years and he was out and then they

994
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:53,970
shelved it. That's all. That's all
that bullshit. But Al Gore, yeah,

995
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:57,480
he's using it to try to get
himself back in the ring. You know,

996
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:01,980
he's like a comedian, you know,
his show got canceled and now he's,

997
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:03,300
he's doing infomercials.

998
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:06,690
He's got to get his face out there so
we can still make speeches and make some

999
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:10,830
money so we can pay the fucking
bankers. But Dude, you know,

1000
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:15,831
you really should do a little more
research into a global warming other than

1001
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:19,770
it's 10 degrees out in January.
That's all I'm going to say.

1002
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:24,600
And to sit there, and obviously I'm
by no means a fucking scientist,

1003
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,350
but you know,
I do know that you can't have 6 billion

1004
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,010
of any species on this planet,
especially human beings who,

1005
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,580
unlike animals, we're the
only ones, as my brother says,

1006
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,500
we're the only species on the planet
that alters the environment rather than

1007
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:45,600
adapting to it.
You know what I mean?

1008
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,280
You could have 6 billion deer and
that would fuck up a lot of shit,

1009
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,970
but not to the level that we're fucking
it up because they don't make, you know,

1010
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,050
nuclear weapons and deal with the
waste and plastic and all that shit.

1011
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,760
So I dunno dude. I mean, if I, I mean,

1012
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,860
I don't know what to tell you,
dude.

1013
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:07,590
I'm not here to try to convince
you that global warming,

1014
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,300
that 6 billion people on the planet
are going to have an effect on it.

1015
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:16,680
You know, we're like the Gypsy
moth caterpillar for right now,

1016
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:20,280
just eating everything in
her fucking path and uh,

1017
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,920
none of this shit that
they're doing hybrids,

1018
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,540
any of that shit is going to fucking
help anything until they literally get on

1019
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:32,400
TV. And they start telling people
to stop having children. Um,

1020
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,540
well that's uplifting bill.
I mean,

1021
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,580
I don't understand what
people are fucking doing.

1022
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,360
Have you seen that IBM car shul or all of
a sudden, you know, they're acting like,

1023
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:45,390
you know, they're talking
about how in uh, oh,

1024
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:49,420
this is Joe to Rosa just called me
and I missed the fucking call. Um,

1025
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,660
this IBM commercial,

1026
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:55,410
they sitting there talking about how
like in Sweden or something that, uh,

1027
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,480
they installed a automated toll booths
and that decreased gridlock by 20%.

1028
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:05,040
And then in the end, this
girl's like, I'm an IBM or,

1029
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,130
and that's what I'm working
on. It's like, really? Well,

1030
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:12,000
why don't you work on a digital poster
that tells people to stop fucking busted

1031
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:16,630
nuts in their girlfriends? I think
that that would help gridlock by, uh,

1032
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,930
a hundred percent kept clashing.
Not 100%, but you know what I mean?

1033
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,090
Some point I can't wait.
I hope I live long enough to see that.

1034
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,980
I really want to see that argument
where they somehow finesse in,

1035
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,130
you have to stop having
kids because there's,

1036
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,620
there's no, there's no farmland. There's
nothing left, you know what I'm saying?

1037
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,050
And then just all the Jesus freaks
going while the bottle said,

1038
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,900
go for food is multiply.
Lord said it.

1039
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:52,180
He said it really, it wasn't a
bunch of people just writing it. No,

1040
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,430
he said it.
He said it.

1041
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,431
And then he had a kid and a kid was in
some woman who was never impregnated and

1042
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:05,551
he walked on water to cure a leper and
he does a lot of Jews even though he was

1043
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:11,380
one. Oh my God. Hopefully
you know something.

1044
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:13,630
I really am as cynical bastard tried.
Definitely.

1045
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,010
I still believe in a higher power though.

1046
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,450
But like I gotta admit I'm
lost because I don't know what,

1047
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:22,210
I can't go to any of these, uh, you know,

1048
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,160
from the Catholic Church to Scientology.
I just can't, you know, I can't fucking,

1049
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,080
I dunno.

1050
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,070
Do you have a look at a picture yourself
from five years ago when you just think,

1051
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:33,221
you know,

1052
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:37,120
I was so much better a person then how
do I get back to being that person?

1053
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:40,510
That's where I am in my life right
now. You know, I'm trying to do,

1054
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,740
trying to do some better. I don't know
what the fuck I'm talking about this week.

1055
01:06:44,741 --> 01:06:48,730
All right, let's, let's, let's, let's move
on here before I do my, I tell you guys,

1056
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:53,350
I'm doing that teen 90 x system for
fucking 40 year old douche bags like me.

1057
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:54,190
It's actually great.

1058
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:57,970
It's a great system and I'm just killing
time right now as I tried to get to the

1059
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:01,570
next point. Okay, here we go.
Uh, how to link to my podcast.

1060
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:06,130
This is something else I should
have done upfront. Um, you log in,

1061
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,360
you log into Google with an
account. Yes, I am reading this.

1062
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,490
Um,

1063
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,520
go to google.com/reader/view click on add
as added at a subscription on the left

1064
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:23,950
hand side of the page. Oh my God.
And then paste this in the box.

1065
01:07:23,951 --> 01:07:27,100
I can't read that. That's
like too much. All right.

1066
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,530
Evidently I can't tell you how
to link to my podcast. All right,

1067
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:31,120
let's move on to the next fucking issue.

1068
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,930
I really loving how this is becoming
like the morons meet the press,

1069
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,340
my podcasts,

1070
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,710
we're discussing issues like that last
guy who I just screamed that he basically

1071
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,410
has no more information on
global warming than I do.

1072
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,440
He just has his gut opinion
that says it's bullshit.

1073
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,190
And I watched the discovery channel
and I saw a brown and white bear,

1074
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:56,020
this grizzly polar bear that they called
the piddly there because they're now

1075
01:07:56,021 --> 01:08:00,620
meeting and fucking, and how do I know
it exists? Because some redneck shot,

1076
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,823
that's what happens.

1077
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:07,840
I don't know what the fuck it was all
shot in the face and now I'm standing next

1078
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:12,190
to it. And then I went and
I found a scientist. Do you
know what the fuck this is?

1079
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:16,520
Whatever it is, I killed. All right.

1080
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:20,690
The checkout line argument is still
continuing. All right? Some people, uh,

1081
01:08:20,691 --> 01:08:22,370
I don't know if you're new to my podcast,

1082
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:26,640
I'm in front of bloat from my explanation.
Um,

1083
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:31,790
and a lot of people love had been arguing
with me that the automated checkouts,

1084
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:35,930
um, where they make the customer
work as a cashier for free.

1085
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,190
There's somehow telling me that this is
progress and they are equating it with

1086
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:42,170
great inventions of the past.

1087
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,440
I kinda got into it with some
guy on the Internet where he was,

1088
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,850
I can't find the email
because I'm disorganized. He
brought up some sort of um,

1089
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:55,790
some sort of machine like a hundred or
so 150 years ago that came out and the

1090
01:08:55,791 --> 01:09:00,380
textile mills that would obviously
do the work of like 10 20 people.

1091
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,250
So this one guy started revolt going,
this is all going to put us out of work.

1092
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:07,850
And Him and his friends came in and they
attack the machines and all that type

1093
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:12,851
of shit and he tried to equate
that with the cashier thing.

1094
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,280
And I'm not saying that I am against
inventions straight across the board just

1095
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:21,800
because they put people out of work.

1096
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:26,801
Like to me that's not the same example
because it's not like they came out with

1097
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:32,891
a new cashier machine that does the
work of 10 cashiers while I just fucking

1098
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:34,724
stand there.

1099
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:40,480
They just came up with a
new cashier machine that now
I have to operate and then

1100
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:44,270
I have to bag my own groceries.
That's not progress.

1101
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:49,190
That's making me do the fucking job.
And actually to his credit, he goes,

1102
01:09:49,191 --> 01:09:50,210
you know what?
Fair enough.

1103
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:53,810
You are right on that because I'm not
against them coming up with a machine that

1104
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:58,010
does the work at 10 textile mill workers.
I'm really not against that.

1105
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,170
And uh, because at no point does it then
require me to go down to the factory in,

1106
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:06,950
so my own fucking shirt, that
is my point. But despite that,

1107
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:11,930
people still have opinions that they
like them. Here we go. Here's one. Um,

1108
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,900
what a fuck is it? God dammit, I can't
find it. It was a great one. Hold on,

1109
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:20,570
hold on, hold on, hold on.

1110
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:26,110
Just keep yourselves
busy. Um, all right. You,

1111
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,730
you actually just fell into underrated.
That's why I couldn't find it. Um,

1112
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:30,230
somebody will,
you know what's underrated?

1113
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,830
Those self service tills
at the grocery store,

1114
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,500
I'm going to assume you
don't understand what it is,

1115
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:41,210
what it's like to not want to talk to
someone about the effectiveness of the

1116
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:45,830
Maxi pad you're buying or if some hair
conditioner really works, et Cetera.

1117
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,910
There is always a fucking conversation
and it's always fucking annoying.

1118
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:55,240
I feel bad that maybe someone might be
out of a job because I don't like making

1119
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:57,500
a name conversation
with other human beings.

1120
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:01,790
But Sundays being able to get in and
out without speaking to anyone is all I

1121
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:05,120
really want. Uh, you know,

1122
01:11:05,121 --> 01:11:08,450
I have mixed emotions on that one cause
I understand not wanting to get into an

1123
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:12,500
annoying conversation like that fucking
Douche bag with their green peace

1124
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,330
sweatshirt,
you know,

1125
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,480
pay Prius driver. I
understand that. But um,

1126
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,040
I would rather have an an a personally,

1127
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:27,210
I'd rather have an annoying conversation
then know that I helped to put another

1128
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:31,890
foot on the yacht of some corporate
fucking Douche bag because I just put

1129
01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:32,770
another person out of,

1130
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,440
out of work who's probably already
eating macaroni and cheese nine times a

1131
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:42,030
fucking week anyways.
Um, all right. What else?

1132
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:45,300
Some other people, like some
people agree, some people don't.

1133
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,850
I think we've beaten this thing to death,
you know,

1134
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,500
I don't know what to tell
you guys. I just fuck it.

1135
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:59,340
I'll just get you, keep having kids. Keep,
keep going with the computers, you know,

1136
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:03,600
line up for the microchip in your head.
It's all going to be good. It's all great.

1137
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,480
It's all fucking great. Everything's
great, everything's wonderful.

1138
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:08,820
Global warming doesn't exist.
It's all awesome.

1139
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:14,480
Go see that new movie that that fucking
crooked nose guy is in with Jennifer

1140
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:17,190
Aniston about the dogs.
You know,

1141
01:12:17,191 --> 01:12:20,430
take your fucking kids there who are
going to add to the mess. You know,

1142
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:26,520
an SUV when they turned 16 Jesus Christ,
I am on my soapbox is fucking week.

1143
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,760
I really need to shut the fuck up. Let's
move on to the questions. All right.

1144
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,870
Whenever I get this
way, by the way, people,

1145
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,790
I'm really not this
passionate about the subjects.

1146
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,090
That means I have other shit going on in
my life that's causing me stress and I

1147
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:42,060
have an inability to focus on the
thing that's causing me stress.

1148
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:46,920
So I rant about other stuff and annoyed
the shit out of people. All right.

1149
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:50,730
Question number one. Hey, I
think you'll like this one.

1150
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,360
That's how somebody just started it out
and then for some reason I didn't erase

1151
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:58,140
that part. Um, there's a forward,
oh, this is more of a story.

1152
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:00,140
And then I guess a question.
All right.

1153
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:02,940
This is a four way intersection that
I drive through on my way to work.

1154
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,640
A lot of people keep getting
into car accidents there.

1155
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,830
Well for about a month I could tell they
were installing a traffic lights, um,

1156
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,380
because they had tons of poles and wires
and construction workers where they are

1157
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:14,214
all the time.

1158
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:18,060
Or when they finish installing the new
traffic lights with the Green Arrows

1159
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,210
alliance, allowing people to
turn and not get into accidents.

1160
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:25,200
They also installed cameras
looking in every direction.

1161
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,230
Am I crazy to be really bugged by that?

1162
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:32,070
I live in a small area about 30,000
people and they definitely could've told

1163
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:35,280
local residents with a letter that they'd
be putting in cameras or something.

1164
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,760
If they can't afford a cop
to watch the intersection,

1165
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:42,800
then they shouldn't have cameras there.
Right. People will slow down for a comp,

1166
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:46,500
but nobody cares about a camera. It's
not like they, it's not like that.

1167
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:49,560
We'll stop bad driving. It
doesn't, it doesn't even end there.

1168
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:54,150
They put even more cameras towards the
downtown area, so when I drive into work,

1169
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:58,020
I could be photographed or tape
twice in a span of seven miles.

1170
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:03,270
Would this bug you too? Would you do
anything about it too? Awesome questions?

1171
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,270
Yes, that would bug me.
Would I do anything about it?

1172
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,130
I probably do what I do on this podcast.

1173
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:14,060
I'd sit in the bed and bitch about
it and not join a group that would

1174
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:18,010
effectively try to make a change because
they judge me because I drive a Prius.

1175
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,300
Yeah, it does bug me. It does
bug me. I think it's bullshit.

1176
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,580
I bugged me on two levels.
It's a way for them to just,

1177
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,381
I guess,

1178
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:37,381
nail every single person who sorta sorta
ran a red light and just give everybody

1179
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:42,460
a ticket so they can have even more money,
you know,

1180
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:47,710
to, to just fucking give away to some
Douche bag that they're going to pay eight

1181
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:50,920
bucks for a ham for. You know what I mean?
I really can't explain anything today.

1182
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,450
What is wrong with me?
You know what I'm saying?

1183
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:56,860
If I that's like some boss hog shit
that's like putting down the fake fire

1184
01:14:56,861 --> 01:14:59,890
hydrant. Um, yeah.

1185
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:02,980
I really find it disturbing that in the
future I'm going to have absolutely no

1186
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:06,970
privacy. I mean, it's not like they're
going to watch every second of footage,

1187
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,060
but just to know that at no point am I,
you know,

1188
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,660
can I just like being my alone,

1189
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,530
that's what freaks me out about the
future and going to let shit I was talking

1190
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:18,820
about last week while I was on,
you know,

1191
01:15:18,821 --> 01:15:23,650
watching 60 minutes and they're in the
beginning stages of having computers have

1192
01:15:23,651 --> 01:15:28,180
the ability to read someone's mind.
I mean,

1193
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:30,820
think about that shit.
They're already putting microchips in,

1194
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:34,030
people at the upper corporate level.

1195
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:37,660
They'll love computers to be able to read
your mind and there'll be able to film

1196
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:41,290
you every way you go. You know, it's like,

1197
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,930
that's to me is a,

1198
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:50,290
that's like all those science
fiction fucking movies. Um,

1199
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,570
I dunno what I do anything about it. I, I,
you know, the movie version of me would,

1200
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,210
and I would turn into a Ellen, uh, Erin
Brockovich or whatever fucking name is,

1201
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:05,200
but uh, yeah. You know what would make
me feel good? I'm one of those people,

1202
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:09,700
I don't start shit. I, I, I don't
do anything. I don't join two.

1203
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:12,910
I joined shit too. I don't know. If it was
a movement, I would definitely join it.

1204
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,960
I just hate how protesting has been.
It's turned into like a cliche thing.

1205
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,640
Like if I actually went to a protest
and I had a sign and I was chanting

1206
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:25,750
something that rhymes with four, you know,
it always has to rhyme with four, one,

1207
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:30,460
two, three, four wheel
Duggan more. No, no,

1208
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:34,900
no, no, no, no. Not a whore. Right.
It always has to rhyme with four.

1209
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,280
Why is it, you know why that is is
because musically, all our, all our,

1210
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:44,050
all our music is in four,
four time.

1211
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:47,110
That's like common time and we
just kind of go with that rhythm

1212
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,040
like in the Far East like
they play in like I dunno

1213
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,910
like that Vinnie Kali Uta time,

1214
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:59,911
like fucking 17 eight or whatever the
fuck it is and they can all sit there and

1215
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:04,570
bounce and they have the patience to
wait for the person to count up to 17 and

1216
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:09,571
with their crazy language they have words
that Ryan was 1717 you're fucking in

1217
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:19,130
the hummus team or
whatever the fuck the fuck.

1218
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,910
I don't know. Question number
two. Here we go. Hey Bill.

1219
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,660
Was there ever a crossover period in your
career where you were still working a

1220
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:32,420
day job but getting
successful as a comedian?

1221
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:37,610
Did anyone ever recognize you at your
day job sparking a Mickey Rourke temper

1222
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,580
Tantrum at which deli displays

1223
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,150
if anybody, if any, did you body
slam? Dude, what the fuck happened?

1224
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:51,110
The rest of that sentence.
Did anyone ever recognize you at work?

1225
01:17:51,111 --> 01:17:53,330
Sparking and Mickey Work?
Temper tantrum.

1226
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,380
And then this is the rest of his sentence.
At which Deli displays,

1227
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:02,050
if any, did you body
slowed? Okay. Oh I know of.

1228
01:18:02,051 --> 01:18:04,910
There was no comma in there.
It should have been at,

1229
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:10,070
at which deli displays comma if any.
I Dunno.

1230
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:13,040
I Dunno what they should be a comma in
there cause I can't figure out what the

1231
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:17,960
fuck that means. That I have a
body slam someone at a deli. Um,

1232
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,800
does anyone ever recognize
me at my day job? Uh,

1233
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,700
no.
I,

1234
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:30,150
I want to say maybe once
and I was thrilled because
I never got recognized and I

1235
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,220
felt like somebody,
you know,

1236
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,630
which I think is very poignant
on Martin Luther King Day.

1237
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:43,750
I am somebody I did five minutes
at the comedy Ville comedy vault.

1238
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,120
I used to go up and Dick Doherty's,
comedy volt and Remington.

1239
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:54,950
And uh, it's actually one of the things
I like to do when I go back to Boston.

1240
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:57,980
I'm not working, I go back to that
club cause it's still fucking exist.

1241
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,170
So I put my first five minutes
together on Boylston street. Um,

1242
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:07,190
yeah. So no, no one ever recognized
me. You basically, you have to be,

1243
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,713
um,

1244
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:13,550
you have to be on TV for a long
time to start getting recognized.

1245
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,310
Um, you know, it's weird, like

1246
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,830
you'd think if you did stand up on like
a Conan O'brien the next day you walked

1247
01:19:23,831 --> 01:19:24,664
down the street,

1248
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,520
if millions of people watching a bunch of
people would recognize you, they don't,

1249
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,740
uh,
they don't.

1250
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:37,700
So you have to be,
you gotta be super famous and then,

1251
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,990
or at least famous,

1252
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:43,130
and then you have to fall off and then
have to get a day job and then they

1253
01:19:43,131 --> 01:19:45,320
recognize you.
It's weird.

1254
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:48,890
People recognize you on
the back backside of fame,

1255
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:53,840
you know. And speaking of which, you know,

1256
01:19:53,841 --> 01:19:56,340
being 40 years of age,
um,

1257
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:59,810
I did what you're the responsible
person supposed to do.

1258
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,050
You know,
the May I fucking,

1259
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:07,800
when I actually got my God damn prostate
checked and uh, got to tell you, dude,

1260
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:08,790
do you want to talk about the,

1261
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,280
that's the other side of fame
that people don't bring up.

1262
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,710
I was really happy that I have a low
level because when people look at same and

1263
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:21,270
they just think like, you know, court
side seats to fucking the Lakers,

1264
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,130
you fucking a supermodel,

1265
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:26,220
they don't think that you still
have to get your prostate checked

1266
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:33,100
and you don't have the ability to walk
into the office as an an anonymous,

1267
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:38,100
an anonymous person, you know, thank
God this guy wasn't a comedy fan. So

1268
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,620
my prostate is fine by the way.
You know,

1269
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,250
psychologically I don't know how I
am after that. It was just fucking,

1270
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,600
it's horrific.

1271
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,170
And I gotta tell you something when
they tell you there's nothing wrong with

1272
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:55,620
your prostate, you really have
mixed emotions at that point.

1273
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:59,040
Cause you site that you're not
going to die of ass cancer.

1274
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:03,630
But on the other side does immediately
a jolt of anger where you like. So it's,

1275
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:06,270
so that means you really didn't
fucking have to do that then did you?

1276
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:08,550
I don't know.

1277
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:12,060
I just came to peace with the fact
that his job is just fucking horrific.

1278
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,560
Said for me. It's just a
fucking horrible eight seconds.

1279
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:19,140
And then I can just,
you know,

1280
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:24,300
turn on the radio at full volume and
drive away and try to kill the thoughts of

1281
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,134
horror.

1282
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:29,430
Where is he has to then just because
he has to just do that all day long.

1283
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,620
Uh,
you know something.

1284
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:37,440
I think the fact that I just
talked about this on my podcast,

1285
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:42,120
I'm now emotionally fucking dealing
with the fact that another man put his

1286
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:45,720
finger on my ass and he's just fucking,
you know,

1287
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,550
and it's done very professionally.

1288
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,650
It's not like he's whispering in your ear
like, you know, like this, it's not that,

1289
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:58,830
oh my God,
I got to go to therapy.

1290
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:02,250
I still fucking horrible.
I let another man do that.

1291
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:06,990
And there was nothing wrong with me.
You know,

1292
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:13,080
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

1293
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:17,940
I think this is the end of the podcast.
I really,

1294
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:22,290
I really don't know how to process that.
I really don't know how to process that.

1295
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:24,540
And you know, you know,
it's funny, as you know,

1296
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:28,620
in five years they're going to have a
way to do it where they don't have to do

1297
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:30,870
that. You know what I mean? Like,

1298
01:22:30,871 --> 01:22:35,070
I just did the ass version of
electroshock fucking treatment.

1299
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,740
That is what they should do. They should
put like a fucking Arrow in your mouth.

1300
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,910
You know, I don't think I'm going to
be able to stop talking about this.

1301
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:49,290
It's just fucking horrific.
Fucking horrific.

1302
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,330
Um, okay, let's grit the teeth and
let's move on to question number three.

1303
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:00,180
Who, wow. Wow.

1304
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,660
All right. Yeah. What the fuck? All right.

1305
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,940
What if that's all a scam?
Forget about global warming.

1306
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,910
Oh my God. Question number three.
Come on bill. You can do it.

1307
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,650
You can do it.
Hey Bill,

1308
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:18,940
do you ever think of how ironic it is
that Hitler didn't have blonde hair and

1309
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:22,120
blue eyes?
Um,

1310
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,160
no. No I didn't. I've heard that argument.

1311
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:31,990
I find it more weird that he was just
a complete fucking spats and people

1312
01:23:31,991 --> 01:23:36,130
followed him. I mean, he had
the classic spazz haircut,

1313
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:41,230
you know, that's shorts stuff on
the side and it's all long on top.

1314
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,100
I mean that, I mean, if there's
any kids listening to this shit,

1315
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:49,060
it's like if you really want to just
up the chances of you getting fucking

1316
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:50,620
slapped in the back of the head,

1317
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:56,010
buzz the back of the size of the ahead
and then leave it long on top and mean

1318
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:59,710
it's classic in naked head
is just sitting there,

1319
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:03,430
which is just going to make a football
player want to slap you with those three

1320
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:07,660
fingers right in the back of your head
so he can watch your colic flap around on

1321
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:11,920
your forehead. Um, again, you know,

1322
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:12,731
I've heard that before.

1323
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:16,030
I've heard people talk about how
Kettler didn't even fit into his, uh,

1324
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:21,520
his, um, his view of,
of, of the perfect race.

1325
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,440
I think it was like a self hate.

1326
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:27,460
He was like a chick who was born or
Brunette and always wanted to be a blonde.

1327
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,171
You know,

1328
01:24:29,171 --> 01:24:33,640
he just sort of bought into what he was
like a self hating Brunette that somehow

1329
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:37,720
convinced people to kill
like 10 million people. Um,

1330
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:39,191
you know,

1331
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:42,700
and I like to say that we've moved beyond
that and in our society and you know,

1332
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:47,701
judging by people's reactions to fucking
microchips and being filmed every five

1333
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:51,250
seconds and being like, well, you know,
if you're not doing anything wrong,

1334
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:56,250
I really think that there's another
Hitler and our future. Um, all right,

1335
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:59,140
bill number five. Hey
Bill, what's the, uh,

1336
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,890
worst slash most embarrassing
thing you've ever done to get laid?

1337
01:25:02,891 --> 01:25:06,250
For me it was watching ballet.
Um,

1338
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,630
all right, let's see here.
The worst thing I ever did,

1339
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:15,190
I'll tell you the last most lost I've
ever gotten in a relationship was I dated

1340
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:19,750
a girl who sang in a
band and I was about 20,

1341
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:22,600
21 years old and she was like 30,
31.

1342
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:27,760
And uh, she's saying in this
band that was called, uh,

1343
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:34,450
I don't know what it was called.
Fuck was the name of the band.

1344
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:39,070
God, I'm so old now. What's a, what's a,

1345
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:43,690
what's a male? It was something
in the girls was a guy's name,

1346
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:47,320
like Mike and Mike and the girls.
And it was basically,

1347
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:51,010
they did like cover songs and
there was three, three hotties,

1348
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:55,600
you know, like the Andrews sisters
and they would sing fucking, you know,

1349
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:01,930
awful Bryan Adams songs and
CNC music factory. Shit.

1350
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:06,260
This is how long ago it was. And then
the dude would be playing the keyboard.

1351
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:11,290
And I sat in the audience with a
Michael and the girls sweatshirt

1352
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:17,810
that was written in three
different levels of pastel.

1353
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:23,390
You understand?
Like it was like the Miami Vice Aqua blue,

1354
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:28,370
the hot pink and some
other awful pastel color.

1355
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:30,560
You know what it look like?

1356
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:34,760
It looked like Demi Moore eye shadow
and that famous eighties picture of her

1357
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,910
where she has her hair all crimped,
whatever the fuck that was.

1358
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:41,990
You know what girls used to do that and
their hair used to look like a staircase

1359
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,280
descending down to the
[inaudible]. Um, yeah.

1360
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:49,730
And I sat in the audience and I
remember sitting outside myself going,

1361
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,670
how the fuck do I get out of this?

1362
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:58,230
How do I get out of this? This is not,
uh, I was just psyched to be getting late.

1363
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:02,150
You know, I was definitely a late bloomer
and I was banging on this hot broad,

1364
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:05,270
who's like 10 years old.
I mean it's sang in a band and you know,

1365
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:09,050
that was all my Dick just going
like, yeah, keep blowing me,

1366
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:10,130
I'll load a sweatshirt.

1367
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:14,390
And then I was actually in public
by myself sitting in the crowd.

1368
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:18,560
And uh, that's one of those
things where it was almost like,

1369
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:21,140
you know when you were in first grade
and your mother gives, your mother,

1370
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:24,890
gives you the shirt your grandmother
bought you and you're kind of thinking you

1371
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:26,810
back of the head.
You kind of haven't thoughts like,

1372
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:31,260
does this shirt like fucking gay? Is
it, I don't know. You just, you know,

1373
01:27:31,261 --> 01:27:34,030
and then you watch a cartoon and then
you go to school and then all this,

1374
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,980
the second you get on the bus, it's
just like everyone just starts, dude,

1375
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:41,600
what's with your shirt at? Then it
starts and then you like, oh my God,

1376
01:27:41,601 --> 01:27:46,220
this is going to be the longest fucking
day of my life. And everybody just,

1377
01:27:46,221 --> 01:27:46,461
I mean,

1378
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:51,461
you lose like half your friends that day
and you contemplate kissing your pants

1379
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:55,730
so you can just fucking get out of school
or are claiming you have chicken pox

1380
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:59,030
or anything just to get the fuck out of
it. That was the adult version of that.

1381
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:00,943
And uh,

1382
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:06,400
I remember I walked out of the
place where they had the Gig and I,

1383
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,980
and I went into a bar.
I was trying to reclaim my manhood,

1384
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,440
but I still had that
fucking sweatshirt on.

1385
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:17,180
I think I took it off and I turned it
inside out and I just drank at this bar

1386
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:20,950
for the rest of their show. And
then I walked back, hammered and I,

1387
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,520
I think I turned it back in. And you
know, I hate that part of my life.

1388
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,030
I really do. I don't even want to
bring it up on, I resent that question.

1389
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:34,280
What a fucking Douche.
Like now I just, I dunno,

1390
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,260
it's all part of the learning process.
People.

1391
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,140
This is a really fucking
becoming a dark podcast.

1392
01:28:39,141 --> 01:28:44,060
I'm just admitting to horrible things
that have happened to me. All right.

1393
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,710
Um,
index,

1394
01:28:45,711 --> 01:28:50,030
anal rape and an awful fucking sweatshirt.
All right,

1395
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:53,930
question number six, Bill. Hey, what's
the worst slash most embarrassing thing?

1396
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:57,830
Oh, I've already read that one. I'm
so fucked up right now. Emotionally.

1397
01:28:57,831 --> 01:29:02,280
I just reread that question. Wait
a second. Oh, I have it down twice.

1398
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:06,750
So that wasn't me.
All right,

1399
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:09,990
let's move on to underrated,
underrated, overrated. This is really,

1400
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:12,750
I like the awkward pauses at this
point is I'm trying to fucking

1401
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:17,760
mentally deal with what the
fuck happened to me last week.

1402
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,680
I really didn't emotionally
even deal with that

1403
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:26,460
big deal. It's a medical
procedure. You did the smart thing.

1404
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:30,120
I know I did the smart thing, but did
it, I have to go through that process.

1405
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:35,610
All right, Bill. Um, my friend and I have
a couple of ideas for you. Uh, all right.

1406
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,900
Overrated.
Crown Royal Crown Royal is overrated.

1407
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:44,820
Okay. I can't agree with you on
that one. I think it's fun tickets,

1408
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:48,150
tremendous underrated.
Woodford reserve.

1409
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,100
Basil Hayden, four roses, single barrel.

1410
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,580
These obviously whiskeys were from
Kentucky and a little biased. Oh,

1411
01:29:56,581 --> 01:30:00,600
well fuck it. All right. Now
I have to try those. You know,

1412
01:30:00,601 --> 01:30:03,930
there's a bar in downtown la called
the seven grand. It's a whiskey bar.

1413
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:08,460
They have all kinds of, uh, I'm
going to try that four roses,

1414
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:13,110
single barrel and actually
sounds good. Um, overrated.

1415
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:17,520
All the damn spitting in pornos.
What the fuck?

1416
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:21,530
Spitting and a-holes
spitting in Vijay Ga's,

1417
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:23,490
spitting on the pain.
I,

1418
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:28,800
when did hawking a Lougie becomes
sexy. Yeah, that is pretty disgusting.

1419
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:32,460
I've actually sworn myself off of porno.
Um,

1420
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,450
I was a big fan of, uh, this one website,

1421
01:30:36,451 --> 01:30:41,451
which I'm not going to name just because
I feel like a crack dealer because it's

1422
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:45,570
a free porno site and I don't want to
put the name of it out there and get

1423
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:49,380
somebody else hooked.
And, uh, I just, you know,

1424
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:54,780
I just decided I wasn't going to go on
there anymore because I was finding shit

1425
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:59,400
that used to turn me on. I
found it to be boring, you know,

1426
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:04,020
and then you start progressively
moving towards sicker and sicker,

1427
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:06,480
crazier shit. And I'm just
like, I can't fucking do that.

1428
01:31:06,481 --> 01:31:11,420
So I know I've mentioned on
a number of times that, uh,

1429
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:15,210
I've been trying to fucking
stop doing that. You know,

1430
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,400
you know something, I, I really,
I really think that that shifts,

1431
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:24,930
it's just not good.
It's just not good for you.

1432
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:29,790
You ever think about how fucked
up that is? That you can just,

1433
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,033
you know,

1434
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:35,970
think of something that you want to see
and you can go on the Internet and you

1435
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:40,640
can just find it. And how, back
in the day when you were a,

1436
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:44,730
you know, little house
on the prairie, I mean,

1437
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:47,520
all he ain't just had was your
imagination. I'm not saying he,

1438
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,680
people didn't lay in the fields,

1439
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:57,140
lay down in the barley and take down their
trousers and a a but, whoa, whoa. What,

1440
01:31:57,141 --> 01:32:01,090
what could you possibly
could people even comprehend?

1441
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:07,180
You know, some of the shit that people
have come up with at this point,

1442
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,860
I don't think you could.

1443
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,600
There's no way that you could think of
some of the shit that they have on there.

1444
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,550
If like musically you're just that
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care.

1445
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:23,290
Actually, that's not true.
They had Beethoven, they had
classical music, but still,

1446
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:27,700
you know, I dunno. Like I said,

1447
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:31,210
I just looked at a picture of myself like
from four or five years ago and I was

1448
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:35,680
just like, you know, I was a
lot better person back then.

1449
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:38,260
So, uh, you know, this
is actually been a very,

1450
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:41,110
a very sad melancholy fucking podcast

1451
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:47,650
and uh, yeah, that's it. I'm
going to end on that. No,

1452
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:55,060
because I have to emotionally
deal with the fact that a, yeah,

1453
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,960
I got to deal with that shift
at whatever's in medical
as a medical procedure.

1454
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:01,830
It doesn't count, right. Fuck.

1455
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,920
Anyways, so I'm going to hit the
Improv in Houston this weekend.

1456
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:11,110
I want to be extra funny because
I want to be burying that, uh,

1457
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:14,350
that procedure deep in my psyche.

1458
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:17,770
And I probably won't be talking about
it on stage just because every comedian

1459
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:22,100
over 40 who's had that procedure then
goes on stage and talks about it.

1460
01:33:22,101 --> 01:33:26,760
It's all stared in there.
Uh, I got the bug in Pega on,

1461
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:28,510
in my ass is hanging out.

1462
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:35,590
You know who, who goes to school
to become that guy, if any.

1463
01:33:35,670 --> 01:33:37,330
That there's your homework for the week.

1464
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:42,331
If anybody can come up with a
new standup comedy angle on,

1465
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,960
I had to get my prostate checked.
Um,

1466
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:50,380
I'll give you a free DVD.

1467
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,800
I will literally fucking mail it to
your fucking house and I'm not joking.

1468
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:57,370
All right. If you can somehow
come up with a new angle,

1469
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:02,830
that's actually a no, you don't, I'm
not going to put any parameters on it.

1470
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:06,220
They can go clean. You can
go dirty, you can go clever.

1471
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,060
You can even be a guitar act if
you want to write a song about it.

1472
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:14,160
I don't give a fuck if you can somehow
come up with something. You know,

1473
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:18,970
you got a couple of days to this offer
expires Thursday afternoon because by

1474
01:34:18,971 --> 01:34:22,050
then I'm going to be on my
way over to the club in, uh,

1475
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:27,190
in Houston, Texas. Oh, speaking of
which, you know what, I fucking, uh,

1476
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:32,170
you, one of the things I like going about
to Houston as they got a mall out there

1477
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:35,320
that actually has a skating rink in the
mall and it's the funniest thing ever.

1478
01:34:35,321 --> 01:34:38,900
You can actually go ice skating right
near the food court as you watch. In fact,

1479
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:41,830
Fox eating orange chicken
and you're burning calories.

1480
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:46,420
And a actually when
skating out here recently,

1481
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:47,680
I just hate going to the gym people.

1482
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:50,440
That's basically it sound like
I can burn calories doing that.

1483
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,520
So I go out to Burbank,

1484
01:34:51,521 --> 01:34:55,270
it's like 80 fucking degrees out and
I go onto a skating rink out there.

1485
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:58,610
It's the worst fucking ice
I've ever on it in my life.

1486
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,920
It's like the cracks in the ice.
I mean it's, it's unbelievable.

1487
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:10,330
It's like Tiger Marcel Dion skated on
this fucking ice back when the kings wore

1488
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:15,010
the colors of royalty.
And um,

1489
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:20,600
I get over there and there's literally
like 15 other people out there and uh,

1490
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:25,100
I have a question for, uh, people who are
Asian, not Indian people who are like,

1491
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:27,620
you know, Chinese, Japanese,
Korean or whatever. Like,

1492
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:30,920
I'm really interested
in your culture that,

1493
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:36,850
you know, it seems to
me that like, I dunno,

1494
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:41,360
I just never see you guys get
angry. You know, I'm sitting there,

1495
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:46,420
there was like five Asian dudes and
they suck to get skating and they,

1496
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,600
and they just kept falling
down like really hard.

1497
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:57,220
Like they be getting going fast and they
would fucking roof really hit the ice

1498
01:35:57,381 --> 01:35:57,711
hard.

1499
01:35:57,711 --> 01:36:02,711
And every time they would get up smiling
with like this self deprecating when I

1500
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:07,880
go, I was still bad. Look on
their face and my, you know,

1501
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:12,590
and everybody else in that group or
just sort of laugh and I just was

1502
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:13,250
fascinated.

1503
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:18,250
I mean it's like I never saw maybe like
an American version of an Asian person.

1504
01:36:20,631 --> 01:36:24,890
You'll see, you'll see one of them go like
fuck if they'd like stubbed their toe.

1505
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:28,460
But these like dudes are like whacking
the heads and shit and they just kept

1506
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:32,780
smiling. And I'm not gonna lie to
you. I was laughing my ass off.

1507
01:36:32,781 --> 01:36:36,710
But then after a while it just became
bizarre. And then I felt bad about myself.

1508
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:36,891
Like,

1509
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:40,430
what's wrong with me as a human being
that I can't laugh off the little things

1510
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:44,690
in life, but you know to me
once you fall for the 15th time,

1511
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:47,630
that's not a little thing anymore.
That's like a major God damn problem.

1512
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:48,831
Then you should,

1513
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:53,831
you know mine's be that Stephen
King Book were there was,

1514
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:57,080
there was the music guy
and those I got dammit,

1515
01:36:57,081 --> 01:37:00,020
I didn't close my fucking refrigerator.
I hate when I do that.

1516
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:03,680
It's refrigerated.
Such a piece of fucking shit.

1517
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:10,980
Don't you know your frigerator
you supposed to have to
hold the door open and if

1518
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:14,360
you don't hold the door open,
it's supposed to do this. Listen,

1519
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,530
it's supposed to close but not mine.
Mine just stays open.

1520
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:24,680
Cut the shit and to global
warming right there.

1521
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:27,890
I want to go to the fucking energy.
I just wasted anyways. What the hell.

1522
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:31,710
I was talking about Asian people fallen
on the ice and not in a, not, not caring.

1523
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:33,683
I don't know.

1524
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:37,520
It's just been a really weird podcast and
I don't even know how I feel about it,

1525
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:42,500
but um, anyways, that's it. I'm done.

1526
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:47,000
I have to go work out. All right. You
guys were a very patient with this one.

1527
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:49,840
Please keep the, uh, the questions
and everything like that coming in.

1528
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:51,680
Please let me get the momentum going here.

1529
01:37:51,681 --> 01:37:53,690
Please come out and see me
at the Improv and Houston,

1530
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:55,770
please come out to that show.
Please.

1531
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,920
I'm begging people because
every time I go there, you know,

1532
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,870
didn't like nobody shows up.

1533
01:38:00,871 --> 01:38:03,450
And I know I said that about
Tampa and people showed up.

1534
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,250
I don't know if cause I
have a new special out,

1535
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:09,450
things are finally going to change, but,
uh, please, for the love of God, show up.

1536
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:13,740
Bring 15 fucking people,
you know, just, you know,

1537
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:17,310
I wrote a new hour. I'm literally begging
you. Okay. Just for the love of God,

1538
01:38:17,311 --> 01:38:22,230
I had a really rough week. I did violated.
Okay. I've seen confusing things.

1539
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,470
I've seen a group of people fall on
the ice and not get mad about it.

1540
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,730
And I left my refrigerator door open.
