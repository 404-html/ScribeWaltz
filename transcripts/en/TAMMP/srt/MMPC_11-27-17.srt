1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,300
Hey,

Burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

November 26th,
2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,360
How? Wow. Yeah. What's up?

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,590
What's going on? How was
your thanksgiving? How was
your Thanksgiving Week? Oh,

6
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:23,730
it's over. Huh? Jesus Christ.
Isn't that a great weekend? It's,

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,450
it's the best. It's the,
if you don't fucking,

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,490
if you don't have to go anywhere, first
of all, if you don't have to go anywhere,

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,110
you know, if you get, you get
a wife and you've got a kid,

10
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:38,010
you don't have to go anywhere. People
just come into your place. It's the best,

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,560
you know, all your stuff is there
in the end. People help clean up.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,080
I literally, I had the perfect
thanksgiving. It was perfect.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,230
Did I want to thank you?

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,990
Oh, I can't yell. My daughter's
asleep. Fuck, I'm taping
this at night. Sunday night.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,180
Um,
the potato sweet potato pie killed.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,280
I think I gave out some misinformation.

17
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:08,480
I just bought the wrong kind of
sweet potato. I bought a, uh,

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,720
it was the white one, which I'm
hurt. I used for other desserts,

19
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,280
but not for the Pi,

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,420
but people do actually use sweet
potatoes for sweet potato pie.

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,550
You can also actually use yams.
That's what I used. Yams, brown sugar,

22
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,440
cinnamon, some Nutmeg, a
little bit of ginger. Um,

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,750
some vanilla,
whatever,

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,830
and a whole bunch of sugar stirred the
whole thing together. And I tell you,

25
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,850
I was sweating it. Okay. Fucking
white guy making a sweet potato pie,

26
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,890
you know what I mean? I mean,
I'm living dangerously here.

27
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,880
I thought it was going to get
booed like at the Apollo and uh,

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,600
maybe people were just being nice, but
I think, uh, I think everybody liked it.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,100
Um, so I was psyched. And
then my stuffing always kills.

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,590
I stuffing always kills.
You know why?

31
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:58,280
Because it starts off with me melting
as an entire stick of butter in a pan.

32
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,570
That's where,
and I go from there.

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,350
I don't care what you make and you can't
lose if you start by melting a stick of

34
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:09,320
butter and a parent, you know, um,

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,050
he's fucking lunatics nowadays.
They will take that note.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,210
Can I pour that entire thing into my
coffee? I don't know what's going on.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,020
All right. I have a lot of stuff
to promote. I apologize for the AC,

38
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:22,280
but it's as hot as shit in here.

39
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,130
I don't know if he can hear that
running over my loudest voice here.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,690
A bunch of stuff.

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,720

and been taken care of. So, um,

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,510
it's so one of the things I'm most
proud of as far as all the things that,

75
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,880
um,
you know,

76
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,970
I've done in this business and I've
watched my friends do the fact that we all

77
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,560
get together and make sure that his mom
and his family are right around right is,

78
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,530

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,750

80
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:52,360

might as well promote a few other things,

81
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,500
is a speaking of comedians and I got
to get her on this benefit one of these

82
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,800
years. A good friend of mine
from way back in the day,

83
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,820
it became a film maker and is now back
is back then when stand up Maya to

84
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:08,740
Giorgio. Um, absolutely fucking hilarious.

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,920
And I was talking to you that night
at the comedy store. I didn't realize.

86
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,890
I told her, uh, you know,
my, I really fucked.

87
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,440
I really fucked up my side
big time by playing drums.

88
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,400
I think I already told you guys,

89
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,040
that's how I was down there and
I was just telling her that,

90
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,180
you know how I messed it up and then
I re screwed it up by playing drum.

91
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,250
She's like, I didn't eat, play
drums and I used to play drums.

92
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,050
I started talking to her mother,

93
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:32,140
used to be this famous jazz singer and
she played at the cotton club and all

94
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:36,100
this stuff, the real jazz gigs and
shit. Sit in with all these legends.

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,670
Started talking, all this drum stuff.
And she's a great comedian. Anyway,

96
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:42,160
she's going to be a December six.

97
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:46,150
She's going to be at levity
live in Oxnard, California,

98
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:50,790
which is just outside of La.
It's a Wednesday night. Um,

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,920
she's just fucking awesome.
So definitely check it out.

100
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll have the link up there for that.
And lastly,

101
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
Judah Freelander has a new special on
Netflix called America is the greatest

102
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,060
country in the United States.

103
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,640
And me and Nia was sitting in bed watching
it really low on the volume because

104
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,590
you know, our lovely daughter's sleeping
in the other room and just cracking up.

105
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,290
It's fucking hilarious.
It's brilliant.

106
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,740
I haven't seen him in so long because
he's a New York guy and I'm a big La phony

107
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:25,760
here. And um, I sent him
a text. I told him how he,

108
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,660
that guy is fucking brilliant
man. Uh, definitely check it out.

109
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,550
It's so cool the way he shot it. It looks
like almost lead us in black and white.

110
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:38,810
And probably there was a
couple of I iPhones. It's
just shot over the course of,

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,840
I don't know how many months
of him screwing around
doing bits fucking with the

112
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,760
crowd,
you know,

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,990
and he just would just would cut out
and just say, the seller, this date,

114
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,730
the seller, that date all shot at
the seller. It's, uh, it's really,

115
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,620
it's really different.
It's awesome.

116
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,440
Judah Freelander America is the greatest
country in the United States. All right,

117
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:04,070
that's it. Let's get into the end
of the podcast here. All right,

118
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,000
let's dig in to the God damn podcast.
Um,

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,870
in a good way. I did not
do shit this weekend.

120
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,030
I didn't do shit other than this morning.

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,350
I woke up and I got all my tax shit.
You know,

122
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:25,340
I do it at the end of every month.
I just get all my stupid receipts.

123
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,990
I organize them so I don't have
a fucking avalanche, you know,

124
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,340
April 14th to go through and throw it my
accountant and make his life miserable.

125
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:38,780
I don't do that. End of every month,
like a little old lady, you know,

126
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,300
I try to balance the books.
I just do all of that.

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
And then all I have to deal
with is whatever bullshit
I did in the last 30 days,

128
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:48,290
rather than having to deal with 365 days.

129
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,140
It's the smartest fucking thing
I've ever done. Because I remember,

130
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,130
I remember back when I used to live with
Bobby Kelly, right? We would sit in and,

131
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,780
and you know, we would do like a
zillion spots a week. You know,

132
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:04,520
on the weekend you'd have like six,
seven, eight spots a night, you know,

133
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,070
and I was working uptown and downtown,

134
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:12,071
so I'd have all these cab receipts and
have all of these receipts from College

135
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,230
Gigs, Club gigs, bus
tickets, train tickets,

136
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:20,231
all of this shit shoved in like four
different cvs bags by the end of the year.

137
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,190
And, you know, we had to do our
own taxes back then or whatever.

138
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,980
I remember we would just be sitting there
with this shitty fucking coffee table

139
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,990
with our giant plastic bags of receipts.
I can't do it.

140
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:39,080
Why did we do this?
Why did we fuck it?

141
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:41,210
Why didn't we just along the way,

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,620
at least just to have an envelope that
said taxi receipts that I would try it

143
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,550
every year. You know, in a
good year I'd make it to march,

144
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,940
you know,
but I never made it for the whole year.

145
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,970
Most years I wouldn't even make it into
February. And I've just be like, yeah,

146
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:01,320
fuck it. Um, but this
year, finally, years later,

147
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:05,520
25 years into my career,
finally I finally been doing it.

148
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,380
And, uh, I kinda know where
shit is, like major shit,

149
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,340
life insurance and stuff like that.
I kind of know where it is.

150
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,660
Like I know it's in one of two different
places. I don't know which folder,

151
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,150
but um, it's really made my life a
lot easier. Um, or who's kidding, who?

152
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,280
My wife if make her life easier,
if I ever die, it's like,

153
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,700
it's either in that boxer,
in that box and it's sort of organized.

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,273
MMM.

155
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,440
So anyways, yeah, I did not do shit
this weekend. Still didn't drink.

156
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,860
I made it through. I did not
drink. So I'm up to 102 days.

157
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:42,490
By the time you listened to some it triple
digits over there, I'm like fucking,

158
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:47,410
well chambal it of being sober.
I got him by two fucking days.

159
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,060
Two points.

160
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,103
MMM.

161
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,370
Yeah. It wasn't that, it wasn't that
bad. No one was really drinking.

162
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:56,290
So the temptation wasn't really there.

163
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,310
MMM.

164
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,400
And once the night was over and my
daughter was awesome and she didn't cry

165
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:09,630
nothing. She's just like, she's so cool,
man. He's so chill. She's so, you know,

166
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,860
when people, people actually say that
when she gets upset, she looks like me.

167
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,690
That's when she looks like me.
You know what I mean?

168
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,900
And as much as that hurts me to hear that,
I know it's true.

169
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,030
So anyways, um, I ended
up, uh, I, you know,

170
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:30,460
when I'm home,
I usually am the one that puts her to bed.

171
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,570
I actually really enjoyed doing it
and I haven't down to a whole system.

172
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,310
And the worst part is after they fall
asleep in your arms and he got to set them

173
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:42,790
down in the Crim and then they cry
for a little bit and just walking away

174
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,460
knowing that fine, no one,
they just crying there. Okay.

175
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,273
MMM.

176
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,770
That's the hard part. But, uh, I
actually enjoy her falling asleep,

177
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,490
you know,

178
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,140
laying on my arm so much that I usually
let it go for like an extra 20 minutes,

179
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,410
cause I figured some day, you know, she's
going to be like, Oh my God, Dad, God,

180
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,420
you're so embarrassing. I'm,
I'm really trying to take
all of this shit in. So, um,

181
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,840
anyways, I put her to bed and uh,

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,980
was watching around the little video and
then I went out on my back porch and I

183
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:21,040
smoked arguably the
best cigar of the year.

184
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,950
It was just perfect. You know, it
was thanksgiving. It was an event.

185
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,890
So there was no guilt of like, look
at me smoking a cigar. What am I,

186
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:33,780
some bomb at a track. I said, I
smoked it. It was fucking delicious,

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,780
delicious.
So couldn't have gone any better.

188
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,480
And just when I thought my weekend
couldn't get all any better,

189
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:44,340
I decided to watch every college fucking
football game I could get my eyeballs

190
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:49,290
on. And I did. And it did.
I see some bright ones who,

191
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,340
please tell me,

192
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,840
please tell me you son of a bitch that
you fucking sat down and you watch the

193
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,841
war on I four interstate for that runs
between the two underrated cities of

194
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:07,360
Tampa in Orlando, Florida.
They don't get any respect.

195
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,800
You know,

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,510
you gotta be on the East Coast and south
of Lake Okeechobee to get any respect

197
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,500
and Florida.
And even then,

198
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:19,000
they still laugh at you if just if
you're living in Fort Lauderdale, right?

199
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,740
You're up north on Daytona beach.
They all know you're doing math right.

200
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,220
You gotta be down in Miami.
I got a buddy of mine forced Shaw.

201
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,350
He's going to be on my shows
out there enough Florida.

202
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm doing a show in Hollywood,

203
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:35,761
Florida and in Orlando going to a magic
game in between knocking off another

204
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,890
team and uh, he's a Miami
guy. So I was trashing him.

205
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,920
I was making fun of
Miami. I was like, dude,

206
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,250
every guy in Miami is either
a drug dealer or a promoter

207
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,480
or both.
I know that isn't true,

208
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:54,160
but I just like trash in
places that I enjoy going to.
Who doesn't like Miami? Um,

209
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,730
anyways, so interstate four
runs between Tampa and uh,

210
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,540
and uh, Orlando and I watched
that game deck game was fucking,

211
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,770
it was like watching a god, this
was like a video game. I can't,

212
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,700
I can't even remember what
the fucking score was.

213
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:15,701
It was like 42 35 and I got to tell
you something with some of the fastest,

214
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:20,720
most athletic to the fastest, most
athletic teams I've seen in a long time.

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,940
I don't know that,
I don't know if they're not division one.

216
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,820
I don't know what their deal is. I don't
know where they are. But I know this,

217
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,200
I've seen a lot of like good players come
out of south Florida, central Florida.

218
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,390
Um, so I don't know what happened. Maybe
they fucked up in high school, you know,

219
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:37,100
punched a teacher.
I don't know what happened,

220
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:41,300
but these guys look like they could
take on anybody granted at the same,

221
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,460
I don't fucking know.
It looked great. Okay.

222
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,880
Everybody was flying around the field.
So you know,

223
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:50,540
there was very few white people out
there. You know what I'm saying here? Um,

224
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,480
so, uh, I'm watching this game.

225
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:57,100
It's 42 35 and C um,

226
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,500
central Florida is trying to be the
first team ever in that conference or

227
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:05,120
whatever to to ever go winless and
within two years go undefeated.

228
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,030
So they have a chance to do what?

229
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:12,410
They go up 42 like 35 or some shit and
there's like a minute and a half left,

230
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,470
right? What are you going to do?
You're going to go into the prevent.

231
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,490
You're going to give up the whole,

232
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:18,650
the first fucking 80 yards and
then you're going to go into,

233
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,470
then you're going to start finally
playing defense, right? You know,

234
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,980
I hate the fucking prevent defense, but
guests, guess what central Florida does?

235
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,200
Evidently they didn't go into the prevent
cause inexplicably.

236
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:34,370
Somehow this fucking guy got behind their
defense with a minute and a half left

237
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,140
for like a 70 80 yard touchdown,
which by the way,

238
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:41,870
it was like a 20 yard pass
and then he just ran 50 yards.

239
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,690
So I immediately tweet and all caps.

240
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,360
How the fuck do you let that happen?

241
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,130
As I'm finishing the
tweet and hitting scent,

242
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,540
it's now tied 42 42 south Florida
kicks the fucking ball off.

243
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,010
A stunned stadium of central
Florida fans are watching going,

244
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:04,020
can we at least get down
to field goal position?

245
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Did we just fucking blow our whole season.

246
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,440
Fucking dude on central Florida catches
the ball debt kickoff and ran the

247
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:11,460
fucking thing back.

248
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,300
Okay.

249
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,850
So then I had to tweet again.
How the fuck do you let that happen?

250
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,060
So now it was like 49, 42. I'm sure I
got the score wrong with [inaudible].

251
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,120
They both in the forties and then
I'm sitting there going, well

252
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,990
those two places so fucked up.
They did easily.

253
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:31,500
Central Florida could run this fucking
ball back of south Florida, I should say.

254
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,860
Um, they didn't, and, and the game ended,

255
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,840
but Jesus Christ one an entertaining game.

256
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,130
And then the next day I watched Michigan,
Ohio state,

257
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,940
and then I watched the iron bowl,
um,

258
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,960
and watch Auburn beat Alabama and uh,
watching Michigan

259
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,840
for us,
Ohio state.

260
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,650
I've come to the conclusion that I
fucking hate quarterbacks who run.

261
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,110
I hate a running quarterback. I just
can't, I can't fucking stand it. Yeah,

262
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:06,160
no, I don't think it should be legal
for a quarterback to run. All right.

263
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,410
Okay.

264
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,470
Or if you run,
then you get treated like a running back.

265
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:14,190
This whole fucking thing that you can
wait until everybody, everybody covers.

266
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,200
They called the right defense.

267
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,530
Nobody's open and then you can just take
off running and when nobody's fucking

268
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:22,950
looking, that's all well and
good, but you should get stuck.

269
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,050
But it's all like he gave himself up.
He threw himself on the ground.

270
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,910
Leave him alone. Fuck you. Fuck you.
If you're going to take off running,

271
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,260
you should get stuck.

272
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,830
Either that or keep your fucking fucking
running around to ask behind the God

273
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:45,150
damn line. It's fucking driving
me crazy. I'm a Michigan Fan,

274
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:49,740
so I'm watching that shit and Michigan's
fucking defense was lights out and that

275
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:54,480
fucking cunt kept running eight yards,
nine yards.

276
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,370
Guy couldn't complete a pass. He couldn't
feel pressure, but he could fucking run.

277
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:02,310
And then when he ran there to be
like, Ooh, he's a quarterback.

278
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,290
If I was coaching for the other team, I'd
be like, listen, he hit the fucking guy.

279
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,710
Take the, take the penalty.
I don't give a shit.

280
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,330
I'm not saying deliberately energy
him, but fucking hit him. I don't care.

281
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,580
Now it drives me up. It drives me
up. The congratulations to a house.

282
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:27,960
I don't hate Ohio state or whatever.
I'm just more of a Michigan Fan. Um,

283
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,280
and Michigan's just in a
weird year, I don't know what
their deal is. I mean, they,

284
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,230
they don't have their quarterback.

285
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,890
I hate trash and college players
cause there's still kids or whatever.

286
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,360
But he could've had a better game.

287
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,510
He was a little amped up in the beginning
and I don't know what happened on that

288
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:45,030
last play.
I think a miscommunication.

289
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,530
Maybe the guy broke off the pattern or
whatever cause it will be just fucking

290
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:53,550
threw it to the guy. But, um,
Jim Harbaugh, oh, in three.

291
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,490
Oh,
in three against Ohio state.

292
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,440
You're telling me his wife
had a good fucking weekend.

293
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,660
So he comes home with this fucking
woody Hayes glasses all steamed up.

294
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,043
MMM.

295
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,270
But Jesus Christ at Defense
Michigan's defense was great. Um,

296
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,850
and how about that kid that came in after,
uh, Ohio state's quarterback went down.

297
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:18,740
He played great, and he could throw the
ball, he could throw the ball and run. Um,

298
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,190
so maybe they've got a future with him.
I have no idea. And then I, you know, my,

299
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:24,500
I got a buddy Jay law head
is a big Ohio state guy,

300
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:29,300
so he's always arguing the case as to
why or how Iowa state should be in the

301
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,750
fucking off every, he did it to me
last shift fucking talking to me.

302
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,700
He tried to explain to me
how our hio state should be.

303
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:38,720
Yeah.

304
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
In, in the, the, the, the,

305
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,330
the 14 play off and it's like
two they lost to Penn state.

306
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,040
Penn State won the big 10 championship.
Penn state does it make it in,

307
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,740
but Ohio state does. He goes,
yeah, I'll tell you why.

308
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,860
Strength of schedule early
fucking does all the fucking math.

309
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:58,820
And then what happens? They play Clemson
and they get the old right there, Fred,

310
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:03,140
right. 31 to nothing. You know,
somebody else should have been in there.

311
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,640
So I love Jay. He was doing that
to me again the other day via text.

312
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:09,110
And I'm just laugh at thinking like,
dude,

313
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,330
he's always talking about how Alabama
stinks and there's nobody fucking in the

314
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:19,060
sec. It's like the big 10 sucks. The
big 10 still sucks. It's not that good.

315
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,550
Penn state was overrated.
They were overrated.

316
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,220
They lost the White House state
and it was a huge fucking winter.

317
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,310
Then the very next week, what happened?
I always stayed Pete's Penn state,

318
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:29,270
the next fucker week,

319
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,330
Penn state loses to Michigan State and
Ohio state gets fucking raped rate by

320
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:39,080
fucking Iowa.
So I dunno,

321
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400
he's always talking about how
weak the SCC is. It's like, dude,

322
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,330
get the fuck outta here.
Wouldn't look at the big 10

323
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,600
yeah,

324
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,550
Jesus Christ. How many teams you got
laying down every week? Rutgers, Indiana.

325
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:54,810
Purdue, Northwestern. A fucking Minnesota.

326
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,090
I hate to say Nebraska,
but that they're no good.

327
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,070
That's six fucking t's right there in
Michigan state is always half ass. Oh Man,

328
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,570
I'm going to get some
fucking mail this week

329
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,570
in Michigan. Isn't that good? There's
still trying to put it together.

330
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,570
So who the fuck are you playing out
there? I don't get it. You know?

331
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,303
Okay,

332
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,340
look at fucking Auburn.

333
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,270
Auburn beat Georgia when Georgia was
number one and now they beat Alabama in

334
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:24,090
Alabama was number one.
So Alabama is number one.

335
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,390
They take a loss in the last game
of the season. So now at they out,

336
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,310
the whole fucking thing is just,
it's just a,

337
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,730
a symptom of the game.

338
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,710
You can't have the march madness because
everybody would be getting concussions

339
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:41,310
and ruining million dollar
fucking careers. So this
is the best system we got.

340
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:44,940
So I guess it creates arguing,
but I got to tell you, um,

341
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,960
yeah, what a fucking, I've just, the
college football was fucking amazing.

342
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,570
Then I watched a little bit and I
never watched PAC 12. I watched Lou,

343
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,840
that Washington, Washington
state, Jesus Christ,

344
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:59,200
a bunch of players on those teams too.
Um,

345
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,140
and for some reason my wife just let me
do it. You know, it's funny, we actually,

346
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,740
we went out shopping after the Michigan
fucking Ohio state game and I was so

347
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:12,760
fucking pissed,
so fucking pissed.

348
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:15,820
Cause I just felt like Michigan, they had
a better defense, they should have one.

349
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,910
And they just kept doing that little
cunty fucking eight yards scamper for a

350
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,690
first down to keep the fucking
drive alive was driving me crazy.

351
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,280
Um, and then, uh,

352
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,300
I dunno. And then he just went
out and I just like, you know,

353
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,130
I don't know why I get that
into games, but you know, my,

354
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,340
my laugh could sense it and I just
said, yeah, listen, I just fucking,

355
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,730
you know, I just watched the game.
I did not like the outcome. Right.

356
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,750
It's because Jesus Christ. All right,
so then we're walking around, okay,

357
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,710
we're with all these people like you know,

358
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,900
Christmas shopping and shit and you know,

359
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,880
there was this group of fucking
Asian people, I dunno. I Dunno.

360
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,890
They will for whatever reason,

361
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,910
we're walking down the sidewalk like 17
people across and we were behind them

362
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,570
and they were walking
like half a mile an hour.

363
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,110
I don't know if they just got
done eating Thanksgiving dinner.

364
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,690
I don't know what it was,
but I was having what this comic,

365
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:18,490
I used to know John Bush used to call
it walk rage instead of road rage.

366
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,510
He's to do this great bit about
having walked rage in New York City.

367
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,890
And I was just sitting there like,

368
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,060
how the fuck do you not?
I mean,

369
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,600
I get it there. There's a whole family,
they were with their grandparents,

370
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,940
you know, an agent. People
respect their elders.

371
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,390
They're not like Americans where we
would have thrown those old people in the

372
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:49,200
home and we would have picked up the
pace when we walked down the street.

373
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,220
So I was trying to respect their culture,
but at the end of the day, I'm selfish.

374
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,530
So I was just like, ah, what
the fuck. We finally get by him

375
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,060
and my daughter didn't want
to be in the fucking stroller,

376
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:05,050
so I got her out and I'm carrying in my
ribs a fucking talking to me and one of

377
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,040
my shoulders is fucked up, man. I'm
a mess, right? I'm like, you know,

378
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,810
I'm like a fucking journeyman
quarterback, right? No,

379
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm like Steve Drogan at
the end of his career,

380
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,400
I should have been walking around
with like that fucking neck brace.

381
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,870
So I'm already grumpy.

382
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,760
And then this lady's kid is having a
fucking temper tantrum and was stopped at

383
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:26,400
the, at the red light waiting
to walk across the street,

384
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:30,420
and this kid is hitting this
fucking note that is making my ears,

385
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,190
which are junk from playing drums,

386
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:37,380
vibrate in this painful way that's
making my teeth hurt. So Nia goes,

387
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:40,110
hey, we can cross up here and
right as I do that though,

388
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,910
fucking woman with the screaming kid
heard it too and started following me and

389
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,160
has a say aviation.
She was a beam up my fucking left eardrum,

390
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,070
which means just right alongside of it.
And I just,

391
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,840
I was walking away and I couldn't see.
She was right,

392
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:56,450
but I couldn't understand why it wasn't
getting quieter and that she came,

393
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,590
I turned around, I saw that she was
following this up there, and I just, I,

394
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,740
I snapped,
I snapped.

395
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,340
I was under my breath.
Caught Jesus fucking Christ.

396
00:24:08,341 --> 00:24:12,210
Can you just fucking get that fucking
kid a fuck away from me? I was, go near.

397
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:15,100
Stop. Just let him go past Jesus.
Fucking cool. You know, it was,

398
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:19,520
it was completely irrational.
I was 100% wrong, but, uh,

399
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,530
it was just all those things building up.
And like I said,

400
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,100
I already walk around at a six, so it's
very easy for me to get back up to a 10.

401
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,800
So, uh, Nia, stop talking to me. And uh,

402
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:35,930
then I was like, ah, here we go. You know?
And then I was a baby about it. I'm like,

403
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:39,570
Oh really? Dooley, I should have a
football game. I'm driving over here.

404
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,020
We just bought this. I did this.
I took the fucking garbage Joe.

405
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,713
Okay.

406
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,240
Just cause I drop a bunch of f bombs in
public about some other woman's crying

407
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:56,190
kid, you know, I did the dishes.

408
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,390
That's not a push. That's not a
wash, you know? I thought like,

409
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,010
I thought that all balanced
it out. So, you know,

410
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,140
I put up a good fight on the ride home
and then I find just a mess. Like, yeah,

411
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,810
right. You're right. I'm just arguing
because I know you're writing.

412
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,370
I'm embarrassed. I shouldn't
have done that. Yeah.

413
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,353
MMM.

414
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,890
What do you, what are
you going to do? I mean,

415
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,930
they wrote a song about
me a long time ago. Huh?

416
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm not a perfect person.

417
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,900
Um, yeah. I don't know why I did that.

418
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
You know, something I would go
to fucking anger management,

419
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:33,120
but I just don't feel like
telling my stories all over again.

420
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:35,100
I've already gone to therapy.
I just don't, you know,

421
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,230
you're gonna Retell these fucking things,

422
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,823
you know,

423
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,860
going to reboot it like fucking
full house on a Netflix.

424
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:47,870
Okay.

425
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,840
Oh, she's got to have it.
They just keep rebooting shit,

426
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,160
doing the same shit over again among,
but I'm going to do that.

427
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,390
Tell these fucking stories all over.
I'm sick of my stories.

428
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,720
That was part of my argument
too. I was just like, you
know, Nia, this is, this is,

429
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:11,550
you know, something. This is who
I am. This is what I do. Okay. I,

430
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,030
uh, I'm really good at being a
comedian. I make a great living.

431
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,260
We have a great life,

432
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,490
but every once in awhile I'm going to
drop a bunch of f bombs because the baby's

433
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:24,180
crying. Okay. That's why.
And you have some, I usually,

434
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:28,080
babies crying usually makes me laugh
because I'm usually on a plane when they

435
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:31,650
start crying and they were expressing
exactly what I'm feeling and it's just

436
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:35,340
like, it's like a great comedy.
It's just like, dude, I hear Ya.

437
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,020
That's exactly what the fuck I'm feeling.

438
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,053
MMM.

439
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:45,170
I don't know. It just all built a house,
state beat Michigan. Then there was the,

440
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,290
uh, hands across America, Asian
family that I couldn't get around

441
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,570
and on those like 20,000 other fucking
things going on too. It was just like,

442
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,680
it was a shit show. And I fucking hate
Christmas shopping, but by the way, dude,

443
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:02,670
I've, I've crushed it this year. All my
nieces and nephews all have presence.

444
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,370
They're all wrapped and I'm mailing them
out to respective families this week.

445
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,200
Okay.

whole world, but you know, whatever,

448
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,753

San is a number one seat. I'm like a
16 seed. I got into the dance cell.

O'Neal comedy benefit. Uh,

We'll have some surprise guests.

454
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:46,220
Hopefully I'm reaching out to some big
names. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Alright,

Song. Butoh due to me. Andy's me.

457
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,770
Andy's losing my shit over a crying
baby. But Dude, dude, dude, me,

458
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:03,000
Andy's beyond these. Uh, why
didn't you join the navy?

459
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,040
Because I'm scared of the fucking ocean.

460
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,060
But I would have fought a shark not
to listen to that fucking baby. Sorry.

461
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,950
I don't know. I'm all over

00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,550
I just,
I fucking snapped.

464
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:21,880
I didn't always know when Nia is not
going to talk to me anymore because not

465
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:23,030
only does she not talk to him anymore,

466
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,960
she gets this look on her face cause I
started looking at the side of her face

467
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:30,550
and I'm just like, oh, that's
that look, I know that look. Uh,

468
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:33,310
I know what she's doing when she's
rewinding 20 years of her life going,

469
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,750

with this guy? Um, all right.

472
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,690
Okay.

473
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,830
But we still give it up to our family and
our loved ones who just don't want it.

474
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,020
But many will do by the way. What
does that fucking underwear that they,

475
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,000

495
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:05,560

496
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:08,440
it's for a practical purpose.
It's not supposed to be sexy.

497
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,660
It's not supposed to be
inviting or whatever.

498
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,860
It seems to be like for fat white guys.

512
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,770
drinking a thousand fucking
glasses of booze and pizza.

513
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,210
That's all beer and pizza.

514
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,550
Then if I actually get to the weight
that I'm supposed to be, you're like,

517
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,660
Don't you bill? That's not even
funny. I would never say that.

518

Don't tell people I said that on the park.

519
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,300
You said it and you made a sign and you
held it up in the kitchen. Oh, I did not.

did you say it in a way I, I'm sorry.

All right, but maybe it's not the,

525
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:54,190
that underwear is the problem.
It's the kind of underwear.

531
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,900

532
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:17,850

Ania.

533
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,100
All I'm going to get you for Christmas

534
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,420
I would love some meanthey. No,
that's all you're getting. No,

535
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:29,260
I want more than that. Why? Because I
don't want to just underwear. Thank you.

536
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,010
And when I give you the underwear, where
should I put it? That'll be your age.

537
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,050
I did a lot of that over the net
and it's a stocking stuffer. Sorry,

538
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:39,980
I'm too close to them.
I care. It's three, not

539
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,900
a copy. It's offer dollar shave club.
Okay. Why don't you get a microphone.

540
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,643
All right.

541
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,270
I just so you won't be off mic so people
can hear you and I can also get through

542
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:51,070
the,

543
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,520
by the way, people can hear me just
fine, like people tweet me that,

544
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:57,970
that they can hear me while you're sitting
there below Google. Good. Who are you?

545
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,460
You're used to screaming
into a microphone,

546
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:04,930
which is hilarious to me because the
microphone is meant to amplify your voice.

547
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:09,490
It's meant to carry it, but
you like like, yeah. Yeah,

548
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:10,430
I'm criticizing.
Yeah.

549
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,200
Yeah. I'm threatening you.
Yeah. Threatening. You're
good. Sit down here then.

550
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,120
I was trying to find the, no, I'll look it
up. All right. I'm just giving you shit.

551
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,310
Oh, you got to get another microphone.
The microphone is in the other room.

552
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm not doing that. All
right. I'm not doing that yet.

553
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,060
Did you know me undies is three times
softer than cotton. It's very soft.

554
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,320
Very soft, isn't it? Is that
Horse Mussel soft? Mandy's. Huh?

555
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,130
That's my favorite touch. Like the, yeah.

556
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't know what you call it.

557
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,570
What do you call it when you have a
favorite thing that you like to touch?

558
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,190
If you said this on a first date, they
wouldn't have been a second day. Oh,

559
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,660
that's my, that's my favorite
touch. What do you call it?

560
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,730

00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,630
That's how it's spelled. Did
they pronounce a carnival
or kind of Steve Judge.

703
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,280
Jesus Christ. That guy's a
beast. Incredible. Incredible.

704
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,980
Top to bottom. Everybody in that band,
singer guitar play a bass player.

705
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,040
The whole fucking thing. That drummer.
Unbelievable. Please download that.

706
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,590
Listen to it.
Tell me how much you love it.

707
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Australia.
What you got to,

708
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,230
you got any more bands like that or
what do you hold now for every week I'm

709
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:29,620
fucking sitting here like a little,
a little kid, you know, on Christmas.

710
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:33,760
But no presence. Just asking them. Maybe
they don't tell me anything. I go to,

711
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:37,210
I like toy go all the way out to Perth
and what thanks do I get? Oh Australia,

712
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:40,660
that's not cool.
Fucking album came out in 2010.

713
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,400
Why they treat me like that?

714
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,490
I don't know. Anyways, um,

715
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,410
so nice when we went out there anyways,
shout out to little creatures. Beer.

716
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,450
Can we read the ones that I feel like
I'm going to be able to jump in on first

717
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,640
and then I can leave and you can do what?
I don't care.

718
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:07,090
Can we
the last two progressive rock.

719
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,440
Oh, I know you don't give a fuck about
that. I'll read that one. All right.

720
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:16,150
Emily Linden tweets. You don't want
to do this one? No, I dunno. Alright,

721
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,880
what does, who is Emily London? I didn't
know who he was. Tell she was either.

722
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,590
She somebody on the Twitter
sphere. Okay. She, she's uh,

723
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,940
she's got, um, social media.
She tweeted some a shit about,

724
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,340
I don't know, some shit. I don't
know. Okay. Hey, the fair trail.

725
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,233
Um,

726
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,770
I imagine you've been sent this article
many times over the last week I had,

727
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,990
here's an excerpt from an article about
what the writer for Teen Vogue tweeted.

728
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,960
A,
here's an unpopular opinion.

729
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,020
I'm not actually all that concerned
about innocent men losing their jobs over

730
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:55,650
false sexual assault slash
harassment allegations.

731
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,700
The benefit of all of us getting
to finally tell the truth.

732
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:04,701
Plus the impact on victims far capital's
far outweighs the loss of any one man's

733
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,170
reputation.
He said adding,

734
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,060
if some innocent men's reputation have
to take a hit in the process of undoing

735
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:16,680
the patriarchy. That is the price
I am absolutely willing to pay.

736
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,840
It's hilarious. You're not paying a
price in that. That innocent guy is, um,

737
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,270
the most cognitive cause
I didn't say the word.

738
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:30,271
So stupid critique of Linden came
from CNN anchored Jake tapper.

739
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,570
The lead host tweeted, well, this
is CNN. There's bad as Fox News.

740
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,740
I'm guessing you didn't get a good grade
for your seventh grade book report on

741
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,450
to kill a Mockingbird,
uh,

742
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,710
referencing the classic novel that
features the trial of a black man falsely

743
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:50,480
accused of rape in the 1930s, Alabama. Um,

744
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,870
you said if some innocent men's reputation
have to take a hit in the process,

745
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:58,320
fun doing the patriarchy, that is a
price, same. Absolutely willing to pay.

746
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,150
That's immoral. Tapper wrote, and it's not
a price you would be paying by the way.

747
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:06,870
It would be an innocent, innocent
men doing that. Um, all right.

748
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,590
He said, my wife is black,
is back to the guy running.

749
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:14,640
My wife is black and she has a cousin
who served six months in jail for being

750
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:19,080
falsely accused of rape. He lost
his academic scholarship, academic,

751
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,730
not sports scholarship,

752
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,210
and has been having trouble getting
his life back on track since having his

753
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:28,680
conviction overturned from being
physically and emotionally abused in jail.

754
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,790
She said, uh, that is she ever

755
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,090
wait. She said that if she ever saw
this woman in public, she and I quote,

756
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,950
slapped the Shit Outta that irresponsible
cont bill I've never heard of or used

757
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:48,850
the c word or even threatening violence
against anyone. It's like that light.

758
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,750
Now you just go in a completely different
direction. That line from Batman,

759
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:52,584
the dark night,

760
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,580
you either die a hero or live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

761
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,810
All right. You're all over the place.
I don't know what's going on here. Um,

762
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:04,740
what do I think that, I think that's
the tweets have somebody young. Uh, and,

763
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:08,970
and also it's kind of seems,
it's a little WWE wrestling,

764
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:13,530
grandstanding, knowing there's no
way you write that, not knowing,

765
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,920
you know, it's like watching
down, you know, the,

766
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:21,000
the Tories guy there and the MMA guy,
the crazy shit.

767
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:25,040
He says he knows what he's doing.
Yeah. And then everyone's like, oh,

768
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,470
this guy's too cocky. I want
to watch it moves. And then,

769
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,860
then he wins and he gets your money.
I think that that's a,

770
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,400
I think that's all this is,
uh,

771
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,420
white feminism.
So that's pretty much womanism.

772
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,450
Yeah.
I mean that's pretty much,

773
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,480
this is why people don't like being
labeled a feminist because of stuff like

774
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:50,560
that. Not Elaborate. Nah. That's
all I'm going to say about it.

775
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,860
I feel like nobody white and
knows what you're talking about.

776
00:47:54,861 --> 00:47:56,360
But everybody black right now does,

777
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,640
oh my God, was that shade?
Am I woke? Um, yeah.

778
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:09,540
I mean that's just one of those
that, I dunno. I don't know.

779
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,770
What do you do you know what? That's
how she feels. That's how she feels.

780
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:15,440
What am I supposed to,
am I supposed to actually respond to that?

781
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:17,690
Like that's like some sort
of rational human being.

782
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,980
What do you mean what this person
foaming at the mouth. I Dunno.

783
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,370
They remind me of myself

784
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,910
when you think of this complete.
Yeah.

785
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:30,170
And yet can I make this any more
easier for you? I love how you,

786
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,200
you will only wanted to fucking respond
to the ones that were easy and then when

787
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:36,400
to give you a chance to respond to you.
Like you like bill Bellacheck lion off.

788
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,330
She's a, yeah, it's white phone is,
I know so. Cause you know, but I, I,

789
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,630
but I can elaborate.
I can get into these next to elaborate.

790
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,740
I don't want to, I don't
want to him why, I dunno.

791
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:53,730
Maybe I am being a worse, but I just,
uh, yeah, it's, that's, I dunno,

792
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,790
there's really no other way for me
explain it then to say that that's,

793
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,640
it's just you,
it's a level of,

794
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,373
okay,

795
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,320
not nice not,
or they're not naive.

796
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:08,603
They're not

797
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,430
like maybe just in a bubble or something.
Just like,

798
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:17,730
so sheltered,
sheltered.

799
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,410
So it's like all they can focus on is
like the one thing, you know what I mean?

800
00:49:22,411 --> 00:49:24,600
And they just can't quite grasp.

801
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,230
Yeah.

802
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,050
Well that's a joke I do on my act when,
when like when I listen to feminists,

803
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,400
like it's hard for me to listen to white
women in the United States of America

804
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,870
complaining, like going, do you know,

805
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,220
you know what it's like
to be me a slightly less
awesome than what my life is.

806
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:45,570
Like.
If you look at the big picture,

807
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,980
uh, I'm sure that seems to be
a giant gap between me and you,

808
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,200
but if you look at
everybody else's situation,

809
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:54,390
we were at what kind of
sitting on the same stone here.

810
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:59,580
So why don't you buy a run around
the lady? All right. I'm sorry.

811
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,350
Am I a rebound chump? Is this good
idea? Is this in your wheel house? Yeah,

812
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:07,800
I think so. Keep going.
You'd be a great president.

813
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:10,410
This is what president is due
now. They like, they basically,

814
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,490
I don't like the way that guy asked
questions. Let's bring this person in.

815
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,450
You don't have time for everything. So
you gotta you gotta weed through? No,

816
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:21,580
I do have to have time for all of
these. You don't have time. Yeah.

817
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,470
I'm not talking about you were talking
about me. Can we read this one? This one?

818
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,070
Okay. All right. Am I a rebound

819
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,040
chump? Probably. Dear Billy forehead.

820
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,650
You're saying all this funny shit
off the Mike. I'm telling you,

821
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,870
but they say and they can hear you.
Okay. I said probably repeat it again.

822
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,720
All right. The time. Yeah,
the time he's gone. All right.

823
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,790
Huge Fan of your comedy and
podcasts. Did you hear that? Nia?

824
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,990
Huge Fan of my comedy.
Huge, huge, huge, greatest,

825
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:51,770
greatest comedian ever get to do stand
up on a golf course with my own name

826
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:55,310
attached to it. Donald's Trump
would think of your podcasts.

827
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,350
Okay.

828
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,240
I mean, I don't care what
he thinks about anything,

829
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:02,710
but I wonder what he would think
about your podcast as far as what?

830
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,410
I don't know. Like do you think
he would be into it or not?

831
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:09,030
Even though you trash them,
you trash everybody.

832
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,830
I think he's busy running the country.

833
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:14,430
I don't think he's listening to
fucking nuts by the way that he tweets.

834
00:51:14,431 --> 00:51:17,820
He's clearly not that fucking busy.
He's not that busy.

835
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,880
Who has time to tweet the
petty shit that he does?

836
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,590
He's got what's great about Twitter
it takes to doing all of this.

837
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:29,310
The actual stuff. He is just
sitting there like, you know the uh,

838
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,880
what do you call it? The spa like, I
don't know. I don't know what the fuck.

839
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,750
He's just, he's working. He's
got me all, he's working Obama.

840
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,790
Bill Clinton Work J. Yeah, that
cigar. He worked at rogue up.

841
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,020
I just get all flustered. I can't
even speak straight anyway. Come on.

842
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,250
Am I rebound chump? Is Trump really
that bad, dear Billy forehead?

843
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,420
So I just like getting me going. I just
like get it ahead. It's really, I mean,

844
00:51:54,421 --> 00:51:56,950
I don't know.
You gotta give the guy and shit

845
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,020
cause it was hot as fuck in here. You're
usually the one who runs hot. I know,

846
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:11,390
I know. I know. No, I
know. Am I a rebound chump?

847
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,050
Yeah. Shut the fucking
thing off. Jesus Christ.

848
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,890
This is why it takes forever.

849
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,290
You the second you bring a
woman into your fucking thing.

850
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:25,410
Like if you're going to leave the house,
everything has to be perfect.

851
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,210
Oh my feet are together. Rub them together
like your shoe. You're always are.

852
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,690
Are we ready? Okay. Yes. Huge Fan
of your comedy in the podcast.

853
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,990
Hearing you shoot the shit every
week obviously makes me laugh,

854
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:46,530
but also gives me insight
and other things. Anyways,
it's hard to find. All right.

855
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,440
I get too many clock minutes.
Thank you. I met this girl,

856
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,010
Buddha [inaudible] who's probably the
beds are good check. While, why blah blah,

857
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:57,690
blah. I've ever been with. And her
personality so far looks just as good.

858
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,450
We are both in college
and neighboring states,

859
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,330
but we hang out a couple
of times a week on average.

860
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:05,550
Things have been going great
for the past two months.

861
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,600
We have traveled around her state and she
has shown me places I have never seen.

862
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,890
I did not expect anything to bloom like
it has and was originally content with

863
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:17,760
just being friends who fuck. However,
after getting to know her better,

864
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:21,630
she definitely seems like someone I
could stick around with for a while and

865
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:25,410
maybe even date. Um, well
what are you guys now?

866
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,150
Sightseeing? He just said they're hanging
out. Oh, just hanging out. Okay. Sorry.

867
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,170
Well, if I have to read and also listen
to what I'm saying, like I can't do that.

868
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,450
The only thing is it's called
reading comprehension. Bebe. Yeah,

869
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:44,310
I'm not good at it. Um, the only
thing she has, the only thing,

870
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,420
the only thing she has an ex who I suspect
she's still hoping we'll come back.

871
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,430
All right.
Incident one on our second date quote,

872
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,460
she rented a movie on an as Amazon on
her ex's account and got a text from him

873
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,603
asking,

874
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,460
okay,

875
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:12,380
what that was about fucking
sector about Amazon movie.

876
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,450
Wow.
Why

877
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,300
is she, what was she? What
is she doing? All right.

878
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,260
That's some bullshit right there.

879
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:24,250
You know good and God damn well you
can't order on your ex as account like

880
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,980
they're going to, they're
still paying for that. Ooh.

881
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:28,840
Sees a little minx the this one,

882
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:34,030
she seemed delighted that he was forced
to communicate with her eyes and she

883
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:37,490
wired him money and said,
sorry, incident number two.

884
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:40,670
So he's obviously broken up
with her fucking dramatic.

885
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,470
Oh Yeah, you ready? Okay.
Incident number two.

886
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:48,650
She originally stated that
they broke up back in February,

887
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:52,400
but one night she let it slip that
they had actually broken up in August.

888
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,900
Just a couple months ago. I
acted like I didn't notice. Good.

889
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,200
That's probably good.
After banging one night,

890
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:04,100
she starts joking about having a
baby and what features it would have.

891
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,660
I have brown hair as
to she and she ran the,

892
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,660
says the baby could be blond,
the color of her exes hair.

893
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,540
She then went on to say your ex's name
was one of her favorite names for a boy.

894
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,460
Oh, Jesus Christ. Dude,
this is always good. My God,

895
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,070
this is like getting ridiculous to the
point. I'm starting to not believe it.

896
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:29,590
Thankfully she waited until I finished
all my dick and balls would have deflated

897
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:35,000
immediately during all this baby
slash x talk incident number four,

898
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:39,800
Jesus Christ, buddy exhibit 1995. Um,

899
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,180
she still uses her ex's,
Amazon prime account to watch movies,

900
00:55:44,181 --> 00:55:49,100
but on two occasions she began snooping
through his order history right in front

901
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:51,950
of me,
either unaware of how off putting that is,

902
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:56,630
are simply not giving a shit disrespectful
to myself and the x in my opinion.

903
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,580
Uh,

904
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,060
another confusing twist is that she gets
pissed off and sad if I referred to her

905
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,500
as my friend. We're not in an
official relationship, so this,

906
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:09,230
which is just that she is
at least kind of interested.

907
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,600
But with all this stuff going on about Rx,

908
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,500
I think she might just like the attention
I provide and I think she may be

909
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:16,460
stringing me along.

910
00:56:16,461 --> 00:56:21,410
She is also randomly accused me of
using her for attention and having other

911
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,010
hose. Uh, neither

912
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,130
of which are true. Yeah. You don't sound
like it. Yeah. That has a lot of hoes.

913
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,730
Sorry for this long email. It's hard
to put all this bull shit into words,

914
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:34,660
which you are great at. If the, yeah,
he's in the emotional side of this.

915
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,990
Maybe me just reading what you
just wrote out loud will be enough.

916
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,640
If the lovely Nia is nearby, I would
love to hear her take as well. Thanks.

917
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,390
Uh, and go for a jog once in a while.
Yeah. All right. What do you got it?

918
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,311
Yeah.

919
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:52,120
This girl is fucking crazy and she's not
over her acts and she is using you to

920
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:56,380
get jealous and if you don't mind banging
her because she's hot and all that and

921
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:59,710
letting it go, then fine. But if you're
starting to catch feelings, I would bail.

922
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:04,220
Wow. You said that nice and quick.
I agree with all of that. I concur.

923
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,930
That's exactly it.

924
00:57:05,931 --> 00:57:10,010
If you could somehow and
not get emotionally tied to
her and just keep banging

925
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:10,844
her

926
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,420
disrespectful as fuck.
She is incredibly disrespectful.

927
00:57:14,421 --> 00:57:17,960
She does not care about you at all.

928
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,760
The things that she is saying and
doing in front of you is so ridiculous.

929
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,760
Like how are you going to lie
in bed with someone and be like,

930
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:30,500
you know when I have a baby, like
I ended up this, you know Caleb,

931
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,860
because this is also like some
white girl shit like halo.

932
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,130
I just feel like it'd be the perfect
name for a boy and he's the sitting there

933
00:57:37,131 --> 00:57:40,580
like, are you serious? Like your ex
boyfriend? Oh yeah. You know what?

934
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:43,820
This could be a great mood and he
should be on the roof. He should

935
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:47,690
just, I dunno. I think he should
just say some just fake listen like

936
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:49,950
I have,

937
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:53,110
but this is one of these people that it's
do you don't even say anything to him

938
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:56,800
because it's not going to, they're not
going to sit there and be like, Oh wow,

939
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,610
I guess you're right. I really
shouldn't have done that. Just person.

940
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:01,360
It's not going to give a fuck.
So whatever man,

941
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,890
you got to bang a hot chick and
she's not over the other guy.

942
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:04,724
So who gives a fuck?

943
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,320
Thank God you didn't marry or they'll
do and thank God that other guy broke up

944
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:10,660
with her cause she seems I don't,
granted it's all you

945
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,880
talk has the nerve to be
mad at him when he called,

946
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:15,590
when he introduces her as a friend,

947
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:20,120
she has the fucking nerve to get mad after
all that craziness that she's putting

948
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,070
him through. Ah, get outta here.

949
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,250
Classic hot chick.
Crazy hot chick behavior though.

950
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,790
This is classic crazy that
I taught that I've taught.

951
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:32,630
I think I told the two weeks ago that
hot chick I'd met at the gym and she kept

952
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,660
giving me a number and she wanted to go
out and I kept trying to get her up but

953
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:38,990
she wouldn't go out with me. Then finally
she picks a date and yeah come over,

954
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:41,330
we can hang on Saturday and
she goes, Oh, I'm moving kids.

955
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,030
She wanted me to help her move
and I just burst out laughing.

956
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,190
I'm not fucking doing that.

957
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,090
And she had some other chump
who came over there too.

958
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,530
It going to be the two
of us standing there.

959
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:56,240
Like maybe if I pick up something
heavy can fuck whales is like,

960
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,140
she's all yours buddy.

961
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:01,640
Wow. Yeah. I mean I can't knock the
hustle, but that's incredibly rude.

962
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,440
Yeah, that's the thing. And that's
why that right there, that statement,

963
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:10,610
I can't knock the hustle, but that's
incredibly rude. That's why. Oh,

964
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:14,330
you're just being funny. Honestly,
that's, that's why I, I get all that,

965
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:19,331
that that male feminism horseshit where
they just sitting there drinking the

966
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,250
fucking Koolaid. Like women
just, you know, there aren't

967
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,240
as many,

968
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:28,390
just as many fucking absolute sociopath
psychos that have vaginas out there is,

969
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:29,940
it's not drinking the Koolaid.

970
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:33,020
They're just saying what they think women
want to hear and then they turned out

971
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:36,050
to be fucking assholes.
So Jesus Damn,

972
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,250
you just really get cut to the chase.
So cut to the chase here.

973
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,910
I'm trying to do an hour here and you
just fucking bang, Bang, boom. Done.

974
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,440
All right. Girlfriend wants
plastic surgery. How do you
feel about that title? Nia,

975
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:53,300
is this an easy enough class for you?
I'm excited to hear this. Hello, Bill.

976
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:58,040
Big Fan of your work. Could use
some lady advice here. All right.

977
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,230
Is this a lady? No. No.
Awesome lady advice. Sorry.

978
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,290
My girlfriend has been
dropping hints from month,

979
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:08,290
months now about getting plastic surgery
knows and boob job bump bump a Boehm bu

980
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,590
a while while she looks perfect in
my eyes. She said she hates her,

981
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:20,420
her junos in her tiny tits.
She has,

982
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,910
she has big pea size cup.
She has a pea size cup.

983
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,700
Sorry, that's me. Whatever
the fuck it's called,

984
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,920
brow or whatever the fuck it's called,
which like he, he, he, he net which w.

985
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:40,610
H. I. C. H. O. This is which on
a Bronc, which is all I need.

986
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,490
I tried to ignore it
for as long as I could.

987
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:48,730
Now she says she wants it for
Christmas to fake press one nose job,

988
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:54,410
so on. That was a good joke and you
should be sorry. Maybe sleeping,

989
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,023
sorry.

990
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:02,080
And a bag of fucking tampons
on the third day of Christmas.

991
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:06,620
My true love gave to me
three fucking removed.

992
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:11,040
No moles to boob jobs.
One bleach asshole

993
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,960
and a burger. Botox in
a pear tree. Come on,

994
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:22,040
let's do the plastic surgery
on the fourth day of Christmas.

995
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:28,150
My true love gave to me for corrected
hammertoes three remove no moles to fake

996
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:36,080
tits and a bleached asshole and an in
a pear tree. I can't fucking do it.

997
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,523
Go on

998
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,920
five inches off my pussy lips.

999
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,130
They hung down too far.
One bleached asshole too,

1000
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,230
and some botox in a pear tree.
Nia,

1001
01:01:57,231 --> 01:01:59,060
can you get me hair plugs for Christmas?

1002
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:03,200
We're going to go all the way to
12th on the 12th Day of Christmas.

1003
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,270
My true love gave to me
was what would you get?

1004
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:09,770
12 things of 12 stretchmarks removed?
Yeah,

1005
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,800
you go 11 to bleached tooth is bleached.

1006
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,390
Seven eyebrow hairs plucked. I don't know
what to say. Nick, can you get me here?

1007
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:22,920
Plugs for Christmas.
But here's the thing,

1008
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:27,420
I just want them right down the
center of my head. I want to get,

1009
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:31,580
I want to grow a Mohawk.
Okay.

1010
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,320
Anyways, while she looks perfect,
she says, okay, she blah blah, blah.

1011
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:38,070
But now she's saying she
wants it for Christmas

1012
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:45,840
or she's antisemetic no. You know what?
A lot of juice to celebrate Christmas.

1013
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,150
What do you mean? [inaudible]? Oh yeah,

1014
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,050
maybe she goes again and I got an
Undergrad, I went to him, you know, just,

1015
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:56,550
you know these, they don't like
that she celebrates Christmas,

1016
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:59,880
which I actually have two Jewish friends
to celebrate a Walmart titch to hang

1017
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:03,510
out and sat in my overalls, you
know, so I know it's so stupid.

1018
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:07,650
Act like only only southern
white people are racist. Wow.

1019
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:12,180
All right. Um, now she's
saying she wants for Christmas.

1020
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:14,340
I told her she's perfect the way she is.

1021
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,930
I love you just the way you are bad.

1022
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:25,530
But she has low self esteem,
which he can. Which dude is w?

1023
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:29,310
H I c h not which wtch

1024
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,870
wt is w. H. I. T. Yeah. No, it's w h.

1025
01:03:36,871 --> 01:03:41,050
I. C. H. A. W. I. T. C private pilots. Oh,

1026
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,350
alright.
Which he is probably why she uses,

1027
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,480
why she's with my fat,
ugly asked to begin with Jesus Christ.

1028
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:55,580
Both of you guys. I know you're both
like just, you know, you have each other.

1029
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,480
Just rub your eye Levi's.

1030
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,850
Wow.
That close to the holidays

1031
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:14,340
and my a bad influence on you.
You're never mean like that.

1032
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,600
That's fucking hilarious.

1033
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,360
People know that I'm nice.
They just, you know, I have,

1034
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,230
I have my people like me who
like me, but I have, you know,

1035
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:29,130
I have my moments where I can be a little
rude for no reason. Hey, well this,

1036
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,070
he's describing it this way.
I couldn't resist though.

1037
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:36,860
Cause sometimes two negatives
make a positive. They have
a great looking kid. Um,

1038
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:37,560
all right.

1039
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,510
We got into it the other night about it
and now she's saying she's not happy in

1040
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:46,950
her own skin. Oh God. She wants to
be a dude and if I truly loved her,

1041
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,960
then I should expect it.

1042
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,700
I should accept it and get it
for her as a Christmas present.

1043
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:57,870
Said some, I was being a dick about
dude, a manipulative fuck this chick.

1044
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:01,950
This chick wants to get her.
No, she's trying to trade
up. She's sick of your fat,

1045
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,784
ugly ass.

1046
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,020
She wants you to buy some fucking save
some of your cake money and spend it on a

1047
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:10,470
fucking tits or Anna knows.
Right and Oh fuck that shit.

1048
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,570
Fuck that Shit said. I haven't felt
this way about a girl in a long time.

1049
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,120
I love her the way she is and I don't want

1050
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,030
to see her fuck up or looks or a body. I
don't know what to do here, Billy. Boy,

1051
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:26,140
any advice would be appreciated from
you and the lovely Nia. Yeah. Fuck this.

1052
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,260
Fuck this.
I think you get out.

1053
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:35,110
Um, you're saying he should
break up with her. Get Out.

1054
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,600
They used to break up with her. I should
help her with her self esteem. Fuck that.

1055
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,300
What you're just going to give up on
somebody who loved because they have a low

1056
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:46,030
self esteem and they're
like freaking out about it

1057
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,970
and no, you know something. I was, I,

1058
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:52,450
that was my advice until she
said you should buy me that right

1059
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:56,340
for Christmas, you know, fucking
expensive. That is. Yeah.
That's very expensive. No,

1060
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,790
no dude, no knows. Is
she watching reality TV?

1061
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:03,390
She's going to try to get it on real
housewives of fucking de Moines, Iowa,

1062
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,040
wherever the fuck you guys know you should
really like if she's really trying to

1063
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:12,250
do this, it's her body and it's
her choice. She should pay for.

1064
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,340
If she really,
really wants to do it,

1065
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,400
she should save up her
pennies or whatever it is.

1066
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:20,310
Save up like $100 a week
or whatever the fuck it is.

1067
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:23,700
Cut Out all this other stuff, bullshit
that she's doing, going out with friends,

1068
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:24,840
going out with you,

1069
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,260
whatever the fuck and she should
save up for it and just be like,

1070
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:32,700
I don't feel comfortable and get like
paying for you to alter your body.

1071
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,970
That's not something that
I, you know, believe in.

1072
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:38,850
That's nothing maybe I have the money for.
It's like this is your body,

1073
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:43,710
this is your choice. And I support
you either way, the uh, no, no, no,

1074
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:48,570
and I support you either way, but I
don't feel comfortable paying for it.

1075
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:52,620
It was a sound of a dump truck backing
up in the alley that you should just drop

1076
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:56,370
her in. Yeah, no, I love you. But
this is not, I'm not doing this.

1077
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,900
I would get all feel comfortable.
I gotta be honest with you.

1078
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,800
Cause those are boundaries right there.
And that's not,

1079
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,070
that's not something you feel comfortable.

1080
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,990
You are perfectly well within
your right to say no to that.

1081
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,150
And if she has a problem with it,
then yeah,

1082
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:11,110
I guess she can bounce and she's going be

1083
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,900
pass those slow self esteem, body
issues onto her, onto your fucking kids.

1084
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:18,750
It's going to be a nightmare.
She needs to go to therapy.

1085
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,650
Oh I don't know what the fuck she needs
to do. But if I was you fuck that.

1086
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,180
Fuck that.

1087
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:29,670
Fuck that you can you sit me
and you need to pay for it.

1088
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,510
Fuck you. That's ridiculous.
I would come over there.

1089
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,430
I would dress up like Santa
Claus when I broke up.

1090
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,730
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Get
the fuck out of my life.

1091
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,210
I'm spending all my money on me and dude,
you need,

1092
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:44,470
if you think you're fat and ugly,

1093
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,590
you could do something about the fat
and he can get a fucking personality.

1094
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,930
So why don't you get all the money
she wants you to spend on tits? Wow.

1095
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,730
Why don't you fucking get a drain? Or I
forget a fucking training for yourself,

1096
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:59,260
dude. Fucking move on from this train
wreck. Give me a AH, Jesus Christ.

1097
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:03,070
They almost ruined my
fucking thanksgiving. Oh No,
I'm just kidding. Anyways,

1098
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,800
don't listen to me. I'm not trying to
take you to fucking break up with it,

1099
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:09,370
but that, that, that's a major like, like,

1100
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:12,400
what the fuck did you just
say to me moment? You know,

1101
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,670
don't text during the Goddamn podcast.

1102
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:21,380
Someone to let them know where we are.
What are you having somebody over?

1103
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,790
But boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop. All right. It's my, it's my ex.

1104
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:30,140
I'm using his Netflix account, right the
front of you. So fucking deal with it

1105
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,550
with you would be,
you know what I think is a great name?

1106
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,850
Lamont prog rock.

1107
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:41,210
I'm just trying to pick a stereotypical
black name from way back in the day.

1108
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:44,540
There was nobody named Lamont, by the
way, except that guy on a Sanford and son.

1109
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,760
A boo boo. All right.
Progressive Rock. Hey. Oh Billy.

1110
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:54,560
Burford uh, glad to hear you're
looking to do more progressive rock.

1111
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:55,910
Like every genre of music,

1112
01:08:55,911 --> 01:09:00,890
99% of it is unimaginably derivative
trash and 1% is really unique and well

1113
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:05,660
done. Yeah, I like your perspective.
Your percentage might be a little harsh.

1114
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:07,520
I'd like to think 10% at least as good.

1115
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,570
Even the good stuff can be off putting
at first and just take some time to

1116
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:14,060
digest. Uh, like good scotch.

1117
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,570
It might be harsh to most people at first,

1118
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:21,000
but if you put the time and you'll find
a lot of interesting shit going on. Uh,

1119
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,860
early generous genesis is some of
my favorite checkout. The tracks,

1120
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:29,030
the musical box watch
ishe did she wake up?

1121
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:32,953
Okay.

1122
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:37,640
A watcher of the skies and
dancing with the moon lit night.

1123
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:42,290
The compositions are complex and beautiful
and Phil Calls Collins was really a

1124
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,690
perfect drama. Yeah, he's one of
my favorite drummers of all time.

1125
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:50,300
The band also had some amazing
tracks like close to the edge,

1126
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,800
a heart of the sunrise
and gates of delirium.

1127
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:59,690
Bill Bruford was one of their first was
on one of their first few albums and was

1128
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:02,180
a beast. All right. You're
already mentioned King Crimson.

1129
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:05,900
They had some truly great song but always
had a few improvised stinkers on each

1130
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:06,700
album.

1131
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Check out 21st century schizo oid man
LARCs tongues in aspect part two and

1132
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:18,050
starless Bruford his drumming
on two of those tracks. Finally,

1133
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,040
he got to get into magma
who was one of the,

1134
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,830
who has one of the best drummers
to have walked the earth.

1135
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,980
I never heard of this guy,
Christian Fandor.

1136
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:30,770
It's really his band.

1137
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:33,710
He composed all of the music and
their sound is totally unique.

1138
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:38,480
They sing in an alien language so you
don't get distracted by stupid lyrics,

1139
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,880
but what about their alien language?

1140
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,480
That sounds like something
that sounds like a sketch.

1141
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:47,720
Will Ferrell would be an
ad almost 70 years old.

1142
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,700
Vander plays incredibly.

1143
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:55,180
They are so good live that I've flown to
La and London just to see them play in

1144
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:59,540
the past couple of years.
I'll have to check this out.

1145
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:04,520
Look up live videos of them playing
the last seven minutes and zombies,

1146
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,490
your drum teacher will vouch for them.
Ease easy.

1147
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:12,200
I'm also psyched to hear you
mentioned ms sugar. Uh Oh yeah,

1148
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,160
they're unbelievable.
Uh, they were another

1149
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,370
one that takes a lot of
time to get a feel for,

1150
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,350
but once you figure out that almost all
of their songs are in a strange kind of

1151
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:26,010
four, four, they become one of the
grooviest bands you've ever heard.

1152
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,630
And there's no coming back.

1153
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:32,580
Enjoy your foray into the weirdness of
progressive music. You speckled asshole.

1154
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:38,610
That's a good one. Speckle the
asshole that said no one. So Nia,

1155
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:44,070
how was your thanksgiving? It was
delicious. And I don't mean the meal.

1156
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,490
I mean, how was the weekend?
Oh, it's great. Thank you.

1157
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,840
There you go guys.

1158
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,580
That's what it come tome
to raining positivity.

1159
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:02,880
What he just said, that's
like a mom too. I was like,
great. Thank you. And you said,

1160
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:06,630
yeah, that's what I come home. Zoo as
if I was to some big negative Nelly. No,

1161
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:09,480
you just sounded like I was asking for
your autograph as you rush through an

1162
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:11,160
airport. Great. Thank you.

1163
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:16,860
Do you want me to say, I just want you
to throw a roll of paper towels at me.

1164
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,490
That's what you should've done. Stop it.
Get away from me. Uh, get away from me.

1165
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:25,620
He doesn't get it hosted. Stop it.
Get off of me. I will clean myself.

1166
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,260
I'm always picking at me.
You're a mother now.

1167
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:35,490
Go downstairs and go fucking pick it.
Your daughter. Isn't she beautiful?

1168
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:40,890
She is knocked out. You can hear her like
really? Cause she's got a little stuck.

1169
01:12:40,891 --> 01:12:45,110
We know. I know. We had the best day
though. No snuck. Omar. Did you guys do,

1170
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,710
uh, we watched the end of
the Patriots game. What's,

1171
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:55,050
you know, I watched the whole
Patriots game and uh, you
know, everybody's, you know,

1172
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:58,680
that's one of the reasons why I don't
get overly excited about a nine.

1173
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:03,130
And to record when you play in the Miami
Dolphins, which was already, uh, just a,

1174
01:13:03,131 --> 01:13:05,130
a franchise that has been transitioning,

1175
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,700
trying to get to another level for
fucking decades, it feels, feels like,

1176
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,253
and you know,

1177
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:15,150
Jay Cutler isn't playing and it's just
one of those games. We got like three,

1178
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:18,540
four sacs, which are going to pad our
numbers. So then we go into the playoffs.

1179
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,510
[inaudible] they got a decent pass,
rush and bubble pop.

1180
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:25,670
This like teams like that. We'll pad
your fucking stats. I got to tell you,

1181
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:30,360
that backup quarterback was
actually pretty good. Um, but,

1182
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:35,190
uh, I, I just, and I love and Tamika Sue,
I just, I don't feel he's a dirty player.

1183
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:37,860
I just think that that guy
plays in the wrong era. He is,

1184
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,650
he is a fucking Dick.

1185
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:45,360
Butkus violent world of Sam
huff type of football player.

1186
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:49,480
He's just playing in the millennial
age. I love that guy. Um,

1187
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,560
anyways,
so we watched that.

1188
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,830
Then I started to watch some of the Ram
Saints Game, which was a great game.

1189
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,310
And then, you know, she
had a runny nose and stuff,

1190
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:03,570
so I was constantly
having to deal with that.

1191
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,680
And I don't know that I read some books.
You like that baby face?

1192
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:12,040
Yeah, she loves that book. I read that
book too. Like five. Really? Yeah.

1193
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:16,090
She loves it. She likes it cause you
act it out. That's like, you know. Yeah.

1194
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,630
But she gets the faces too that they're
making, you know, like, like happy face,

1195
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,530
you know. And then the last one I'll be
like, I go, I, you know, I go laughing,

1196
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:27,400
I'm like kick, kick, kick,
kick. And she'll look at me
going like, he, she laughs too.

1197
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:29,520
It's fucking awesome.
That's our little like

1198
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,190
see has like she still has those,

1199
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:36,610
the big belly laughs like when
you really get her, you know,

1200
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:38,520
like I got her yesterday,
you know,

1201
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,480
but then she does a Little Hee Hee Hee
Hee Hee Alpha, which is like funny. No,

1202
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:45,940
but I got the belly blast yesterday
when you were still mad at me.

1203
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:49,250
Did you hear how hard it was
making her laugh? Yes I did. I say,

1204
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,170
where are we going to talk about that?
About your,

1205
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,030
about what you're like completely,
you know,

1206
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:02,680
being mad at the wrong person because you
were upset about a game and like that.

1207
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,530
It wasn't that what it was
was I was carrying Lola,

1208
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:09,190
my ribs were killing me and
then her in the stroller.

1209
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:11,760
I told you because she didn't want
to be in the stroller. I know,

1210
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,460
but if she like has a moment where
she's like, Eh, she'll be fine.

1211
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,370
You keep it moving and she's fine.
She's not one of those gets,

1212
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:21,820
she's not at that stage yet where she
just screaming for 10 minutes straight.

1213
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:26,080
That's not who she is and plus she has
to learn that you can't carry her all the

1214
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:27,250
time and I wouldn't know.

1215
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:30,760
But she also wrote all the way over there
on the car and then we walked up the

1216
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:34,170
street, we come back down the street.
She was like, I'm over it. You know,

1217
01:15:34,171 --> 01:15:37,180
in the this strapped in like astronauts.
I think eventually I was like,

1218
01:15:37,181 --> 01:15:41,080
get this fucking thing off
me. I understand. It's like,
yeah, I wouldn't like to,

1219
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:44,290
I mean I'd like to be wheeled around but
after I'm at the time we got stuck in

1220
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:49,110
the ride at six flags. Yeah. That's
what they feel like. You think so? Yeah.

1221
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:53,780
Like fuck out of here. Yeah, I'll
probably, I would think so anyways,

1222
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,460
like having a full on parent conversation
right now on the podcast and nobody

1223
01:15:57,461 --> 01:16:00,910
goes back. All right. Sorry.
Anyways, that's the podcast.

1224
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:06,480
A Happy Thanksgiving post Thanksgiving
weekend to you what but what did you say

1225
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:10,540
about being mad at that little boy
when we were going down the street?

1226
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,370
What did I say?
I don't know.

1227
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:14,950
When I came in you were saying
you were just talking about it.

1228
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:17,570
Did you talk about Utah? I was.
Then I was saying, I said there,

1229
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,140
do I do this and you'll do that and
you're just going to be a good dad.

1230
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:23,110
I realized I was being a baby because I
was embarrassed with my behavior there.

1231
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,500
Is that enough? Yeah,
and she and she sat down.

1232
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:30,700
She sat down next to me afterwards. I was
watching the late game and she's like,

1233
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,950
is this game going to make you upset?
Oh my God. The amount of time sunny.

1234
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,490
I swear to God that if you were a guy,
I would just start swinging.

1235
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,430
That was one of those moments
I want to start swinging.

1236
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,211
I would have done the most,
well,

1237
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:48,940
most guys do acted like I was going
to swing and not you to duties.

1238
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:55,720
Bring it. I'm not the one.
You know what? I am the one,

1239
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:00,400
you can talk all this shit and you
want to, I'm an old man. Let's go, Bro.

1240
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:04,840
You want to do this bro? And when
they're like talking top of the bar,

1241
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:07,780
let's go bro. Yeah. You know what
fucking frat boy white guys also do.

1242
01:17:07,781 --> 01:17:12,440
They'll bite your ear off
fucking lunatics. Especially
if their dad's a judge.

1243
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,780
Um, you had to the pens
on like what fucking yeah,

1244
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,530
yeah.
I stayed out of that world.

1245
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,890
I did not like that world at all.

1246
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:28,700
That world was fucked right when,
when I came,

1247
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,840
the shit that they used to do
to people during fucking hazing,

1248
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,460
the fucking stories.

1249
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:38,180
I'm telling you the stories like fucking
guys got from getting hazed to it.

1250
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:41,910
It was, it was fucking like Frat guy,

1251
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,320
white frat guys. I mean, a
lot of guys can drink a lot,

1252
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:49,250
but like they really make
it like a competitive thing.

1253
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm not talking about that. I'm not
talking about that. And it'd be a,

1254
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:56,870
and we stuck a fucking care it up.
His ass kid was screaming.

1255
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,820
I just, what I remember that was one of
my first jokes in my standup back. Yeah,

1256
01:18:01,821 --> 01:18:03,560
people go, how come you didn't
join a Frat? I was like,

1257
01:18:03,561 --> 01:18:06,500
I dunno cause I kinda got this thing
about letting other guys show fruit up my

1258
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:09,240
ass. And he used to get a laugh back
in the 90s because everybody know,

1259
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,750
oh that was like funny.
Like oh hazing.

1260
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:17,360
Like people actually die from that.
So now you don't die from that.

1261
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,010
You did souls crushed.

1262
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,060
How about talking about them making
you drink all the water and all,

1263
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:24,530
you know when he eat all these
pancakes and then they die.

1264
01:18:24,531 --> 01:18:25,700
That's millennial shit.

1265
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,800
I'm talking about what the fuck they used
to decent fucking beat the Shit Outta

1266
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,980
you and fucking a ass. Rapey with
fucking nuts. The stories. I used to hear

1267
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,600
the shit I used to fucking hear that
people used to do to each other and I,

1268
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:41,600
I was just like, I used to always
think of that and then what?

1269
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:43,220
Then you get to hang out
with them afterwards.

1270
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,160
I'm not saying that always
fucking happened but through
some of the [inaudible]

1271
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,200
this is a one ivy league school with it.

1272
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:50,870
This is some pew pancake
you have to fucking eat.

1273
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:54,810
And somebody finally said something about
it and all these older people that he

1274
01:18:54,811 --> 01:18:58,670
was a Dartmouth or something and they
were all mad like dude I can't believe

1275
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:02,540
it's gotten all it's called.
No it's called the vomit.

1276
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:10,490
Disgusting. Why, why,
why is that necessary

1277
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:15,260
to be in a,
in a group to do that sort of thing?

1278
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:19,760
It because they're fucking
losers cause cause cause your,

1279
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:23,360
cause you're exploiting somebody at
a very weak moment in their life.

1280
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,110
They've left their parents, they, they
need new friends, they want to fail.

1281
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:30,910
And I always was just, yeah
I draw. Yes. Hell yeah.

1282
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:36,240
You should hear the fucking stories.
Like some of my relatives were in frats,

1283
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:41,241
some of the shit they did to them
took them outside the dead of winter,

1284
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,570
sprayed him with like a fire hose because
somebody threw a bucket of paint on

1285
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:49,250
one of the older brothers or whatever.
Spreading with bucket paint. Yeah.

1286
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:53,750
Got like fucking pneumonia almost died.
They could just beat the shit out of you.

1287
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:54,740
It was bad.
It was bad.

1288
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,930
Then every once in a while you hear the
fruit that I want to make it seem like

1289
01:19:56,931 --> 01:20:00,350
everybody did that. But I remember being
a gold's gym and this guy was sitting,

1290
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:02,030
I think it was just talking about Hasan,

1291
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,270
people at football camp and he was
going like, yeah. Then we shoved the,

1292
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:08,580
carry it up. It says kid was
fucking screaming out there.

1293
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:12,180
They're hazing experience, but
like anonymously, cause you know,

1294
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:15,720
I don't want to do that. I'm not going
to do a fucking me to guy thing here.

1295
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:19,950
All right.
I don't want to blame the victims,

1296
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:22,800
but I heard what happened and I
was just like, yeah, fuck frats.

1297
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:28,250
Look at my own friends. Yeah, you gonna
you gonna you gonna rush a Frat. Yeah,

1298
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,530
I'll think about a buddy.
Are you, would you just,

1299
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:36,060
you do not have the personality to
be in a fraternity at all. Yeah.

1300
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:38,130
That is the opposite. That
you would, you would eat,

1301
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:42,250
you wouldn't even get past the
first day. Yeah. I, I couldn't,

1302
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:44,290
I couldn't get through the fucking army.
I can get to the army.

1303
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:47,950
You couldn't hear you. Yeah,
you're dead. You're dead.

1304
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:52,090
What are you going to do? Beat the shit
out of me then. I don't have to go to war.

1305
01:20:52,091 --> 01:20:54,620
I'll do that.
Oh,

1306
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:57,160
did I get a dishonorable discharge?

1307
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:05,880
I'm still fucking here. Oh, I'll do
that. Private bearskin whole Sassy.

1308
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:12,280
No, I never would have made no, here's
the deal. At my age when I was young kid,

1309
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:14,470
I would have done whatever the
fuck they said. If I was 18, 19,

1310
01:21:14,471 --> 01:21:16,290
I would have done whatever the
fuck they said. Yeah. Yeah.

1311
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:21,360
So that's why they do it. But yeah.
Anybody middle-aged. All right. Yeah.

1312
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:25,130
I'd be like Michael J. Fox and like, yeah.

1313
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:30,460
All right, that's it. Um, alright.
Go fuck yourselves. I need to worry.

1314
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:33,790
I'm in this podcast. Uh, I'll talk
to you guys on Thursday, right?

Yeah,

1318
01:21:41,511 --> 01:21:45,170
I remember like faculty members going

1319
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,630

Yeah,

1320
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,020

like the sorority and I
don't want to hear it because

1321

it's at this fucking time, because what
you're going to do with Zick creating,

1322
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:58,450

01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:02,830
Like it's this giant non-consent
consensual like fucking orgy.

1324
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:03,791
And it isn't.

1325
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:06,730
Most people aren't here busting their
ass to fucking great people in all that,

1326
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,980
but then now they're going to
say that everybody's, you know,

1327
01:22:08,981 --> 01:22:11,260
how are you have you
don't fucking suck a deck.

You're not going to get a fucking
commercial. It's like dad. No.

1329
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:18,910

people that work in the industry.

1330
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:22,870
So that's true. That's true.
