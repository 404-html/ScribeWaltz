1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,050
Hey, what's going on?
It's bill burr and uh,

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:07,980
this is a very special edition of
the Monday morning podcast. You know,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,580
every once in a while here on the podcast
rather than listening to my psycho

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:16,130
ramblings in my jam jams is I lay
on my bed every once in a while. A,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,200
I'll have a guest on
of highest steam and a,

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,760
this episode is of no a exception. This
is a man I've done a lot of radio with,

7
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,850
but I've never had as a guest.
Please welcome the one, the only,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
the legendary from New Jersey.
Mr Jimmy Norton. Thank you bill.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,990
What's going on?

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,980
It's funny. It's like, do I know you're
such a solo guy when you do your podcast?

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,940
I almost felt like when I texted
you to do it, I almost felt like I,

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,380
you were the hardest one for me to text.

13
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,870
I know you longer than I know
any of them. Right? And it was,

14
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:46,090
you are the hardest one because I'm like,
Bill does it by himself.

15
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,730
I didn't want to put them on the spot.
But you said you've had some guests.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,480
No, no. I've had. Great.
To add Jay more, I've had,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,860
I've had Dave character, I've had
a, Michael Rapaport was great.

18
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,560
Just the whole sports thing. That guy's
like a total like hoop head and I'll,

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,410
yeah,
fuck Boston and all that.

20
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:04,190
So we had a great going back and forth
and of course he trusts me for the giants

21
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:04,821
beat in the Patriots.

22
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:09,821
So I tried to get guests then I'm
friends with because I'm not the greatest

23
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:13,140
interviewer and uh, so
I definitely, you know,

24
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,370
someone that had done a bunch
of radio with now watch,

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,060
are we feeling the tension
that it's all going to go off

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,200
the rail cell?
It's funny,

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,110
it's one of those days off whenever
you're with a friend or whoever you're

28
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,960
interviewing or talking to somebody that
you know as well as we know each other,

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
it's all you want to feel
self conscious. Like, oh no,

30
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,630
they're going to think I'm putting on my
performer hat or my interviewer hat or

31
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,680
my radio guy. It's like, oh Jim,
tell us how did you get your start?

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,660
Oh No.

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,290
And that's what comedy podcasts into
every comic has in Collin won't do them.

34
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,990
He's like, I'm sick and tired of talking
about to go fucking process. You know,

35
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,020
he didn't want to hear what the
process and he's right. I'm actually,

36
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,060
I'm out of here

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,690
stories.

38
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,690
I kind of like tapered back on doing other
podcasts not cause I don't like other

39
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:55,990
podcast. I just, I've run out of
stories. I don't know how many more.

40
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,430
I like the amount of times I
tell the story and I, yeah,

41
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:01,540
I probably told this one before,
but uh, I mean, you know,

42
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,360
everybody's got your classic
half dozen dozen stories.

43
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:07,780
Unless you're like a guy
like Jim Jefferies and you
just live in like a classic

44
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:08,620
story.
It seems everything,

45
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,190
an active alcoholic. If you're an
active alcoholic and you, he's nice.

46
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,660
He's sober now. Yeah. Yeah. He's been,
he's been, he's been been a good boy for,

47
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:18,520
they'll come for a couple of
years. Jim, even if he isn't,

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm not going to say
he's an active alcoholic.

49
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,570
I gotta just got to sit there and be like,
you know,

50
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:26,130
he likes having a good time that Jim
Jefferies, he came in one time and he was,

51
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,520
I think still gone from the night
before. It was quite enjoyable. I like,

52
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:33,520
I don't drink anymore, but like I love
the guy who's drunk like on the air. Oh,

53
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,410
it's awful to deal with in real life in
the air. It's like a phone in a firm.

54
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:41,760
It's great radio. God there he
brought in who that big Irish can be.

55
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,480
Andrew something. He's one of the biggest
words. He doesn't rain is an Ireland. Oh,

56
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:49,320
okay. Man on Saint Patty's day and he was
fucking loaded. Not, not Tommy turning.

57
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,870
No, no, no. We've had him
too. And he was the sober,

58
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,130
this guy I think is bigger than Tommy and
uh, he was just so drunk and obnoxious.

59
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,160
It was just funny to watch this guy who
in his home country, his and he's now,

60
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,850
he's like Kevin Hart, Right. Dot.

61
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,050
Just loaded and fucking seven o'clock in
the morning, blathering making no sense.

62
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,650
And I'm like, this is about who you
are. God, it don't drink anymore.

63
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,190
No, they don't. They don't fuck
around over there. Like it is a, uh,

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,940
it's a whole other,
but I mean there's definitely,

65
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,650
it's not like everybody
over there is a drunk,

66
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,870
but like there isn't like that I should,
I'm saying this is a tourist.

67
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,460
I just didn't see the level of concern
where everybody's so worried about

68
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,370
everybody over here. Like,
do you think he has a PR?

69
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,160
I'm really concerned about so and so.
Like I didn't feel that vibe over there.

70
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,350
It was more like, um, if you felt you had
a problem, maybe you tried to go to a,

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,120
an animal if they have AA over there. Is
that, is that worldwide? Has that spread?

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,900
Yeah. It's made it everywhere. Russia
has no, it doesn't, it doesn't,

73
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,690
does it everywhere has it?
Yeah.

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,990
That's what I've been told
about the youtube clips of
just like people saying it

75
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,840
in all different languages. You know?
That's a good question. I've never looked,

76
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:55,800
from what I understand,
the,

77
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,670
it is anonymous so people don't state
their affiliation with it publicly.

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,370
That's right. You wouldn't film it.
They probably wouldn't allow that. Yeah.

79
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:05,970
They'd try to frown on some guy with a
fucking fucking moron. How would you know?

80
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,990
I mean, people fill me anonymous
meeting. This is the level,

81
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,840
this is the level of intellect
that you're going to get on this.

82
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,610
So fucking settle in.

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,730
There's nothing wrong with that.

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
It's one of those things where
everything is online anyway.

85
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,090
Everything is via the fact that the
fucking first tower getting a hit,

86
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,070
there's a clip of that.

87
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,720
I don't have a windscreen on that. So
you're popping on your keys a little bit.

88
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,370
Uh, so that's, that's my, that's my fault.
Sorry. My last one, my five days a week,

89
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,460
10 years. And I don't know not
to go into a fucking microphone

90
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,100
with the fact that that's my ob by the
way, says bullet and not put, he'll say,

91
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,780
did you put that down?

92
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:46,800
Like there's certain words
he says P is B because he,

93
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,310
he went to broadcasting school castings
can eat. That. Sounds like such a,

94
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,010
such a broadcasting school.
His thing.

95
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,490
No, they didn't in college. You learned,
I think you learned in college actually,

96
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,010
but he, you know, he went
from communications. But, um,

97
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,760
the fact that there is footage of the
first tower getting hit like that plane

98
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:01,720
going in,
you know,

99
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,780
back then everyone didn't have the cell
phones at the cameras is a miracle.

100
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,720
Like so it's not surprising that people
think that things are going to be filmed.

101
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,330
I don't know why I'm on this tangent
but it's not surprising to me.

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,100
Okay.

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,710
I'm glad that was a tangent cause I was
like trying to adjust the level there as

104
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,590
you adjust the microphone away
from him. I was like, oh my God,

105
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,030
it's all about nine 11. Where the
hell did we go? Just for a second.

106
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,330
I just started like a weird thing
to be on film just as a color. Yeah,

107
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,350
just a little something.

108
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:25,050
Just a little cells to bring us
back to how lucky we are. Bill,

109
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,530
how Walker would it be if I just
mentioned had 11 and started blubbering.

110
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,280
Anything worse than somebody cries like
way too long after. And I was sitting in,

111
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,510
in Jim's fucking fabulous hotel
rooms so that would really be fucking

112
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:40,560
uncomfortable. Creepy on. It'd
be as long as the mikes are on.

113
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:42,810
And I feel there's an audience,
even though I can't see him. Yeah,

114
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,380
it wouldn't be that bad. But if,
if we would just here by ourselves,

115
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:51,330
which fucking takes me back to a
moment, Cleveland, that I, yes,

116
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,010
I was in a hotel room,

117
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:57,290
pissed and you fucking knocked on the
door and talk me off the fucking ledge.

118
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,970
It was, it was the Gig after
the Philly gig where I was like,

119
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,470
I knew that they were going to boot me
again, just the Boomi rather than Philly.

120
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,320
They booed me cause they
didn't like me. And then, um,

121
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,150
by the time the fucking Cleveland Gig,

122
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,900
you guys gave me so much props that
the crowd wanted to see it again.

123
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,130
So I was asking, uh, somebody there, hey,

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,340
just put me on early. Give
me a chance. Just give me a
chance. Ever. He's like, yeah,

125
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,620
yeah, yeah, don't worry. And then
I was in the exact same spot.

126
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,370
I go out there and I just walk out,
I'm on for two seconds.

127
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:31,880
They just start bullying me, just
the Boomi. And I was like, look,

128
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,710
I'm not going to pretend to get mad
because you guys are pretending to Boomi.

129
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,270
And it didn't go anywhere.
I got off stage and I was fucking livid.

130
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:41,690
I remember me and Jeff will still
laugh about it because Jeff was like,

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,820
oh, I'm sorry. I was like, fuck
you. Fuck you, fuck this state,

132
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,990
fuck everything. And I left. I think I
threw a water bottle. Very unhappy. I was,

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,150
I was not happy and are not cause me,
I catastrophize in my head.

134
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:57,560
So I was like going, oh my God, I
become the boom guy and I'm going to go.

135
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,760
And everywhere I go,

136
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,270
I kind of forgot because I had been on
the virus tour long enough that to me a

137
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,660
normal show was fucking 10,000 people.

138
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,240
And I wasn't thinking like my next gig
after that tour was at the punchline.

139
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,550
It's like a cozy 200 people and
I can see everyone, you know?

140
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:17,540
And so if anybody fucked with me,
I could get them. And so anyways,

141
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,400
so I go back to the fucking hotel
room, uh, ready to quit the business.

142
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,330
And I hear a knock on the door and you
came walking in and fucking talk me off

143
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:26,850
the ledge.

144
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,110
I remember that. I don't even
remember what we spoke about it.

145
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:32,220
I just remember you were very upset
and I knew why and you will like they

146
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:33,240
fucking, and I was like, dude,

147
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:38,040
they did it because they were trying to
recapture a moment that they want it to

148
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,700
be a part of something that was very
amazing to them as opposed to they hated

149
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,600
you. You know what I mean? I didn't, I was

150
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,180
fenced. Everyone was out to get
me the, the crowd, the show,

151
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,800
uh, uh, not live nation. Everybody.

152
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,460
Well, I'm still convinced
about that. Fuck me.

153
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:56,360
I couldn't get the odd ball tour this
year. I can't get on the eyeball touring.

154
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,780
They're doing fucking the tweeter
center and, and late half those please.

155
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,630
What's that? You've played half of
those places and I can't get on the,

156
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,610
I couldn't get a fucking
set on the odd ball. Ah,

157
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,850
or they'll have it next year. Yeah. I
know. This shit is guys like you and me.

158
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:14,560
We always got to fucking, we always got
to go the extra fucking whatever it is.

159
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,160
It was always remember that when they
were doing the half hours on, on a,

160
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,910
on comedy central or,
or the whatever the fuck that was,

161
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:25,060
it was always the guy with the silly hat.
The person with the catch phrase,

162
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:29,470
the hot chick, the fat guy, you know,
the blackout doesn't scare white people.

163
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:33,340
They had to get through all of those and
then they also had to get the veterans

164
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,560
that they fucked over on the
last group of half hours.

165
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,650
They have to give her to all of
those fucking guys. And then,

166
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,810
and then it was always us afterwards.

167
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,120
I ever did with for comedy central.
I was so resentful over being passed over.

168
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,570
I was like, Frito, I just was like,
fuck these guys. I'm not going to do it.

169
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,310
And then I waited for him.
Not like everybody says,

170
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,740
well that's the way Doug wanted it.
Yeah.

171
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,160
I wound up,
uh,

172
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,350
said I want to hold that for HBO and a
that when we finally did them for Hbo and

173
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,630
they were supposed to do four and they
were going to be really these special

174
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:07,020
half hours and now they want to do
in 10 of them and I'm, you know,

175
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,420
I'm happy we did it.
I'm glad I held off for Hbo.

176
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,280
Yeah, you did. And you did the same
year, the same year that I did it.

177
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,320
Well you all we want to, okay. I take with
Patrice. You taped with Kevin Brennan,

178
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:23,060
right? I still remember that. And
then the Louis C K Yep. One time.

179
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,910
Um, you know, cause I'm obsessed with
trying to own everything I did, you know,

180
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,090
I tried to buy my half hour back from Hbo,
but they wanted me to buy the whole,

181
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,070
I had to buy the whole fucking series.

182
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:37,400
I did buy like all 10 of them know how
much they want out Jesus. It was like,

183
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:41,300
you know, in the millions. So it was
just, I mean, I was looking at it like,

184
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,140
well it costs me 130 to shoot it our,

185
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:49,640
so I ought to be able to offer them.
She fucking 65 and they were like, no,

186
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,550
you have to buy the whole season
and like, you know, fuck it.

187
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,050
I don't know some of the thing to throw
money at the sopranos or something to

188
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,210
get it,
but I wish I had the money because,

189
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,060
but nowadays everyone just steals
everything anyone says probably dumb.

190
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:05,150
But when I was looking back at that,
I'm like, that series is fucking insane.

191
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,070
That's you, Patrice O'Neal rest his
soul is the fucking greatest I ever saw.

192
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,930
Louie earthquake flight of the Conchords
was wider. The Conchords was one.

193
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,190
That's right.
I forgot they were on it.

194
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,250
They wanted me to do it with
those guys and I did to,

195
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,910
I did one and I was just like,
uh, you know, I think once,

196
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,880
what's his face bot delirious
off of them. They were shy. They,

197
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:30,220
we've got a little gun shy. Oh, he owns
it now Murphy. I didn't know that. No.

198
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,460
What's his face coming up next?
Comics unleashed that guy. Oh, Byron.

199
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,910
Byron Allen bought that Motherfucker,
delirious.

200
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,810
Hbo showed that fucking thing. And
then they just, when we were kids,

201
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,480
teenagers and uh,

202
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,970
they just never showed it again.

203
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:50,510
They had it in their library and somehow
Byron Allen went in there and bought it

204
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,330
off of him. How much? Right. But
I don't know what he paid for it.

205
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:57,170
Like a couple million bucks.
And right before the whole DVD thing died,

206
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,140
he put it out,
it like 15,

207
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:05,020
20 a whack and he sold like 4
million of them are some genius.

208
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:07,550
That guy. He is. And a lot
of people don't really,

209
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,650
I don't like talking about people's money,
but this fucking guy,

210
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,910
it's like this guy,

211
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,330
he has like three quarters Oprah
money and people don't even know.

212
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,000
They just look at him like he's
one of those guys, like, you know,

213
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:21,620
like how Seinfeld sees his show, where
everybody else sees just hanging out.

214
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,720
He's one of those guys like
I saw at Seinfeld on uh, um,

215
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,910
the daily show the other day talking to
Jon Stewart and they were joking how he

216
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:33,080
was saying how he did TV, right?
How he just did it, did it once.

217
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,770
It lives forever. And Jon Stewart, when he
does an episode of the daily show, it's,

218
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:37,720
it's all topicals.

219
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:42,440
So no one's going to buy the box set of
the fucking day on Shell. And um, Jesus,

220
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,730
I'm taking the long way around here.

221
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,320
So he was talking about the new TV show
he's doing, uh, on the, on on the net,

222
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,370
which is fucking comedians in
cars getting coffee. And he said,

223
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:55,810
which is what I would doing anyway,
right? So Byron Allen was a guy,

224
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,270
took those press junkets when
you were just like, well, it was,

225
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:02,440
it like to work with Steven
Spielberg, talk about Mel
Gibson, blah, blah, blah, blah.

226
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:06,880
All that he actually saw show and then
that's where he came up with that coming

227
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,190
up. Next thing it was just
a fucking press junkets.

228
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,210
And what's coming up next is
that he would say common up next.

229
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,020
Jim Norton and talking about the vice
show that he's on and blah, blah blah.

230
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,320
And he turned that,
he turned that into a fucking TV show.

231
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,080
That comics unleashed is genius.

232
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,060
It's literally just, and, and
it's the worst setups of all time.

233
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,370
Is it just do your act for
three minutes at a clip,

234
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,840
but it's fucking jeans and
he produces the whole thing.

235
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,600
He owns the whole fucking guy.
A gene.

236
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:36,970
Like he's like a hero of mine is far as
like the way he does like this business.

237
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,250
And he's basically for people, a of
this is to uh, go into quick here.

238
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,110
He basically that show,
if you don't watch it,

239
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,780
it's just Byron Allen sitting there
with three or four other comics.

240
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,730
He already knows what your bits are.

241
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,490
So you've already written the
whole fucking show for him.

242
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,650
And all he does is just say your
set up like, so Jim, uh, you ever a,

243
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,830
you ever lived in a fucking building
in New York and then you're likable,

244
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,900
murder for,
go ahead.

245
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,020
And the other comment on that drug,
cause nobody's calling each other out.

246
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,120
Like they're all like just
participating in like,

247
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:08,900
it is a really a good time we're having
like how can three comedians sit there

248
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,070
and listen to a guy do a bit off that
setup and not want to fuck and attack them

249
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,310
or they can't do that. Cause then
they'd get sued by tough crowd. Yeah.

250
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,870
You don't want, I guess that's what that,
that's what made tough crowd funding

251
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,770
crown was fucking awesome that we,
that has such a, such a cult following.

252
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,520
Do you know, people stay asked
me like just as much for a first,

253
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:30,720
just along a time,
like when Chappelle show coming back,

254
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,140
when's tough crowd coming back?
Those two shows had like, uh,

255
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,650
these die hard fans and
I, I still don't, um,

256
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,330
I don't understand what
about calling I'd get,

257
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,480
he got his own show and he gave every
comedian in New York a TV credit just

258
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:50,280
about, like I, I was trying to, I remember
towards the, the last, a season of that,

259
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:53,520
I was trying to think of somebody who
hadn't been on it. He got everybody on.

260
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,370
I think he did. Yeah, it was Bobby.
Bobby was an irregular on it,

261
00:13:56,371 --> 00:14:00,140
but Bobby was on it a couple
of times. Um, I, yeah. Oh,

262
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,310
I thought he was under quite a
bit. No, I don't think he was.

263
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:04,480
I could be wrong about that. Maybe
I'm thinking open ethic. He's,

264
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:07,320
he didn't do opie and Anthony on new, he
didn't do that too. We're on satellite,

265
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,180
so maybe he was on tough
crowd more than I thought.

266
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,200
But I remember him being talked about
warm up for it at one point and like,

267
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:17,140
I don't want to fuck that
one up there. You know, man,
Bobby. So I think that, uh, he,

268
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,340
it's a very short fuse, so I think that
he was on a few times, but I didn't,

269
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,070
I don't think I ever did it with
them. Right. They get mad at me too.

270
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,670
He got mad at me cause I remember
that we went to Vegas, like I met,

271
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:29,460
we went to Vegas together, but not the
actual fight and he got very angry at me.

272
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm like, yeah. I'm like, yeah, that
was your IFA. But it's like, fuck dude,

273
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:35,070
I know I was fucking now with Ya.
I'm like, oh, all right, sorry.

274
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,320
I can't make fun of liberty

275
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,960
for having a temper.
But he's another guy who,

276
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:45,980
he's always had to go the extra fucking
12 miles. He's just one of those guys.

277
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,540
He does got that short thing.

278
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,940
I remember one time I was walking down
the street with them when he was talking,

279
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:52,220
you know, when we all just start
complaining about the business.

280
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,370
So he was complaining about the
business and he was going to, uh,

281
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,460
he was going to help me with the complete,
you know, he's great with the computer.

282
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,950
So he was going to help me.
And as we were walking,

283
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:02,810
I used to live around the corner
from him and I'm thinking, well,

284
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,810
my computer is up on the, you know, the
fucking whatever, the seventh floor,

285
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,820
and he's on the ground floor
and I'm thinking in my head,

286
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,820
let me go out and get the computer
and we'll take it over to his house.

287
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:15,620
So as he's telling like his, you know,
fucking 20 the story about this business,

288
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,210
I said, hey Bob, what if I can I just go
up and get that age just fucking snapped.

289
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:20,780
And he goes,
HM,

290
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,330
don't
fuck

291
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,920
did on ninth avenue and like
broad daylight and you do
it like everybody fucking,

292
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,660
you know, people look in and shit.
And I just looked at him like,

293
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,000
and the old me would have taken the bait
and I would've gotten to this big fuck

294
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:41,550
you fuck you fight. And I don't
even know if this is the new me.

295
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:43,590
I just was not an,
I don't know,

296
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:45,540
I just wasn't in a place
where I was mad or anything.

297
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:50,100
He so came on a nowhere that I just
kind of looked at. I was like, Bob,

298
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:53,820
I thought we kind of got past doing
this to each other and then he kind of

299
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,960
laughed and it was gone,

300
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,560
which he's always been able to do as
much as that guy flips the fuck out,

301
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,970
he's able to bring it back down and be
like, I do at least and do it. I'm like,

302
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:05,530
he's not a grudge holder. I started, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So he fucking, uh,

303
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,610
that was like an instant Bobby
classic. Don't interrupt me. Yeah,

304
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:14,230
that's what a great line echoing.
I just like how he said it.

305
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:15,380
Like I worked for him.

306
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,050
Like I felt like he should have been
behind some big walnut desk. Oh, is it?

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,660
Maybe we could do this.
Don't interrupt

308
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,550
made contact.
I'm talking cause you fucked this up.

309
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,500
You don't just be so happy.
That makes me so that,

310
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,670
that's a fucking Bobby scream and I'm
really happy that that happened to

311
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:36,120
somebody other than me. Oh No. He's a
frightening guy. When he fucking yells.

312
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,720
I hate to admit it, but Bobby's a
fucking maniac. He does scare me.

313
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,860
I would call them a maniac,
but that's a, that's the one

314
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,280
plot and kettle there. I'm out of my
fucking mind dude. Like when I'm out here,

315
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,340
I literally had to make a rule
about just relaxing when I drive.

316
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,060
And w one thing that it helps is very
therapeutic for me is letting people go.

317
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
If you're really like,

318
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,360
I get so frustrated with the
quality of the driving out here,

319
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,370
the inability to fucking make
turns at a decent speed and,

320
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,780
and we'll do it when they go buy shit out
here. The second they pass it, it's it.

321
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,720
They don't even remember it. They
have no fears, no fucking clue.

322
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,990
As for what's behind you.
Like you know what they do here,

323
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:19,190
I'd hear that fucking drives me nut.

324
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,140
You'll be sitting behind some
guy to a red light, you know,

325
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,470
in Europe on his bumper.
You know,

326
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,030
like you're supposed to be not in
crazy and it's the light turns green.

327
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:28,310
He then puts his left fucking director.

328
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,810
It's absolute enraging and it's self
centered and yet it's, it's, it's,

329
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm with you.

330
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,490
It's wrong that I fantasize about pushing
him into traffic and know it's wrong.

331
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,970
You don't have the moral courage to do it.
That's totally,

332
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,440
I think that's totally right.

333
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:45,470
And whenever you hear about someone
getting shot and killed for road rage,

334
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,460
everyone folks goes, oh my
God, that maniac that shot
that. And I honest to God,

335
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:54,750
the first thing I think is I'm glad like
and until I find out that guy with the

336
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,950
gun was the Dick who who fucked up.

337
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,850
I love that you have to find out
that the guy with the gun was a dick.

338
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:03,480
I know to find that out.
The guy with the gun overreacted a little,

339
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,820
but it's just there's something about,

340
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:09,870
because people are so self centered
and narcissistic when they drive it,

341
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,670
it's a reflection of who they really are,

342
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,420
so that's why we take it so fucking
personally may like you let people go.

343
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,450
If the guy, if a guy doesn't wave
thank you to me, that's awesome.

344
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,040
No sin,

345
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,060
they don't do that out here and I go from
like being this fucking mother Theresa

346
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,910
Person. I turned it to
the devil. It starts,

347
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:31,660
I try to stay calm as such with a couple
of release in my car. I just got really,

348
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,420
really, really, you're not going to
fuck these fucking people out of here.

349
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,460
I don't know what the fuck are you.

350
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,340
I ended up turning into that
just because some douche.

351
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,810
Do you see the look on their face? They're
like, please, please, please let me go.

352
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:47,770
And you go to let them go
and you think like, Oh hey,
thumbs up something. Nothing.

353
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:51,700
They immediately, I just
back into their own. Uh,

354
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,080
I dunno.

355
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,510
I find sometimes I wave at people out
here and they look at me like weird.

356
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,260
Like what do you know me?
Like maybe you know,

357
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,650
I did move 2,500 miles away
from where I learned, you know,

358
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,290
societal rules. So maybe uh, but you
know, you just think if you know,

359
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,040
you're waving to another white guy. I
mean we're pretty fucking generic. Yeah.

360
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,900
You know,
there's not a lot of depth to the culture.

361
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,710
Sure. Here is that there's no gang
signs right away. I can see black guys,

362
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
he'll freak out watching which
point your fingers are turning.

363
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,250
Well plus he's Costo is so aggressive
and I hate to do like get all your thing.

364
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,390
But out here maybe that courtesy,
like you know in Boston or New York,

365
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,460
if someone lets you cut it and it's like,
Hey motherfucker,

366
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,930
I did you occur to seeing like,
Hey,

367
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:31,110
thank you for the car to say you're a
good shit though. Welcome, you're welcome.

368
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,190
But here it's like,

369
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:35,280
well that was just expected because they
might do that for each other more out

370
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:38,160
here. It's not a big deal.
That's the only I can think of.

371
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,310
I was in the Pennsylvania turnpike one
time driving to a Gig and I know I'm

372
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,260
popping all over every,
I'm very self conscious talking

373
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,480
is how are you doing? What? You're
doing much better. But I don't have,

374
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,190
I don't have anybody to
help us out with this.

375
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,830
Okay.

376
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,780
I was driving to a Gig and a guy cut
into my lane and I was doing about 70 it

377
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:55,620
was raining and he had a trailer,

378
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,730
normal.
And I'm like hydro,

379
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,620
you know, it was a real drive
to with my Mustang, real punk,

380
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:03,530
your shit fucking
hydroplane and cargo recall.

381
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,800
And I'm driving and this guy is
coming into my lane and I immediately,

382
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:09,020
your mind when you're thinking you're
going to die, it goes very quickly.

383
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,120
And I'm like, okay, you
got to slam on the brakes,

384
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,940
you're going to have an accident,
hit the wall. Like it tried to,

385
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,920
it's self down, sideswiped the
wall. So I jam on the brake,

386
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:22,010
I hit the horn and he veers out
and we don't have the accident.

387
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,340
So then I'm not afraid I'm in a
rage at this fucking guy. Right.

388
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,960
And I pull up next to him and it's a,
it's a like a,

389
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,620
you don't have a fat
black dude like it all.

390
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,800
Family Mopey guy and I'm ready to really,

391
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,700
you know we've went from family guy
actually. Yes. William Stephenson fellows

392
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,510
and now he looks at me and he gives me the
like, oops, I fucked up ways up. Sorry.

393
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:48,030
And it gives me that and
every bit of drink cause

394
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,030
he, he just owned up to it. I'm sorry.
Sorry. Yet I wave back. No problem. Yeah,

395
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,760
that was it in a second my rage,
it was gone. You know what's funny,

396
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:02,620
I sometimes when somebody acts on the
rage, even though I know it's wrong,

397
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,030
I sort of lived through the,

398
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,470
the fucking ecstasy
that that must be like,

399
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,070
do you remember when Russell Crowe
through the phone? I said, Guy,

400
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,180
I just can't imagine,

401
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,350
like when you're in a hotel and you're
not getting the customer service you want

402
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,030
on whatever it is,

403
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:22,630
that the fact that you actually take the
machine that they won't help you with

404
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,290
and fucking hurt somebody,
the person who not helping you,

405
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:31,240
you fucking hurt him with it. Completely
wrong thing to do. But I can't imagine.

406
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,190
I always was wondering why is he's
letting that phone go? Just Ah,

407
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,650
just fucking all that rage going on him.
I think it was, it was good for him.

408
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:41,070
It was bad for the guy behind the,
uh,

409
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,330
by the counter behind the
counter was brought to people,

410
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:45,820
learned a lesson that day.
Russell Crowe learn not to do it.

411
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:49,270
The other guy probably learned better
fucking customer service next time because

412
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:52,010
I remember when that happened,
I was in the Greenwich Hotel and uh,

413
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,500
it was Dinero owns and I remember like,
Oh my God, that's a really nice place.

414
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,110
It's beautiful. Like he would stay
at a die from a stupid comment,

415
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,820
but I remember thinking this satisfaction,

416
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,010
it must've felt when
the phone hit the guy,

417
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,990
like how good that must've felt a throw
that phone with that motherfucker.

418
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,160
And again, he got in big trouble for that.
But yeah, that was a story that I do.

419
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,200
You know how mad you are you,

420
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,430
you're pulling the wires out of the wall
and that voice is still not going, okay,

421
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,710
what are you doing? What are you
doing? And then you wrap it up,

422
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,100
you leave your hotel, you're walking
down the hall, he leave Your Room,

423
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:23,920
you get into the fucking elevator
and your brain's still going. Yeah,

424
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,830
throw it at him. Yeah, throw it
out. What happened? Well, I mean he,

425
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,190
he went downstairs to the front.
I mean I don't,

426
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,220
I was just wanting to pick the phone up
off the desk and just do it on them. Oh,

427
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,620
I thought he was upstairs in his room.
Maybe he was, but I thought the, I didn't,

428
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,380
I didn't, I thought he just picked
the phone up and threw it. The guy.

429
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,130
That makes way more sense if I find out
that he actually wrapped the cord and

430
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:46,480
took the phone from downstairs.
That makes me love him more. I was,

431
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,390
I loved him just for picking it up.
I probably fucked it up.

432
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,950
I fucked up everything.
I don't know.

433
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,430
Do you know the other day I
actually called the periodic chart.

434
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,620
I called it the periodical.
Yeah,

435
00:22:56,621 --> 00:23:01,390
but that's understanding on the ones
that was a magazine ad. That's no excuse.

436
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,210
That's like you're on a fear on a
western. You call it a cow boy. Yet.

437
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,040
How do you not fucking know?

438
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,600
It shows you the amount
of fucking research I did
through sometimes on Twitter.

439
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,270
Where do you get trashed?
It's just so fucking on the money.

440
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,900
And I always read it as if people
would just be in mean to be mean.

441
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:24,580
But when they call me out for the,
all the stupid shit, it really, uh,

442
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,120
it makes being on Twitter worth it.
Cause other than hyper and your shows,

443
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,630
it's usually just a bunch of people giving
you shit artist with half the fucking

444
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:36,200
information pause on that.
Um, they fucking, and then,

445
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:39,370
then it just becomes like a,
you know, it just becomes like,

446
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,940
why am I on this thing? Because it
will literally put you in a bad mood.

447
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:45,170
And then every once in a while somebody
like that guy waving, you know,

448
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:45,581
in the car,

449
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:48,350
he just gives you shit in the right
way and it makes you fucking laugh.

450
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:51,420
You retweet, they select your,
retweet them and it just,
it becomes like, all right,

451
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,420
I'm fucking cool with Twitter again.

452
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,450
I have a piece of, of criticism,
somebody's bashed me all the time,

453
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,890
but actually have it on my desktop and I,
I've opened it a few times and read it.

454
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:03,290
It was just about like, you know, I
used to love Jim, but he knew the,

455
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,580
but the guy made some valid points as
to what I do wrong on the radio and a

456
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:12,650
about how like, and I felt this
constructive criticism, but he was mad,

457
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,000
but I actually felt like,
Eh,

458
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,270
this is actually coming from the guy who
was a fan and who just thinks I've been

459
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:20,810
quite a con for a while and uh,
you know what,

460
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,380
I read it and it just resonated with
me. Like this guy is not wrong. I mean,

461
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:29,470
I don't like what he said, very mature
way of handling criticism. But yeah,

462
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:32,180
I normally it's, it's, it's
much more like rage full.

463
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:35,590
I want to find out who they are and I,
you know, I get very, very angry and uh,

464
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,610
this time it just, it just
got me right. I'm like,

465
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:41,240
I know he's being honest and he's
like, oh, I have been doing that.

466
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,160
It feels exposing when some stranger just
notices you're fucking your weaknesses

467
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,120
and your crutches.

468
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,930
I've had a couple of heckles like the,

469
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,240
Oh they kind of put you in your place and
you gotta be like, you want to be like,

470
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,180
Ooh, do you do for a living? That's
soaks. But you have to be like,

471
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,830
I finally learned at one point,

472
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,410
oh you know something I actually
learned about handle a heckler is in a

473
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:04,550
different way. Watching you.
I did down at Caroline's,

474
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,030
it finally clicked.
I learned through watching you,

475
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:12,140
you don't have to chop all their heads
off. Sometimes they are ordering food.

476
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,330
Sometimes they're just repeating
a, a punchline. Like I saw,
I forget what you, you,

477
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,530
they were talking and you just kind of
said something. What'd you say? Oh okay.

478
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:24,890
And, and you kind of like, you
actually ask them what they said.

479
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:28,310
I think that that's what it was rather
than just assuming that they were

480
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:31,490
trashing you saying that you sucked it
cause he amount of times I kept having

481
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:34,760
this reoccurring thing where someone,
if anybody talked,

482
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:38,450
I was convinced they were saying that I
sucked and they would make fun of how I

483
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,040
looked at whatever and
I was the first eight,

484
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:43,820
nine years of my career and I would chop
the heads off and the amount of times

485
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:47,360
afterwards people would come up to
me at the end to show shows going.

486
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,680
I was just asking where the bathroom was
or I was actually saying I enjoyed your

487
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,400
act and blah blah blah blah blah. And
then I felt like I couldn't get out of it.

488
00:25:55,401 --> 00:26:00,290
Man. I like, I was locked in this, you
know, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em,

489
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,260
get 'em kind of vibe. And then I
was watching you and I and I was,

490
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,140
it took me a while to learn how to do

491
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,810
well I had one too.

492
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:09,750
It's once in a while that'll happen at
the cellar because that's such a loud,

493
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,240
small area where you'll
say something to say,

494
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,820
you'll hear somebody talking and I can
always see if it's somebody ordering a

495
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:18,000
drink that I leave it alone. Um,
you know, cause it's a small room.

496
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,940
But once in a while you'll hear talking
and I've had a few people like over the

497
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:24,480
years go, like, what? What will you
say? I just think, I think you're funny.

498
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:26,450
I'm enjoying you.
And then I've just kind of now,

499
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,280
then I repeat that and I just kind of
get the audience to laugh at me with it

500
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:33,210
because it's like, all right,
they all know I was about
to attack the person. Yeah.

501
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,460
They all know that this
was an almost heckle.

502
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,650
And so did you always do
that or is that something,

503
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,300
I think I learned it in a place called,
uh, Arba John's, which was a two.

504
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,170
I first met Arie Spears back
in the 1991 when he was going,

505
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:48,810
his mom would bring him to open mikes and
he would do these robo cop impressions,

506
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:52,100
but he was too young to
get him by himself. So his
mother took him and it was a,

507
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:57,101
a Sheraton bar area and I had just
had felt a wave of depression.

508
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,930
I probably did that Gig. Yeah. Oh
yeah. Well, East Brunswick, New Jersey.

509
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,980
What did you start? What
year? I started marching 92.
Okay. Yeah. So you might have,

510
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:05,910
it was right around that time.

511
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,740
Well, I started up a Massachusetts and
then I worked, I got down to New York. Uh,

512
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,340
I probably did my first road
gig out there and in 95 oh six,

513
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,870
but I remember going out to those,
some of those Jersey ones in those hotels.

514
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,070
Awful.
Yeah.

515
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,100
They will either great or you just would
driving home fucking that thousand yard

516
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,060
stare. Like, oh my God, what have I done?

517
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
I remember doing one with
Vinny, Brandon, Bob Levy,

518
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:32,640
where there was a pool I believe
in between us and the audience.

519
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,890
I'll never forget that gay.
We were on one side,

520
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:39,660
there's a holiday inn and it was in the
pool area and we were an obvious place

521
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:42,330
for a competent,
wonderful place to try your art.

522
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,800
Wet feet slapping by as you're fucking
China do your jokes. That was really bad.

523
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:50,700
I remember Vinny or we were in the front,
but I remember there was a pool,

524
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,030
I think between us in the crowd, but
in their orbit. Jordan's, we've always,

525
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:59,031
I was smashing a heckler arbit John and
nobody was laughing in the back and then

526
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:05,070
I realized like, oh, they
can't hear what is being said.

527
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,870
Repeat what they say a it buys you a
couple of seconds and nobody knows you're

528
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:13,430
doing it right. We were like, how with the
audience we know, we're like, you know,

529
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,550
someone's like, you know you suck.
You're terrible. I suck and I'm terrible.

530
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,330
It's like you've just bought yourself
and if you hit them, tried it.

531
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,300
Priceless time. Yeah.
Yeah. It's really weird.

532
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,740
I don't know how to explain this to
people. When, when, when people like,

533
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,090
how'd you come up with that that fast?
Like I don't know.

534
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,050
When you see a funny moment,
I don't mean a written joke,

535
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:37,260
but if someone slams you and you're
great at fucking firing back immediately

536
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,820
like Donald Hammond said he sees
impressions as colors like a yellow or an

537
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,260
orange.
He can't explain it.

538
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,860
When I see like slamming
something as like,

539
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:48,420
it's like these weird
choices you're making,

540
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,930
they're kind of floating in front of you.
Like you don't see the words

541
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,260
but is that why you self,
cause you got the fastest mind if anybody,

542
00:28:55,261 --> 00:29:00,080
and we used to sit at the table at the
seller do when you is Patrice was like

543
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,170
she would just make you fucking, yeah,
you'd start crying when he was the best.

544
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,270
But like as far as speed,
like I thought Patrice,

545
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:11,240
a lot of times he would use
his laugh to drown you out.

546
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:14,570
Like he had all these different things.
You would just sit there.

547
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,870
I remember when you'd start looking at me
I was like, oh fuck he's looking at me.

548
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,350
He's looking. It was a different thing.
Like with Keith, I felt Keith Robinson,

549
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,910
Keith,
you could get,

550
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:26,890
you could get a mitness face to
try to throw him off like Keith,

551
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,220
stop looking at me,
blah blah blah.

552
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:31,130
And that would make them forget what he
was going to say. But you never forgot.

553
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,571
And Voss,

554
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:36,090
all you had to do with via techniques
for all of you guys survive the Voss.

555
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,650
All you had to do was lay on the ropes
and eventually he would say something

556
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,540
that bombed and then it would come
back on him. He always got bit,

557
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,190
he would hit you one,
two,

558
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:49,840
three times and then that fourth or
fifth one would be so bad at bombed that

559
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:52,990
everyone would then jump on him.
So you never really had to get them back

560
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,380
voice what voice would be
pounding you and pounding you.

561
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:58,010
But he always got greedy and
throw a right hand lead. Yeah,

562
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,950
you always punch himself out.
Always Punch himself out.

563
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,400
But how do you see when you, when you're,
whether it's a heckler, whatever, how do,

564
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,370
I can't explain to people
how that works. Like, how,

565
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:12,310
how do you think of a joke
or a funny thing to say it?

566
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,690
It's almost like watching things float
in front of you and you grab them.

567
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,070
I look at it more like in
the beginning it was like,

568
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:23,150
remember like I have to have
these stock lines, right? Hey,

569
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:26,810
where'd you learn how to whisper
helicopter, helicopter factory?

570
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,340
Like what is that they're already on.

571
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,230
It didn't even make sense
and it always got a laugh.

572
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,550
Um,
but it was more like those,

573
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:40,130
I had those stock lines
and then it became,

574
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,980
I would watch and Greg Fitzsimmons and
I've told him this before in his show,

575
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:46,630
I learned from Greg where
Greg would just ask him, like,

576
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,110
Greg is fucking unbelievable on.
He's so good at it.

577
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,990
Fucking with people in the crowd and what
time we would play in this place. The,

578
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,310
the grill 93. And uh, oh my God,

579
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:03,140
where was it was up. It was on route 93
messages. Yeah, it was not Arlington.

580
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:05,300
That was the way Dane was falling.
Springfield,

581
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:09,830
I can't even over to get with an a, I
don't remember. And um, Andover mass.

582
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,400
And over, there you go. Yeah,
the grill 93 in Andover mass.

583
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,760
And these two guys showed up with matching
American flag shirts and they sat in

584
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:24,581
the front row and Greg was so good at
trash and people like I was either hosting

585
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:29,780
or featuring, but me and the host or me
and the feature both said to Greg, Greg,

586
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,730
we're not going to fuck with those guys,

587
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,580
but you have to promise us that you're
going to write at the beginning.

588
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,300
Go after him. And he goes, absolutely.
Absolutely. So we deliberately did not,

589
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,860
none of these guys
wanted to get picked on.

590
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:44,720
And Greg ended up going up there and
he just started telling this story.

591
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,380
They've just went all the way around
the fucking band at this point.

592
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,570
People are like, what is he talking
about? Some high buy around the beach,

593
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,310
you know what I mean? That
would be like, I dunno,

594
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:56,270
like wearing matching American flags
shirts with your friends or something.

595
00:31:56,271 --> 00:32:00,080
And then he just pointed at the guys and
opened his mouth like David Lee Roth,

596
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:04,190
you know, when he looks at the back row
and it just fucking absolutely destroyed.

597
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,910
I saw my time at the cow, Luna,
he eat fucking heat by that.

598
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,110
It was like Hannibal Lecter should,

599
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,450
he could tell by the
shoes the guy was wearing,

600
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,710
he guessed the guy's name and for
guests is, he guessed his job,

601
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,240
the table the guy was sitting at
was going nuts and it was just all,

602
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,970
and of course his name was horrible.
His job was horrible.

603
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:26,030
Where he lived was horrible. He started,
he did a little vignette of their family.

604
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:29,060
Like he's unbelievable at
doing stuff like that. So,

605
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,680
so that's funny when people ask me,
you know who your influences as well,

606
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:35,660
that was, you know, as much as it was
the, the grates that you listened to.

607
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,870
People don't understand that.
Not only did you learn, you know,

608
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:41,780
I was a tell CK and all
those guys too are beyond me.

609
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:46,400
But I learned watching guys that were, uh,
you know, breaking in at the same time.

610
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,270
Yeah, we starting to, cause I, I
a lot of times you were, you were,

611
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,140
you would get yourself into the same
situation that a more seasoned guide

612
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,210
wouldn't. And I would watch
you get out of it and be like,

613
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,520
oh I never thought to do it that way.

614
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,680
Right.
That's how you scale.

615
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,770
That's how you take it and stop it before
it goes off the cliff. And the whole,

616
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,160
cause I I realized too that a lot of
times I would lose crowds by hitting too

617
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:09,520
hard. Like you know a guy throws
up something that deserves a four.

618
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,230
It's almost like in the right to, I hope
you get aids. Yeah. Right. Two of them.

619
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,840
Yeah. Like what's that? What's
that? Fucking wife's got cancer.

620
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,940
What does totally unnecessary it
was in the crowd hates you for it.

621
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:24,040
So it's like the worst is when
someone's heckling you in the front.

622
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,760
I'll never forget this guy heckling
me are rascals. I was a new comic.

623
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:30,910
But even back then I knew this guy
was being a twat cause he was, he ski,

624
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:34,090
he was heckling me and it wasn't
horrible shifted, he was saying.

625
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,760
But it was his eyes.
Like I knew he's the fucking,

626
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,740
that scumbag in the office who's resentful
that he's not up here getting laughs,

627
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,630
you're gay. Yeah. And the
audience can't see it.

628
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,780
So I was pounded them and I
really ruined his night. And uh,

629
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:49,930
the crowd hated before,
but as I couldn't see what a dick he was,

630
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,720
you know how like, you know, you
just know. Yeah, of course I do.

631
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,280
And you could always tell times, I'll
never, never regret doing it though.

632
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,690
It's like that's 25 years ago.

633
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,590
It's my first year of comedy and I still
feel good that I wrecked that piece of

634
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:04,570
shits tonight cause I didn't know he
was coming out. You know what I saw?

635
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:07,480
I remember I was at the
punchline in Atlanta and I
had a guy like that and all I

636
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:11,860
can remember about what he looked like
was he had loafers with no socks and he

637
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:15,550
had fat feet. So things like the
like bolting out the front end,

638
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:19,830
he kept putting his feet on the stage. So
I made the joke to take them, you know,

639
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,300
to take them off or whatever.
And it's,

640
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,190
you know, cause he really, you know, had,

641
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,030
and he's just was fucking annoying me
and it was just the fact that he kept

642
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,970
putting him back. I knew that
it wasn't, oh, I'm sorry,

643
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,380
I just need to stretch my legs out.

644
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:34,870
There was some sort of power things
go when you breathe it into the mic.

645
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,460
Then it was like a power thing.

646
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,800
There was like this power thing going on
with them and it literally escalated to

647
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:44,920
the point that they had to kick
them out and eat. When he stood up,

648
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:48,070
he made sure he got on the stage and
took like half a step towards me.

649
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,430
And he was just, you know, this
little fucking, I don't know,

650
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:54,160
he probably was doing well in business
and he was used to people telling,

651
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,150
you know, telling other people
what to do and uh, but whatever.

652
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,410
Here we are and now we're sitting
here talking about the process.

653
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,120
I want to make sure that I get to the
whole reason why is a fancy man like

654
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:08,480
yourself out here in a, in Los
Angeles. You got it. You are, you,

655
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,090
you're working on something.
What's going on?

656
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,820
Well my thanks bill.
That was my advice show is uh,

657
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,690
coming on and uh, you know, I
just had to come out and plug it.

658
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,170
It's hard to plug show it,
isn't it? That's great too.
What, tell me about the show.

659
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:24,310
Happy about it to do it.
I talked to, you know,

660
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:26,200
I do a monologue.
I mean I feel ashamed of,

661
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:28,400
I explain things but I don't
know if that would ever,

662
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,800
it makes me a common cause that's
that fucked right. Right. Shame thing.

663
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,800
Collin Collin describing
his shame spiraling.

664
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,610
It's hosting a talk show and it's,
I always wanted to do it.

665
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:40,500
So I a I did four episodes
and you do a monologue sketch,

666
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,460
you're hosting a talk show. Yeah. Yeah.
That's fucking great. Yeah, I'm happy man.

667
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,600
It's uh, my first guests are our,
we're Tyson and Dana white together.

668
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,750
Then it was awesome and it was like a
really good interview and I was like,

669
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:54,600
wow man, that went well. I've never
seen, I mean this isn't a good way.

670
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:59,070
I'd never seen him give a guy like you
don't talk show. They don't. That's great.

671
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,640
Yeah. Cause usually it's usually telling,
you know, if you're doing a talk show,

672
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:06,600
Hey CIM pen a, tone it down a little.
So what, what uh, what channel is it on?

673
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,830
It's on vice.com. You know,
it's a, it's online, which
is kind of where I wanted it.

674
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,970
I now can you curse and stuff? Do I
you want total content freedom? Oh,

675
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:19,320
I had total content freedom.
Um, Bailey, Jay's my cohost. Um,

676
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,500
and she's kind of like my announcement,
you know, Bailey, lovely girl. And uh,

677
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,710
you know, so I think it's, I think it
turned out was Bobby's suggestions.

678
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:29,010
It's like, dude, you got to get
Bailey involved. And I think it's,

679
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,090
I think it's Bailey. J the,
yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

680
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,490
The fuck was I thinking of, I interviewed
a, you know, I interviewed freeway Rick,

681
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:39,900
you know who that the drug dealer,

682
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,770
the extra dealer not direct from.

683
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,350
Oh, that's us. That sounds
like a seventies black guy
nickname. It is. It is.

684
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:52,950
He did 20 years. Yeah, he did. And
he was a big dealer in the 80s.

685
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:56,970
He was like with the Iran Contra
scandal like he was buying,

686
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,940
the guy he was getting his drugs from was,

687
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,620
it was funneling money to
the contras and then uh,

688
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,850
you know Rick went to jail for,

689
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,540
he got life without parole but he's out
now on a technicality cause they was

690
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,610
like a three strikes thing,
whatever.

691
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,220
But they charged them twice option the
rights for this fucking great movie.

692
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,510
I got to own them. No one, he, Michael
K. Williams is playing him in something.

693
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,570
There's a reporter who broke his story
is being played by Jeremy Renner and I

694
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,120
think the reporter committed
suicide cause people laughed at him.

695
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,990
The whole Iran Contra thing and the drug
connection in the CIA putting money in

696
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:30,390
the black neighborhoods. We
had tea, I wait a minute,

697
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:32,790
they laughed at him so he
could reporters back then.

698
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,750
They didn't think he was right.

699
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,490
Like I think we were just
talking about the government,

700
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:39,120
the CIA allowing drugs
into these ghetto now bad.

701
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:43,200
Did they laugh at and he must've been
getting, fuck yeah, I expected a Pulitzer.

702
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,350
And they were like hanging him from
his press undies every day from the

703
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:51,010
typewriter.
Keep picking on me.

704
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,430
God, there's a connection there letting
the drugs could, man, I fucking feel it.

705
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:59,970
Yeah. And then he wound up, uh, blown
his brains up or be improving. Right.

706
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,450
We've let t I was t I was on a week
before I interviewed Rick Ross and we were

707
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:07,670
like, Eh, it sounded kind of power.
Like those are great guests. Tea,

708
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,190
I always opening out to the,
not on a whatever, but he
was talking about the, the,

709
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,730
the drugs wouldn't have like,
everyone's like, ah, I don't know.

710
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,240
It sounded a little bit conspiracy and
then requested the same thing. I'm like,

711
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:19,410
fuck man. See, I was right.

712
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,790
Like I've heard it from too many
different sources that the CIA apologized.

713
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,070
It was really interesting.
So he was a good interview.
And then I did a couple of,

714
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,160
uh, comedians and uh, you know,
hopefully it will do more. Nah, dude,

715
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:36,220
you gotta when's this coming out?
This Wednesday, July 23rd. And

716
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,580
I can't say what time, like I
guess when, when are they going to,

717
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,060
I don't know. I'll just Twitter it.
I'm not sure. They, they, you know,

718
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:45,280
it's like they,
I don't know how this one works.

719
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:49,920
Like I'm used to doing
promotion for stuff. Like I
know exactly what day it's on,

720
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:51,280
I know exactly what time it on.

721
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,470
The first episode is being released
in two parts because it's a, you know,

722
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,660
so it's like a 45 minute interview
plus 20 other minutes of content.

723
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,510
So it's like one day and then the next
day and they can watch the whole thing.

724
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,590
Yeah.

725
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,670
Does that sounds like a great, great
guest. And then, you know, sidekick,

726
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:08,980
nobody has anybody like Bailey J.
That's great.

727
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:11,830
And then usually a guy like you
doesn't get you guys, they usually,

728
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,920
you're usually the guy, the way
they're like, all right. You know,

729
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:18,400
just tone it down, tone it down.
So the see a, a real, I can't say,

730
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:19,390
I don't want to insult anybody,

731
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:24,160
but like somebody might
taste like actually going out
doing a monologue and that

732
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,320
type of stuff that you're going to
pick on. That's fucking awesome, man.

733
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,720
It felt so nice to not have to tone it
down because in one of the episodes I

734
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:33,540
just did a bunch of sterling stuff
which I've been doing on stage.

735
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,590
It's like how long is that going
to be good for you? And um,

736
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,170
I like, it was a fun one. Oh God. I
hope he lives forever. I hope with the,

737
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,030
my angle on it's still cause
my specialist coming out and I,

738
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:48,490
and I was able to turn that into some,
like I'm hoping I,

739
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,220
the point that I'm making,
uh, is still relevant.

740
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Is there anything worse than when
you shoot something and it winds up,

741
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:59,050
something happens in the meantime,

742
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:02,590
which dates the reference or the bats?

743
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,440
Yeah. No, but it happens because this is,

744
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,760
I think sometimes I try not to overthink
that thing where, you know, if you,

745
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,250
even a guy like Richard Pryor,

746
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,810
I talked about the heavyweights
of his time cause you know,

747
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,880
there's some comics are like,
you know,

748
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:19,080
don't do anything w where anything
that's going to make you look fucking,

749
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,490
you know, in three years I'll be like the
cutting edge fashion. Like take you a,

750
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,240
like Sinbad, like some of the stuff that
that guy wore, you know what I mean?

751
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,210
Like some of that sh just in general,
some of the shit from the early nineties,

752
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:34,260
late eighties, early nineties was pretty
out there. Um, so some people try to go,

753
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,600
just wear black on black,
very kind of simple thing.

754
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:40,270
And then don't do anything topical
because it's going to date you're special.

755
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,310
And it's like, who gives a fuck? Who
Cares? Yeah. I don't if it's a great joke,

756
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,610
it's a great joke. Like,
uh, that prior one,

757
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:52,080
I forget he's talking
about the old retired black
fighter who was refereeing in

758
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:52,800
the ref,

759
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,390
one of the fighters with beating the
shit out of a white guy and he didn't,

760
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,680
he was joking that the guy wouldn't stop
it. Oh Shit. He looks okay. Whatever.

761
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:01,170
And that's still funny. Yeah,
it's still fucking funny.

762
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:04,760
So I think if the joke is there, it,
let's see. I'm trying to convince me.

763
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,880
What did fryers say? And it's, it's, it
was a Jerry quarry joke, right about,

764
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,790
it was something that, how he just, he
just loves black people beating them up.

765
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,710
And it made me laugh so hard.
And it was 40 years after he said it.

766
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,470
It doesn't matter.
Woody Allen stuff,

767
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,610
he does references from the early sixties
it's hilarious. Yeah. Climate opens,

768
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:24,370
one of the specialists, you know
the Reagan people, I don't care.

769
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,170
I learned who Jerry quarry
was through Richard Pryor.

770
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,320
I didn't know who James Brown was
until Eddie Murphy did the bit.

771
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,140
I was that white, like the
world I was living in and, and,

772
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,210
and people will be like, how
the fuck did that? How did,

773
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,820
how did you not know who he
was? And it was like, well,

774
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:45,500
my parents were that fucking white. And
then there was three channels, you know?

775
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,360
Right. And there was no internet
and it was like, you know,

776
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,300
I,
I knew who the fucking Jefferson's war.

777
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,210
I mean that was like the only thing that
was on TV, it seemed, but good times.

778
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,480
But as far as stuff like that was
really difficult for a guy like him.

779
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:02,240
Even when he became an icon. You
know, I just saw it recently.

780
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,030
He did like the Mike Douglas show.
We did some shows, but I mean,

781
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:09,110
I was a little kid so I just didn't seem
so, I remember laughing at the eddy.

782
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,490
I told Charlie this story and he was
beside himself. He was almost offended.

783
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:17,090
He goes, get the fuck outta here.
Fuck debt. You knew who he was.

784
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:19,220
Your parents knew who he was like,
I didn't,

785
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,660
I didn't know who arguably the greatest
performer of the last century was.

786
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,160
Um, GRC. James Brown and
Pavarotti. They get us. They did.

787
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,940
It's a man's world together. How awesome.
It was. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

788
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,200
They really liked each other, but that was
a really, I love stuff like that. Yeah.

789
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,410
When they like,
to me that that's a mashup.

790
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,040
Like I don't like when they just take
two songs that have the same tempo when

791
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,710
it's supposed to blow my
fucking mind. It's like, yeah,

792
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:44,590
well if you get two
songs at the same speed,

793
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,880
get dropped some shit out and
you throw some shit in. Right.

794
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,250
Not that I could ever
figure out how to do it. No,

795
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:51,710
I couldn't say there's a genius to it,
but I still resent it the same.

796
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:54,770
I understand the hating it like I respect.
It's hard to do but fuck them.

797
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:58,990
It's that stinks.
All right everybody,

798
00:42:58,991 --> 00:43:02,620
here's the advertising for this week.
I apologize for the bad edit.

799
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,680
I just interviewed Jim on like Friday
or something when he was in town and you

800
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:12,220
know we just did that straight through
without the advertising because I didn't

801
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:14,500
have it yet.
So now I am in my house,

802
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:19,950
it's like seven 30 Monday morning and
my wife is still sleeping so I gotta

803
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,700
I gotta read in this creepy voice so
you're gonna have to fucking deal with it.

804
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,320
All right?
You just fucking deal with it.

805
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,590
This is going to be my
voice dollar shave club.

806
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:32,110
Everybody at the big razor
companies think we're stupid.

807
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,760
Every year they roll out some ridiculous
shaving technology gimmick and expect

808
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,310
us to flip out and shell
out big bucks for it.

809
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,810
Do you really need a razor with a
vibrating handle or a roller pivot ball,

810
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:48,310
back scratch or egg timer, laser pointer
corkscrew. You get the point, okay.

811
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,620
You don't need it.
All right.

812
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,720
We were all just shave and fine before
any of that crap and I personally

813
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:59,380
definitely don't need to spend
my hat earned cash on it. Um,

00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:15,960
it's too expensive or it's too
time consuming, but the level blah.

backyard and given it to somebody else

863
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:03,960
down the street? Some bankers kid. All
right. I know that was a weird example,

Did you ever try an instrument
when growing up? No, I didn't.

871
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,100
I'm not musical at all. I used to draw.
I want it to be an artist. I would draw,

872
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:37,450
like I was obsessed with kiss
or draw pictures of kiss.
I could never draw hands.

873
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,090
That's always their thing.
My hands were terrible.

874
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,930
So every couch is do the
three finger thing. No, I put
the hands behind the back.

875
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,290
I really would. Everyone had hands behind
the back. I couldn't, I could not grasp.

876
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,710
That's uh, that's what makes an
artist, if you can draw hands,

877
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,010
you could probably draw
anything in the world,

878
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,580
hands in and tried to ruin someone's hand.
It's fucking hard.

879
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,380
I think the face as hard. Yeah.
It can be, but I can, I can,

880
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,780
I could work out at face. I could do,
I would go, it would be a little off.

881
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,410
You know what I mean? Like it was, it
was like rocky Dennis issue sometimes,

882
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,940
but at least it was a face
bell palsy. Yeah. Yeah.

883
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,190
No, it's all right. I always, when
I, when I tried drawing, I just,

884
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,250
I just remember was everybody
was always jacked. Whoever.

885
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:17,670
I like the one body type I could draw
would be like fucking jacked and everybody

886
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:21,050
had the same God damn
nose. But uh, I dunno, I,

887
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,160
there's actually a show out here then
I'm doing coming up where there's a live

888
00:48:26,341 --> 00:48:29,850
band and it's, you know,
I want to do this show.

889
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:33,000
It's fucking cool where it's like you
go out and you'd just sort of riff about

890
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:36,960
music and that type of thing.
And then when, uh, when,

891
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,460
when you're done with the set,

892
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,400
you then go and jam with the
band however you want to do it.

893
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:45,690
You can sing a song and they'll learn the
song beforehand or whatever instrument

894
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:48,860
you play that your idea or someone
is, no, no, no. This is, uh,

895
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,200
somebody else's idea out.

896
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,590
I hope I didn't say that and everybody's
going to steal the idea of what it's

897
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:56,160
fucking and I'm going to
be doing it coming up, man.

898
00:48:56,161 --> 00:48:58,500
It's going to be fun as shit though.
Well, you have balls to do that.

899
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:03,490
That I would scare me. Uh, yeah, but
what I've learned is, I don't mean, yeah,

900
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:05,610
like I got balls.
What I've learned is that they,

901
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,500
that comes a point when you get
something down, anywhere in life,

902
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,010
you got a gig down.
If you don't keep learning,

903
00:49:14,011 --> 00:49:17,790
you don't keep pushing yourself to try to
be like, all right, whatever I'm doing,

904
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:21,010
how do I get better at this? I always
equate it to like, I dunno basketball,

905
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
some resentment, I don't fucking
play it. But like, you know,

906
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,440
he always goes to his right. Then
you've got to learn to go to your left.

907
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,530
He sucks on defense. I've got to get
better at defense. It's that whole thing.

908
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:31,740
Like I read this whole, they had
this great magazine out about Jordan,

909
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:34,600
how we just kept working and working
and working and working and working and

910
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,783
like,

911
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:41,070
you can literally read the
article and not be a Jordan,

912
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:45,030
but just apply that in work
and work and work and work.

913
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,610
And so for me,
um,

914
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,130
I'm really comfortable being a standup,

915
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:55,440
but I'm not comfortable playing drums
necessarily out in public or whatever.

916
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:57,870
So over the years when every
time I get a chance to sit in,

917
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:01,380
I would sit in and just go through,
you know,

918
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,530
it's just like you go back to being an
open mic or I think there's like an ego

919
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:05,700
thing that's involved at once.

920
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:08,550
You're good at something and
people know you're good, you're,

921
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:12,540
you're embarrassed to kind of
stink at something a little
bit. So you're like, oh,

922
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:15,840
I don't want to do that. It takes
like, I dunno, it's, it's a,

923
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,980
it's a balance of the balls to try it
and then also still be fucking around.

924
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:22,770
It'd be like, listen guys, I know I'm not
a professional drummer or whatever, so

925
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,630
we can handle the bombing on something
like that because it's comma,

926
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,680
you kind of learner.
I like,

927
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:29,720
I know how to be funny if I'm sucking
at something or I know how to own it,

928
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,230
right? Like if you own
something so completely, people
kind of like, all right,

929
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:34,550
well what are you going to write?
You know,

930
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:38,390
he's owning that he's not a good
drummer or a singer, so we can't go out,

931
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,360
go out there and you're just,

932
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,880
you're acting like a fucking idiot
and you're having a good time.

933
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,370
Then they don't have to worry.
Like,

934
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,360
like I just don't want the crowd to
at any moment to have that thing like,

935
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,080
oh wait, is he likes series here? Does
he like feel like he should be in a band?

936
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,370
I don't. Okay. For any anybody concerned?

937
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:58,700
I do not.

938
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,850
You're good actor though, man. You're
a really good actor. I finally,

939
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,000
I finally went through break in bed and
we'd interviewed everyone on that show

940
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:09,230
and I had never seen it. We had Cranston,
we had fucking, the guy played Hank,

941
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:13,860
we had the Schuyler, everyone. And then
I finally watched it and you are so good.

942
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,370
It you didn't take me out of it.
Like, you know, I know you so well.

943
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:20,570
And whenever you see like a close friend
in something and man, I was like, fuck,

944
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:24,050
that's bill. And then right
into the character. It was
really fucking good though.

945
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,750
I didn't think I'd seen you since.
I finally watched breaking bad.

946
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,200
I am learning to take compliments,

947
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:32,800
but I will say that show
the way it was done,

948
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:37,630
all you had to do is memorize what they
say and hit your marks and they handled

949
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:40,720
the rest of it. They just, it was uh,

950
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,780
I don't know how to equate it.

951
00:51:42,781 --> 00:51:46,060
Pick a great fucking sports team
and you're coming off the bench.

952
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:50,300
It's like somehow you can end up wearing a
ring, you know? Right, right, right. Yeah.

953
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:52,750
I mean one of those guys,
that awful white guy dancing,

954
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:55,030
but Shaq used to make fun of
whenever the Lakers would win it.

955
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:59,560
Like that's who I was, who I was
on break at bat. But it was uh,

956
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,860
it was fun. And um, you know,

957
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,210
what's the most nervous doing?
Will you,

958
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,450
cause I remember the first time
I saw you with Cranston, uh, you,

959
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:09,680
I think when you in a car,

960
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:14,420
no, the first time I, I had a scene
with him, I was so excited cause a dude,

961
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:18,620
I was a fan of that show from the very
beginning, from the pilot episode.

962
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,880
So I was so invested in the show and,

963
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:28,820
and couldn't wait for the next season,
so to all of a sudden be on it,

964
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,240
interacting with these fucking characters.
It was,

965
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:37,330
it was like you got sucked in TV
and then fast forward into time.

966
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,110
Right. So there was this, it was,

967
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,700
I always said I felt like I won a radio
contest or something like, you know,

968
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:48,040
do you want to play a storm through over
the next star wars and stand next to

969
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,591
Darth Vader?

970
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:51,950
I always felt that when I was there and
I would have been happy just getting one

971
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:55,790
of them. And the fact that
they kept bringing me back.
And the fact that, you know,

972
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,230
uh, Vince Gilligan use so many standup
comics to get back to your thing, when,

973
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:05,210
when, uh, the question did, the first
scene I did with Cranston was, uh,

974
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,580
was after, I'm trying not to ruin it
for anybody because everybody, you know,

975
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,620
all when I've seen it. Right,
right. You know, spoiler
alert, when does that run out?

976
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:14,570
You know? But, um,

977
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,050
we'd shaken down this guy
for money and he got hurt.

978
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,210
So we had to go talk to the lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

979
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:23,570
So it was me and Lavelle Crawford,
but that was, he played huge.

980
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,690
I didn't realize that was a
come out for like knew it was

981
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,150
unreal. Yes, she was good. I didn't
realize what you're committing to it.

982
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,470
Right. So we had this little bit
that we were doing at the top,

983
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:34,580
this whole act of God thing and then
Bryan Cranston character bursts in.

984
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,540
So our thing was we jump up and Sorta
make sure that he's not coming for Saul

985
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,250
and Saul tells us to screw.

986
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:45,580
And I was so excited that I was actually
going to be in a scene with Mr Wiker is

987
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:51,230
Mr. White. To me it took everybody,
I don't know how long, like three,

988
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:56,180
four season for the entire country, but
for die hards like myself, like he was,

989
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,910
you know,
I,

990
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,980
I've never had a guy like a character
that it followed that I was rooting for so

991
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:07,040
hard and then all of a sudden
he took this fucking turn,

992
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,690
he took this turn where I'm, I, I kind
of felt weird about rooting for him.

993
00:54:11,691 --> 00:54:15,200
And then I was just started watching
going like, dude, what are you doing?

994
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,560
Just turn yourself in, just
stop, blah blah. And it was,

995
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:22,480
it was like literally watching,
literally watching like someone you loved,

996
00:54:22,481 --> 00:54:25,190
like you knew like a family
member rooting him on and being,

997
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:29,210
making excuses for him and what's
he supposed to Dota guy. He's sick.

998
00:54:29,211 --> 00:54:32,750
He had given him any fuck he put his
time in, you know, that type of shit.

999
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,170
And then some somewhat, you
know, it, you know, I dunno,

1000
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,050
after how many fucking murderers,
it just,

1001
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:42,260
some of the shit that he started
doing the Jesse that it started to,

1002
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:47,180
it started to turn and it was, it just was
unreal to be, you know, I've lucked out.

1003
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,390
I really lucked out where I've gotten
to be a part, very small part of some,

1004
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:56,060
some pretty amazing things. Cause my
IMDP pages is a pretty quick read. But,

1005
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:59,690
um, I got to tell you, I like, I've
always liked the shit you've done.

1006
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:02,390
Let's the stuff you did in Spiderman.
I wish,

1007
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,600
I wish I could've seen that whole
fucking rent you did. Even though I just,

1008
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,400
you know, I don't like him
and he stinks, but you,

1009
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,760
you were really in it and they
had you in the back of that truck.

1010
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:15,200
You just look like this New York guy who
was dropping off something and you will

1011
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:17,690
fucking pissed. I know you're going to
shit on your acting, but I loved it.

1012
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,350
No, no, no, no.

1013
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,230
But I'm going to point out this is why
bill's a good friend and this is why I

1014
00:55:21,231 --> 00:55:24,820
love bill because honestly you,
you had a part in what is tremendous.

1015
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,630
Like it's one of the
culturally biggest events.

1016
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,780
How bad would Keith be trashing us
right now for helping each and Nice for

1017
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,520
friends? Keep it keeps problem
is he doesn't know how to
be nice about anything.

1018
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,710
Oh, mommy paid by Keith and he
came in with that fucking pee.

1019
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:45,050
He came in with a Dave Chappelle
shirt the other night from, oh no,

1020
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,140
he's wearing Chappelle at Radio City
and me and Collin at the table and we're

1021
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:53,270
like, oh, you fucking fat fan
boy. And we just impact him.

1022
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,200
And he sat down for five minutes and
he goes, I'm going to change the shirt.

1023
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:01,010
And he got up and he left the comedy
cellar and he came back with a button down

1024
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:02,240
shirt over it.

1025
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:05,120
And that's the second time in my
life I've been able to chase him out.

1026
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,660
I remember one time he ran out with
this show was there that night.

1027
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:13,360
I forget what he ran out, that puffy,
white, awful ugly. It looked like, uh,

1028
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,240
a bedding shirt that he had
on and I beat him so terrible.

1029
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:21,050
He went and he hung in there for
like two rounds, three rounds,

1030
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:22,940
and then it was just,
and then he stood up and ran out.

1031
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,310
And I remember being pissed

1032
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,490
being like, you can fucking do that.
I didn't know you could leave here.

1033
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:31,390
I never thought to leave like that
pounding. I took the bus pounding,

1034
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,480
which is one of the all time clubs.
You guys literally did a headlining set.

1035
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:39,481
You did 45 minutes on me
when I was going to do that.

1036
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,440
Was it? That was it. We were
both going to do it. No, no.

1037
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,400
St Ste. Whatever the fuck it was. Estee,

1038
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:49,900
somebody approached the comedy cellar,

1039
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:54,830
these Atlanta brave fans and
they said it was, I'm actually,

1040
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:57,790
no, no, it was the Braves.
And they said, you know,

1041
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:01,390
they were taking a bus from Manhattan
up to Yankee Stadium and they wanted to

1042
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:03,220
hire a comic for the bus ride up.

1043
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,460
And at the end of it they were going
to give you a world series ticket.

1044
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:10,330
So we sat there going, Oh man,
that's going to be brutal.
I don't know, blah, blah,

1045
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:13,750
blah, all of that type of shit. And um,

1046
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:19,690
I forget what happened at the law without
me knowing you said, you know what,

1047
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:23,110
I'm not fucking doing that. That's
bullshit. Right. And I didn't know it.

1048
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:24,340
So I agreed to do it.

1049
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,990
And then we sat down and we started
trashing each other. And this is,

1050
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:32,830
this is what you started it. I
fucking go, I said this to you.

1051
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:34,720
I made funniest shirt, but blah, blah.

1052
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,940
And I was getting you and
everyone was laughing.

1053
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,790
And you know that thing at the table,
you're like, oh my God, I'm winning.

1054
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:43,800
I'm winning. I'm finally winning here.
And then as they're all laughing,

1055
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:48,810
you just lean in and you go whatever bus
boy and the whole table's stopped and

1056
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:50,140
went what?

1057
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:55,240
And you said bill burrs going to do
stand up on a bus on the way the and all

1058
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:57,550
fucking chairs turned at me.

1059
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,410
That's the fun and doing it all the
killers were there, you Patrice Voss,

1060
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,200
Kevin Hart.
Kevin Hart was there,

1061
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:08,440
Keith was there 45 minutes.

1062
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,640
I didn't say a word and
just got pounded and then,

1063
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,390
and I was still going to do the Gig
because to me that was an easy gig.

1064
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,640
All I had to do was shit on
the Yankees the whole way.

1065
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,730
Make Fun of fucking New York
and say that Atlanta was better.

1066
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,890
Say That I was a red sox fan.

1067
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,770
I would have been fucking
shotgun and beers with them.
It would have been a joke,

1068
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,190
but I ended up not doing the Gig,
which a lot of people don't know.

1069
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,720
I didn't do the Gig because Patrice
and the end of it through you guys were

1070
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:35,710
trashing me so bad,

1071
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,000
like strangers were either
laughing or they were going,

1072
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,560
ah. I'm trying to think
of some of the grounds.

1073
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,170
The trees imitating me.
Oh, Patrice goes, hey,

1074
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:49,120
when they call you out on stage,
he goes,

1075
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:51,130
are you going to come out of the
bathroom where you're gonna walk up?

1076
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:54,100
Those little steps.
I remember all of them.

1077
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,410
He had another one where he was,

1078
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,920
he was imitating me at the end of
this show and this is a visual.

1079
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,670
It's a lot of the explaining. I finish,
I'm in the front, front of the bus. I go,

1080
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:08,260
hey, you guys are great, and then he
imitates me turning around, sitting down,

1081
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,800
and then as people are walking by reaching
over my show. Good show. Good Chunk.

1082
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:14,650
Well Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot. Written my shoulder.

1083
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,320
They asked you guys if
I was going to use the,

1084
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,850
the the bus drivers microphone to do
the show. I going to bring my own dude.

1085
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:26,660
Every joke was just funnier than the
next one and it was never ending.

1086
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,380
I took this fucking brutal Pawnee, but
I was still going to do it. I was like,

1087
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:33,260
fuck these guys. I'm a sports fan. I want
to go to the game. I don't give a fuck.

1088
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:38,300
So in the end you guys had all left and
it was just me and Patrice sitting there

1089
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,810
and he just goes,
Bill Egos,

1090
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,320
you're making enough money
at this point if you want,

1091
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,560
if you want to go to the game by a
fucking ticket. All right. He goes,

1092
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,350
dude, I will you call me the n
word he said and what? He goes,

1093
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:58,610
I will stand in front of that bus
still.

1094
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:01,310
You don't do that Gig,
do not do that fucking Gig.

1095
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:04,850
And it was the first time I ever thought
of like, you know like self esteem. Yeah.

1096
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,530
Like why not just blow the cash and
actually have a little dignity because you

1097
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:12,890
just come into this business doing like
those Jersey turnpike gigs and all that

1098
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:15,470
shit that you don't, you just feel
like I need to learn how to do this.

1099
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,830
So I didn't do the Gig and I actually
passed the Gig off to somebody else and I

1100
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:26,000
too had taken such a bad pounding. I
said, listen, I'll never tell anybody.

1101
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,090
I'll never tell anybody
who I gave this gig too.

1102
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:32,210
And I think the person who did it
didn't they come in and say who it was?

1103
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:37,530
I believe they tell you when we're done
cause I mean it doesn't matter. No, no,

1104
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,930
it's fine. It doesn't matter now. But
I, I, I don't think he would care. No,

1105
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,560
I passed it on. Not at all. No, don't
feel bad. That's it. That's it. Many,

1106
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:47,070
many years ago and he'd probably
be love to be associated.

1107
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:50,140
I asked him what it was like any, he told
me later I go, what was it like? He goes,

1108
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,240
dude, he goes, it was brutal.
It was brutal. It goes.

1109
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:54,790
But the second was over and I had
that world series ticket dude.

1110
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,780
He ran away from those people and
it's hilarious. It was their ticket.

1111
01:00:57,781 --> 01:01:00,460
So then you just sort of sat next to them.
So he kind of couldn't leave him.

1112
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,040
But uh, yeah, I'll never
forget that. That was,

1113
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:06,670
that was another turning point that I
learned from someone who I started with

1114
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:08,380
was to have self esteem.

1115
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:14,340
Like at some point you can say no
like I'm not, you know what, I'm,

1116
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,230
I'm making enough money here in the city.
It wasn't, I was making great money,

1117
01:01:17,231 --> 01:01:20,720
but hey, I was making enough money
then if I wanted to blow, I mean,

1118
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,340
how much was the world series ticket
for 500 bucks back then we had to sit in

1119
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:28,150
the upper deck to not stand on a bus.
You fucking moron

1120
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,750
it yourself. So youth those gigs
teach you to like, like the,

1121
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:37,550
the seller is getting pounded so terribly.

1122
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:42,551
Like I get beaten so badly sometimes you
don't Bobby or Keith and Collin and you

1123
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:44,760
know when they're all attacking you,
there's times where I'm,

1124
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:48,800
I'm a comedian for over 20 years and I
find myself still answering seriously.

1125
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,890
Like when they're killing me, I'm like,
well no, that's not exactly what happened.

1126
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:55,370
Like I'm getting beaten up so bad. They
know all the helpless. I'm fucking,

1127
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:58,380
I'm turning into like my girlfriend
when I'm annoyed. Like I,

1128
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,540
that's not accurate at all.

1129
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:04,230
It's so it's cleansing though to
get a beating like that. It's, it's,

1130
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,680
do you know one of my favorite
ones watching you taking
a beating was that time

1131
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:09,440
when you were on a date in,

1132
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:12,270
Patrice was yelling over at you and
you weren't talking back to him.

1133
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:17,580
And he started and you just started
opening for dice and you were thrilled,

1134
01:02:17,581 --> 01:02:22,110
your hero and you guys were out in poetry,
started imitating Deiss,

1135
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:25,500
talking to you in the character during
the day and you was sitting in the corner

1136
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:28,590
trying to ignore him. And Patrice was
all the way across the restaurant.

1137
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:32,610
And he's going, hey Jim,
let's go to the mall.

1138
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,870
Oh,

1139
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:39,240
and we will all fucking crying,
laughing.

1140
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,180
And you finally had the given to a man.

1141
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:45,300
Like those are the things what
I loved about it. And like,

1142
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,190
I love watching your date,

1143
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,910
kind of keep hearing the name Jim and
hearing us laughing and silly figuring out

1144
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:54,600
like, is he talking about you and you're
trying to stay in the date for the

1145
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:58,890
excruciating five minutes, Dude.
Fuck. I miss that guy, man.

1146
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,320
I remember one time I was, uh, I would,

1147
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,420
I would always come in off
the road and not sleep.

1148
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,930
I would be dealt with usually dice on
Saturday nights or Sunday morning and fly

1149
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:07,764
home with no sleep.

1150
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,910
And I wasn't doing radio and at that
time was just Sunday nights and be loopy

1151
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:14,010
and go on to the seller on no sleep.

1152
01:03:14,011 --> 01:03:18,170
And I always had good sets cause that'd
be creative and it'd be overtired and in

1153
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,350
we played chess every night there.

1154
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:21,890
I would play with Keith
[inaudible] you were good too, man.

1155
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,530
I started little circle. Yeah. But I
mean compare it to a real chess player.

1156
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:28,450
I'm a fucking on the chimp, but I mean,
you know, in our little the knee you Bob.

1157
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,380
Yeah. You were like reading the Bobby
Fisher book. You were into it dude. Yeah.

1158
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:35,850
Yeah. I do enjoy him. Um, and I'm quite a
character I was getting, I remember I was,

1159
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,220
because Keith was such a shit talker.
Like he's like a,

1160
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,080
he's like one of those
fucking bums in the park.

1161
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,800
They're like master level players because
they're all homeless and they play for

1162
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:47,100
drinks, they've found for food.
So they're real players. But Kiki,

1163
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,500
like you'd move your queen and do
that stupid thing with his fingers.

1164
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:52,410
Like he was sprinkling salt,
sprinkle and salty up. Wow.

1165
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,790
Let's see what color panties she get up.

1166
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,020
And I would like literally non-Canadian
guy quit touching my fucking police man.

1167
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,100
And uh, you to, you got to reexplain
that to the listeners, Keith. Well,

1168
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:05,250
Keith Robinson would do when he
knew he was closing on your queen,

1169
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,500
he would reach over and
pick it up and be like, Hey,

1170
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:10,910
what color panties is she wearing?
And set it down like he was just touching,

1171
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,820
talking trash. Oh yeah.
It was annoying as shit.

1172
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,080
I remember one time Patrice pulled
my chair out after I had lost.

1173
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:20,200
I had lost and are so fucking
over tired and cranky and uh,

1174
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,980
he wanted to play Keith,
so he had winters and I lost it.

1175
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:25,120
He was just such a
dismissive pull my chair out.

1176
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,520
And those may with you still sitting
in it. I locked. Of course I was.

1177
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,850
And he dragged me out and I was so mad.
I went, don't touch my chair. I'm like,

1178
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:37,440
I'm fucking grown man. And that's my
comeback. Don't touch my chair like, oh,

1179
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,630
and how long did you get pounded for that?

1180
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:43,830
I was just an awful night and that was a
bad light. I was overtired. I socked him.

1181
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,160
Yeah, that was, you know, it
was the worst was the carryover.

1182
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:50,750
The carry over trashing where there was
so much less meat leftover on the bone.

1183
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,400
You'd come back the next night and day a
fucking chair guys, you sit down, dude,

1184
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,750
don't touch his cherry. Like, oh.

1185
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,940
Sometimes I think about those
days and I was just like, it's,

1186
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:03,140
it's fucking hilarious and
it's a goddamn tragedy.

1187
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,800
We never sat down and wrote anything.
All we,

1188
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:10,860
we took all of our comedic skills and
just use them to humiliate each other.

1189
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:14,540
Yeah, we just sat there, but it all
worked out. It doesn't, it, it does.

1190
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:18,220
So those moments I think
made every one of us

1191
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:21,130
a better comic,
a thicker skin comic,

1192
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:26,200
because then you're on stage in front
of 10,000 people and getting an unfair

1193
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:29,800
booing. That was when we first started
on k rock. Right. And you had been,

1194
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:32,320
not the XM listeners loved you,
but they,

1195
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:34,750
the k rock was just didn't
know you as well at that point.

1196
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:39,010
Cause it was a new thing and you had
been away and they're booing you and you

1197
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:40,330
pull out this fucking,

1198
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,530
one of the great moments of
standup that I've ever witnessed,

1199
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:49,480
which was just turning 10,000
Philadelphia fucking monsters.

1200
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,310
And they're the worst crowds in the world.

1201
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:54,620
If they don't like you and you turned
him, you did the impossible. That's a,

1202
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,000
that that's like,
I lucked out.

1203
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:00,980
The sports thing, that was enough. Jersey
and New York sports fans, you know,

1204
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:05,270
the Patrick Division and, and uh, one
of the ML, the national league east,

1205
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:09,650
whatever it does, enough mets fans and
hated the Phillies is enough fucking fans.

1206
01:06:09,651 --> 01:06:12,510
Everybody hates to fucking fliers,
you know, except for Philly Fan.

1207
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:15,500
So I was able to do that.
But what was funny was I actually,

1208
01:06:15,501 --> 01:06:17,870
when I finished that set,

1209
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,740
I felt bad cause you had to go
on next and I was like, Oh God,

1210
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:24,560
you don't want a comic burns down
the room. And that was basically,

1211
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,860
that was not a, like you can burn down
the room, I feel as the headliner,

1212
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,020
but to burn down the room with his,

1213
01:06:30,021 --> 01:06:33,530
another guy going up on basically a
showcase night. I was sitting there,

1214
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,860
I thought you were going to be mad
at me and it, and you went out,

1215
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,310
never addressed what just happened,

1216
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,430
went right into your act
and fucking smashed him.

1217
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,610
Yeah. I mean again, they knew me
though. He's like the, the, the, the,

1218
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,490
the terrestrial crowd knew me so I had to,
you know, it was kind of like, you know,

1219
01:06:49,491 --> 01:06:52,490
they were expecting me to come
out, but, uh, I felt the, you know,

1220
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,730
that if that show it occurred
six months after that, right.

1221
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:58,580
When that crowd new year, that never
would've happened. That was just,

1222
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:02,540
that was a really weird transition time.
But what you did with that crowd, Emmy,

1223
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,750
yeah, it was the sports
knowledge, but it was about,

1224
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,180
uh, the ability to pull that out
in front of all those people.

1225
01:07:11,181 --> 01:07:12,980
Cause it took a while. They
didn't just start. Yeah.

1226
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:17,130
You know what, I, I had been booed
before a cup. I've got booed, uh,

1227
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,150
on a Vegas show. I,
and, and I didn't leave,

1228
01:07:21,151 --> 01:07:24,720
but I didn't know the first time you get
booed dude is fucking unreal. It's like,

1229
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,830
it's the weirdest experience because you
have exactly what you want, the total,

1230
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,730
the total focus of the crowd, but
the exact opposite emotion, right.

1231
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:34,290
I've always compared it to like,
you know,

1232
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:37,470
when they do the reverse echoes on those
Zeppelin things to make it seem like

1233
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:40,180
you're in health. Like the echo
comes first before you've voiced,

1234
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:45,090
it's like sort of the standup version
of that where it's like they're cheering

1235
01:07:45,091 --> 01:07:47,520
but they're blowing. It's the
most fucked up thing. And,

1236
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,990
and I remember after getting booed,
um,

1237
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,670
just fucking walking through the hotel,

1238
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:58,080
going back to my room and
I started thinking about
people in the crowd and it's

1239
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:01,010
like, all right, Bill, you got boo,
but you let, that guy blew you.

1240
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,530
You let that woman with that awful dress,
that guy with the big head,

1241
01:08:04,531 --> 01:08:07,560
you could at least said that. It was just
so shocking the first time it happened.

1242
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:11,150
And also I, uh, you know,
I did a lot of those, uh,

1243
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,710
the uptown rooms as they call them,
the black, the black crowd. Yeah.

1244
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:17,450
So you kinda had to get, you
know, I was in fighting shape,

1245
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,560
so it's somehow,
I just remember opie coming through the,

1246
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,470
the curtain LP and aunt,

1247
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:27,580
I think he had his glass of red wine and
Opie just came walking through when it

1248
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:30,170
was just like he said, he goes,
I was one for the ages, Bro.

1249
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,430
And just came walking out.

1250
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,450
And what was funny was you went out and
killed and the second that was done,

1251
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,910
that was the end of the show.

1252
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:42,440
And then they brought me back out for
the curtain call and I got booed again.

1253
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:44,300
Saf Clapping,
half booing.

1254
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,130
And I remember there was this dude
who ran up to the stage, he was going,

1255
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:54,050
he's screaming, he's going, fuck you.
Fuck you. And I'm going, what? And he's,

1256
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:58,910
he's giving me the finger.
He's going, fuck you. Fuck
you. And I kept going, what?

1257
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,630
It's like you giving me the finger.
How do I not know? I just kept going.

1258
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:07,070
I can't do, I literally got them
hopping mad. He was jumping up and down,

1259
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:09,680
screaming, giving me the finger.
I just kept going. I can't,

1260
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,540
I kept doing cupping my ear like I
can't hear you. Right. Fuck. You know.

1261
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:19,340
And it just, I just laughed at him and uh,
that was still, that was the end of it.

1262
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:20,174
And uh,

1263
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:25,630
I remember I rode back
with Bobby Kelly and um,

1264
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,090
I had a fucking splitting
headache after it and, uh,

1265
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,420
I just remember riding
back with Bobby and,

1266
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,870
and he was just laughing going,
dude,

1267
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:39,710
do you realize you just told Tanka
hasn't people that go fuck themselves.

1268
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,570
And I was dreading it because I was like,
fuck,

1269
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:45,650
I know somebody filmed that cause I
thought when it got on the Internet,

1270
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,410
I knew comics would appreciate it,
but I didn't know that.

1271
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,050
I didn't know fans would get it if they,
if they would just be like,

1272
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,660
oh you got booed, you sucked,
you know, fuck this guy. Hi.

1273
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:57,290
Hi everybody laughing at and shit.
Cause you know, can kind of go,

1274
01:09:57,291 --> 01:10:00,500
can kind of go either way,
but whatever I we have for you here.

1275
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,840
No, no, no, no, no.
That, that to me was uh,

1276
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,980
that was a fascinating thing to watch
because it was legitimately funny stuff.

1277
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,320
It wasn't like you were
obnoxious and got the crowd.

1278
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,740
Like you were really
pounding them like a comic.

1279
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:15,380
Like that's what was so fun about if
you had just taking your pants off and

1280
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:19,080
waved your cock at them and I got
right. Any idiot can do well, you know,

1281
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,710
fucking hilarious though. But that
would have been much better obviously.

1282
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,270
But I mean that was,
that was,

1283
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,940
that would have been like it's the legend
but the fact that you got them, I saw

1284
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,410
a guy do that.
Did you?

1285
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,480
I'm not going to say cause I
don't want to get them in trouble,

1286
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:35,710
but I saw when I was doing
late nights at the cellar,

1287
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,810
do you remember how they
used to have that water pipe?

1288
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,920
They used to hang and this guy used
to go up, he's a fucking mad man.

1289
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:46,270
And he used to fucking hang from that
pipe by one arm and he had this crazy look

1290
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,040
on his face.
He looked like Charles Manson,

1291
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:49,960
I'm trying to let you know
who this guy was, right?

1292
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:54,670
So he went on stage and he's
doing his fucking thing.

1293
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,550
And like really just one of
these great comics where like,

1294
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:01,410
just the pain of whatever he went
through is right there on the surface of

1295
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:04,480
anybody moves. He, he's
going to cut the head off.

1296
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:07,940
So there was some woman who was all
fucking dressed up or something,

1297
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:08,541
sit in and you know,

1298
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:12,040
she's the kind of 50s and she's not
laughing and he just keeps looking at her

1299
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:17,010
and he just finally just starts like,
isn't that right, mom? Huh Mom, Mommy.

1300
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:17,800
And he got in her face,

1301
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,350
they find just goes mom and screamed in
her face and she got like mad and she

1302
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:26,220
goes, uh, she started giving him
shit and he said, like, lady, if you,

1303
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,680
he got to the point, it's like,
lady, if you don't shut up,

1304
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,190
I'm going to take my dick out and slap
you in the face with it. And she goes,

1305
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:35,550
you don't have the balls. And he
goes, oh, I don't have the balls.

1306
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:38,070
And he starts unzipping his pants.

1307
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,600
The crowd is going fucking nuts because
they think he's joking and he fucking

1308
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:45,390
pulled his dick out,
pull his dick out,

1309
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:52,130
and he had it by the shaft and it just
as fucking purple head is coming up and

1310
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:56,280
he made these machine gun noises. I'm
like, take it right in her face, dude.

1311
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:00,330
Fucking place went ballistic.

1312
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,190
Fucking ballistic. And he ended
his set there. I hope so. Yeah.

1313
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:09,840
And Wanda, who is hosting at the
time up and coming, Wanda Sykes,

1314
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,900
I think she was the host fucking
outro to them and then brought me up.

1315
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,990
Was it wonder, wonder hosted one of
the fucked up ones? I can't remember,

1316
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:23,550
so brings me up and I had to go on after
him and I was still new to New York and

1317
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:27,180
I was, I was already going to bomb and he
took his dick out and shook it and this

1318
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,320
fucking woman's face and dude,

1319
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:32,190
I can't even tell you how hard
I ate it and I was too green.

1320
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:37,680
I didn't know to be like, just
riff about the guy. Yeah, that was,

1321
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,400
I went up and tried to do my act. I went
up and I immediately went up in like,

1322
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,480
gee, it's been raining a lot here in New
York City. It just completely flat lines.

1323
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,310
It's like walking into a party and not
acknowledging what's happening. Yeah,

1324
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:54,680
that was awful. I think I know who you
mean, man. Yeah, yeah. There you go.

1325
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,200
Well, listen, we're a, we're a
little over an hour and do it.

1326
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,440
I can't tell you how excited I am.
Thank you,

1327
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,710
bill to to see it and once again promoted.
It's going to be this Wednesday,

1328
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:09,360
July 23rd is the premiere episode with
Dana White and Mike Tyson are my guests

1329
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:12,690
and a, I think people will like it.
I'm actually really happy with it,

1330
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:13,524
which is rare.

1331
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:18,740
I'm as excited to see the monologue as I
am just to see a guy like you because I

1332
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:20,730
always wondered, I always
wondered like, you know, you have,

1333
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,200
it'd be like doing a bit
and you just think, man,

1334
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:25,050
that'd be a great monologue joke because
it's topical. Like say your at your,

1335
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,600
your clippers guy stuff, you
know, which I haven't seen,

1336
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:30,260
which I know is going to be
fucking great. But like, uh, I,

1337
01:13:30,261 --> 01:13:34,590
I can't imagine like seeing that kind
of thing rather than just being like the

1338
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:36,540
safe, right. Sort of a,

1339
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:39,370
it looks like there's going to be
two empty seats court side, no,

1340
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:42,440
the night and the clippers. Right. I
mean some of them, some of them on.

1341
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:46,560
I was just like, are you even fucking try?
And, um, anyways, that's the special uh,

1342
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,880
podcasts here with Jim Norton.
Dude,

1343
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,460
I'm glad I finally was able to
get you on this. I appreciate it.

1344
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,810
I'll see you up in Montreal
and when trying to drag my
a hungover ass out of bed

1345
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:59,940
and come down and do the uh, the
now opion Jimmy show. Yes. So yeah,

1346
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:02,850
I'm doing the keynote speech too,
so it should be a real gentleman's affair.

1347
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:03,451
Oh you are?

1348
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:07,920
I know you're getting the award this
year for a colleague of the year for

1349
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:11,980
hanging in there long enough to get 100.
Man. You've had a great year and it's a

1350
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,190
dessert thing. If I see conduct, I
don't like getting shit like that.

1351
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:16,300
I'm not just saying that
because you're my friend.

1352
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:18,760
You're a great comic and when
you see a guy you admire,

1353
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,340
you know it's like [inaudible].
The thing is people like,

1354
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:22,390
I don't suck each other's Dicks,

1355
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,810
but it's like I don't get to tell my
friends like, you know what I mean?

1356
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:27,130
Like hey man,
I love what you said.

1357
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:29,500
You don't get to tell your friends that
would just, we'd use to each other.

1358
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,140
You know what I'm saying?

1359
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,510
I just like doing festivals because
I finally get to see you guys.

1360
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:36,530
Cause once we all start, we all moved
up the same time, you know, hosting,

1361
01:14:36,531 --> 01:14:39,750
featuring and headlining. So you never
get to work on the road with the tablet.

1362
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,030
But when we will all do in spots in the
city, you could kind of watch those.

1363
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,690
Another thing man,
when we used to go downstairs,

1364
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,230
when someone would be on stage and you
just stare at him. Kevin Hart. Yeah.

1365
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,800
And tried to take that confidence and
Kevin, Kevin didn't back down. Nope.

1366
01:14:51,801 --> 01:14:54,170
He took it and he was very new to

1367
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,760
he, we would walk to me, you, Patrice,
Keith, Bobby, whoever else was around,

1368
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:02,190
just sit there because the seller was
half empty back then and sit in the front

1369
01:15:02,191 --> 01:15:04,450
rows. Ah, AH,

1370
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,910
or laugh obnoxiously loud it as awful
jokes when you see it on the little

1371
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:10,040
details,
little fucking whore

1372
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:14,920
Florentine would start groans.
There wasn't a greatest skills I've ever,

1373
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:16,270
he would sit in the back,

1374
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,770
he would sit in the back of the crowd and
he would turn the crowd on you by like

1375
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:25,710
groaning. He could almost like throw
his voice like, oh come on. Yeah,

1376
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:29,080
come on. And then like it was contagious
and then there'll be like three people.

1377
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,953
Ah.

1378
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,990
Anyway,
just get it going.

1379
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:35,570
We ruined bosses night one night of
Caroline's cause the curtain was drawn.

1380
01:15:35,571 --> 01:15:36,404
It was a Sunday night.

1381
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:41,590
Jim's not one side of the curtain and I'm
on the other and just doing the groans

1382
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:46,330
in Stereo. Aw Man. It was Florentines
were the ones who conceptualize that.

1383
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,340
And I'll never forget Voss
for 45 minutes on stage,

1384
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:52,910
just being combative with you.
Like what the fuck did you guys want from,

1385
01:15:52,911 --> 01:15:56,620
but you know how I fucking ornery,
he is fucking dope. So yeah.

1386
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:00,000
Why did we do that to each other?
It's fine. Why didn't we support you?

1387
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:03,340
And I'm just, we never,
never support each other.

1388
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,870
We have a vos and Patrice gotten as some
huge fight down in Carolina cause he,

1389
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:12,700
he was actually opening for portrays.
Then Patrice trashed his CD so bad.

1390
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,540
The brought it up on
stage and he ripped it,

1391
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:20,560
ripped the cover and half and
then broke it and he was trashing.

1392
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:21,700
It's so bad in the crowd.

1393
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:26,470
Laugh so hard that Voss got mad for real
and it was one of the, you know, we've,

1394
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:29,330
we've had a zillion real arguments and
then two days later you don't give a fuck.

1395
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:31,930
And it was just like, why would
you do that? Nene? Patrice

1396
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,460
real argument. We were doing
the column Quinn, Sean NBC.

1397
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,010
I was trying to get something
through standards and practices.

1398
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,350
He was just being Patrice La.

1399
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,640
He just give me a hard time with this
woman and I'm like, dude, shut up like it,

1400
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:46,590
you know, and we stopped. I'm like,
you know, I know you're a comedian.

1401
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:49,280
You don't have to prove it. I'm fucking
doing it. This is work. You know,

1402
01:16:49,281 --> 01:16:52,370
I was trying to get like literally a piece
of material through and we had like a

1403
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:54,510
real argument over it and Keith
at the fucking play, you know. Oh,

1404
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:58,070
the uh, the arbiter dude,

1405
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:01,940
I had a real fucking item one that
became a classic because of the fucking

1406
01:17:01,941 --> 01:17:06,350
Internet. I had that huge one with him
over this stupid fucking man couch show.

1407
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,610
I'm on your show on the opiate.
Anthony,

1408
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:14,960
shall we like Patrice called up,
told his man cal thing trashed me.

1409
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,590
And then I called up
Monday to defend myself.

1410
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:23,520
And of course somebody on the
show put fucking Patrice on hold.

1411
01:17:23,521 --> 01:17:27,880
They just put the two dogs in the
ring, you know, I vaguely remember,

1412
01:17:27,881 --> 01:17:29,570
I don't even know if
[inaudible] was a fucking, like,

1413
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:31,820
we were pissed at each other for
like, you know what? It was funny,

1414
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:34,070
but what broke the ice I think was that,
uh,

1415
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:38,510
was that Philly rent the Philly rant.
We finally started talking to each other.

1416
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,860
We had talked to him like,
you know, three, four months,

1417
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:41,360
which wasn't hard because we
weren't seeing each other too much.

1418
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:45,170
We would kind of this pissed and um,

1419
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,410
when, if you watch the Philly rant
as a time where I look over the Dj,

1420
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,640
the Dj going through, why you
yelling out shit, you fucking me up.

1421
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:53,810
I vaguely remember doing that.

1422
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:56,120
But what actually was was
Patrice was trying to help me.

1423
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:58,130
He yelled out invincible,

1424
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:00,830
which would have been a great
one to bring up about Philly,

1425
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:05,360
which was about a guy who was playing it,
was working in a bar,

1426
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,200
tries out for the eagles.
Not only does he get a tryout,

1427
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,660
he makes the fucking
team and has an impact.

1428
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:16,590
Like I could've just gone off on
how bad the eagle sucked. Um, and I,

1429
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,690
I, he, he, you know,

1430
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:22,691
he threw that out there like gut past
our stupid acting like a couple bitches

1431
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:26,120
not talking to each other, saw me in
trouble and fucking threw that out there.

1432
01:18:26,121 --> 01:18:29,390
And then when I came off stage, he
just started talking like, you know,

1433
01:18:29,391 --> 01:18:33,890
one of the few times he ever threw me a
compliment. Right. Um, and then you know,

1434
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,110
that we were cool after that.
It was just like a fucking,

1435
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:40,190
I dunno that Jesus Christ,
whatever. We got a lot of stories

1436
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,080
this point. Yeah. It's nice though.
I like it though. I like a, you know,

1437
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:47,810
like musicians hear
musicians talk and I'm like,

1438
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:50,600
that must have been fun to be a part
of that. But then I realized like, Hey,

1439
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,810
I'm a part of a pretty cool group of
people, just comedians who I like.

1440
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:56,960
And it's like, I never get to
watch. I don't watch David Terrell.

1441
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:59,020
I don't watch you if you're on,

1442
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:02,130
I don't want to watch standups
to tells latest special.

1443
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,910
Oh my God was it won't watch it.
I love Dave.

1444
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,930
We were doing co headlining
gigs and he would walk on stage,

1445
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,710
literally like a fucking,
like a gnome.

1446
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,340
He's carrying a plastic bag with things
and then it's like he's losing his mind

1447
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:16,820
every once in a while because I would
always make him go on last and I'm like,

1448
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:20,510
look dude, I'll take less money.
I don't fit the antisocial. Oh No.

1449
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:25,130
This was just me and Dave doing okay.
And uh, Jesus, what a fucking show.

1450
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,990
It was a good show,
but then we would refer at the end.

1451
01:19:26,991 --> 01:19:29,600
Like I would come on stage with him and
we were just doing like 15 to 20 minutes

1452
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:34,220
playing with the audience. And that was
fun. Yeah, we had a good time. He's great.

1453
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,280
But watching him, like even for the
couple of minutes when I came back,

1454
01:19:37,281 --> 01:19:41,390
he would always throw out one or two that
would just make me fucking hate being

1455
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:45,590
a comedian. Like, God, I'll
never, he just did one dumb line.

1456
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:49,970
They give a bid on mushrooms or you're
so high and you think you're having a

1457
01:19:49,971 --> 01:19:52,510
pillow fight, but then you realize
you're holding a live baby.

1458
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,230
I'm like, I just wish I
thought of that. That's one,

1459
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:04,130
I don't remember how we set it up,
but the Olympics were going on in,

1460
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:07,510
somebody's doing the luge
had died that day. And, and,

1461
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,500
and he went on stage and said
something to the effect that I think,

1462
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:13,590
I think it's very fitting that the
Olympics started with the sacrifice.

1463
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:16,080
I can't even do how we did
it, but he did it, you know,

1464
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:20,940
when he talks like low and he just sort
of vaguely threw it out there and just

1465
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,580
to see if the crowd even got it.
And it was just like, oh my God,

1466
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:24,391
it's so fucking so it,

1467
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:29,070
it's such a smart joke going back to
the original Olympics and like that time

1468
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:32,490
where I dunno if though they had sex, I
don't even fucking know. It's just, yeah,

1469
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:36,570
he's one of those guys. He, but he's a
guy that I will watch because there's,

1470
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:41,370
there's him and Harlan Williams are
two guys. The way they do this shit,

1471
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:44,530
it's just like,
there's no way I'm going to,

1472
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,420
there's going to be no overlap the way,
like, Carlin, we just comes up. Hey,

1473
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:50,670
what are you saying? They're
pig in a blanket. What are your,

1474
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,400
what are you doing there buddy? Huh?
What are you doing? Their sport.

1475
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:57,060
They just kind of goes off on these crazy,
I don't even know what he's doing.

1476
01:20:57,061 --> 01:21:00,900
Absolutely fucking destroys that. Last
time I was at Harlan, I said that to him.

1477
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:04,500
I go, nobody in your career has ever
walked up to you going, Hey Harlan.

1478
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:08,700
I kind of have a kind of got a joke
like that, you know? So anyways,

1479
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:13,650
I got my dog downstairs, I
gotta I gotta go. Uh, thank
you for go get it. Yeah, man.

1480
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:17,340

doing the fucking show. He said,

1481
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:19,490
thank you for coming. Oh, actually
I did come over to your hotel room.

1482
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,570
