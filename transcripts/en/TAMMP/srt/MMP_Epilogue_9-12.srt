1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,330
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
a, this isn't the Monday morning podcast.

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,350
This is the special,

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:12,351
the epilogue from last week's Monday
morning podcast where yours truly the

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,540
wonderful host of this show
that even say truly yours,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,570
truly promise that.
Um,

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,450
I was going to have Nia
answer the question,

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,370
the provocative question. Um,
the fuck list. So first of all,

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:30,600
let's welcome the lovely Nia
to the epilogue. How are you?

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,490
I'm great. Thanks for having me. Well, I
thank you Nia. That was very professional.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,560
What was that all about? Why was
that so professional at? No, I do.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,030
Why you did something when you were away.
That was very guilty of, hello bill.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,620
How are you person? I am something
when I was away, when I was old snack.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay. Get your promo out. When I was in
London shooting the pilot that I wrote,

14
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,940
produced and directed for a
possible travel show, I didn't,

15
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,180
I didn't ran it and I didn't direct it,
but I did produce in house debt.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,470
I'll take a compliment.
Yeah, it's a travel.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,680
I travel show pilot. Okay.
Then I did with two friends.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,040
It was amazing all about the,
uh,

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:15,090
what the black experience in different
parts of Europe are like racist,

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,180
starting with London.
What if I went over?

21
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,210
But if I went to Europe and did the
white experience, why don't you,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,540
I'll start in Germany. What's stopping
you? Yeah. Um, political incorrectness.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,420
See vites experience.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,830
You don't need your papers.
He was so lights.

25
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:39,690
You need no papers. Um,
all right, the fuck list.

26
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,720
Here's the question. Bill. Uh, I
wake up at my girlfriend's house.

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,130
She leaves for work. I love this guy. He
gets right into it. I can't find my socks.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,940
They bagged. Um, she
says I have, I have some.

29
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,930
Just use mine in leaves. All
right. Now, first of all,

30
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,850
why is this feet the same size of hers?

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,010
Who wants success? Stretchy.
Look at your socks.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,720
Strike where little colorful ankle socks,

33
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,530
like girlies socks that most girls
do. Most girls do. But I mean,

34
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:15,390
maybe she has for those, those bitches
we saw last night in the crossfit thing.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,600
Why are they bitches? Just because
I've got to get you going here. Oh,

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,230
we watched that on ESP or awesome.

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,840
These girls were ripped cry.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,880
These girls rate crime cornerbacks with
titties. That's what they look like.

39
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,210
That girl that won that, that one
round we saw it didn't look like that.

40
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,660
She looked really sexy
show. No, no up top. Up Top.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,250
She looked like a roid it up. Who said
that girl you watch on a, Oh my God,

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,630
I ate too much. Helped me.
The biggest loser. Oh my God.

43
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,200
I got to find it in my brain.
Jillian, she looked like,

44
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,970
but then she had regular girly legs and
she had a nice little button and she

45
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,220
know she had a great figure
and she looks amazing.

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,710
She was doing those muscle
ups that's going to make your,

47
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,970
your shoulders and shit really bag.
But she didn't look right about. Yeah,

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,950
he's just looking muscular number one.
Dennis Rodman wore the wedding dress.

49
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,200
That's what she would look like. Um,
no, I'm kidding. She was uh, I dunno.

50
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,080
Oddly sexy yet frightened. That's only
cause you know, she could kick here.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,700
Oh absolutely.
Anybody could kick my ass.

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,620
I have the worst hand dyed coordination
ever drunk people. That's what I have.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,900
I have heart. Yeah, I have that
classic cut. I ain't going down.

54
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,380
Hit me over the head with a hubcap will
keep coming at you. But I swear to God,

55
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,650
I took some martial arts classes.
I literally,

56
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,470
they were saying what punch was coming
and I would still get hit by it.

57
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,040
I just can't, I just can't. I
know you took martial arts class.

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,240
I took martial arts class the
way somebody comes up and look,

59
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,690
I did stand up a couple of times and then
considers himself a comedian. I'm, no,

60
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,230
I went down, it's a karate for a month
and I don't remember anything. No.

61
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:03,490
I went to a Jujitsu class and it was like
literally like literally fighting and

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,700
it was pilot season and I'm sitting there
going like, what am I doing down here?

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,380
All right, I'm fucking, I was
already in my mid thirties.

64
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,710
I don't give a shit how old you are by
the time you're in your mid thirties,

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,190
somebody can come in with,

66
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:19,660
with a fucking the mailbox and just
smash it over your head. You'd done,

67
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,470
I just did that for all the psycho
competitive guys out there. Um,

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,700
all right, the fuck list. Uh,

69
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,650
why didn't you just fucking sign me out
for no goddamn reason. Fucking thing.

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,060
You believe the timing of that, right. As
I go back to it. So where were we though?

71
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,480
Oh, he was, he was a barber.

72
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:43,481
He put under or fucking
sometimes I we get,

73
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:47,290
we would get our socks. Smith
step, the like gym socks.

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,890
So it is possible. No, no, no.

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,690
But the second I want to put them
on and went halfway up my foot,

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,050
I think these are yours with this guy.

77
00:04:56,051 --> 00:05:01,051
It's a viable option for him to walk
around all day with his fucking lady.

78
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,280
All right. Um, I wake up later and I
looked, I looked for the sock drawer.

79
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,040
Top drawer, right. Dropped
or right is what he's saying.

80
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,300
And I find this list with
about 20 to 30 names on it. Oh.

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,920
And this guy brought this up and he
goes in, my name is near the bottom.

82
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,680
I missed that the first time
I read it. So thank you. Good.

83
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,090
A good looking out there on Twitter.
Um, some of check marks on them.

84
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,270
It's Cetera.
That's okay.

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,950
I asked her about it a while and while
she was initially up, it's upset.

86
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,020
It turns out to be her fuck list.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,010
She made it after we got together
with some friends drunk one night.

88
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,050
She then admitted to being somewhat of a
whore. Her words, not mine before we met,

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,460
but assures me that she
hasn't done anything since
she met me with anyone else.

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I do believe her but I totally blew up
on her and we haven't been talking for a

91
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,470
few days. I also look a bit creepy as
to why I went through her drawer. Uh,

92
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:00,050
it Wa it wasn't an envelope.
I need help.

93
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,220
I need help on this one
was snooping around.

94
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,220
No,
but this is the thing.

95
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,170
You are a creep from snooping until you
find something cause then you have the

96
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,980
APP. Well we'll maybe see, I knew I
should have looked. I just felt something.

97
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:19,280
You could just be a total straight up
creep looking just cause you're a creep.

98
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,380
But if you find something you can
get out of it. So when he goes,

99
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,800
I need help on this one. Do
I apologize? She already has.

100
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,790
Do I just say fuck it and forget about it?
What's knee his take on this?

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,420
Now this is something I want to add in
here that I missed the first time he said

102
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,520
his name was near the bottom.

103
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,720
It doesn't mean that this list
is in chronological order.
I know, I'm just saying,

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,730
but it also could be.
It could be or it could not be.

105
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:45,820
Sometimes it's just like in the
order in which you just remember.

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,270
Well then shouldn't she say
his name first? If she even
remotely gave a fuck. Oh,

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,600
is she was drunk with her friend.
It's not like she's,

108
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,500
she's going for accuracy here.
What are you fucking Matlock?

109
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,870
You have like every defense fence for
this person. All right, cool. Let's,

110
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:02,020
let's say you are take, I'm going to shut
the fuck up. Isn't that why I'm here?

111
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,710
Yeah. Thank you very much. But
I'm here to always be an asshole.

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,540
But um,

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,950
there's something slightly creepy and
mildly psychotic about making fuck list.

114
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,240
However, a lot of girls have done
them. I've certainly done them.

115
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,540
It's just a thing that you do because
you've got this voice in the back of your

116
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:24,490
head saying you made them leave with,
who was it?

117
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,970
You know? It's just, I've never even
done that. I just go on my head.

118
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:31,630
I go a fucking cam. Cathy, Susie,

119
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,040
fucking that chick with a Jello
shot. Well, girls let to make lists.

120
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,720
We like, we like writing things down like
to journal and why is that what it is?

121
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:43,570
So it's not really in like
a a fucking horror thing.

122
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:46,570
It's just like you're going to the
Navajo as she, and she means she was,

123
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,060
had went through a slutty
face on a Horay flays phase.

124
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,850
She should get the terminology right
unless she was in fact of what's the

125
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:55,990
difference between a slutty phase in a
hoary face is someone who just likes to

126
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,230
sleep around and sleep with a lot of
different people and have a good time.

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,100
A whore is someone who is fucking
people to get something out of it.

128
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,470
That's a horse. That's the
difference. Wow. That's what
I think. Yeah. I actually,

129
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,490
I don't think I can argue
with that assumption of who
worry about being a slut.

130
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,340
There's something funny
about being a whore.

131
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,080
Okay.

132
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,340
All right. I just got lost in
that one. Yeah, it got deep.

133
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,000
Uh, but you know what I think, I
think you should let it go. I mean,

134
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,560
it wasn't an envelope.
Come on, leave it alone.

135
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,110
But he saw it and he's,

136
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,450
he's right to feel he's right to feel a
certain kind of way about it because if

137
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,990
I found, wait a mail list or
notebook or whatever it is,

138
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:45,970
you have all of your cock
in an envelope to me,

139
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,100
seems like it's a work in progress.

140
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:51,340
If she scribbled it down on a cocktail
Napkin and then threw it away,

141
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,910
or even it was crumpled up in her genes,
as they say in my,

142
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,740
that's Spanish for genes. Genes.
That's the way they say it.

143
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,740
And I was fucking saying it back to
it going geed and they kept saying,

144
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,470
I was saying genes wrong and you're
a Rosetta stone. He's the guy.

145
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:08,480
That would be the funniest thing that
you've done the cm. You know what?

146
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,820
When I'm bilingual, you wake me, I'm
going to bilingual, I'm gonna give,

147
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,490
I'm gonna become filthy bilingual and
you wait till the shit that I'm saying

148
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:16,410
that you don't even fucking
understand when we're in the wreck.

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,120
I look nothing to it. Of course should
do with your fuck list. All right.

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,060
Wait a minute. The fact that the
fact that it's in an envelope, right?

151
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,710
It's in a fucking envelope.
It's just keeping it private and keep out.

152
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,960
Yeah, because it was so,
this is what I'm really,

153
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,370
you're going to call that a document.

154
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,020
Your Dick w nine form the fuck outta here.
To me,

155
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,960
this girl is, she's not done
fucking yet. Okay. This,

156
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,500
this is and what's the deal with
some of them have checkmarked.

157
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,450
Some of them don't. That's either a
performance thing. Yes. Look at that face.

158
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:00,180
You can't see the face you just made.
That's either a performance thing.

159
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,280
That could be a lot of things.
That could be,

160
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:06,150
these are the ones that really
put it on me up the ass.

161
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,340
These will be the ones that I really
liked. These are really the ones,

162
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,480
the ones I like blue, whatever.
Who knows? Did she not have a, um,

163
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,990
a guide at the bottom? Did he check
for that while he was snooping around?

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,710
They look for the fucking,
you know,

165
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,210
bibliography to go back to cross reference
with those check marks mean stay out

166
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:29,070
of the drawer and the private notes.
Creepo wait a minute.

167
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,580
No, he went on the drawer to get socks. I
get it. Can I just say something though?

168
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,490
What? Uh, I don't know that if a woman,

169
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:39,390
it really has the right to tell
a guy not to snoop. Why is that?

170
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,410
Because of your guys' history. But
then again, wait a minute. Wait,

171
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:47,130
am I three of what? I'm just snooping you
guys all do it. All right. But then, but,

172
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,030
but that kills my argument
because that would be like a,

173
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,720
then I should have no right to give you
shit for fucking around because guys do

174
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:59,670
it too. So that, that, that argument's
stuck. All right. So I think so what,

175
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,250
so what do you think is, what should
this guy do? Should he apologize?

176
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,130
Should what is, should he
apologize and let it go? Move on.

177
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,150
How exactly she apologized.
Said, listen, I'm sorry.

178
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,710
I went to get a pair of your Chris Everett
shock and I found your fuck list and

179
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:16,380
then I got upset about
it. Yeah, I'm sorry.

180
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,230
And like blew up at you about
it cause she up. By the way,

181
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:22,050
why isn't my name is that
guy brilliantly mentioned.

182
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,650
Why isn't my name at the bottom
of the or the top of the list?

183
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,780
It's not chronologically. You're
just throwing down names. Maybe.

184
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,410
Maybe she started off being like,
okay, who was the first guy?

185
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,410
And then she went down the list and
then she got things got thrown in there.

186
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,080
It doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter. She's with him now.

187
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,160
So stop focusing on the you.
Can I ask you a question?

188
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,200
Isn't it weird that she just has this
like a fucking serial killer as like this

189
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,420
trophy?
That's why.

190
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,630
That's why I said it's weird and mildly
psychotic that she has a fucking list.

191
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,890
We, but a lot of girls do it. I have done
it. It's one of those things that you do.

192
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,990
So you're sharing,
you're weird and mildly psychotic.

193
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:02,890
You speaking out of both sides of
your mouth here. I'm not, I'm not.

194
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,740
You don't think it's weird and mildly
psychotic to do that? Yes. I admit,

195
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,590
but then you're saying put up a lot
of women do it with a lot of people do

196
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,710
something. It doesn't, it doesn't it
become mainstream and not be be psychotic?

197
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,680
I guess so. I mean maybe it's more
normal than you think, but it's,

198
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,780
it's a little weird to,
I mean,

199
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:21,400
unless you're trying to trace back like
an STD or something like that then,

200
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,530
but people do it all the time.

201
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,970
That's another reason for possibly the
check thing. I wasn't itching with him.

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,740
No. He should just be like, listen, I'm
sorry I freaked out. Let's just move on.

203
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,490
You know what I mean? Like if there's
a bigger issue, what should she said?

204
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,540
She's already apologized to him. He
said, what would you, what do you think?

205
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:48,210
I'm sorry. I think she said fuck list.
Yeah, I was drunk with my girlfriend.

206
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,990
We made a little list and
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I,

207
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,370
she admitted that would make somebody
feel uncomfortable if she found it.

208
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,870
She would feel fucked up about it.
I would feel fucked up,

209
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,900
but I wouldn't want my girl being
out there with all her friends.

210
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,170
Man, I fucked this guy. I sucked his dick.

211
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,160
So guys and girls they sleep
with and then I come walking.

212
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,820
Yeah, but it's different.
Why? Why? I'll tell you why.

213
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,550
Why didn't you just say it like
that? Why? I'll tell you why.

214
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,770
First of all, physically we're
doing the fucking, Oh God,

215
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,650
this fucking argument.
Yeah. Yeah. And secondly,

216
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,150
a guy has a right to brag about getting
laid because for us it's a fucking skill.

217
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,690
You can go out any night of the week
and walk into a bar and be like, hey,

218
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,550
who fucking wants it? Yes. That's exactly
what we can do. You could get a fucking,

219
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,320
you could get a three on one on a God
damn fucking pool table if you want it to

220
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,154
a guy.

221
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,690
I don't give a fuck what he looks like
unless he's a fucking movie star and

222
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,330
they're just throwing themselves at him
and then even then they're going to try

223
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,360
to get fucking knocked up.

224
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,140
Take the old Turkey based or to
the use condom and then fucking,

225
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:00,290
you know that move the NBA move. Huh? I
don't know that. You don't know that move.

226
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,290
You don't have that on
your fucking lawyer.

227
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,380
I know. The reason, the
reason why a woman is a whore,

228
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,190
it's this.
I still a bit about it.

229
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,310
It's like a fat guy eating an ice cream
in public where he's like, oh cool,

230
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,470
I'll go to, if you do it, nobody cares
when I do so Google wouldn't fit. Fuck,

231
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,870
because it's gluttonous.
It's gluttonous.

232
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:24,871
Your guys' pursuit of sex takes
absolutely no skill whatsoever other than

233
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,260
other than four,
and I'll say it again.

234
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,040
The only thing you have to worry about
is which one's the rapist. Once you,

235
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,900
once you get, once you get
past that, it's just a field,

236
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:47,320
the dicks.
Maybe that's why you have guys make lists.

237
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,560
Whoa, whoa. Dang.

238
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,850
You're an idiot. Idiot. That
was, listen, a lot of my show,

239
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,460
very ignorant.
A lot of my shit is deliberately ignorant,

240
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,640
but there's a nice point in
there somewhere, which is what?

241
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,480
Like a little little rose booboo.
Um,

242
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,020
we know where my point is.

243
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:13,220
My point is the reason why we don't
fucking respect the fact that you guys go

244
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,050
out and do it is because
it takes no skill.

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,760
Because guys will fuck anything
that moves basically. Okay.

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,600
You want even, but even the fact
that we will fuck everything.

247
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,910
Anything that moves, we still got to
fucking do a little tap dance before.

248
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,663
Yeah,
look at you.

249
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,450
[inaudible] I'm old enough to realize
when you get that look on your face,

250
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,160
even if I'm making a great point,

251
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,500
you don't want to fucking hear you
already have your mind made up.

252
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,370
You know what it is.

253
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,370
You don't have a comeback to this other
than to sit there with your stupid

254
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:45,110
eyebrows doing whatever
they're doing right now. It
is true. You know, you don't,

255
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,510
you remember that time when I
was trying to explain to you,

256
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,951
this is a great story.

257
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm going to tell them and tell the
podcast people this because I'm so sick of

258
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:55,220
looking at your funny story.
One time were in a bar, right?

259
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,620
And we were talking about whatever,

260
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,080
what it was like to be
a guy and all that shit.

261
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,030
And I was sitting there telling
her, you know, to, to get laid,

262
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,600
you know you got to have fucking, oh
you said, you know guys. Oh my God.

263
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,720
They used to just say the dumbest
things to me. That's what you said.

264
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,880
I said rarely. I go,
let's flip the tables.

265
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,850
Let's pretend I'm in control
and you were over there. Oh boy.

266
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Come make them to hit on me and
you want to talk about bombing.

267
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,920
So she sitting there just with her
fucking nonexistent game. Like, Hey,

268
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:32,921
I theory gencon had drinking your glass
there and I love games and I was being a

269
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,590
total fucking jerk to you. And
at one point you go, you just be,

270
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,170
you just making this difficult on
purpose. And what did I say? I said,

271
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,940
welcome to my world.
I say,

272
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,440
and the whole bar ware Uno,
uno,

273
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,380
you start high fiving the birds.
That's what should have happened.

274
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,610
If I was miked up that what happened?
Oh Shit.

275
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,140
Z now you're doing is mopping the great
point that I made because you know your

276
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:03,860
rock dog, you fucking plot throw
it. It's difficult, isn't it?

277
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,580
When I was being a fucking jerk,
thinking, isn't that the craziest feeling?

278
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,490
Like what the fuck do I say?
How do I get into this?

279
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,520
That's what guys have to learn how to do.
You guys don't have to do that.

280
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,850
All you have to do is come there
to know how to flirt. I get what?

281
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:17,990
Come there with half your titties,

282
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:22,991
hanging out and sit there like the hats
is fucking slowly putting a straw in

283
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:28,040
your mouth. No suggest things. A whole
like seductive technique. You know?

284
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,700
It's like being charming
and funny and sexy.

285
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,280
Putting your hand on his forearm for
just a second and then taking it away.

286
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,780
And this isn't some like fucking cosmo
list of how to get a guy interested in

287
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,290
you. I'm just saying that wasn't
a cosmo loose. That was, that was,

288
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,230
that is something that I learned. That's
something, that's something I learned.

289
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,950
What putting your this girl one time
when we finally fucking hooked up,

290
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,230
you know, I as always, I was stunned
that it happened and then she was like,

291
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:58,800
fucking a, what did she say? How
did you not know? I liked, you know,

292
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,920
it's like we can have a fucking say. Then
she goes, I put my hand on, she goes,

293
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:06,470
I put my hand on your arm. And like
that to her was a sign of, yeah,

294
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
I want to have sex with you.
Well know that that's true,

295
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,590
but she liked me that she
was interested in. Okay.

296
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,740
Like the physical contact thing.
Okay.

297
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,920
I guess so you seem pretty confident
when you were hitting on me.

298
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,290
US because I had been bombing for years.

299
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,220
Okay.

300
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,860
No, I got, yeah, you get to, you get
to the point. We don't give a shit.

301
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,660
If I had to do it now, ah, forget it.

302
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,340
It'd be like taking five
years or six years off of
fucking standup. Yeah. I mean,

303
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,480
I feel like my flirtation dimension,
I'm old and balding like that.

304
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,820
That doesn't help either,
but I am making some money.

305
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,380
I am making some money so that
that trumps a lot of shit.

306
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,310
That's like me wearing a little hoary
dress. If you come fucking walking in with

307
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,600
money, what do you mean at, first
of all, I'm making money now.

308
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:53,410
It's not like you're walking around
dripping in diamonds and Rolex watches and

309
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,770
stuff and driving. You know a
Porsche where you read, I have money.

310
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,620
You're walking in there and I go out
of 50 Boston's sports related. CSUS,

311
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,130
I you have.
Okay.

312
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,680
When your socks pulled up
and your old man shorty like,

313
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,900
like you look like the
fucking little league.

314
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,870
Okay. You're not exactly the
screaming sexy money guy. Okay,

315
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,600
so this whole idea, oh, I make
money now. So now the pitches,

316
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,040
the bitches be loving name. No
one knows you having money. Okay,

317
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,670
seriously.

318
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,700
Well maybe that's my little whore
repelling. There you go. Dress

319
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,783
little league coach.

320
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,280
If you have money and you want to keep it,
that's what you do.

321
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:43,290
And then every once in a
while you go out and I,

322
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,770
I wouldn't even know what to wear.
I would watch an old r Kelly video.

323
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,800
Am I supposed to have like not have it,
have a tie on,

324
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:52,580
but have some sort of chain with my face
on it? Is that what it's supposed to do?

325
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,040
I don't know. One of these
days, needy. I'm going to,

326
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,560
I'm going to go down to fucking
Hollywood boulevard or sunset.

327
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,600
We're all those whores or walking around

328
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,190
wrestling. You keep threatening.
You're going to go down.

329
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:05,260
You're going to go down to the w hotel.
That's what it is.

330
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:07,440
You're going to go down Martha,
the Debbie

331
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,330
and have it all these young girls
asked me where the bathroom is.

332
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,383
Right.

333
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,200
I don't work here. I'm actually here
to intermingle with the opposite sex.

334
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,840
No, listen to. I act my fucking
age. All right. I'm not,

335
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,930
even if you were to fucking dumped me,
there's no,

336
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:31,660
I wouldn't go down to the fucking w.
What would you do?

337
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,380
I'd go none of the wine bar where all
that dusty divorce pussies. I just,

338
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,750
except my lot in life.

339
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,650
Oh, can we talk about how there's
no woman a cougar? And I said it's,

340
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,820
they're not cougars if they're
the same age as you. Oh

341
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,750
No, she, she wasn't hitting on me.

342
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,520
What do you mean who was she was a nun
when she hitting on somebody young.

343
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,354
Who are we talking about?

344
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,430
You said to me,
Oh,

345
00:20:56,431 --> 00:21:00,090
we were out the other night and the is
the cougars came up and talked to us and

346
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,660
I said, oh, girls and all they were up.
I said, they're not cougars. If they say,

347
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,900
do you realize a female
cougars are your age?

348
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,870
The ones they call cougars are your,
I don't judge them by their rate.

349
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:13,290
So for you to say Cougar is Mason,
no science. Those are your peers.

350
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,840
I don't judge them by their age.
So then why'd you call him cougars?

351
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,620
Cougars allowed age. The
lack of elasticity. Fucking

352
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,540
they're dead.

353
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,560
Titties were like when
they pull their pants up,

354
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:35,270
like the titties were behind their belt.
Okay. They will fall. They were a mess.

355
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,200
You, you know, I'm like, one of
them was actually cool and the uh,

356
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:40,921
she was cool.

357
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:44,430
She was actually like hot for her
age and still fucking working out.

358
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,370
But she was like beyond the expiration
dates, you've actually said, hey,

359
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:48,690
you look good. She goes, thank you.

360
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:53,430
Thank you for noticing the
fucking attitude you would
like him to have 25 years

361
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:57,540
earlier. Right. So she was
cool. The other one was a mess.

362
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,340
I told you she kicked me in the fucking
leg. No. Yeah, like three times.

363
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:02,971
Right in the Shin.

364
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,640
Cause I made fun of her because
she was just an obnoxious that Kay,

365
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,680
we're thing over here.
I was hanging down.

366
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:09,090
I'm not gonna mention the person's name,

367
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:14,010
but I've ran into a comedian and we were
sitting down and they came walking by

368
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,760
man. So comedians, you know, we fucking
made fun of. Next thing you know,

369
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:22,440
they're sitting down and it was, it
was horrific. The second they sat down.

370
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,150
So the one was cool, the other one
was an asshole. What did I say to her?

371
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:31,080
I didn't comment on our age that did
something. And she had these big,

372
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:35,730
those big stupid fucking platform horse
shoes on that they're all wearing now.

373
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,001
Right.

374
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:39,000
And she fucking kicked me with his like
hit him with a block of wood and for

375
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,020
some reason it didn't hurt.

376
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,790
She hit me like three fucking times and
I just kept laughing at her and then

377
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,830
security came over. The whole thing
took like 90 seconds. She had that,

378
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,400
that's not a cigarette and
ges for fucking India. It is,

379
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,410
it is what it is. Come on. She came up,
she was in that window. Nini, she came up,

380
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,060
it was just herpes.
That's when she came up.

381
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,850
I think if she, if she had like a
CB that would be her handle. Um, oh,

382
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:13,410
one of the last thing I want to, I want
to ask you just to get you going again.

383
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:17,670
Yesterday we went to, we
got some barbecue. Yes. Um,

384
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,120
and we would drive it back and there was
the name of this store called peekaboo.

385
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,200
Peekaboo. I want to do with
that store is, and I go,

386
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:29,910
it's probably kids clothes and then
you're like, yeah it is kid clothes.

387
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,961
And then I said,

388
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:35,961
what if it was closed for those people
who are full grown adults but want to act

389
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:40,350
like babies before you go off on them?
There's this group of people,

390
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:43,200
Opie and Anthony exposed me to this.
Uh,

391
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,190
they would show him that
where they fucking a, it's,

392
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,870
they were adults and they don't want to
grow up and their mothers like 60 or 70

393
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,130
and they're like 35 in a
playpen wearing a diaper guy.

394
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,720
I go, I can't, oh my
God, stop. Stop. I can't,

395
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,670
I can't deal with that.
What's wrong with that?

396
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:05,671
I refused to ever be okay
with that lifestyle and I'm
a very tolerant person if

397
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:10,330
it was your son, but I no, no, no,
no. It's not going to be my son.

398
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,720
What if I find that whole thing?
So repellent,

399
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,750
pretend I'm your and you're wearing a
diaper and you want me to breastfeed you

400
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,900
and rocky back and forth and
have you put or whatever. Mark,

401
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:27,820
breastfeed and all that shit. No, get
up. Get a fucking job. You'll Weirdo.

402
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,960
So grows and no,
I refuse.

403
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,670
I refuse to be okay with the adult
baby. Trend, but if he had a job,

404
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,610
he had a job, but he, that's when,

405
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,710
that's just how he rolled
when he was in the house,

406
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:45,520
like he chilled and he just wanted to
come out of the couch and lay in your lap

407
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,470
and have you like tickle his tummy? No,
I mean, as he played with the mobile,

408
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,330
fine,

409
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,720
people can do whatever they want in their
free time and if they're not imposing

410
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:58,460
it on other people, I guess that's their
right. I mean, I know what to do that.

411
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,970
How many guys when you accept somebody,
but I don't accept it. I don't, I mean,

412
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:06,180
I have to say though,
people should do whatever they want to do,

413
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:11,181
but I just find it's so creepy and just
wrong to be crawling around and cab.

414
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,600
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. What
would you do? Fucking weird.

415
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,190
What would you do? Your son, he,
you know, he, he took shop class,

416
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,300
he thought was going to be a carpenter,

417
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,930
but the only reason why I did it was so
he could build himself a giant crick and

418
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:25,850
then he was in there one day,
came home.

419
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:29,180
It's like Eddie standing there standing
up in the crib wearing a diaper and a

420
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,080
shirt that doesn't quite meet his diaper.
Oh,

421
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,500
with his hands on either
side of the rails going

422
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,970
no. Am Abby had, oh, I wouldn't be
okay with that. Be like with a beard,

423
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,310
right. Is there, there's,

424
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,940
there is a problem and we need
to get you help because why?

425
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:48,260
Why is this your escape like by
acting like a baby? I don't know.

426
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,380
Nope. Nope. Nope, nope. Nope.
Not into it. Don't like it.

427
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,620
Don't want to see it.

428
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,630
What if,
what if he went to,

429
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,770
I got help and everything was totally
fine but the only side effect was he still

430
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:01,041
wore,

431
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:05,980
he wore an adult feety
pajamas onesy and it was baby

432
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:11,010
blue. I can live with that. I suppose
what I just, you know the sound that a,

433
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:15,690
once he makes on hardwood floors,
adults acting like babies is weird to me.

434
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,261
It's just like,

435
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:20,400
I don't like girls who like to be like
these little girl princess is all the

436
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:24,120
time where they're like obsessed with a
hello kitty and they want to like be a

437
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:28,680
princess and like ponies and cupcakes
and this like that, that you know,

438
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:30,480
making yourself a child like a,

439
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,840
yeah, most of them are according
to the doctor drew show,

440
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,030
they got molested and then you
just sort of stopped there.

441
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:39,080
Like whatever age they're acting like
they're at something chromatic happened to

442
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:43,440
them. Oh, well I know the age old.
Don't know about that. I just mean like,

443
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,880
no, that was actually what was
actually when I did his show up.

444
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:52,440
Girls would call and be like, Lna
Raping Jackie, Jackie, me. Like,

445
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,440
like what happened to me yesterday?
Okay, we're almost up to a half hour.

446
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:56,850
This was only supposed to
be like 10 minutes. Okay,

447
00:26:56,851 --> 00:27:00,390
well really quickly doing an entirely
different pocket, but really quickly,

448
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,210
remember I said yesterday
I went into that store and,

449
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,590
and that you don't shut up the,
I saw that little white fluffy dog,

450
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,220
one of those little tiny white
curly fluffy dogs running
around. I was like, oh,

451
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:16,140
how cute. And the girl in the shop goes,
that's waffles. And I went, oh, waffles.

452
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:17,070
Okay cute.

453
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,200
And she call icon that cause he looks
like a waffle and I she stress out waffle

454
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:22,891
like that.
Yeah.

455
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:27,570
While Paul and I looked at the dog
and I looked at her and I said,

456
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,250
is that what a waffle looks like to you?
And she goes, well now I just be like,

457
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,090
he reminds me of a waffle.

458
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,470
Like he really more looks
like a sheep or a lamb,

459
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:41,430
but I call them muffles and I just walked
away because I can't deal with that

460
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,020
because I just feel like you're trying
to be like this cute little nonsensical

461
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,310
girl.
And it's like,

462
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,160
why do you feel the need to like
dumb yourself down like that?

463
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:54,030
It's like girls need to be held to a
higher standard than that and not try to

464
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:57,720
like cute their way into things or change
their voice when they're asking for

465
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:01,200
tea. Yeah. Ernie, sorry, can I make
it, I'm so sorry. Can I like it?

466
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:04,830
Like an ice tea thing
is like don't do that.

467
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:07,980
Don't feel like you have to be
a baby to get what you want,

468
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:12,900
or that's what I say. Put Your
titties away. Not Standing yet.

469
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,220
It's just being a fully formed
adults being an adult. Okay.

470
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:20,850
We're going to end right now. Can you just
please do, do her saying waffles again?

471
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,620
Wow. Fucking horrific.
All right. There you go.

472
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,020
There's the answer to your question
and thanks for the guy on our Twitter.

473
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:30,840
Let me know that the major thing that I
missed at that dude wasn't even at the

474
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:34,590
bottom of the list. All right?
Not necessarily calm, logical.

475
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,850
We got it fucking Matlock
the whole fucking way.

476
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:39,950
I knew you were going to defend fender,

477
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,760
her, whatever. All right.
