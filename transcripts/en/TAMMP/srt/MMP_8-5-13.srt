1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,700
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,010
August 5th, 2013. How are you,
how are you doing this morning?

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,690
All of that.
She has fantastic,

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,140
this is going to be another subdued
William Burr here on the Monday morning

5
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,680
podcast.
As you can tell,

6
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:24,270
I wasn't able to find a
fucking cord from my mixer. So,

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:28,650
um, the lovely Nia is going
to send me mine. Uh, so next,

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,540
this will be the last week
of this kind of stuff.

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,541
So I've had difficulty trying to find
basically everything here in New Orleans.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,380
For those of you just listening, I haven't
listened for the past couple of weeks.

11
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm here in New Orleans.
I'm doing the, uh,

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,670
what do you call it?
The final episode of Glee for this season.

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,300
It's like some three hour extravaganza.
So I have to be out here forever.

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,300
And you know,
like I mentioned,

15
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,760
I am going to be shirtless
in the cafeteria scene,

16
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,580
so I've been trying to try
to get healthy food out here,

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,430
which is practically impossible.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,470
I haven't been able to find it.
If there's any New Orleans people,

19
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:09,540
I guess they don't say knowledge,
by the way.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,630
I was told that the other
night that they don't say that.

21
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,140
That's just some Hollywood
shit. And then, uh,

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,520
I taught that person how to
properly say Boston, B, a w Boston,

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,540
not Boston.

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,700
So we both had a laugh and then we
ate some fried fucking oysters because

25
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,840
everything's fried down here.
You know, I go into Verizon,

26
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:35,520
I need a new cell phone.
You know,

27
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,860
they didn't have the entire thing.

28
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:40,350
They just had the part you plug
into your fucking computer.

29
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:45,270
So unless I was going to walk around with
my computer and then bring that plug,

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,710
plugged that in and then plug the
fucking cell phone into my computer,

31
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,140
that was the only way for me to
charge it when I was on the road.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,390
So I'm sitting there going like, you
know, I'm becoming a top of shit here.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,090
And I have my big shirtless scene,
you know,

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,620
I'm singing a eight, six, seven,
five, three Oh nine, Jenny.

35
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,610
Uh, but the jazz it up
a little bit, but uh,

36
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,570
anyway, so I find someplace
to get a juice. And uh,

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,130
even then the way they do the juice,
you know, usually you use the apple,

38
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,870
you use the fruit to give it a little
zing so you can drink the fucking green

39
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,870
shit.
But they do it the opposite down here.

40
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,200
It's apple juice and then they'll add
like half a leaf of Kale in there.

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,870
And I just kind of hop and yourself
up on sugar. So, um, I actually,

42
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,940
I do have a game plan dot people,
um,

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,380
after your wonderful suggestions
where you like, Bill,

44
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:48,030
why don't you watch that documentary
fat sick and nearly dead?

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,610
And I'm like, well, yeah, I've
already watched those, you know,

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,220
Food Inc and I watched

47
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,610
uh,
uh,

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,060
Drylok [inaudible] fucking uh,

49
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,040
Morgan Spurlock try like [inaudible] yeah,

50
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,900
it's a famous percussionist from India.

51
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,623
MMM.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,070
I fucking, uh, I mean that's
how you can say his name built.

53
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,780
Just get to the point on right.

54
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,760
The fuck was my point.
Oh, Morgan Spurlock.

55
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,640
Is that his name? I watched that. What?

56
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:27,330
He Ate Mcdonald's for 30 fucking
days in a row. And uh, I mean,

57
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,200
you know what's great about that?

58
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,270
You knew what you knew his
body was going to be junk,

59
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:35,070
but secretly haven't you always
wanted to do that? Just say fuck it.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,420
Just blow your body out.

61
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,983
You know,

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
just deep I would,

63
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,240
how much weight you actually could
gain if you really put your mind to it.

64
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,373
You know,

65
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,270
this is what I do.
I would start with a grand slam breakfast

66
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,360
and then I have to take a nap cause I'm
old. When you get older, by the way,

67
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:55,830
when you eat really bad,
you know,

68
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:58,620
rather than just running outside
like you do as a youngster,

69
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:01,050
it takes a toll on you.
He actually have to go lay down

70
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,110
and try to sleep yourself back
into some sort of balance.

71
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:09,270
I don't know what put a, yeah,
I'd probably start with that.

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,220
Okay.

73
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,100
Lunchtime or would I do steak and cheese
so you know what it is?

74
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,070
That kind of food itself fucks me up now.
I can't even enjoy it anymore.

75
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,350
That's what happens as you get older.
It's like you fucking guts.

76
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,330
I like some engine that your entire life
you went down like two quarts of oil on

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,480
and it just doesn't run as
well as it used to. You know,

78
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,410
back when you were younger,

79
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:38,180
you could do fucking neutral drops and
fucking be driving 40 miles an hour and

80
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:40,190
just yanked the emergency brake.

81
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,380
It cut the wheel and almost tip over
your fucking Volkswagen Fox like my buddy

82
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:50,360
did back in the day. You can't do that
anymore as you get older, you know,

83
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,700
so if you are older
and every time you eat,

84
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:57,170
you then have to immediately fall
asleep. Uh, you're down a few courts.

85
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,630
It's time for a new, ain't want to put
a synthetic in there. So anyway, so,

86
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,980
um, I've been a, you know,
days, I'm not working.

87
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,600
I've been kind of bored.

88
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,780
I know a lot of you guys already
know what I'm working on here in la.

89
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,060
Do you guys always go, Bill, why do you
try to keep it such a big fucking secret?

90
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:17,690
What you're doing?

91
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,250
You can just go to your imdv page and
figure out what you're doing. Well,

92
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,090
do you ever think that that may be that
that's the fucking method to my madness.

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,930
See, if I just told you what I'm doing
down here in New Orleans, you'd be Oh,

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,270
humble brag or you'd give me
shit. You know, easy their care.

95
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:37,730
Don't forget where you came from,
Ra.

96
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,963
MMM.

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,910
So what I do is I deliberately
act vague and then people send me,

98
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,880
then they just got an IMD B and they
ended up knowing more about what the fuck

99
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,530
I'm doing. Then if I told you anyways,
and then people send me emails like bill,

100
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:55,920
in order to still be so vague, it's
so easy to find out what you're doing.

101
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,270
You're doing this, that blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. It's like, there you go.

102
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,900
You're dumb. Fuck. That's
exactly what I wanted.

103
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,200
I wanted you to have the
information. I tricked you. Okay.

104
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,020
You're coming at me like you
just solved the murder case.

105
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,380
Like you're fucking Colombo and you're
looking away with your crazy eye rubbing

106
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:16,070
your forehead and I'm standing
there flabbergasted here
in a heartbeat under the

107
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,120
floorboards. You got it ass
backwards. That's why I'm fig.

108
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,210
I want to give you
something to do at work.

109
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,880
Well, is she going to do sit there
and stare at your spreadsheets,

110
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,540
figuring out how much fucking grapes
costs in the next 20 minutes screaming by

111
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:36,470
myself. I've actually been
doing really well with my
weight here. Oh, so anyway, so,

112
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,790
uh, I finally give in and a, I'm like,
all right, I'm not working today.

113
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,930
I'm going to go, uh, I'm going to go, uh,

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,280
yeah, I'm going to watch this
fucking fat, sick and nearly dead.

115
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,100
And I gotta tell you, man, it was awesome.

116
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,810
I absolutely loved it. And, uh,

117
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,390
I felt bad for trash and fat
people on my podcast, my, my, uh,

118
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,330
Billy shade, Billy shame to get back
and get back into shape. You know,

119
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,250
where I just make fun of the Fed is,
um, I mean it was always done in jest,

120
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:15,710
but I don't know if there's one guy that
he runs it to that, uh, I don't know.

121
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,570
I felt bad for the dude, but anyway,
so he goes on this juice fast. So,

122
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,840
of course now I'm like obsessed with it,
you know,

123
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,040
just so I can get some of these
fried clams and all this stuff,

124
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,600
these po boy sandwiches.

125
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,650
Just try to get these out of my system
because I'm sick of having to take a nap

126
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,170
every time I eat out here.
Uh,

127
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,760
so I think I'm going to buy a mini juicer
and a bunch of Kale and that type of

128
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:45,640
shit. Nah, juice it up and then just
shove it down my fucking pie hole,

129
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,020
you know? And believe it or not,
it fills you up. It fills you up.

130
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:53,650
Do you get used to it?
Then you start craving that and uh,

131
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,080
and then the best part is you
don't have to go to the gym.

132
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,010
That's what it's really all about people.
That's the number one reason to eat.

133
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:08,090
Well, not so you live longer. It's
so you don't have to go to the gym,

134
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,440
you don't have to go to the gym and
you've, you've clothes still fit. Right.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,913
You know,

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,840
I don't know. It was funny. Somebody you
ever, they actually sent me an email call.

137
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,240
Bill. Do you have any idea how
many times you say, you know,

138
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,760
during a podcast and it was, it's
just like, yes, of course I do.

139
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,060
You know,
how the fuck wouldn't I know that thick.

140
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,830
I don't listen back to these things as
I upload them to try to see if they're

141
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,770
funny or not. You know, I got admit
if I don't think they're funny,

142
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:39,900
I shut them off really quickly,
but they start going,

143
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,563
I like them.

144
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,640
But I do notice that I say
it that, that, that much.

145
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:49,960
But maybe can I have a catch phrase?
No,

146
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,370
that was actually not even a,
but when it wasn't even on you.

147
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,630
Now I'm in my own fucking head.
I don't want to do that anyways.

148
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,910
I'm still here at the hotel.
I'm going to buy a juicer and uh,

149
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,640
I just figured to two
out of three meals a day,

150
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,940
I'm going to drink that shit.
And uh,

151
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,150
yeah, when I come home I want
to have an even bigger head.

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,193
Yeah.

153
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,490
I guess that's the way you can,
I know you were,

154
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,720
if you come back off the road and
your head isn't three sizes bigger,

155
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,090
does your girlfriend thank you?
Cheated on her.

156
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,450
Like what are you in such good shape for?
But if you come back,

157
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,910
it's like a fed booze hound.
Oh, okay. He was faithful.

158
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,553
I don't know.

159
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,270
Anyway, so let's talk about, let's
talk about Major League baseball.

160
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:44,271
Something that I have not watched since
2010 when I just got sick of everybody,

161
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:49,170
you know, testing positive for stuff,
particularly people on my team.

162
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,400
And uh, it was just like, yeah. You
know, it just Kinda took all the, uh,

163
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,540
the glory out of those championships
and stuff that the red sox won.

164
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,110
It did not take any glory away from
beating the Yankees in 2004 though.

165
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
It did not at all because, you
know, they had just as many guys,

166
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:07,740
if not some of the worst offenders.
You know,

167
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,780
I think Andy Pettit woulda got more
shit if he wasn't into Jesus. Any,

168
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,170
any major league baseball players listing.

169
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,260
If you're listening to this and you're
doing, if you're on the juice there,

170
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,400
what I would do and you feel like
the hounds are nipping at your heels.

171
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,360
I would air quote find Jesus.
You know it.

172
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,040
Just start fucking write it on your glove.
When you wave to the,

173
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,800
when you wave to the camera.
Jesus's love.

174
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,430
Jesus saves Jesus is my homie.

175
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,650
Yeah, I know. Whatever. Whatever the
fuck else you say so that when you, uh,

176
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,320
okay,

177
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,780
you fuck up then you can just do like
that stuff like those televangelists we

178
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:54,120
just sit there crying. I
have sinned against you and
people seem to forgive you.

179
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,330
So let's get to Alex Rodrigues up
everybody buddy. Oh, by the way,

180
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,060
if you'd like to know who's in first
place in major league baseball,

181
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:04,230
I actually looked it up. I had no idea. I
mean, I knew the red sox were doing well.

182
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,320
Um,
the red sox,

183
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,740
the Tigers and the Oakland age earned
first place in the American league and

184
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:18,070
then see if I can remember this.
And National League, it's the A,

185
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,990
is it the Braves?

186
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,480
The Dodgers Dodgers are actually
doing well. Making me eat kraut.

187
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,390
Yeah. Cause I laughed at them last year
when they were like, we were like, hey,

188
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,870
we have $100 million worth the fucking
players who want doing shit for us.

189
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:34,830
And the Dodgers are like,
well shit, we'll tag them.

190
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,720
You don't like they're playing
a different game over there.

191
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:42,500
I don't know why you would do that but
thank you for doing it. And you know what,

192
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,990
thanks to you,
it works for all of us.

193
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,130
The Red Sox and Dodgers a buzzed
in first place. And my squad,

194
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,980
if I had been paid attention, the
Pittsburgh pirates. Yeah, but you

195
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,300
know how he found out the pirates were
in first place that was sitting in a bar.

196
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,250
Yeah. Eating fried corn flakes, whatever
the fuck they have down here. And um,

197
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,210
they had on a game and oh well the
pirates on pirates and cardinals,

198
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,990
I really loved the National
League for way back in the day.

199
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,680
I used to like it because so many
of the teams played on astro turf.

200
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,570
And when I was a little kid,

201
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,090
I thought that that was way
cooler than playing on grass.

202
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,500
Like now grass is way cooler than
astroturf. ASTROTURF looks cheesy.

203
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,480
But in the late seventies, early
eighties, astroturf was the shit.

204
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,850
You know, the whole infant field was
astroturf except around the bags. And uh,

205
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,850
it just seemed like a faster game.
They were playing, hit and run.

206
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,200
Guy Gets on first,

207
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:42,040
you bought them over to second stealing
bases and over in the American league it

208
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:42,940
was all about,
you know,

209
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:47,830
people just standing there trying to
smash the ball over the fence at back then

210
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:52,330
home run hitters would, would hit
like fucking two 78 if you hit to 80,

211
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,510
that was considered like a,
you know, you were a solid guy.

212
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,073
MMM.

213
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,160
I don't know,
maybe you are now,

214
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:02,340
but like they just didn't put
up the numbers the way they,

215
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,660
they did during the roid error action,
obviously I should say.

216
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,360
So anyways, I'm sitting there and
I'm in and I'm like, oh, pirates,

217
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:12,870
pirates and cardinals. This is
like the old days, you know,

218
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,640
and uh,

219
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,720
I'm looking in the crowd and it seems
like everybody's wearing a pirate ship.

220
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,290
And I'm just like, and the place looks
like it's sold out. And I'm like,

221
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,190
wait a minute, the pirates are
selling out a game and I'm like,

222
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:34,820
this must be a cardinals home game.
And I look at their jerseys.

223
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:37,820
What was weird was there, they're
away. Jersey said cardinals.

224
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:41,670
So then that made me feel like it was a
home game cause I thought unless I saw

225
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:44,080
it the wrong way,
right.

226
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,000
I misremembered it as politicians say,

227
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,500
but I was under the impression that uh,
uh,

228
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,610
way baseball teams,
when you're home you have the navy,

229
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:57,950
a team like the red sox and you go
on the way it says Boston, you know,

230
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,340
you ride home, it says the Indians,
you go on the road, it says Cleveland.

231
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,690
So I guess you know,

232
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:05,330
people who don't know shit about
baseball know what city you're from.

233
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,000
I have no idea. Uh, but anyways,

234
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:11,210
it turned out that it was a pirate told
game and it looked like it was sold out.

235
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,990
So, uh, oh, that makes me
excited. But haven't they,

236
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,330
they've been doing that the
last couple of years. You don't,

237
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,250
my fandom of the pirates is from fucking,
you know,

238
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,070
just watch a baseball
in the late seventies.

239
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:28,820
And that we are family team was
like one of my favorites at, uh,

240
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,790
I rooted against the Orioles because
the Orioles kicked the red sox ass in

241
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,420
[inaudible] 79 with their
unbelievable pitching staff.

242
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,473
MMM.

243
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,880
I would always root for the national
league teams I guess because it was

244
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,220
actually, it was really exciting to
see them play because they didn't have,

245
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,433
uh,

246
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,220
there was no MLB package is like if you
lived in Boston, you got was the red sox

247
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,580
game and then they would have
the, uh, the game of the week.

248
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,700
And uh,

249
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,060
if you miss that, then you watch
Mel Allen's this weekend baseball,

250
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,270
which was the shit you said.
Come on Saturday. Yeah, the
nudes and it was bent. Dun,

251
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,630
Dun,
Dun Bat,

252
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,450
Bat, Bat, bat.

253
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,960
If the gun, then he came,

254
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,750
you'd come on wherever the fuck
he would say. That was the,

255
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,080
that was supposed to be the exciting
theme song that started the show.

256
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,990
And then they ended the show
was something a little, uh,

257
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,380
not uptempo to just let you know it was
a beautiful game and they would just

258
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,930
show it in slow motion and the sun,

259
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,900
Duh,
Duh,

260
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh.

261
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,760
[inaudible]

262
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,290
de de, De, De, De, De, De, De,
De, De, De, De, de, De, de.

263
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,740
Fucking people just do what all this
amazing shit and like slow motion.

264
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,580
And it was amazing about that song is,
that's probably a 40 person orchestra.

265
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,300
All right? There was no auto
tune. There was no drum machine.

266
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:02,080
There was no fucking one guy on a giant
keyboard that can make all those songs.

267
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:06,830
It was like 40 people getting
paid, um, all working together,

268
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,180
pointing it. Yeah. Other afterwards and
going out and having a couple of Schlitz.

269
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,420
Okay.

270
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,253
MMM.

271
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,280
So anyways, um, fuck am
I talking about here?

272
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,780
Yeah. So I started watching
baseball again. I haven't
started watching baseball.

273
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,060
Who's kidding who? But, um,

274
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,360
I was psyched to see that the pirates
server now first place and I'm actually

275
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,190
happy for the Dodgers.
Believe it or not,

276
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,500
I have a tough time with
the Dodgers because I was a
huge fan of them when I was

277
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:43,501
a kid because of the 77 and 78
world series when they played the,

278
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:44,381
uh,

279
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:47,560
the New York Yankees because I hated the
Yankees and we can never beat him back

280
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,370
then. Um, so I would root
for the, for the Dodgers.

281
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:55,510
And I remember feeling bad
for Tommy John Because, uh,

282
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,810
he lost in [inaudible] 77 or 78
with the Dodgers and then an 81,

283
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,440
he went to the Yankees,
which was unforgivable to me.

284
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,370
And then the Yankees played the Dodgers
again in the world series and then the

285
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:14,030
Dodgers finally won. The guy went,
oh, for fucking three poor bastard.

286
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,790
And he had an operation named after him.

287
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,893
MMM.

288
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,610
Him had Lou Gehrig. No one
was an operation. Yellen
was a disease. They Bell,

289
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,410
why don't you shut the fuck
up? All right, I will let,

290
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,630
let me read you a little bit of
advertising here. And then we'll get back.

291
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,550
When I come back.
I'm going to tease you a little here,

292
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:32,910
people you gotta to talk about
that whole a rod situation.

293
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,973
Uh,

294
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,710
here we go. All right. Dollar Shave Club.

295
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:41,700
Everybody been talking about this for the
last couple of weeks and I got to tell

296
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:42,481
you a lot time ago,

297
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:45,840
I used to do a bit about this in my
act about why do they act like those

298
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:50,670
disposable razors or some sort of gold
bullion? Why are they locked behind that?

299
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,120
The, the, the, that plastic glass.

300
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,690
Why do they act like it's,
it's this amazing thing.

301
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,740
It's a little hunk of crap that
shouldn't cost more than a buck,

302
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,750
right? Say we go, I did that, right?

303
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,240
But like seven, eight years ago, see what
I did was, I just did a joke about it.

304
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,100
These geniuses actually
did something about it.

305
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,420
Started a company here and they're
probably making a zillion dollars.

306
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:21,410
And you know what I say? I say
good for them. I say good for them.

307
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:24,020
Dollar Shave club, everybody. Um,

308
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,060
it's a cool brand and they send you
these quality razors right to your door

309
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,720
every month. You don't have to think
about it. You don't have to wait in line.

310
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,560
Get someone to unlock them from a cage
and pay way too much money for a bunch of

311
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:40,100
features that don't even fit your old
handle. Shaving has become such a mess.

312
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,460
But now with dollar shave
club, all right, saves me time.

It saves me money and the
raises are fantastic and I can,

sending those things right to my house.

315
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,180

316

I have an awful cvs right
down the street with,

317
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,730

346
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,180
All right. That was painless. I only had
one screw up there. You liked that people?

347
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,390
I think I finally got my game
together with reading these, uh,

348
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,860
these advertisements. You know,
you don't, I am. I'm like a,

349
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:53,500
a number one draft pick bust when it
comes to that shit. I'm not quite a bus,

350
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,670
but no, about five, six years in
the original team I was on, uh,

351
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,990
drop me down to number three on the
depth chat and now I got traded and I'm

352
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,090
pulling back up over and
fucking in Minnesota.

353
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,220
But the first two went down and now
getting in. All right, is this, this?

354
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,130
Now skip Bayless.

355
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:13,510
He's yelling about me saying that he
doesn't think that I can actually read

356
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:17,770
these fucking things without screwing it
up. While Steven A. Smith Goes, blasphemy.

357
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,250
Blasphemy. Uh, alright.
Hey Rod, everybody.

358
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,160
It's my thing about this son of a bitch.

359
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,910
This guy gets a lifetime ban and
that somehow voids his contract.

360
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,950
The Yankees are somehow able to get out
of that contract. I swear to fucking God.

361
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,320
You might as well just have the
commissioner of baseball minus, well,

362
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:46,720
just be Steinbrenner's son.

363
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,153
Okay.

364
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,410
How much shit can the Yankees fucking
get away with? Do you remember?

365
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,940
The red sox wanted to get a rug.
We had the deal in place.

366
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,850
It baseball came in and was like, no,
we had the deal was done at baseball,

367
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,100
came in and said, no,
that's bad for baseball.

368
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,330
It's bad for baseball to have
yet another big time free agent.

369
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,340
Go to the red sox because that's what
we were becoming the Yankees. Right.

370
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,993
And then

371
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,580
a rod goes to the Yankees,

372
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,080
some health that wasn't bad for
baseball to have two of the three best

373
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:24,900
shortstops in the league at
the time on the same team.

374
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,120
One of them never to play shortstop again,

375
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,810
to have to learn a new position
at third base. If you remember,

376
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,430
this is pre steroids and all that.

377
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:36,030
So some of these names don't hold
the weight they did back in the day,

378
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:41,031
but they're infield was
[inaudible] Jeter and a rod.

379
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,210
And then there was talks that
maybe they were going to sign,

380
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:48,660
no mar to play second place, second
base. I remember Jambi be like, dude,

381
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:52,890
he was like, dude, that would be
awesome. I just remember thinking like,

382
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,470
how would that be awesome? What, where's
the fucking fun in that? So what, anyways,

383
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,030
we try to get a Rod.
It's bad for baseball.

384
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,350
The Yankees do it and they already had
like fucking every goddamn free agent in

385
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:08,700
the league at every position other than
they are for fucking five core guys from

386
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:12,810
their own, uh, uh, a farm team.

387
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,700
And somehow that was okay.

388
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,933
All right.

389
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,360
And that was just a,
an ongoing story in baseball.

390
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:24,800
It was the red sox just never just,
we couldn't win.

391
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,750
No matter what we did,
it blew up in our face.

392
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:29,360
And even when we made
moves and got a big guy,

393
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,890
it was considered bad for baseball.

394
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:35,480
You go back to the 70s we had rollie
fingers signed him bad for baseball,

395
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,070
you know, Yank that out.
Reggie Jackson, can you,

396
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:41,320
can we can the fucking Yankee
sign him apps a fucking Luke Lee.

397
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,190
I don't know what, I don't
know what, what, what our
pens look. But for some reason

398
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,800
they were bad for baseball.
So anyways,

399
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:53,440
for once after 86 years of flailing,
you know the deal,

400
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,620
somehow it worked in our favor.
So I have thoroughly enjoyed,

401
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,950
okay.

402
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,950
Watching a rod flame out and in and
watching the Yankees trying to get out of

403
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:10,821
that contract and just not being able
to get this $200 million albatross off

404
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:16,680
from around their neck.
I thoroughly fucking enjoyed it.

405
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,340
They try to humiliate them.
They've tea,

406
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,370
they benched him during crucial moments
and like the playoffs and a rod doesn't

407
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:26,790
give a fuck. He just sits there like
a fucking robot going, well you know,

408
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,820
whatever's good for with tape, I
don't go to shit. You know, just,

409
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,360
just keep paying me. I don't give a
fuck. And I completely enjoyed it. Ed,

410
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,030
they still have another five years

411
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,630
of this nightmare. Five
years, like $114 million.

412
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,450
They got to give this,
this matinee idol look in bust.

413
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,420
And I have completely
enjoyed every second of it.

414
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,820
And um, in my world is like,
I got another five years.

415
00:24:56,821 --> 00:25:00,020
So just sorta, you know, I like,
I watch a ton of baseball anymore,

416
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,140
which is kind of sad. Uh, I gotta get
back into it. Everybody, but I can't,

417
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,400
I can't get back into it at
the, the, the upper levels.

418
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,060
I just can't, I can't watch
these fucking, you know,

419
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,550
juggernaut teams. I, I gotta, I gotta I
gotta be watching Kansas City, you know,

420
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,880
the Padres, the pirates, even though
the pirates in the first place,

421
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:22,470
but I don't think they have
any major leaks. Science.

422
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,630
I'm in major free agent signing.
But anyways,

423
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,630
so I thought I had another five
years of this show to watch

424
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,470
and now all of a sudden I'm worried
that it's going to get canceled.

425
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:36,180
I'll tell you right now, if,
because of this suspension,

426
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:40,980
the Yankees are somehow able to get out
of this contract and saved themselves

427
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:44,340
$114 million, which you sit down,
but it's just a drop in the bucket.

428
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,090
The way they ass rape their fans.
Every home game,

429
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,520
they way they take every one of those
poor Yankee fans with their pin stripe

430
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:58,140
shirts and they're classic Yankee hats
and they just bend them over the hot dog

431
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:02,820
stand and just stick that pin stripe
Dick Right up their ass. No loop.

432
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,931
You know,

433
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:08,850
I really feel bad for the total
fucking ass raping that every,

434
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,610
every Yankee fan takes when
you go to the ballpark. I mean,

435
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:19,330
if I was a Yankee Fan, I would
not go to that new fucking, uh,

436
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,640
beautiful baseball stadium
slash growing up gaudy house.

437
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,200
It's such a weird stadium. If you haven't
been to it, you should definitely go.

438
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,800
Uh,
but I,

439
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:34,200
I suggest eating a Thanksgiving dinner
before you go there or you know,

440
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,340
one of your kids will not
be going to college. Um,

441
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,400
but you go to that stadium is
such a weird stadium where like,

442
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,980
there's literally some breathtaking

443
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,870
views as you walk around that park
and every time you like, oh my God,

444
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,630
this is amazing. They really did it
right. Then they'll just have, you know,

445
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:55,680
some jackass like
just some,

446
00:26:55,681 --> 00:27:00,650
some fucking look how much money we got.
Just you don't know it is it,

447
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,160
it's Kinda like this blend of,
um,

448
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,650
I dunno. Like what, what's a great
ballpark that they built that that's new,

449
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,270
but it's all, I guess maybe the
Jake when it first came out,

450
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,040
it's kind of the perfect,
it's a blend of, of uh,

451
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,750
the beautiful new ones.

452
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,260
They conjure up the old shit and like
Dallas Cowboys stadium where if you never

453
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,370
been to that,
you got to go to that one just once.

454
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:35,371
Just to see that absolutely fucking that
I saw of a television that they have

455
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:38,680
hanging up there. It's the dumbest
thing I've ever seen in my life.

456
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,080
I swear to God when I go to that stadium,

457
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,010
I always think if Bobby Kelly
designed a football stadium,

458
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,510
this is exactly what it looked like.

459
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,960
Yeah. Look, I think the TV is,
I don't have to go anyway, dude.

460
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,310
I just sit here and watch it.

461
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,003
MMM.

462
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,070
Dallas Cowboy stadium is an
absolute fucking abomination.

463
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,940
And uh,
and it's just because of that TV.

464
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,630
Everything else is actually,
it's beautiful.

465
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,530
If you could just get that fucking TV,
that TV,

466
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:16,430
it's like a drunk at a holiday. Family
gatherings, you know what I mean?

467
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,120
No matter how good the food is,
not how great it is to see everybody,

468
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,340
all conversation, everything is
drowned out by the fucking, the,

469
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,200
that guy over there, you know, your
uncle who keeps dabbling in the oxy,

470
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:32,330
he's telling you that he's
clean, but he is it, you know,

471
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:36,260
that's what that fucking TV's like.
So anyways,

472
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,150
the hell am I saying here

473
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,640
as a fan of sports and my
hatred of the New York Yankees,

474
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,200
I'm really hoping

475
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,700
that the Yankees feel like,
oh, maybe we can get out of it.

476
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:53,980
Maybe we can get out of it.
And then they still can't.

477
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,940
Knowing full well that in the long run
it's not going to mean shit to them.

478
00:28:57,941 --> 00:28:59,890
$100 million doesn't mean shit to them.

479
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,660
It's just annoying and that's basically
all I can really hope for at this point.

480
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,710
So, um, maybe I'll write some letters,

481
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,920
I'll write some letters to
the commissioner of baseball,

482
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:16,300
tell them that I'm dying or something
and that my bucket like bucket list or

483
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:19,700
something. So something has to do with
a rod. I just really want that, that

484
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,200
I just want to be able to talk to him
sometime while he's on the field. That's,

485
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,810
that's my make a wish thing. I want to
look into those Zombie robotic guys.

486
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,150
Uh,

487
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,950
I like how he's actually pissed now says
that he's being singled out. It's like,

488
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:39,520
well you kind of made yourself a target
with the steroids for the second time.

489
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:42,160
You fucking jerk off.
He really

490
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
is like a,

491
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,850
he has an inability to,

492
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:52,851
to step outside of self and see how
he's coming off and absolute jackass.

493
00:29:53,311 --> 00:29:57,310
And I can't think of a
better person to beat,

494
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:00,900
to be wearing the pin stripes
and represent what that
organization is all about.

495
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,590
They're clean shaven,
steroid abusers,

496
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,040
unlike the Red Sox who,
uh,

497
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,250
I don't know what we look like.
We,

498
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,160
we look like we'll go into an
Allman brothers concert. Uh,

499
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,320
I'm just trying to get Yankee
fans all day. Use Boyd too.

500
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,250
All right, let's, let's plow
ahead here. Have you buddy? Um,

501
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,950
they held it out. You've got to
talk about something. Yeah, I was,

502
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:34,200
I going to bring up the, Oh, let's move
on to this. Let's just keep the, uh,

503
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,530
the sport thing going here. Oh, no,
no, no. I remember what it is I owe.

504
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:42,630
I owe an apology.
This wasn't my fault,

505
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:47,010
but I have to apologize on behalf of
the theater that El Paso show got a

506
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,560
rescheduled,
as I mentioned,

507
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,200
because of the active work I
got down here in New Orleans,

508
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:55,910
I was only able to do the first two
dates of the red state tour. Um,

509
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,590
none of the shows are canceled.
They've all been rescheduled.

510
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,600
I know it's a pain in the ass. I know
people make plans. I apologize. Um,

511
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,200
I announced it here on,
on

512
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,423
MMM.

513
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,630
On the podcast. I, di I, you know,

514
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,890
I dunno what the fuck else I could have
done to let people know, go to hell.

515
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,390
I guess the theater out there in El Paso,
I don't know what happened,

516
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:23,290
but some people didn't get the word that
the show was canceled and I guess, uh,

517
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,850
there was some people that
showed up. So, uh, I apologize.

518
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,250
I hope you're listening to this.

519
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,100
I will try to tweet about it
and maybe you'll be able to get,

520
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,410
I don't know if you follow
me on Twitter or not,

521
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,250
but to let you know the,
uh,

522
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,180
the new date of the El Paso
date is September 13th.

523
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,990
All right. I'm sorry. September
12th. September 12th is the new date.

524
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,870
And uh,

525
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,870
I apologize to anybody who showed up.

526
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:56,510
I can't believe what a pain in the
ass that is. I hope nobody drove.

527
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,150
Yeah,

528
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,550
Jesus, someone's going to be like,
dude, I drove four fucking hours,

529
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:04,310
or I had a plane ticket or something
like that. So I feel horrible about it.

530
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,410
So because of that, I'm just going to
announce my dates right here. Right now.

531
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:14,030
I'm just going to read through a bunch
of these as quickly as I can. So,

532
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:17,720
uh, there's no more confusion. All right?

533
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,080
And then somehow there's still will be
confusion and then somehow someone's

534
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:24,470
going to get mad at me and I'll get
a fucking angry email or whatever.

535
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:28,250
I apologize for the clicking here people
see if I can bring this up with this

536

shows I have coming up. Uh,

538
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,450
and I'm going to read the ones that
don't even have ticket links. All right.

00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,340

606
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,550

607
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,570

610
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,630
And here's two shows that
people don't know about.

611
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,380
December 5th eighth I'm going to be at,

612
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,440
at Harper Silverberg Hall in Reykjavik,

613
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,910
Iceland. Hope I'm saying that right. Never
been to Iceland. I'm really excited. Ed.

614
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,840
The biggest teaser of a mall.
You know,

615
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:39,380
I don't work new years cause I
go to the rose bowl every year.

616
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:42,320
When I finally decided this year,
well, I live in Los Angeles.

617
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,970
Why don't I do a big show in Los Angeles?
And why don't I put my buddies,

618
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,070
the Rosebowl legends,

619
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,223
uh,

620
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,920
fucking Joe bought nick and Jason Law had,

621
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:58,520
we're all do a show the
night before New Year's Eve.

622
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:01,220
If you don't have New Year's Eve
plans and you live in Los Angeles,

623
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,910
we're going to be at the Wiltern
theater right down there. Ron.

624
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:07,250
Now we'll chef Wilshire and western.

625
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,120
So tickets are not on sale for
that one yet. So there you go. Now,

626
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:16,121
you know as much as I do about my schedule
and once against sincerest apologies

627
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:17,444
to anybody,

628
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,680
any of the poor bastards that
showed up for my shelf and El Paso.

629
00:38:21,681 --> 00:38:25,330
That was not to be, I don't
know how that happened. Uh,

630
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:31,280
so there you go. All right, back to the
effect of the, uh, the podcast here.

631
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,980
Everybody. So as mentioned,
I'm down here in New Orleans.

632
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,890
I've been making fun of the food, but, uh,

633
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,060
I've been having the best time
in New Orleans as they say,

634
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:44,170
if you can't have a good time down here,
there's something wrong with you. And, uh,

635
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,900
I went out the other night,

636
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:49,750
I guess they shoot a lot of movies
down here because it's really cheap.

637
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,090
He gave him a great deal or whatever.

638
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:55,480
And I had a buddy of mine who was
shooting something else and he had just

639
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:58,330
wrapped and he called me out.
We went off,

640
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,450
met up at this hotel
and uh,

641
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,790
just so you know what I, I'll
actually, I usually don't name a name,

642
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,090
but this will hype is movie.
It was Craig Robinson who still,

643
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,810
when they just wrapped on a hot
tub time machine part too. And uh,

644
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,970
Craig, just one, just one of
those guys who's just, I dunno,

645
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,660
unbelievably charismatic. Like I
watched, I was watching that guy,

646
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:26,200
that guy was having more goddamn fun in
one night that I think I've ever had in

647
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:29,440
my life. You know, just ease.

648
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,110
There was a live band playing. He
went up, he played piano, you know,

649
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,100
singing and making everybody laugh.

650
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,530
And then he fucking called
me up to go do some standup.

651
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,580
I of course was defensive, turned the
crowd off and then I got offstage.

652
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,210
But later on that night
when the band had left, uh,

653
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,590
he went back up,

654
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,400
started playing piano and I went up
there and played some drums full of,

655
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,700
I swear to go for like 45
minutes or like an hour and a,

656
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,050
it's probably the most fun I think
I've had in a long, long time.

657
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:09,550
And I was stone sober, didn't
have a drop alcohol, you know,

658
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,500
whenever I have an acting Gig,

659
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:14,770
I tried to lay off the booze and Mike
fucking giant head doesn't seem even

660
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:19,600
bigger. No one wants to see that on the
screen. So, um, I've been doing that,

661
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:24,040
walking around, checking out the
city, avoiding, what do you call it?

662
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,620
At Bourbon Street, you know, I that just,

663
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,970
I just don't like the date rapey
sort of vibe on that street. So, uh,

664
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,730
there is a laundromat that is on that,
so it's kind of funny.

665
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,260
I've been doing my laundry down that way.

666
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,920
It just walking on that street
like in broad day light after,

667
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,410
you know, show your tits or whatever
the fuck happened the night before.

668
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,000
It's just a,

669
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,200
if you ever walk by a
strip club during the day,

670
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,060
it's just really just, it's
just not a good look. It's just,

671
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,660
I dunno what about it is at nighttime
when you see those purple neon light bulbs

672
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,550
and you're half in the bag or something,

673
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,470
it actually looks like
something appealing,

674
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:09,190
but when you just see it in broad
daylight, it's fucking brutal.

675
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,620
So anyways,
uh,

676
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,040
I've actually been getting into like,
you know,

677
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,800
they've been talking about Lsu
football down here in the saints,

678
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:22,360
like every single day they're getting
so fucking amped up for football. Um,

679
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,350
I'm actually caught up in this
excitement down here and uh,

680
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,480
I saw that the saints have a preseason
game Friday night and if you think I'm

681
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:34,010
not going well,
if I have

682
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,880
to work that night, obviously I'm
not going, but if I don't have to,

683
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:37,820
there's no fuck away.

684
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:41,180
I'm not going because the super
dome now that they redid it,

685
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:45,290
it was already iconic. It's your OT is
self to come down here and go to a game.

686
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:49,460
It's, it's uh, it's beautiful. Which
brings me to their basketball team.

687
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,630
I don't know if you guys know this,

688
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:55,631
but the New Orleans Hornets or
no more than now called the,

689
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,180
uh,
New Orleans Pelicans.

690
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,533
Okay.

691
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,650
Just going to pause and let you take
that in for a second. It's called,

692
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:05,940
they're called the Pelicans,

693
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,430
which is arguably the worst fucking
name of any God damn sports team.

694
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,540
I, I'm going to motion, I'm
going to make a suggestion here.

695
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,780
Any new team at this point,

696
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:26,580
do not name your team after an animal
because evidently there's no good ones

697
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:27,414
left.

698
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,800
There's 122 fucking teams and
I think just all the good,

699
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,730
ferocious ones are taken unless you
just want to go obscure and just start

700
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,951
picking like names of like
poisonous snakes and fucked
up animals from different

701
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:46,980
countries, which I dunno, why would
you, why would you do that? You know,

702
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:52,500
the New Orleans tie pants, you know,
you wouldn't do that shift the Pelicans.

703
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,560
So I looked up their logo and I'm like,

704
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:59,910
if they made like a basketball net out
of that bird's fucking double chin,

705
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,793
uh,

706
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,800
I dunno what I was going to do,
but I looked it up.

707
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:09,990
And you know what they did conveniently
as they got rid of its double chin?

708
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:13,590
Like it had like a facelift.
So what I think they should do now,

709
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,700
if they're going to go like that,

710
00:43:14,701 --> 00:43:19,701
if they're gonna sell horribly
misrepresent that Bert not have it's giant

711
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:24,660
fucking double Chin and somehow
have this streamline chin, you know,

712
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:30,120
uh, I, I think they should just, they
should just put those fucking, you know,

713
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:33,190
those lips, those plastic surgery
lips that you GAF fuck. I am,

714
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,480
I might even be remotely fucking
funny on this Goddamn podcasts.

715
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,990
Such a fucking handicap.
I can't hear myself right now.

716
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,940
I don't have my microphone. It's
like my Kryptonite. Whatever.

717
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,270
Make the fucking thing looked like
a Kardashian. Kardashians, mom.

718
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm actually, you know
what? It's such a fucking,

719
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,560
you know what I don't like about it?
Date, they tried to make it look cool.

720
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,640
It's like if you're going to be
the Pelicans, just embrace it.

721
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,170
And what you have to have is do,

722
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:08,940
do the cartoony version of the Pelican
right where it's got a cigar in his mouth

723
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:12,450
and it's giving you the thumbs up
with it's fucking wing. You know,

724
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,840
he's got a fucking beer in one hand
or something. That's the guards.

725
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:18,900
It's just a Hawaiian shirt.
If you're going to be the Pelicans,

726
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:23,520
she got to do that. Stop trying to make
that bird look cool. It's not cool.

727
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,840
Is this iron been fucking rock
and like death the entire time?

728
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,190
It's not fucking cool.

729
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,460
There's two logos that really fucked up
the New Orleans Pelicans and then, uh,

730
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,010
the fucking Miami Dolphins
who never should have changed.

731
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,890
They shouldn't have changed their logo.
It had been,

732
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,380
it was always a kind of a Douchey logo,

733
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,760
but had been around long enough and
they'd done so many legendary things that

734
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:53,450
you kind of like, you respected
it. I mean, when I saw that logo,

735
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:57,230
I thought about Don Shula. I thought
about Larry's Onca, Jim kick,

736
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,060
Bob Greasy, that whole era, Gary, oh,

737
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:06,290
your premium or the fuck,
his name is and I'm

738
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,790
Gary at Premiere and that's why
people used to go bald. You know,

739
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:14,960
like fucking Lou grant was a dump of
these chemicals on your head and having

740
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:18,530
that whisper of grass on top of your head

741
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,880
or I thought about Dan Marino.

742
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,310
Okay.

743
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,300
Mock duper Mark Clayton, all of that
shit. That's what I thought about.

744
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:32,320
And uh, for some fucking reason
they decided to change it,

745
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:34,540
which I think is a desperate
move at this point.

746
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,070
They're trying to make more money because
now everybody has to go out and buy

747
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,940
the new logo is never better.
Look at the New England patriots.

748
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:45,910
I think we have to like the ugliest
fucking uniforms in the league,

749
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,900
that awful silver with that,
you know, whatever they call it.

750
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:53,900
The Flying Elvis on
the side. I hate it. I,

751
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,090
I've never bought.

752
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,160
Okay.

753
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,610
Wow. I just realized that I've never
bought anything with that logo on it.

754
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:01,900
Never bought a jersey or anything.

755
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,500
I've hated it from way back when
drew Bledsoe first came and it was,

756
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,480
it was more sky blue as opposed to
the darker blue with that silver.

757
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:14,570
I always just thought it was
horrifically fucking ugly. Um,

758
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,720
but the dolphins new logo, you know
what the logo basically looks like.

759
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,340
Do you know like when a
corporation accidentally
spills like nuclear waste into

760
00:46:24,341 --> 00:46:25,270
the water supply.

761
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:28,030
So then they changed their name and
they try to come up with like a,

762
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,320
like a logo that makes it seem like
they give a shit about the environment.

763
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,150
Like BP did,
you know BP went from this

764
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,860
logo that looked like they drilled
oil out of the fucking ground,

765
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:46,320
like what they did and then sprayed
it on baby birds and fucking sweatshop

766
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,750
children. Now they got that
one. It's all green and yellow.

767
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,590
Like you don't know if they plant corn
or it just looks like grass and sunshine.

768
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,570
That's what I feel like
the new dolphins have done.

769
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,790
Is that what you feel like bill,
Bill,

770
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,410
considering you're not
that funny this week,

771
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:00,850
why don't you just read
some of the letters,

772
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,910
said a continuing to just
flail as you're riffing. Um,

773
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,000
all right, I'll get onto it.
All right. Here's the first one.

774
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:14,830
Facial scare bill, a few notes. Uh,

775
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,090
you know what?
I'm just fucking up this week.

776
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:18,970
I got to read these
last two advertisements.

777
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:21,670
I can't read them to link to the podcast
because for some reason they think he

778
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,900
think that you guys just shut these things
off. Uh, all right, Hulu plus everybody.

779
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,160
I'm sure you've tried hulu.com
if you haven't you. But

780
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,010
uh, but if you've already tried hulu.com
I want to tell you about Hulu Plus Hulu

781
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,780
plus lets you watch thousands
of hit shows anytime,

782
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:42,280

the go with your smartphone or tablet.

783
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,120
Why stand in line or ride a train
and just stare at your feet.

784
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,510
You could be watching your favorite
shows on Hulu plus who the pluses,

785
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,180
a great way to binge
watch your favorite shows.

786
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,540
I'm going to use Hulu plus to catch up
on all the old family guy episodes I

787
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,800
missed when I was on the road.

788
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,210
I guess I'm always supposed to put it in
the show that I really want to watch a

789
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,980
person of interest. I
think I'll do that. Um,

790
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,090
didn't see my episode of new girl that's
on Hulu plus two and if I ever decide

791
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,640
to watch lost,
which I won't,

792
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,290

803
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,740
All right,
I'm reading very well this week everybody.

804
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,640
I'm going to pat myself on the back,
uh, and put a little pressure here.

805
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,510
I Bet I can go through this whole one
without screwing up once. All right,

806
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,160
here we go. Legal Zoom. Most
Americans don't have a will,

807
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,293
but why?

808
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,930
You don't want government rules dictating
what happens to your property and

809
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,180
minor children.
So why procrastinate?

810
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,380
Most people say it's too expensive
or too time consuming. My answer

811
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:25,050
it is legal zoom.com too expensive.
You're going to love legal zooms,

812
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:27,210
reasonable prices, too. Time consuming.

813
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:31,770
Most people finish the online process
and just 20 minutes and we're not talking

814
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,270
some fill in the blank form.

815
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,770

829
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,460
There you go.
Dammit.

830
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,600
I went 14 and two in the regular season
and I just blew the first playoff game.

831
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,590
That's what I just did there.

832
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,920
I pulled the Peyton manning.
Um,

833
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,350
okay.

834
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,620
All right.
Where the hell am I here?

835
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,700
All right.
Facial skin.

836
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:50,923
Where the fuck is it?

837
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,111
All right,
Bill,

838
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:56,920
this past weekend I went to Vegas to
visit my brother and his buddy who

839
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,030
currently reside there.

840
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,240
They actually caught your most recent
show in Vegas and had a phenomenal time.

841
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,320
Oh, that's awesome. Thank you.

842
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,370
Said I left last Thursday from Tampa
and I soon I touched down in Vegas.

843
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,600
I just received an out of nowhere
texts from the girl that got away.

844
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,590
I was shook this broad, used to live in
Tampa about two and a half years ago,

845
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:17,530
but she moved out to La to
pursue her careers and actress.

846
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,550
The two of us attended the University
of Tampa a few years ago and had an on

847
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:23,980
again off again relationship.
Long story short,

848
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,840
I was in a relationship with another girl.

849
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,610
We went on break and I met this
girl and was hooked. So anyways,

850
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,490
her tech said, hey, where
are you going to Vegas with?

851
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:36,430
Because I'm going to be
there this weekend to uh,

852
00:51:36,431 --> 00:51:39,820
my guess is that she had seen
my social media. She had been,

853
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,670
my guess is that she had seen on my social
media that I was going to be in Vegas.

854
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,080
What I read the text.

855
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:50,710
I was very surprised and pretty pumped
because we hadn't talked in a long time

856
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,720
and like I said,
she was the one that got away.

857
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,890
She's absolutely gorgeous and she also
happens to be a really good person as

858
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:59,560
well. Jesus Christ. People
what could go wrong here?

859
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,820
We hooked up in Vegas and it was
amazing to see her. We all went out,

860
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,760
did our thing and had one of the
best weekends I've had in my life.

861
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,540
I give you more details, but you know
what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

862
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,460
All right.
You gave her the old Meat Hammer.

863
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,690
Wait, it be subtle. Anyways,

864
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,610
the reason why I'm writing to you
though is because on the plane,

865
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,260
right back to Tampa,

866
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:25,770
I was thinking about mine and this girl's
relationship and all of our history

867
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:30,720
and a pretty comical slash genius
story came to mind about her.

868
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,730
I know this is getting long,

869
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:35,670
but I hope it's not as long and boring
as that guide running to explain the

870
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:40,650
fucking origins of Jimmy's a couple of
weeks ago. Jesus Christ. Uh, but anyways,

871
00:52:40,651 --> 00:52:42,240
like I said,
when I first met her,

872
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,080
I was immediately attracted to her natural
beauty, beauty, and her personality.

873
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:49,170
She's one of these ladies who didn't have
to wear makeup or do anything special

874
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:52,270
to look sexy. However, one of
the first weekends we spend vent

875
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,700
together,
I wake up with her in bed.

876
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:57,880
One morning I go to give
her a kiss and I am,

877
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:03,210
I am immediately troubled the way the
morning sun was shining into the window on

878
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:07,510
her face, expose something. I wasn't
ready for that. Early in the morning,

879
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:13,350
this broad has dark hair and for the first
time I noticed she had some dark hair

880
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:17,560
above her lip.
I was really surprised.

881
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,620
I didn't catch it before, but it
wasn't a thick mustache or anything.

882
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,850
It was just like the peach fuzz. A 12
year old boy has before he starts shaving.

883
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,330
Regardless,
I was taking,

884
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,070
I was taken back and from that morning
and from that point on that morning,

885
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,000
it was all I could notice.
Jesus,

886
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,700
isn't it crazy how visual guys are?

887
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,313
That's it.

888
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,580
Take the most beautiful woman
in the world. You put it,
give a mustache. We can't.

889
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,420
That's all we can say. It's like I'm
kissing fucking Burt Reynolds here.

890
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:53,430
All right, so when I went home,
I had to devise a master plan,

891
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,410
operation mustache removal.

892
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,910
I liked this girl way too much and
she was still very hot with the,

893
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,310
even with the stash,

894
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:06,120
but I needed a way to get rid of it
because I wanted to help her out.

895
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,300
Also helping myself. All right. Now
this is why I picked this one here.

896
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,990
Listen to this guy.
He's got a gorgeous fucking woman.

897
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,940
Everything about her is perfect except
she has a fucking mustache. Now.

898
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:22,450
How the hell do you bring it up
to somebody that you care about,

899
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,600
that they have a mustache and
his fucking turning you off.

900
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,060
There's no way to do that without
sabotaging the relationship or are really

901
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:32,020
hurting the other person.

902
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,080
The only way to do that is if you just
completely don't give a shit about the

903
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:39,040
other person. It just say, hey, you
know, if there's any way you could, uh,

904
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,323
you know,

905
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,610
I don't even know how to fucking say,
well,

906
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:47,540
this is what he did and this
was changes. He said, uh,

907
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,400
since we just started seeing each other,
I didn't want to come out and say, babe,

908
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:54,030
Babe, you shaved today. Seemed
a little self conscious.

909
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:57,480
Edit is so I didn't want to tell her
and embarrassed or anything like that.

910
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:01,290
I needed a way to remove this
stash without being involved.

911
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,770
Hence,
I did what needed to be done.

912
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,070
Listen to this fucking
brilliant conspiracy.

913
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,850
I call it my trustworthy buddy who was
playing hockey in Canada at the time and

914
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,760
told him I needed him
to do me a solid dude.

915
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,860
I filled him in on the situation and he
was willing to help me out since he had

916
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:22,200
a weird random Canadian
number at the time.

917
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,150
I gave him my chick's number and
told him to text her and simply say,

918
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,650
you have a mustache.

919
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:34,370
I ordered him to say nothing else and
not to respond under any circumstances.

920
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,110
He texted me back about 20 minutes
later and said, mission complete,

921
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,590
so this fucking lady,

922
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,580
just to get you caught up in case
you confused here with my reading,

923
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,930
she gets a random texts from a Canadian
number out of nowhere that just says,

924
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:55,040
you have a mustache.

925
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,420
I can't imagine your fucking
stomach must've dropped.
It's when he goes. Anyways,

926
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:02,721
he goes.

927
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:07,190
Later that night I met her at the bar
and she was looking extraordinarily sexy.

928
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,130
She seemed that she seemed to
have a little pep in her step.

929
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:14,690
I walked up to give her a kiss and I
looked above her lip and the peach fuzz

930
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:19,750
mustache was gone clean and
soft as a baby's bottom.

931
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,280
I was very happy how it played out.

932
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,590
I helped myself up because that would
have bothered me and I helped her become

933
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:31,510
even sexier, best part being. She had no
idea that I orchestrated that mission.

934
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,130
I didn't have to talk about it,

935
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,310
bring it to her attention and hurt
her feelings or anything like that.

936
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:40,720
I just had a broad with the cleanup or
lip thought I'd share, go fuck yourself,

937
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,490
dude. That is absolute genius. And
now I just got paranoid cause I said,

938
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:48,220
what's fucking school you
went to and all that shit.

939
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:49,690
I hope you don't get in trouble,
but if you,

940
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:53,920
somehow your woman is listening to this,
a guy does something like that.

941
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,200
Not because he's being a dick.
It's because he cares for you.

942
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,540
And uh,
we don't know how to,

943
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,130
we, we, we don't have those skills.

944
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,430
Okay.

945
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,570
How do you tell somebody that
there's no way to do it?

946
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,780
I think what he did was genius.
Nobody got fucking hurt.

947
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,160
You felt great about yourself.

948
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,700
He cared about you enough
sweetheart in case you're listening.

949
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:23,250
Then he came up with the plan that,
you know, if he put it in another area,

950
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,910
he could have like whacked JFK.
So there you go.

951
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,430
He came up with an enigma
wrapped up in a rental,

952
00:57:29,431 --> 00:57:33,900
however that fuck that goes and uh,
and you look even better.

953
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,770
I would hope somebody would
do that for me. All right,

954
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:42,810
girlfriend and fantasy league. Hey Belle,
love the podcast I'll put up. Thank you.

955
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,210
I've been in a fantasy
football league for 10 years.

956
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,980
It was started by one of my best friends
and has been the same 12 guys for a

957
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,030
decade. I don't even know
how bands have put, uh,

958
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,450
I don't even know bands that
have been together that long.

959
00:57:54,451 --> 00:57:58,410
So this year my buddy who started the
league decided to boot out to lifelong

960
00:57:58,411 --> 00:58:03,411
members in favor of his girlfriend and
the girlfriend of a friend of ours.

961
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,810
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

962
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,860
Did those other two guys who got booted,
did they do anything?

963
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,940
I mean,
if he was going to add the ladies,

964
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:19,710
why did those other
two guys have to leave?

965
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,930
Wow. All right. Okay, well I'm
sucked into this story. He said,

966
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,520
I immediately called bullshit and said
point blank to his face is she wasn't

967
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:33,940
sucking your Dick then she wouldn't
be in the league. Uh, dude,

968
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,860
that right there is a game changer. You
can't say what if he marries this woman?

969
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,890
Always. There's a, for you guys,

970
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:46,060
always be careful what you say
about the woman you're guy is with.

971
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:49,090
Cause you never fucking know.
You never know.

972
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,000
And I'm sure there's some listeners
that have stories and if you'd like to

973
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:55,270
contribute them to the
podcast where, uh, you know,

974
00:58:55,271 --> 00:59:00,250
it's even fucking worse is when
your buddy,

975
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,770
he says fucked up shit about the girl.

976
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,940
You know about what a horse she is in bed
and she's fucking brains out, but blah,

977
00:59:07,941 --> 00:59:10,080
blah, blah, blah, Blah
and tells you all these,

978
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:15,100
these details and then the jackass ends
up falling forward and then he has to

979
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,550
fucking break up with you because he's
not going to break up with her because

980
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:22,340
every time he looks at you,
he thinks out. You know,

981
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,400
he knows how this girl, my,
my future wife Sucks my Dick.

982
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:28,520
You know anyways,
plowing ahead.

983
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,040
Okay.

984
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,360
He's trying to defend this decision by
saying she at least knows a little about

985
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:37,180
sports,
so this is awful.

986
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,960
This guy wasn't raised right, man.
This is just, this is fucking terrible.

987
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,580
You said the fact of the matter is that
she is from New York and knows who the

988
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:50,930
jets are. That's the extent
of her football knowledge.
He thinks I'm overreacting,

989
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,160
not overreacting.

990
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,160
He didn't ask anybody else.

991
00:59:56,161 --> 01:00:01,140
You've had 12 for the last 10 years and
he just removed two of the original band

992
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:05,280
members
do.

993
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,050
This isn't even funny. This is,
this is really upsetting to me.

994
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,060
He thinks I'm overreacting, but I think
of it the same scenario. If you had,

995
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,230
if you have one night a year to have a
guy's night with your buddies and then

996
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,011
you get to the bar,

997
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:22,210
you see that your friend has invited
his girlfriend to guys night. Exactly.

998
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:26,140
Even told me that she,
she's the one who asked if she could join,

999
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:30,250
which obviously to me means he
had no intentions of inviting her,

1000
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,960
but when he was backed into the corner,

1001
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,010
his ball shot up into his throat
and he couldn't say no exactly.

1002
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,890
It's not just a fantasy league,

1003
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,490
but a clear indication that she's
going to slowly start chipping away at

1004
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:46,420
everything else in the rest of his life.
Exactly. In summation, is girlfriend

1005
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,860
wanted in and he crumbled and said,
yes. Am I reading too much into this?

1006
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,060
Am I overreacting?

1007
01:00:52,061 --> 01:00:55,150
I'd like to know because he's getting
pissed at me for being pissed at him.

1008
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:58,360
Absolutely not, sir. Everything
that I was going to tell you,

1009
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:03,340
you already know and you wrote in this
email. Okay? You ran down the mats,

1010
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,680
you went off the little
fucking springy board.

1011
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:07,600
Do you hit the fucking hobby horse?
You dead.

1012
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:11,170
Your little fucking Mary Lou lit
and flip and you stuck the landing.

1013
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:17,040
You get a perfect 10 on that one, sir. You
are 100% right. You know what you want.

1014
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,430
My move would be, I would start
my own fantasy league. All right?

1015
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,600
And I would invite everybody else
in that fucking league. Well,

1016
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:30,070
I wouldn't do that cause that's, that's
a chick move. Make people decide,

1017
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:32,700
okay,

1018
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,020
oh, this is what I, I wouldn't be as
harsh with him and just be like, no,

1019
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:38,390
do what you did was absolute bullshit.
And I guarantee you,

1020
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,330
I would tell him that she's going
to start chipping away at your life.

1021
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:46,010
You balls are up in your throat.
Um,

1022
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,940
but that's going to end your friendship
with them. But here's the deal, dude.

1023
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,110
There are other fantasy
football leagues to join.

1024
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,480
All right? And that, that's
one of those ugly things about

1025
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,260
that chapter of guys lives after college.

1026
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:07,641
You know,

1027
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:11,110
when you went to grade school together
or you met them and call up guys and

1028
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:13,940
college or whatever,
but you guys have this unbelievable bond,

1029
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:18,080
like you went to fucking war together.
Um,

1030
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,020
if one of your

1031
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,750
friends is a policy,

1032
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:25,860
you know,
he has a,

1033
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:30,640
he has a chance of meeting somebody who's
going to splinter that group. You know,

1034
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:31,990
and this isn't an anti woman thing,

1035
01:02:31,991 --> 01:02:35,020
this is more like an anti pussy
guy kind of thing where raw,

1036
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:41,230
you know there are controlling,
suffocating people on
both sides. Men and women.

1037
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,040
And I know that this women
listening and they've,

1038
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,680
one of their best girlfriend started
dating some fucking overbearing,

1039
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:52,600
insecure Douche bag guy and the first
thing they do is they cut them off from

1040
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,210
their friends and then it's the coworkers,

1041
01:02:55,211 --> 01:02:59,320
then the friends and then their family,
they stick them under a fucking

1042
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,920
little glass or something. So, uh, yeah,

1043
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:07,320
you know what dude?
Get up divorced.

1044
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:11,740
The sad thing is is you're going to
lose a couple of friends sometimes that

1045
01:03:11,741 --> 01:03:14,680
happens and a,
you just have to be content about it and

1046
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:16,891
you know,

1047
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:21,540
and I think it's really important for
men and women to have men only and women

1048
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:26,541
only social events that they can go to
once a week or a couple times a month and

1049
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:34,320
just hang out with the fellows or hang
out with the ladies. It just, whatever.

1050
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,330
I think it's really, really healthy. It's
gives you something to look forward to.

1051
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,740
It gives you a place where you
could just vent about your,

1052
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,010
anything you fucking want in,
in a group of people,

1053
01:03:47,011 --> 01:03:50,460
that 100% is going to understand and
you don't have to worry about hurting

1054
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:53,760
anybody's feelings or offending on
anybody. I think it's true. It's really,

1055
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:57,060
really fucking healthy.
And this guy's fucking with that.

1056
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,400
And uh, and he didn't put it to a vote.
What does he, the Grand Poobah this shit.

1057
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:04,643
Okay.

1058
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:07,210
I Dunno. There's so many ways you
can go with that. The spending,

1059
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,280
depending on how much you
want to stir up the pot,

1060
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:14,650
you guys should put it to the vault.
This would be great. Put it to a vote.

1061
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,650
Do we have this be like
you're Arab spring,

1062
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,970
but with a fantasy football league and
just felt that cunt out and then you

1063
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:26,680
become the dictator and you move into the
palace. How about debt? Whatever. Dude,

1064
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:31,060
you're 100% right. I would just, I would
choose my words a little more carefully.

1065
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:34,870
Um, don't say that he didn't
have the balls. Just say, listen,

1066
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:40,360
this was something that we did
together for 12 years and uh,

1067
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:46,610
I'm really disappointed and shocked that
you made this big a move and remove two

1068
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:50,620
other members and didn't
include anybody else in it.

1069
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,970
I don't think that it was done right and
I think we should put this to a vote.

1070
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,350
That's what we should do.
And if he gets mad and he starts yelling,

1071
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,191
don't lose your cool.

1072
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:04,390
Just keep stating your
opinion calmly and you know,

1073
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:06,490
if he's going to be a bitch about it,
let it be a bitch about it.

1074
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:08,770
And I would actually,
for your own health,

1075
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,350
does she all the things she knows
is the jet. She's going to be like,

1076
01:05:13,351 --> 01:05:17,070
wait a minute. Who is that? I have, I
got, I got, I don't know anything I had,

1077
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,040
she still tried to do that.

1078
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,860
You know that thing where women try to
act like they're dumb because they think

1079
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:25,590
it's cute. You know what I would do, sir?

1080
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:30,320
I would just put your losses
just fucking with, I don't know.

1081
01:05:30,321 --> 01:05:32,000
The more you think about it,
the more noisy I'm getting in.

1082
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:33,650
Just ruined my fucking day
and I'm not even in it.

1083
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,450
I didn't like fantasy football.
All right. Bank or cuts. All right,

1084
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:43,430
Billy boy. Uh, so have you heard about
these greedy cunts at Goldman Sachs?

1085
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,970
That was kind of a national story.
What do they do? Something else?

1086
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,500
You said they cornered a large share of
the market in aluminum and then bet it

1087
01:05:51,501 --> 01:05:56,420
on the futures of a lumen with the
price going up. Sounds illegal. It is.

1088
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:59,550
But of course those stupid fucking
cuts found a loophole in the law.

1089
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:03,500
The loophole is that 25 tons of aluminum
is supposed to leave the warehouse

1090
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:07,280
every day. However, the law does
it specify where it had to go.

1091
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:11,030
So they would just send it to another
warehouse of, there isn't technically,

1092
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:14,240
it didn't leave the warehouse
and the New York Times article,

1093
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:17,120
they interviewed people who
previously worked at these warehouses.

1094
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:21,600
They would jokingly send each other
messages and say, Hey, get hey,

1095
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:23,510
get the shipment of aluminum.

1096
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:27,770
But really they were just transferring
it to an adjacent warehouse.

1097
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:32,480
Uh, I, I, this is, I don't even
get what the fuck's going on here.

1098
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:36,740
Of course Goldman Sachs has recently
posted it's largest quarter profit of over

1099
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:37,574
2 billion.

1100
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,270
When can we take these bankers out into
the street and just shoot them all?

1101
01:06:42,271 --> 01:06:45,900
Joking aside, this shit is insider
trading and they should be prosecuted,

1102
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:50,760
but we know that won't happen. A
PS, no, you're busy for a while.

1103
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:55,870
But when are you coming back to
Atlanta? Uh, I actually don't know.

1104
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,460
I don't know when I'm coming
back to Atlanta. You know what?

1105
01:07:00,461 --> 01:07:03,460
That's one of those things I should have
read that 20 times in a row and learned

1106
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,650
what exactly is going on.

1107
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,320
I think this is basically how they get
away with it is that there's too many

1108
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:10,840
people like myself that don't even
understand what was going on there.

1109
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,270
All that stuff,
betting on futures.

1110
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:15,830
I don't even understand
what any of that means.

1111
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,300
I was just in the stock market
long enough to realize like, hey,

1112
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,450
I don't know what the
fuck's going. I'm, I'm S.

1113
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,400
I basically felt like I was
standing at a crap table. Uh,

1114
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:32,690
I put my money on a crap table in
it and I wasn't even in the casino.

1115
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:34,640
You know,

1116
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,240
I was in a different state and then I
was calling somebody else up going, hey,

1117
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:40,760
how's the game going?
You know,

1118
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,630
I saw a couple of stats at the bottom with
the screen and I can't even read them.

1119
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,870
I don't even know if the
games even being played.

1120
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:53,090
That's what I can't get past about

1121
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:58,550
everybody listening to this podcast. You
don't, you don't have any of the money

1122
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,870
that you earn every week.
You don't have any of it.

1123
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:08,340
You ever think about that?
It's a number on a piece of paper.

1124
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:12,330
You take it to the bag and then they
stick that number in your ATM that

1125
01:08:12,331 --> 01:08:16,070
occasionally you go to the ATM and they
give you a piece of paper that is only

1126
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:18,440
worth something because everybody
says it's worth something,

1127
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:20,000
but you really have nothing of value.

1128
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:24,140
What you have is the piece of
paper that's a part of the life

1129
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,510
so that that is the genius of all of
this shit and into penalties and fees and

1130
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,010
taxes and all that crap.

1131
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,610
They get you even further
removed or you have to invest it.

1132
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,940
You know? Why do I have to fucking
invest? You can't, I don't know.

1133
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,390
You don't get anything.
You don't get anything of fucking value.

1134
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:50,490
The only thing that has value is the lie.
And as long as the lie continues,

1135
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,110
I mean,
isn't this the month?

1136
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:54,420
Where are we going to raise the
debt ceiling every fucking year?

1137
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,010
Eventually that wave's going to crash.

1138
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,813
MMM.

1139
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,740
I Dunno.

1140
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:06,740
I hope when the wave crashes that all
races and all economic levels somehow put

1141
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:12,210
down their differences and they all
come together and we just start walking

1142
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:13,890
towards gated communities.

1143
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,990
All right.
There you go.

1144
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:23,320
How much are you stealing that you have
to live behind a gated community there.

1145
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,200
They're sitting there acting like they're,

1146
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,320
they're afraid that we're
going to steal their shit.

1147
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:31,970
It's like you got your shit by
stealing from us. All right.

1148
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:35,720
And our k sorry. All right.
What am I going here?

1149
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:40,850
The next one.
Low Libido girlfriend.

1150
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:42,400
Okay.

1151
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,440
Uh, all right. Hey Bill.

1152
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:48,940
I've been with my current girlfriend
for two years and we've had our ups and

1153
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:52,840
downs,
ups and downs relationship wise,

1154
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:58,180
but even at the lowest points we
still get back together. Okay.

1155
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,850
Is there a reason you get back together?

1156
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:03,640
Is it because you actually love this girl
or he just lonely and don't want to go

1157
01:10:03,641 --> 01:10:05,850
through the pain of a breakup?
A,

1158
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,230
the problem is at this
point and the relationship,

1159
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:10,750
it seems like I'm the only
one interested in sex.

1160
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:13,450
Maybe it's just a man thing
or how long we've been dating,

1161
01:10:13,451 --> 01:10:18,451
but she's in her 20s and I'm 31 and
we have the sex life of a middle aged,

1162
01:10:18,851 --> 01:10:22,390
married couple once a month or
once every three weeks at best.

1163
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:27,010
She generally responds to my advances
with this interest or at worst annoyance.

1164
01:10:27,011 --> 01:10:31,690
Do you think there is any ways to
change this or we just not sexually

1165
01:10:31,691 --> 01:10:33,370
compatible? Go Fuck Yourself? Well,

1166
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:37,660
my gut tells me the relationship
is over and it's been over. Um,

1167
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,930
oh, you said ups and downs. You didn't say
that you broke up. I ran into that. Um,

1168
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,300
okay.

1169
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,630
Yeah. You need to sit down and
talk to her and just say, listen,

1170
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,140
I just want to talk about her sex life.

1171
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:58,790
I feel like it's almost nonexistent and
when I try to get something going with

1172
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,610
you,
I feel like you're a,

1173
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:09,430
like I just completely turn you off.
You know?

1174
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,600
Did I do something?

1175
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:14,730
And if in general you
just not into me anymore,

1176
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:18,180
just let me know cause I'm 31 at,
uh,

1177
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:22,350
I should probably try and find someone
who finds me remotely attractive when you

1178
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:24,990
think so. It was kind of
what I'm looking for in life.

1179
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:29,430
Somebody who actually gives a flying fuck
then of shaking my dick in their face.

1180
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,013
Huh?

1181
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,800
See like right there.
I look at you just look down.

1182
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:38,230
Just a mere mention of me shaking
my cock and your feet. No, sorry.

1183
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:39,850
Yeah,
that's what I would do.

1184
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:41,710
Okay.

1185
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,960
You think there's any change of this? Are
we just not sexually compatible? Yeah,

1186
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,160
this is all like all relationship shit.
His communication.

1187
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,760
He kept a sit down for what you
want to communicate. Relationship.

1188
01:11:51,761 --> 01:11:54,550
What I've learned, the best thing to
do is sit down with yourself first.

1189
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:01,540
All right. Driving in the car, get all
the yelling out. Scream at the windshield.

1190
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,350
Yeah. Well what the fuck? I'm sitting
there, I went over to your broad,

1191
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:06,184
he talked to you.

1192
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,361
Yeah.

1193
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:11,260
You don't just scream and get it all up
and then when you get all of that out,

1194
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:14,770
then you just do some self analysis and
he, you try to break down the anger.

1195
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,280
It'd be like,
what am I really upset about?

1196
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:18,810
Okay.

1197
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:23,370
You know, what do I feel right now? I feel
like I'm not being heard. I feel this.

1198
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:26,580
I feel that. And then she, then
he had to have this game plan.

1199
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,370
Okay.
Even if you've got to make like a setlist,

1200
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:35,060
like a fucking comedian and you just
write down what you feeling and the points

1201
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:36,050
that you want to get out.

1202
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,660
Draw a smiley face at the end of it to
remind yourself to not get angry because

1203
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:45,810
you're going to start the conversation.
This works for both men and women.

1204
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:49,200
You're going to start the conversation.
So the other person is caught off guard,

1205
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:52,170
so they didn't get a chance
to scream at the windshield.

1206
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,400
So they might start screaming at you.
So your point,

1207
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:59,660
your main thing is not to join in
and have the whole thing escalate.

1208
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,460
You just want to be heard. All
right? So if you in an adult way,

1209
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:08,820
just tell them what you're
feeling without insulting them.

1210
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,180
It's always good for the relationship.

1211
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,090
Even if the relationship
fucking comes to an end,

1212
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:17,120
uh,

1213
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,170
you're just pressing fast forward
through a bunch of pain. So there you go.

1214
01:13:21,171 --> 01:13:23,690
So I would just sit down
with them and just say, yeah,

1215
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,270
I just feel like I repulse
you to the point that I'm

1216
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:28,270
okay.

1217
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:31,820
You know, I feel hesitant to even
even trying to make a move on you.

1218
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:38,690
What's the deal? You know? See
how that works out. All right.

1219
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:43,650
Road, head accident. Hey Bill,

1220
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:48,330
I took my lady out to a nice
steakhouse for our anniversary.

1221
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,440
We had an awesome night. The food
was expensive, but fucking great.

1222
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:54,930
We pigged out and after it was all over,
we left.

1223
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,740
We then went and seen a movie.

1224
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:07,680
I don't know if that's a Typo, sir,
but I fucking, I know guys like you.

1225
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,320
We went out, we had all this meal
and we went out. We seen a movie

1226
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,270
and at two hours to let
our stomachs settle.

1227
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,770
I'm surprised you didn't fall asleep.

1228
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:21,540
I would have felt if I had a giant steak
dinner, I woulda got the itis. Anyways.

1229
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,870
Then after we left the theater,

1230
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:26,980
we locked eyes in the car and we
immediately wanted to fuck Jesus. Dude,

1231
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:29,980
you're killing it. Steak, dinner,
movies. Now you're going to, you know,

1232
01:14:29,981 --> 01:14:34,840
you've got a woman who wants to jump on
your deck. God bless you, America. Uh,

1233
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:39,190
so I threw the neon into
tribe in Florida towards home.

1234
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:44,200
However, she had the amazing idea to give
me some road head before we got home.

1235
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:47,950
Being in Dota. I had my dick out before
she even got situated. Of course,

1236
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,080
after a while of her doing
this, she started to gag
being a dude. I was thinking,

1237
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:57,700
oh yeah, she can't even handle this dick.
Jesus Christ. This guy's spare no detail.

1238
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:02,650
Sorry ladies. Uh, despite the fact that
she had never gagged before, oh, sorry,

1239
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:07,090
I missed the, the self
deprecating tag there. He said,

1240
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:08,710
I was thinking she can't handle this dick,

1241
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:12,220
despite the fact she had never
gagged before. Before I knew it.

1242
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:13,893
Oh No.

1243
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,470
Okay.

1244
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:19,440
All right. If you're squeamish,
people just shut it off now. He goes,

1245
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:22,380
I felt a wet sensation on my balls.

1246
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,440
As I looked down,

1247
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:30,650
I noticed that she had thrown up all over
my dick balls and general crotch area.

1248
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:35,933
Sorry.

1249
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,673
Wow.

1250
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,410
Here's the bullshit.
She was mad at me.

1251
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:46,970
What the fuck? She was so
upset and embarrassed. That's
what it is right there,

1252
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:51,680
sir. About about it that she
hasn't come over in two weeks.

1253
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:57,320
Why is she pissed? She isn't the one
that had the cleanest stake dad. Right.

1254
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:58,970
All right.
Tell me what to do.

1255
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:03,803
MMM.

1256
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,390
I gotta tell you this. She's being
really immature. She's embarrassed.

1257
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,150
She's embarrassed,
and

1258
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:20,820
she's not being mature
about this. Where, I mean,

1259
01:16:20,821 --> 01:16:22,200
it was a mutual thing.

1260
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,400
It's not like you grabbed
her by the back of the head,

1261
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:31,230
just slammed her head down there. You
know, she was all about it. In fact, if I,

1262
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:34,710
if I remember before, I can get that
nightmare visual out of my head.

1263
01:16:34,711 --> 01:16:39,470
It was her idea. Right?
We wanted to fuck whoever.

1264
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:43,760
She had the amazing idea to get
me some head, oh, she's a trooper.

1265
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,190
You know, this is what I would
do. Send her a card in the mail.

1266
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,643
All right.

1267
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,750
And just, just tell it that,
you know, you miss her. I,

1268
01:16:57,751 --> 01:17:01,920
you don't viewer any differently
or anything and just, just,

1269
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:04,610
just write something nice and
yeah, I'd really like to, uh,

1270
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,870
take you out for an ice cream.

1271
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:09,320
Maybe if you do throw it up
all of my Dick and balls later.

1272
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:11,740
I think it'd be kind of a soothing,
you know,

1273
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,480
this is summertime months and that
criteria can get a little hot.

1274
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:18,320
So I wouldn't mind a little mint chocolate
chip around the pubes there. Right. We

1275
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:21,980
leave out the last part,

1276
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,293
but

1277
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,950
I have just sent her a nice car.
I wouldn't even bring up the incident.

1278
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,400
Just send her a nice car.
Something cute.

1279
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:37,800
Nothing silly, nothing fucking overly
loving. Just something in the middle.

1280
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:43,800
You know what sir? I think we actually
found a new niche for hallmark.

1281
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:49,440
They got to have one where there was
something sexually weird happened and the

1282
01:17:49,441 --> 01:17:53,460
other person is embarrassed
at the other person.

1283
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,820
Doesn't judge him and wants him back.
You could have those cards.

1284
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:00,780
Let's see if I can come up with
one here that actually bribes.

1285
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,003
Uh,

1286
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:07,030
dare lay you got a little shady.

1287
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,870
I still love you. Uh, I dunno.

1288
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:15,220
You puked at my Dick and balls.
I don't know how to fuck again.

1289
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:19,890
Somewhere in there. Uh, wrap ups. Okay.

missed an email or what,

1294

people showed up at the ball.

1295

Got dropped somewhere.
