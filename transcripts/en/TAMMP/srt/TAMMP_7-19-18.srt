1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,840
Hey, what's going on is bill burn
is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:07,270
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,510
Ah,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,860
just checking in on you. Yes, I am.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,850
How are you? What's going
on? How is your week going?

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,020
You realize it's July, man. The summer
is just, it's just with giveaway.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,420
Do you know how fucking rained
out here yesterday in July?

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,550
It's unbelievable.
It never rains out here.

9
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,550
It never rains in California.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,580
But boy don't they warn you it pours man.

11
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,530
It pulls. It just, it
just was this thunder and,

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,420
and there was rain and it just
poured down and I was like, Gee,

13
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:53,910
willikers you know,

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,650
I had a couple of shirts drying out on
the fucking porch there because, uh,

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:57,961
you know,

16
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:02,370
you can do that out here because it
never rains in February and that is it.

17
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,800
There's a little bit of June
gloom and you're like, Ooh, Ooh.

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,840
Is it no precipitation, blue
balls? That's all it is.

19
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,770
And yesterday it just was an
absolute downpour. And uh,

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,210
like 20 minutes later it was over and
everything was dried up and you would

21
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:24,100
never know what happened. You know, like
a perfect robbery, like a robbery gone.

22
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:28,690
Right. Nobody gets it. They get
in, we get up, we get the jewels.

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,800
Okay. Blonde. Um,

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,250
yeah.

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,760
Franco goes in with the others have been,
sorry,

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,450
I just combined three different movies,
two different movies,

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,980
some like that. I have no
fucking idea. All I know is
a, this is one of these days.

28
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,660
I forgot it was Thursday and I forgot I
had to do a podcast and I have some shit.

29
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,923
Ted Do

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,020
some shit to do.
All right.

31
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,520
I am going down to comic con today.
Can you believe that

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Belper hater of all marvel
and DC fucking movies.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,720
I don't hate him. I just, I they
do absolutely nothing for me.

34
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,783
You know,

35
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,800
I like the hulk. I'm an angry
fucker. I can relate to him.

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,780
Right? I've inhaled a cigar. I've
turned green before. You know,

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,250
I can't jump like that. A kid. I can't
crush cars the way he does, but I get it.

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,100
I like the hulk.
I liked the way he talks to,

39
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,750
okay,

40
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,310
you know how, how fucking stupid.
He basically talks like Tarzan,

41
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,960
which really made no sense if he was
raised by wolves or whatever the fuck was

42
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:49,720
going on there. How the fuck he
learned to how to speak English.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,953
You know what I mean?

44
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,810
I can't tell if he was unbelievably
compromised in that relationship with Jane

45
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,370
or if it was a brilliant fucking thing,

46
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:02,830
cause he could just pretend he didn't
understand what she was saying. You know?

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,100
How long into that relationship do you
think before we looked at that little

48
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:11,040
chimpanzee just fucking rolled his eyes
like, you fucking believe this shit.

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,920
Okay, this, this,

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,340
this woman would be dead out here without
me at an edge and all she's doing is

51
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,830
bitch moaning and complaining.
All right, we'll live in a nature.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,610
We're perfectly safe. Okay, I'm providing,

53
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,200
we don't have to pay any
taxes. There's like, no,

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,860
we're in fucking eating right now.
And they go, Jay, get, go, go, go.

55
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,300
Take a bite on the apple.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,730
Okay.

57
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,340
You know that is one
thing that I've learned

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,700
as a 50 year old man. I'll tell you right
now guys, if you're out with the ladies,

59
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:52,190
okay. Save Your fucking money. Okay.

60
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Do not spend money on women.

61
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,910
Okay?
Do it cause you want to,

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,780
but don't do it because you think
it's going to make them happy.

63
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,760
It will in the moment. But I
swear to God, I don't give a fuck.

64
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,050
You could literally buy a woman to
fucking space shuttle. All right?

65
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:13,410
And put our initials on the
side of it. Okay. And take her,

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,670
I dunno where the fuck you do
with the space shuttle. All right.

67
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:21,690
Whatever the take her to and from work.
I don't like thinning like this.

68
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:25,650
My hair is like hanging down.
Well,

69
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:27,540
we can't take off horizontally,
honey.

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,140
What am I just getting to work?
I swear to God you don't.

71
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,760
You'd literally be in the Doghouse
within fucking 24 hours of doing that one

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,140
stupid comment.

73
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,853
MMM.

74
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,110
It was actually joking with a buddy of
mine the other day. I was saying like,

75
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:46,350
you know, sentiment, if patching shit
up with your wife was deductible,

76
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,450
I wouldn't pay taxes for
the past three years.

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,000
That's all I'm ever doing.
You know?

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,380
I feel like the boss's son
who just keeps fucking up,

79
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,820
but for some reason he doesn't get
fired. You know what I mean? It's,

80
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,200
I have to like the 50th time you've done
something wrong that we could just like,

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,530
I, I really don't understand how, how did
I, how did I end up in this position? Um,

82
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,280
but that's neither here nor there.

83
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,230
Okay.

84
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,070
If you want to make up with your wife,
take her out for ice cream. Okay.

85
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,830
I'm telling you it's, it's romantic.
It, it gives him a sugar rush.

86
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,091
All right.

87
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,300
They feel like they're in some Tom Hanks
movie and it really doesn't cost that

88
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,250
much money.
You know,

89
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
if you can just keep your cool while
you fucking stand in line at the artisan

90
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,690
ice cream place that they want to go to
before you go up there and you order a

91
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:45,340
mint chocolate chip and they tell you
it's not in season with that happening in

92
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,470
San Francisco, remember that
story? It's not in season.

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,720
Then I'm going to cross the street to
the drug store and it came back with a

94
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:54,000
pint of it. You know, I should've walked
into their fucking ice cream place. Hey,

95
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,843
hey,
hey,

96
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,200
here's the deal view. If you want
to get adventurous with ice cream,

97
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,980
follow people under 40.
All right,

98
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,440
can you just want the
old school simple shit.

99
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:14,790
You follow old people because eventually
they're going to the pharmacy,

100
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,380
right? And that's where they have
chocolate, vanilla, strawberry

101
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,060
patch work,
chocolate chip.

102
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,520
How many flavors were there?
There was mint chocolate chip,

103
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:32,500
there was peppermint that was like, that
was fancy back then. Not now. It's like,

104
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,400
I don't even know what the fuck it is.
They got candy bars in there.

105
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:37,390
They got like a,

106
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:42,391
they have sugar and salt with a shot of
espresso and some sort of social justice

107
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,800
warrior thing written in
fucking a whip cream. You know,

108
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:52,200
I followed Joe Rogan is most
of the free world does, um,

109
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,000
on Instagram. And I saw this
whole thing about the okay sign.

110
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:01,080
How funny is that? According
to Joe Rogan, the okay side.

111
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,120
These people is a joke.
Tried to say that you can,

112
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,540
you can find white power in there
like this, which I don't know.

113
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:13,460
I see three fingers in it in a
zero. I see zero to three. I see 30.

114
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,650
I see, uh, uh, I dunno know if making
shadow puppets, maybe a rooster.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,160
I don't see where the white power is
in it, but they tried to say that.

116
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,270
You could see in there,

117
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,980
I guess the p would be your forearm
up into the circle and then the three

118
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,890
fingers would be the
w, Oh fuck, I'm smart.

119
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,760
Or does that mean I'm racist,
racist, racist. So when he was,

120
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:40,761
they started it as a joke and then
dopes believed it and then actual,

121
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,570
even bigger dopes,

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,600
white supremacists started using it
and now it's actually going to get bad,

123
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,920
you know, which is so fucking
stupid. Like why would you ban that?

124
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,760
You know what I mean? That's
like banning, you know,

125
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:04,120
let's say it was actually race.
Would you ban somebody going Sieg Heil?

126
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,860
Why would you ban that? Let people do it
then. Then you know who the Nazis are,

127
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,610
right? If you don't let people do
it, then you're like, all right,

128
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,660
is this guy a Nazi or does he know
Jujitsu or was he just a fan of telephone?

129
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Telly Savalas oh no, wait a
minute. That's all freckles.

130
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,520
He showed up to tell some shit jokes,
right? And then all of a sudden,

131
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,500
all the lines get blurred.

132
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,730
Okay.

133
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,090
Okay. You got to let corny
people have this signs.

134
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,680
You know how you doing Seth?
I'm okay.

135
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,670
You gotta let them do that and then
you got to let morons, you know,

136
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:48,350
fucking do this. SIEG Heil on. I hit
Lou's birthday on April 20th. All right,

137
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,580
well the hippies of behind him
smoking marijuana. Hey Man, like

138
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,380
Nazis, the mellow man, right?
You got to have all those people,

139
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,410
I think. I mean, you'd like to
have not have others, but I,

140
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:07,140
I really don't think I'll like banning
sides. I've always thought that was,

141
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,860
that was, uh, like I
guess wishful thinking

142
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,810
in my world. If you ban racial gestures
than people aren't racist anymore.

143
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,340
You don't need to fix
what's between their ears.

144
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:27,200
You just need to fix just stipulations.
When we come back,

145
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,580
Dr Phil will cure a heroin addict
within two commercial breaks.

146
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,510
Uh,

147
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,510
you ne to stop doing heroin and
you need to put on some weight.

148
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,780
You're right,
Dr Phil,

149
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,250
let me shake your hand and subtly steal
your wash so I can cop right behind your

150
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:51,200
fucking soundstage. Did I say cop?
Yes, I did. That's how old I am.

151
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,840
Uh, you know what's great about being a
parent besides everything is all the fun

152
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:59,570
fucking size. He gets stuck
in your head. You know, it's,

153
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:04,460
I'm talking to you guys about Neo
Nazis in my head. I'm singing pop,

154
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:09,390
pop, pop puppy dog past
a house. But no, no, no,

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,650
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no bro Bro. Bro, bro, bro, bro, Bro.

156
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,350
Up pop up pop. You know it was awesome.
Is My daughter sings along to it now?

157
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:19,950
Yeah,

158
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,740
she just goes pop, pop, pop,
pop. And then anytime they, they,

159
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,280
she just goes dog.

160
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,940
It's funny to parents.
Um, yeah, she's amazing.

161
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,000
Um, I, I get now why people
have like eight kids. I get it.

162
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,400
It's fucking amazing.

163
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:45,120
I mean if he can just get past being
tired and them eventually hating you

164
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:48,930
between the ages of about 11 and a,
I don't know,

165
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,080
depending on how much you
actually did do wrong,

166
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,320
it might be the rest of your life, but
usually it, I think it lasts to somewhere.

167
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,990
A mid college

168
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,740
I would think.
I don't know.

169
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:05,220
I've already thought about how I'm
going to handle their teenage years.

170
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,910
I'm just going to listen. I know, I
know. I'm cramping your style man,

171
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:16,380
but can you just go to lunch with your
old man? I swear to God. Here's the deal.

172
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,760
I like, I'll let you
walk in first. You know,

173
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:23,100
just in case some of your
friends are in there. All right.

174
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,840
And then if none of your
friends are in there,

175
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,750
then I'll come in like
the fucking elephant man.

176
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:31,620
And he will sit down just to have lunch
with me. And if any of friends show up,

177
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:32,454
you know?

178
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,573
Okay.

179
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,430
I mean, I don't know what to do at that
point. I guess I would walk out, you know,

180
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,660
how amazing is that?
Like,

181
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,740
as this little perfect big that
needs you on such a ridiculous level,

182
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:49,410
it almost makes you cry
within like 10 years.

183
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,670
He like treats you like the
fucking plague, you know?

184
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm kind of excited for it,

185
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:58,840
for the whole fucking journey because
at the end of the day, I am a loner,

186
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,060
so I think I'll be able
to sub. No, I won't.

187
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,870
Okay.

188
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,110
What'd your own flesh and blood stone
say? Black on you. Um, all right.

189
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,900
I think we need to do some advertising
here. Don't I? At some point,

190
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,650
not all of them. Only 12 minutes in nearly
12 minutes. And you know what I did?

191
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:16,860
I tell you guys that I watched
the a moto GP from Germany. I uh,

192
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,180
I'm
from Germany and I saw a

193
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,560
fucking Mark Marquez fucking
run down Jorge low Lorenzo.

194
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,700
The, I just don't understand
the whole fucking tire thing.

195
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,030
These fucking guys,
whenever they use the soft tire,

196
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,540
they're always leading in the beginning
and then eventually the soft tires to

197
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,260
fucking soft, it starts to wear
down and then they're fucked.

198
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,800
You know?
I mean at this point,

199
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,770
the way Mark Marquez is winning,
why don't you just go, well,

200
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,140
what is mark going to use today?

201
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,810
The give ourselves a fighting chance
because as far as I know, Jorge, Luis,

202
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,500
Lorenzo, he fucking uh, he won a
championship three years ago. Right?

203
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,490
Mark has his one for the last five.
Let me look this up.

204
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:12,140
Moto g p Jambi almost.

205
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,460
Am I on the right
Internet? Okay, here we go.

206
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:17,950
Okay.

207
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,420
Oh God. They just let me know who.
Okay. How about Valentino Rossi? Huh?

208
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,110
Always making the podium.

209
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,770
That's a weird thing in racing that I
don't get how you get too old to do it.

210
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,010
I mean, as long as you are fucking,
especially race car driver,

211
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,170
as long as you have foot works,
can you press down on the gas?

212
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,250
I mean the engine has to go 200
miles an hour. You don't, right.

213
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,720
I mean it just kind of ride along.
All right. But I guess your reflexes,

214
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,560
your reflexes get, uh,
aren't as good. And then, um,

215
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,380
I dunno. You just stop winning.
It's crazy. All right. So basically,

216
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,040
okay,

217
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,461
first of all,

218
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,461
shout out to Spain because since 2010
a Spaniard as one at every year except

219
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:07,611
2011 when arguably the greatest
motorcycle name of all time.

220
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,670
Casey stoner.
One more time.

221
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:14,160
Casey stoner, one in 2011. All right,

222
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Mark Marquez won it in 2017 2016 Jorge
Lorenzo won it in 2015 and then 2014 2013

223
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:27,510
was Mark Marquez,

224
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,930
Jorge Lorenzo was 2012 Casey stoner,

225
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,710
please report to the principal's office.

226
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,670
2011 and 2010 was Jorge Lorenzo.

227
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,730
And then the previous decade was the
Valentino Rossi show where that genius won

228
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:47,580
it seven times in nine years.

229
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,340
Honorable Mention to Casey and
2007 and also the last American,

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,650
the last Yank to win at 2006.
Nikki. Hey, what's going on?

231
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:05,360
Do you still riding the fucking
motorcycles kit Doty was crazy.

232
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,430
He was doing fucking wheelies
in the seventh grade.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,940
And we also want in 2000
with Kenny Roberts Jr um,

234
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,980
Valentino Rossi won in 2001,
2002,

235
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,770
2003 2004 2005,

236
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,840
2008 and 2009 and he was
riding Hondas in the beginning,

237
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,230
2001, two and three. And
then the unthinkable,

238
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,560
he switched to Yamaha and everybody
thought it was an inferior product.

239
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,520
And not only did he fucking
went with them, he won four
times with Yamaha. Yamaha.

240
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,060
There you go. There's some
quick motorcycle history.
I don't know shit about it,

241
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:41,040
but somebody who watches this shit,

242
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:45,350
please explain to me why you
would ever run a race. Right?

243
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,350
Or race on the fucking soft tire.
The super soft. So whatever.

244
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,430
They always seem to blister
or just they shit the bed,

245
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,710
right when it counts.
It's like you lead the whole fucking race,

246
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,423
you know,

247
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,250
and then all of a sudden
with like 15 to 12 laps left,

248
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,700
all of a sudden somebody with a medium
tire or something like that just runs you

249
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:05,534
down.

250
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,083
You know,

251
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,320
the soft tire is sort of the, uh,
the heartthrob of the tire industry.

252
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,950
You know what I mean? Well, if you're
basing your whole life on your looks,

253
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,810
I mean you're, you're, you
know, you're going to have,

254
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,640
your career's going to be pro probably
shorter than a professional athletes

255
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,000
cause you're going to get old
and somebody else younger,

256
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:33,620
it's going to come along. But the
medium, I think the medium tires,

257
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:37,310
the way to go, it seems to be the wake
up way to go. I have no fucking idea,

258
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,110
but all I know is a,

259
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:44,111
I have to figure out a way next year
in April to get to that Goddamn Moto GP

260
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,720
race. But anyways, I didn't mention
why are you going to comic con bill?

261
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,090
Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

262
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,900
I'm going down the first time
I'm flying a helicopter down. Uh,

263
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,360
it's the first time I've flown since
May tope I remember how to do this shit.

264
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm flying with an instructor.
Everybody relax.

265
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,890
So I'm flying down there and I am,
uh,

266
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,200
is it moderating hosting?
Um,

267
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,200
I'm sitting down for an hour in
front of a crowd of 6,000 people.

268
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,340
Yeah.

269
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,050
And I am hosting, uh,
what do you call it? The,

270
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,270
uh,
the cast of better call Saul.

271
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,390
I'm getting to interview all of those
people and I'm going to see Vince Gilligan

272
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,230
for the first time in a long time,
which can be great.

273
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:35,210
I'm going to thank him for giving
me an acting career and, uh,

274
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,640
and then afterwards,
uh,

275
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,580
some of the cast of breaking bad's going
to come out and then we're going to do

276
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,450
an hour with them.
And um,

277
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,703
yeah,
I dunno.

278
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,760
I don't know why I, this is one of
these gigs where I was like, yeah,

279
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,800
I'd to do that. And then the second I,
you know, the day comes and I'm like,

280
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,670
wait, what am I on my fucking,
what the fuck am I going to say?

281
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,660
But I know that everybody's got great
stories, so all I gotta do is just,

282
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,010
I just got to set people up.
I did this recently on another show

283
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,140
that escapes me. I have no fucking idea
what I am. I short term memories for Shit.

284
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,030
I have no idea. But anyways, it's
going to fly down to San Diego.

285
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm going to a host,

286
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:22,370
both those things and I get to watch
the premiere of better call Saul.

287
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,050
You know what's better than that? Then
I come back, you know better call Saul,

288
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,660
one of my favorite actors
on television right now.

289
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,730
Joe To Rosa Smoking Joe to Rosa.

290
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,180
Oh by the way, by the way, you know.

291
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,040
Okay.

292
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,720
Very strong rumors,

293
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,920
very strong rumors that Belper and Joe
Rosa a back together in talks about

294
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:53,320
getting uninformed going again,
very strong rumors.

295
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:56,150
Remember when guns and roses was getting
back together and everybody isn't going

296
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,940
to happen.
Is it going to happen?

297
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,050
You know what?
Guess what?

298
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,783
Yeah,

299
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm sitting down with old
fucking Joe to Rosa next week

300
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,920
to see if I can figure
out a way to get to,

301
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:16,921
to fit myself into is incredible busy
schedule as an actor yet to be nominated

302
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,900
for an Emmy.
But we all know it's inevitable.

303
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,920
I sound like a break in his balls, but
I think he's fucking great on that show.

304
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,490
And uh, I can't wait for
this season. And, um,

305
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,490
it is a beyond an honor that
Vince asked me to do this.

306
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:38,810
So I just hope I don't fuck
it up to be honest with you.

307
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,280
You don't.
Um,

308
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,150
and I also don't know how, how do
I get into this? I mean, can I,

309
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:50,151
can I talk about like how last season
ended without getting stampeded by 6,000

310
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:56,130
nerds? Go and see. Spoiler
alert man. All right,

311
00:19:56,131 --> 00:20:00,240
everybody. Okay, here we
go. I got a little bit of a,

312
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,640
some advertising three here.
Um,

313
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,830
Hey, Nia is the OBL almost ready? Ah,
Shit. All right, I gotta get in there.

314
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,973
All right.

315
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:11,770
Okay.

316
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,790
Butcher box,

317
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,810
put your box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

318
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,760
organic chicken and heritage breed pork.

319
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,530
The incredible quality of butcher box
means start with the commitment to raising

320
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:30,640
animals humanely and free of antibiotics
and hormones before you kill them.

321
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,180
Each box comes with at least
nine to 11 pounds of meat,

322
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,980
which is enough for 24 individual
size meals. Unless you're a fat fuck,

323
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,650
which probably you'll go
through that in three days.

324
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,390
You can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

325

326
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,810
box.
Custom box.

327
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,120
Okay.

328
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.
Oh Man.

329
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:55,830
That's when you throw
it down at the grill.

330
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,610
That's when your eyes light up
like a kid in a candy store.

331
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,560
I get to pick my own guts.
Antibiotic slash hormone free.

332
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,390
No, we're not talking about bill
burr. We're talking about butcher box.

333
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Put your box believes in a healthier
food system where everyone has access to

334
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:19,230
meets the way nature intended,
the way you used to be able to do it.

335
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:20,730
When you went hunting with a musket,

336
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,460
the only foreign object in that thing
was the little pellet that you shot into

337
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,303
its brain.

338
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,390
Nature intended free of antibiotics and
hormones and humanely raised on an open

339
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:37,440
pasture before they kill
him. Butcher, Buck selection,

356
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:34,820
say that America is not number one,

357
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,580

a great time with him. It's like, uh,

366

he's going to make a great 80 year old.

368
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,780
But the great thing about Jim is he's
a bit of a curmudgeon too, you know,

369
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,790
so we have to fucking chromogens

371
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:41,090
grumpiness. Um, I should
actually post the link to,

372
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,340

I had a great time when a show and uh,

effort to everything that I do. I'm like

font that I'm reading here.

408
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,480
Do you like spending less money on
things than more money on things?

409
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,360
Yes.
I love how easy these questions are.

410
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,760
School is this easy? I would
have gone to Harvard. Uh,

411
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,020

when you started out in comedy,

416
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:34,700
all the other comics teased you
for your coke bottle. Glasses,

417
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,070
blind Billy, bad eyes. They call you
it not at your heart, toward your soul.

418
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:42,950
You seed with rage,
but deep down you knew they were right.

00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:32,660
vogue, Gq, tech crunch, Mashable,

433
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,200
and the billboard podcasts.
So do what I bill burr,

434
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,150
definitely 100% did.

435
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,320
And go to a Hubble context.com
to get your first two pairs.

436
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,730
First two weeks of lenses for free.
Uh,

437
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,130
that's 15 pairs of lenses for
free. I've never done this. Uh,

438
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:52,760
to summarize context.
Cheaper's good, easy,

439
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:57,380
humble Internet C, uh, make
sure to select my show.

440
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,570
Underscore Bill Burr, underscore
at checkout. That's Hubble Hubb,

441
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:06,320
Ellie contacts.com. All right, so
I guess they have cheek contexts.

442
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,070
All right.
Yet you can put it in your eyes.

443
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,000
Uh, I actually, I need
glasses, man. I do. And uh,

444
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,290
I'm just afraid that if I wear glasses,
it's going to make my eyes weaker.

445
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,640
It's kind of like, you know, given into
using a cane, except it's for your eyes.

446
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,120
I'm trying to tough it out. I'm 50 years
old and I still don't have glasses.

447
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,970
You know,
I'll tell you

448
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,880
I can't see shit, but I'm a good listener.
I'm all man. I'm a really good listener.

449
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,980
All right. I gotta get in there
and I got to go eat lunch.

450
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,260
Oh, sorry. Breakfast with
the, with the family. Um,

451
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,030
I almost just said I love you guys. I
don't even know why. Why would I say that?

452
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,390
This being a dad thing is really
making me soft. It's really,

453
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:52,360
it's kind of scaring me here. All
right, let's get back on track.

454
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:57,070
Have a great weekend. You con and
uh, I'll check in on you on, uh,

455
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,610
on Monday. I think. Is there
an f one race this weekend?

456
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:05,560
There wasn't one this past weekend. I
think that coming back. Ah, I can't wait.

457
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,260
That last race was my
favorite fucking race.

458
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,560
That I'd last two have been
my favorite race. And, um,

459
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,630
I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm
going to say a, a ridiculously focused,

460
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,350
slightly angry Lewis Hamilton.

461
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,970
He's going to put on a fucking display.
That's what I'm, that's, that's my guests.

462
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,460
Alright, you wanna see
something cool? Checkout Lewis
Hamilton's private jet. Ahh,

463
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,760
Ahh, I can't imagine that.
You know what I mean?

464
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,120
Just flying to every gig in that
fucking thing. Do you now not funny.

465
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,003
Would be.

466
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,900
Okay.

467
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,320
How would you show up with that grin on
your face that you know, like when those,

468
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,380
when when the the dive and rescue teams
find the fucking guy who drowned in the,

469
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:54,030
in the fucking those cave divers,

470
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,060
they would have that goofy smile on
their face because the last thing that

471
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,370
happens is your body
releases all that dopamine.

472
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,480
That's the look I would have on my
face if I had a private jet. You know,

473
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,300
by the way, there is no way
to fly private and make money.

474
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,370
There's just no way to fucking do it
unless you flew there and then did it

475
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,350
10,000 gigs in a row before you flew back.

476
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,230
I don't get how people fucking
do it and people go, Oh,

477
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,360
you build it into the contract.
It's like fuck it.

478
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,810
It's going to come out of your end. It's
going to come out of your rent. I mean,

479
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,110
I think if I was to fly from here to Utah,
it costs like 50 grant.

480
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,590
It's fucking ridiculous. That
50 it's fucking nuts. All right.

481
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,940
That's the podcast.

482
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,380
Enjoy the music and listen to and
enjoy another half hour of a Thursday

483
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,830
afternoon podcast for my Thursday
afternoon. God, by all look good.

484
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:43,970
Just came walking in all
shirtless with their beer belly.

485
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,190
How you doing buddy?

486
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,900
Is it me or does she just
keep getting better looking?

487
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,640
She does get better looking.
Can you say hi?

488
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,700
Can you say Mama,
can you say okay?

489
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,950
Can you say baby?

490
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,550
Okay.

491
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,910
Can you say dog?
You say Kat.

492
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,680
Can you say car? Can you say, wow?

493
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,930
He's saying, Whoa, whoa.
She slipped in both around.

494
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,710
Can you say keys? Key shoes. He

495
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,170
now she can almost say to civil war.
Can you say wallet?

496
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,970
The water. The water.
That's like the same thing.

497
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,170
Yeah. You got to pick like words that
begin with the letter that she knows.

498
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:37,670
I'm not trying to turn
him into a gold digger.

499
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,720
Okay.
Say Baby

500
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,860
baby laughing.

501
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,030
Crying, crying. Are you doing that?

502
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,873
Huh?

503
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,830
Angry sleeping.

504
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,210
All right. That's the podcast. God bless
Ya. Uh, I'll talk to you on my, yeah,

505
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,380
that's right. Check it out.
I'll see you on Monday.

506
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,880
From the first book, we get bashed into
the holder, not the half of the book.

507
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,330
Captain Aftermath of the project.
That's the way

508
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,210
I have a NASA,

509
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,740
but the one at the top came
after this shot. I'm like,

510
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,063
God,

511
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,790
Brooklyn.
See that all Kimberly,

512
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,770
that they send the true
gas where the police would

513
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:55,130
tell them what at New York City when they
paint murals and the and cash we trust

514
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,880
because it's getting a fabulous life.
Look Pretty. What a pity blunts is.

515
00:32:57,881 --> 00:32:58,750
Still 50 cents.

516
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,780
3 cents is Tom and nick can't be
covered within says my presence felt.

517
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,950
My name is Callie from
the eternal refreshing.

518
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,420
We'll take shorthand from this conception.
Let me meditate.

519
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,260
Satish tray came to that conclusion
that most of these chapters let me

520
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:15,650
demonstrate. Walk in the streets.
It's like battling be with your body.

521
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,630
You must know karate it back to me
like a bitch or ready to be efficient.

522
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,291
Every year may be,

523
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,680
you can see your name in the column
where we certainly teach a reading and

524
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:27,470
talking about a new either mountain
tonight and neighbors like he went to cry.

525
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:31,700
It's like, who'd a thought, David? Hey,
what's going on? Go for Monday morning,

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:37,630
the July fucking 19th
2000 fucking 10 all right,

527
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,740
I'm going to pissed off fucking mood
because I'm not funny this week.

528
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,420
This is the third fucking time
I've started this Goddamn podcast.

529
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,720
They had a race. Two of
them got 12 minutes into the
first one and I just said,

530
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:54,530
fuck it. And I erased it and this one,
I got 24 fucking minutes in and I,

531
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,470
I just, I, I just erased it.

532
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,940
And rather than walking away and walking
down the Goddamn street and cleared my

533
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:01,780
fucking head,

534
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,080
I just hit stop and I hit a race and
then I just start the fucking thing again

535
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:11,830
thinking like, oh, maybe, maybe
this will work. Let me do a do over,

536
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,013
you know?

537
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,690
Okay.

538
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,680
Oh, actually, you know what it
is. I'm on the fucking road.

539
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,310
I went to Montreal and now I'm in New
York and I just, I want to go home.

540
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,760
I've had it. I don't want to sleep in
anymore of these fucking hotel rooms.

541
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,270
I don't want to order any more
fucking room service. I'm in New York.

542
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Are you ordered a God damn fucking protein
salad with a fucking Capri Tse Salad?

543
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,270
Cause I thought they were
Mozzarella, Mozzarella sticks.
However the fuck you got.

544
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:42,250
Goddamn sons of bitches from Italy say it

545
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,640
fucking shows up.
So I ordered a salad and a fucking sal.

546
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:51,060
Do you know what it cost me? It cost
me fucking almost 50 bucks with the tip

547
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,940
because I'm staying in midtown midtown.
Therefore we can,

548
00:34:56,941 --> 00:35:00,630
we can rape you. You want some fucking
advice. If you ever come to New York,

549
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,760
do not stay mid tab too. God goddamn
fucking. They deliver the fucking food.

550
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:10,260
The guy's wearing a goddamn ski mask.
Fucking pantyhose over his fucking face.

551
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,090
Sound believe. And then we send up
there the only set up some fucking,

552
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,930
you know guy who can't even speak
fucking English, right? So you know,

553
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:22,650
it's not his fault. You know, he
didn't come up with the Goddamn menu.

554
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,421
Poor bastard.

555
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:29,100
He's still has scurvy from floating over
on his goddamn luggage coming up here

556
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:33,570
at fucking dazed given me the God
damn s I can't fucking believe it.

557
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,830
Yeah.

558
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,580
You know, and if you've never stayed in
a fucking New York hotel room either,

559
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,330
this is how it works. It costs $400
for the night and you're like, wow,

560
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,160
this is going to be amazing though.
Right?

561
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,340
And you open the fucking door and what
happens? You take a step and a half,

562
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:50,790
you trip over the fucking bed,
you'll roll over the bed like that.

563
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:55,710
Dushant Starsky and Hutch Hutch going
right over the hood of his fucking Grand

564
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,940
Torino. And rather than coming up in a
cool way with your Adidas dragons on,

565
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,320
you do a face plant right into the
fucking wall. And if I have the second,

566
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:07,380
you're like, oh, wait a minute, wait
a minute. There's a ray of light.

567
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,980
I actually have two side by side windows.
Let's check out the view.

568
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,700
And all you see is a fucking
the brick building next to you.

569
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,080
Do you know? I can't even commit
suicide out of this fucking window.

570
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,280
That's how close the building is
next to me. Hang on a second. Yes.

571
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,730
Okay.

572
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,730
It's okay. Uh, come back later.
I'm doing the podcast. All right.

573
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,480
Thank you. And I call, I
assumed that she's a fan,

574
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,910
actually got a laugh out of her.
Um, but she had an accident.

575
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:41,440
I just said I'm doing the podcast.

576
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,310
She probably thinks that's some sort of
new dance or that I'm fucking my wife

577
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,240
and it's some sort of new weird position.
I'd love to open the door,

578
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:53,290
but we're doing the podcast. Um, anyways,

579
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,410
let's get back to killing myself.
Um,

580
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,110
if I were to jump out this
building and trying to kill him,

581
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:00,420
I wouldn't kill myself.
What,

582
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:03,910
what actually happened was I would
slide down between both buildings

583
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:06,500
excrutiatingly slow scraping the,

584
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,380
the fucking skin off of both ass
cheeks, the back of my head, my nose,

585
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:15,070
and the helmet of my Dick
and the top of my feet.

586
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,520
I would have my feet pointed down
like Greg Louganis, you know,

587
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:22,480
coming out of a fucking triple Lindy
gone right into the Olympic Pool.

588
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,070
How does he do it?

589
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,150
How does he not fucking create
a God damn splash? You're like,

590
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:32,650
that doesn't get enough credit.
That fucking Greg Louganis,

591
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,930
you know all he talk about his, how he
whacked his head and he had his fucking,

592
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,560
you know,

593
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,560
he was HIV positive and it got on the
diving board for the next Ukrainian dude

594
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:44,644
who came up there.

595
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,050
You know what about the fact that he
could basically jump off the Eiffel Tower

596
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:54,000
and somehow against the laws of
physics not have not have a splash.

597
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,970
I would put that guy up there
with the fucking Wayne Gretzky's,

598
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,600
the Michael Jordans. Okay. You know
what? I don't know enough about diving.

599
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,410
So I got a strike that,
but I,

600
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:08,300
I did see some shit this weeks with
someone was saying Koby Bryant had five

601
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:12,860
fucking rings. So if he gets one
next year, he gets number six,

602
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:17,750
then you have to say that he's on par
with Jordan as far as championships. Yes,

603
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,980
we can all do math.

604
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,660
But as far as him ever eclipsing
Michael Jordan, he never will.

605
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,940
And I'm gonna,
I'm gonna tell you this right now.

606
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,260
Not only will he never
eclipse Michael Jordan,

607
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,290
he's not even fucking close and know
what all you Laker fans are thinking,

608
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,320
but wait a minute, fucker. He's
doing the same fucking moves.

609
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:46,480
Yes he is. Yes he is. Physically,

610
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,160
he can do what Michael
Jordan can do. Yes, he can.

611
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,830
All right, but this is the
difference. Michael Jordan
created those fucking moves.

612
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,310
All right?

613
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:02,290
You can find a guitarist in your fucking
neighborhood who can play Voodoo child.

614
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,640
Does that mean they're as good as Jimi
Hendrix who wrote the fucking Song,

615
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:12,040
who is 20 years ahead of his fucking
any other guitarist on the planet?

616
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,980
Look, as great as Stevie Ray Vaughan is,
I love that guy to death. He can't touch,

617
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,280
he can't fucking touch Jimi Hendrix.
He can't.

618
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,410
Hendrix came up with that Shit and
then fucking Stevie ray modernized it,

619
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,200
but it was Jimmy Shit.
You know what I mean?

620
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,820
It's like a pilot take you learns how
to fly and then tries to compare himself

621
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,540
to Orville and Wilbur
Wright. Oh, they, they've,

622
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,770
they fucking flew only across the field
and flying across the whole country.

623
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,510
I'm 3000 miles better than the
people who invented flying.

624
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,380
All right. Now Colby, Bryan has the,

625
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:59,080
the I think has the athletic
gifts of Michael Jordan.

626
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,800
And if you had the two of them play each
other one on one at the height of their

627
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:07,300
powers, it would be the greatest
one on one game ever. All right.

628
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,860
But as far as the forward
thinking, the, the,

629
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,260
the athletic genius.
Coby Brian has not an inventor.

630
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,040
He isn't, he does have the drive.
He's got all that other shit,

631
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:26,041
but he doesn't have the ability to take
the game 20 years into the future where

632
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:28,600
he has no fucking pier.

633
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,230
There was no arguments when Jordan played,

634
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,370
there was no arguments about who the best
guy in the league was for the last 10

635
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:38,380
years of his career.
There was a, you know,

636
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:42,640
early on before he established
himself, you know, people, you know,

637
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,940
we're throwing other names in there.
But after you know,

638
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,530
fucking 89 there was no question
who the best player was.

639
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,680
And by fucking 92 93 he was without a
doubt the greatest basketball player of

640
00:40:56,741 --> 00:41:01,570
all time. And he still is
Koby Bryant on the other hand,

641
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,750
his entire career, there's always
been, well what about this guy?

642
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,990
What about that guy you
know right now is Colby,

643
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,600
Lebron James? You know,
I still give it to Colby.

644
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,980
Colby is still uh,
beyond Lebron James,

645
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:21,520
but Lebron James is very close.
There was no one near Jordan.

646
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,350
I can't even explain it to you.

647
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,800
It's like when you talk to those
fucking Douche bags from the baby boom

648
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:30,910
generation,
those selfish Kuntz who hang their hat on,

649
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:34,500
they stopped the Vietnam War and
then became corporate douche bags.

650
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,620
Um, that's a big generalization
for you. Like they always say like,

651
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,270
no matter how much you
get into the Beatles,

652
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:46,040
you just can't wrap your head around
what it was like when they put out an

653
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:50,060
album, how far ahead they
were from everybody else.

654
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,080
It's the same thing with Richard Pryor
because what happens is as the years go

655
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,540
by,
everybody rips those,

656
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,660
those geniuses off and everybody gets
caught up to where the fuck they were.

657
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,160
And what usually happens
is if you're young,

658
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,960
you're watching the contemporary people
and then as you go back in time you go

659
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,190
back 30 years, you go all the way back to
prior and you see him do the black guy,

660
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:17,930
white guy thing and so many people have
ripped him off that that the genius of

661
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:22,370
what he does is, is a little
tainted. You know what I mean?

662
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,790
So that's like when people look at Colby
and that and they go back and they look

663
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,340
at Jordan,
they take for granted

664
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,930
what Kobe's doing now because it just
seems it just like that's what basketball

665
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,510
is now because Jordan showed,

666
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,510
showed them what was possible. You
understand what the fuck I'm saying here.

667
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,350
I'm sure Laker fans won't
fucking, they, they'll,

668
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:51,230
they'll argue it but they're
fucking morons anyways.

669
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,740
They're going to be like Jordan
is just as good as Jordan.

670
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,080
You know the same way.

671
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:02,081
They try to claim that they have fucking
16 championships or this other do.

672
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:06,290
She wrote me this week who tried
to say they have 18 this such,

673
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:10,250
there's just no way to
respect a Laker fan.

674
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,930
I just cause some, they're just
transplanted. Fucking does.

675
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,300
There's so few people from Los Angeles.

676
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,570
And what happens is people move out there,
you know,

677
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,170
Hollywood fucking phoneys and
then the Lakers, you know,

678
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:27,150
they always have some fucking
amazing team. There are a hell of,

679
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,010
they're an awesome franchise.
I think they've uh,

680
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,580
wait how many championships
they got since 1980 he won five.

681
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,110
Eight. They won nine. They're
better than the Yankees since 1980.

682
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,770
Better than the Canadians. They
had the franchise. All right.

683
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,890
This will all these fucking assholes go
out there and they see Jack Nicholas at

684
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,920
a fucking true fan.
Jack Nicholson.

685
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,190
What the fuck is wrong with me every
time I want to say Jack Nicholas,

686
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:57,770
I say Nicholson and vice a versa there.

687
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,270
God help me if they're ever
in the same fucking room,

688
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,130
really built when the fuck
would that happen. Huh?

689
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,890
When you do some corporate gig for some
people who actually did something with

690
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:13,760
their life and you go in there like a
dancing monkey and then afterwards try to

691
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:17,150
talk to them in the green room.
Is there clearly blowing you off?

692
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,210
Um, anyways, the fuck am I
talking about here? Yeah.

693
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:26,520
All those Douche bag Laker fans. You
know, I talked to one the other day like,

694
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:30,230
well dude, I'm die hard. I'm die hard.
And I found out he was from New York.

695
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,580
How the fuck do you go from being
a Knicks fan to being a Lakers fan?

696
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,950
I'll tell you why.
You become a fucking phony.

697
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,060
How do you leave New York and moved
to la? How do you do that? You know,

698
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:46,050
unless you're in show business. Which
was he? I think he was, I can't remember.

699
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:49,080
I drank so much just fucking week.
I'll of everybody's just amalgam.

700
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,710
Everybody's just a big, just
amalgamating, if that's even a word,

701
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,270
into just one big face

702
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,230
running their goddamn miles.

703
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,410
My own fucking lawyer is a Laker Fan.
Okay.

704
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:09,180
And we had that argument about the 16
championships and he just would not answer

705
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:09,781
my questions.

706
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:14,460
I got a real thrill out of it of being
a lawyer in a fucking argument because I

707
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,820
just kept hitting him with
that argument. You know? I go,

708
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:21,500
you go to the staples center. All right.
Now, you know, first of all, if you,

709
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,970
if you got to make a 16 championship
tee shirt, because the law,

710
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:26,903
the Laker,

711
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,860
the Laker franchise has 16 championships.

712
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:34,680
That is undebatable.
Okay?

713
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:39,681
But the Los Angeles Lakers have 11
the Minneapolis Lakers have five.

714
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,910
So when you make those 16
championship fucking tee shirts,

715
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:49,890
you got to say Minneapolis
slash Los Angeles. Okay?

716
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,380
Take the hint from the Laker franchise.

717
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:55,950
When you go to the staples center and
they don't have the Minneapolis banners up

718
00:45:55,951 --> 00:46:00,951
there because those banners belonged to
the franchise slash the fans of fucking

719
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,660
Minnesota in Minneapolis the same way.

720
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:11,520
And I've made this fucking goddamn example
a zillion times and I'm going to keep

721
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:14,670
making it because every fucking week,
some Goddamn Laker Fan,

722
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,610
this is the last week I'm going to do
it because now people have sent me those

723
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:18,600
emails on purpose.

724
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,170
But like if the Lakers now moved
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas,

725
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,320
they win it next year for the franchise
is 17th Championship people in Los

726
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,260
Angeles. What would you do with somebody
from Vegas came walking up to you when?

727
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:35,910
What that 17 bitch,
we have 17 fucking NBA championships.

728
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,650
We are the New York Yankees of
fucking basketball. Would that,

729
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:45,060
would that make sense to you
if you saw Las Vegas Lakers?

730
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,710
17 championships and they will walk
it around, thrust in their chests out

731
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,820
the Boston Celtics have won 17
championships all in Boston. Okay,

732
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,010
that's it. And a few people in La, you're
still confused. Like I've said before,

733
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,780
just think how count,

734
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:08,220
how many times you've thrown a rock
through the wind storefront window of an

735
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:11,310
athlete's foot foot.
I can't even fucking talk this week.

736
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,400
How many times do you
burned down your city?

737
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,160
How many times you've
burned down the La area?

738
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,220
That's how many championships you have.
All right?

739
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:24,210
So stop padding you fucking resume.
Like all you can do out there.

740
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,540
You're a god Damn Pa and by the
time you type up your resume,

741
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:32,541
you fucking directed the movie fucking
phoneys who can't even show up to the

742
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:35,990
game on time. Um, all right,

743
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,910
well we go on. Hey, where the fuck
did we go from here? All right,

744
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:43,600
so how much time did that take
up? How much momentum. All right.

745
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,370
That was a good 14 fucking minutes.

746
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,800
Let me shut off this overhead light
made out of fucking piece of shit.

747
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:55,450
Plastic, 400 bucks a
night, fucking pricks. Um,

748
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,680
anyways, I am here in New York and, uh,

749
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,720
I did the Montreal comedy festival
this week. Uh, that was a big thrill,

750
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,191
you know,

751
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:09,370
that's why I drank so fucking much this
week and I just ran into a bunch of

752
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:13,030
comedians I haven't seen in a long,
long fucking time.

753
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,350
Um, you know, because everybody
I know fucking headlines now,

754
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,810
so we never get to work together anymore.

755
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,870
So just we're drinking and telling stories
and just laughing our fucking asses

756
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:29,920
off and I'll tell you,
it's a goddamn shame nobody filmed it.

757
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:35,370
Cause there's like nine
zillion documentaries out
there trying to capture the

758
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:40,780
backstage stand up fucking thing.
And uh,

759
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,640
I don't think they've ever done it.

760
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:45,550
And the only way you could ever do it
is if you'd have to do it like a reality

761
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,040
show.
Will You keep the cameras rolling

762
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,100
24,
seven.

763
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:54,130
And that way people gradually forget about
them because that's what they have to

764
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,140
do. They have to forget
that they're on camera.

765
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,500
So you actually hear the
fucking stories and the,

766
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:05,170
uh, I don't know if the level you have
to go to, to make another comedian laugh.

767
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,650
Um,
this put it this way,

768
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:13,270
this podcast is PG 13 compared to the
shit that we talk about. So anyways,

769
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,500
that's what I was doing. I was drinking
booze. I was having a great time up there.

770
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,000
Um, and I'm fucking wiped out. But um,

771
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:25,690
I'm actually taping this right
now on the 18th, Sunday the 18th,

772
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,210
and I'm doing the David Letterman program,
the late show tomorrow night.

773
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,240
I got my suit, I got to get my shoes
polished. I got my fucking cufflinks,

774
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,570
you know, nice fucking
shirt. And as always,

775
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:44,020
I know people are going to send me
emails. Dude, why did you wear is?

776
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,730
Why did you dress up for the
greatest fucking, you know,

777
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,680
talk show out there,
Bill,

778
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:57,610
I don't understand it. Everybody else
on the show is dress really nicely.

779
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,580
Why did you go on the show
and dress really nicely?

780
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:05,710
Why didn't you go out there and dress
like you were headlining the funny bone in

781
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:10,360
fucking Dayton, Ohio? Why did you dress
like you were in the Ed Sullivan Theater?

782
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,680
Do you guys realize you young punks that
that's the fucking same stage where the

783
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:19,360
Beatles came out and broke in the
United States. And if you'll watch him,

784
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,710
they were wearing suits.

785
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,480
Your dumb fucks really don't understand
that you show up to a Toga party.

786
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:29,270
If you wear a suit, you can give
somebody then when in Rome cunts,

787
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:34,730
when in Rome. Um, so anyways, this is
going to be my fifth appearance and uh,

788
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,020
I'm really excited. I
got a nice tight set. Um,

789
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,190
I am kind of making fun of mothers
right out of the gates. So, uh,

790
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,170
as always,
you know,

791
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,380
there's always a bit of awkwardness
before people realize that I look like a

792
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:51,590
puppet and then I'm harmless
and then I just write it,

793
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,700
write it right through.
And uh,

794
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,210
and then what's going to
happen is after the show,

795
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:03,200
I'm going to have the fucking euphoria
that I did it and I survived it.

796
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,150
And, uh, then I'm going to go out
and I'm gonna stay out too late

797
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,860
and then my alarm clock's going to go
off 20 minutes later and I'm going to be

798
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,430
in the worst fucking move ever.
I better have a window seat.

799
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,180
That's all I can tell you because if I
get woken up, if I get the aisle seat,

800
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:25,040
you know,
I hate how people wake you up on a plane.

801
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,780
When a stranger wakes you up.

802
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,060
Is there anything more creepier than
the touch of a stranger trying to not

803
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:36,350
disturb you from your sleep?
That little two fingered,

804
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,910
not quite a poke,

805
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,890
not quite a caress that they do into
your shoulder and then they speak in half

806
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,370
sentences. They don't just,
they don't just, you know,

807
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,700
you know, you know, it'd be
acceptable like a man demand, like a,

808
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:55,190
a back of the hand fucking on,

809
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:57,650
on the side of your leg
as intimate as that sound.

810
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,790
I'll give you the sound just like this.
Hey Man, I gotta get up. Use the bathroom.

811
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,110
I, so just like that, but for
some reason, because she just,

812
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,630
I don't know if it's because of nine
11. I don't know what, but people just,

813
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,030
they the two finger and then they,

814
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:14,060
and then they sort of
whisper a half a sentence.

815
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,480
They fuck you just feel this
creepy fucking pedophile touch.

816
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,040
It startles you. The exact
thing they don't want to do.
It's such a creepy touch.

817
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,150
It does startle you.

818
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,570
You fucking whip your head around
over to them and then it's some,

819
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:31,180
another man whispering I half a
sentence. Yeah. I just had to, yeah, I,

820
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,980
I just wanted to get,
can I just,

821
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,410
can you just what you fucking asshole
finished the God damn sentence and stop

822
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:43,040
fucking
finger raping me.

823
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,420
Whatever the hell you just did there.

824
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:49,840
That's the old shoulder finger
rape at 30,000 feet. Um,

825
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,770
which is actually a new phrase,
acceptable in the Webster's dictionary.

826
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:55,610
Can you believe that?

827
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,960
How many times I'm so sick of them
fucking bringing that up on talk shows.

828
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,360
Do you know that chillin is now an
acceptable word in the dictionary? Well,

829
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:09,650
do you know that everybody's using it?
You fucking idiot.

830
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,060
That's how they become words.

831
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,690
You can have words that everybody is
using and you're not going to put them in

832
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:19,460
the dictionary. Why are people so
fucking stuck up about that? Ooh,

833
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,210
good Chilean Knute mood

834
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,850
and be like, does any class
left you fucking doing Vegas?

835
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:34,670
People showing up and Hawaiian shorts
with flip flops and you can't put shelling

836
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,630
in the God damn dictionary. You know, keep
stopping these fucking plagues people.

837
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:40,830
And that's what you're going to have.

838
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,460
You're going to have a weaker
species of fucking human beings.

839
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,553
All right?

840
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,040
And they're going to use fucking slang
words and eventually you're going to have

841
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,210
to stick them in the dictionary
because you're gonna want to commute.

842
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,820
Be able to communicate to the people.

843
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,460
You always have to be able
to communicate to the people.

844
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,590
Because if you can't communicate to them,

845
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,150
then you can't give them the fucking lie.
You can't spend your own fucking story

846
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,970
of why we're all scampering around down
here as you sit in your fucking manner.

847
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,540
You know,
I've been dying to do a bit

848
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,920
about the kind of people I think
should have get the death penalty

849
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,030
and one of them is these fucking
bankers. I really believe, man,

850
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:25,170
if you shake up the economy like a
goddamn ant farm and you make fucking old

851
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:28,680
people have to eat al Po for the
last 18 years of their fucking life,

852
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,060
and I might just talking about five
or six of them. I'm talking about an,

853
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,290
you know, a large percentage
of an entire generation.

854
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:41,730
These fucking banker
cunts fucked over people.

855
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,580
Basically the generation
that won World War II,

856
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,940
it's unbelievable that even go to jail.
They don't even fucking go to jail.

857
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,640
I Dunno. I think they should
give all old people fucking,

858
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,480
they should just give them those paintball
guns and then they should just tell

859
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:04,380
him where the,
where the fucking rich people live,

860
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,440
the bankers and they should just go on
and just see every once in a while drive

861
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:10,530
by and shoot them and
they never get arrested.

862
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,980
That's what I think that they
should do. All right. Once again,

863
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,360
just like the last two podcasts.

864
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:19,080
This thing's starting to Peter
out right around 21 minutes.

865
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,430
52 seconds.
Can I be funny up until 22 seconds,

866
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,240
I got another four seconds to do it.
Three seconds. That's not going to happen.

867
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,240
Jesus.
This is the longest 15 minutes ever.

868
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,810
Fucking God damn judges popped out too.

869
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,560
I tell you guys that they said
that I grinded my teeth at night.

870
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:38,490
Like I didn't know that.

871
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:43,050
I didn't know that I was
an absolute psycho and had
angry dreams about murdering

872
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:43,650
people.

873
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:48,450
So they give me this fucking mouth guard
and I put the mouth guard on and now my

874
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:50,940
jaw just dislocates every once in a while

875
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,180
and I so don't like paperwork and shit
that I would never even consider sowing

876
00:55:57,181 --> 00:56:01,800
them. Oh my God, this sucks and I've just
figured out how to pop it back in again.

877
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,000
All right, now it's out of alignment. Let
me see if, let me try to bite down. Yeah.

878
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,380
What the fuck? I feel like I had
a ball side of my fucking jaw.

879
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,900
Any dentists out there can
tell me why that happened?

880
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,810
I can't even, you know, you know why the
first time it happened, I can't leave.

881
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,740
I'm going to tell you this.

882
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,970
I can't tell you how the
time I dislocated my jaw was,

883
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,250
uh,

884
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,613
okay.

885
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,830
How do I tell it in a clean
way? I don't do sex jokes, but,

886
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:39,760
uh,

887
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:44,380
I was going down on a girl then I was
trying to fucking jam my tongue in there

888
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,510
and I think it, it pushed my lower
back. She was getting really into it,

889
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,870
you know, and I was younger, so I
didn't know how to make them come.

890
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,100
And she was getting close and I was so
fucking exhausted. I just went forward.

891
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,800
I was in the red zone and I was like,
we got a score here.

892
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:02,430
This fucking game is over.
And then when, uh, you know,

893
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,050
I came up out of the fucking,

894
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,520
what the fuck do you call it?
I don't know. The concubines.

895
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,060
I know some word with a see that began
there and I wasn't going to say can't I

896
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:14,530
came up out of there,
uh,

897
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,670
you know what that laminated face and a,
yeah,

898
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,730
I noticed it was difficult to bite down
and ever since then I had a problem.

899
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,810
I think it just ruined my lawsuit cause
if they'll listen to the podcast and

900
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:30,850
actually he admits on
the podcast on July 18th,

901
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,013
2010.
Yeah.

902
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:39,470
Then it was actually jamming his
tongue until Vagina in Laughlin,

903
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:40,304
Nevada.

904
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,550
There's no way to make that
up. It's fucking true. Ah,

905
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,210
Jesus Christ isn't aging.

906
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:58,130
Isn't it just funny how things
like that happen. Anyways,

907
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,950
Jesus Christ.
What a fucker thing to admit.

908
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,680
You can tell him flailing when I
started the fucking admit and that shit.

909
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:06,810
24 minutes. Here we go.
Okay, let's plow ahead.

910
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,470
I was watching ESPN today and um,

911
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,830
and of course, you know, as always,

912
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:20,030
you had four really intelligent people
on a panel who are all involved in a

913
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:23,280
debate that none of them
knew was even remotely true,

914
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:28,140
but they engaged in it anyways because
it would piss off a guy like me and make

915
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:32,400
me continue to watch so that I then
see the commercials so they can justify

916
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,940
their advertising so that those
four cock suckers can get paid.

917
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:39,930
I refuse to believe that Bob Ryan,
John Saunders,

918
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:41,910
though they're not dumb guys.
They're not.

919
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,290
But if you listen to what they're arguing,
it's the stupidest shit ever.

920
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,780
Basically because a tiger woods
hasn't won a major this year.

921
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:56,760
They're questioning whether he's ever
basically going to be able to put it back

922
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:57,594
together again.

923
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,440
Completely ignoring the fact that he got
busted for cheating almost 30 times on

924
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:06,540
his wife in front of the entire country,

925
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:11,130
and that he's going through a
divorce right now that you know,

926
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,170
she wants $700 million

927
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,280
and he's wants to give her 300 million.

928
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:21,410
They're in the process of
negotiating that. And also he's got,

929
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,070
he's going through a period in his life
where he realized that he fucked up his

930
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:29,630
whole marriage. You know, if
you guys, you know, not forget,

931
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,040
if you haven't fucked up relationship,

932
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:34,160
you haven't gone through relationship
that ends and you got to go through your

933
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:37,640
fucking town and everywhere you go
you got a memory of that person.

934
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,360
You sit in there welling
up in a Johnny rockets.

935
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,150
Would you like to get some French fries?
See a thing.

936
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,120
She loved French fries. We used to
share him, um, all that shit. So he,

937
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:54,050
you don't think he's going
through that on a worldwide basis,

938
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:57,980
traveled the world with that
woman and just be, you know,

939
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,330
when you fuck up to that level, you
always want to go back. You know,

940
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:04,760
you have to go through the
regret before you can move on.

941
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:06,830
So I'm sure he's sitting
there at the British open.

942
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,460
As much as he's trying to block it
out as much as he's a competitor,

943
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,700
there's no way as a human being few
not to be sitting here going, man,

944
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,640
this time last year my
life was so different.

945
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,200
Even though I didn't win it
last year when I came up on 18,

946
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,110
but she didn't play last year because
his knee was hurt for whatever the last

947
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:28,400
time he played it, you
know, um, or maybe did,

948
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,234
I don't fucking know.

949
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,630
He was coming up 18 and his
wife was sitting there with
their kid and he got the

950
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:36,440
hug and on the kiss and all that
type of shit and it's not there.

951
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,340
And he has to deal with that. And
this is a fucking guy that, you know,

952
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,390
he's a human being is such idiots.

953
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:48,560
The guy won a fucking tournament when
his knee was blown out and he was

954
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,030
screaming in pain after every God
damn shot. And he's still fucking one.

955
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,910
And they're going to question this
guy with a reconstructed knee.

956
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,480
You know, the guys in his early thirties,
they've already written them off.

957
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:07,280
Jack Nicholas won his final
fucking, uh, master's at like 45,

958
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:10,040
46 years of age. It's this, it's,

959
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:15,370
the whole debate was so fucking
beneath guys like Bob Ryan,

960
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,050
John Saunders, who was that? Who the guy
was. It was if you just sit there going,

961
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,010
you guys don't even believe this shit.

962
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,480
You just trying to cause controversy
because you have to fill up 24 fucking

963
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,980
hours. And that right there is why
I don't watch those shows, you know,

964
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,821
but you know,

965
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,120
unless I'm on the fucking road and
I've got nothing else to do and then it

966
01:01:34,121 --> 01:01:39,050
completely fucking pisses me off.
Anyways,

967
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,350
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

968
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:48,530
here's a question I got this week,
um, from a listener. Um, Bill,

969
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,430
I have a question.

970
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:55,400
I had been dating a Filipina girl who
is too short to be seen with in public.

971
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:01,400
Geez. I mean, what, what a,
what a way to start the story.

972
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,700
I'm seeing a girl who I can't
be seen with in public. Okay.

973
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,350
This relationship has legs.
Um,

974
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,110
and the fact that I'm six foot
three doesn't help at all. I mean,

975
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:15,200
she is really small for foot five.

976
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:20,520
This is one of the great sentences
I've ever read. Listen to this.

977
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,470
Technically she's a midget.

978
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,180
So you would think people would kind of
leave us alone out of respect for her

979
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:28,014
shortness.

980
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,970
Sir. Do you realize that really short
people or little people want to be called

981
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:40,260
little people? They midget
is offensive. I learned that.

982
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,660
I didn't think it was,
I actually have that on my CD going.

983
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:45,450
It was never a racial slur.
You know,

984
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:49,020
midgets weren't dragged here from
another country and forced to do labor.

985
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,200
You're a midget.
What's wrong with that?

986
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,260
And evidently a PT Barnum came up with
it or something just to let you know,

987
01:02:58,261 --> 01:03:01,560
cause I didn't know midget was offensive
either. Right. I knew it was offensive,

988
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:06,561
but I didn't understand why a midge is
like the name for a really tiny bug I

989
01:03:07,531 --> 01:03:09,960
guess. So that's what they were
saying. They say when you like,

990
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,070
you were like as small as a little boy.

991
01:03:12,071 --> 01:03:16,020
They were comparing it to a little
fucking insect, you know? And that goes,

992
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:20,820
the elephant man think I am not an
insect. I am a human being. Well,

993
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:25,740
it's the do with Mooc. It's um,
so technically she's a midget.

994
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:28,830
So you would think people would kind of
leave us alone out of respect for her

995
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:29,670
shortness.

996
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,840
But people's people stare
me down everywhere we go.

997
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,300
She's cute,
nice and sweet,

998
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:39,900
but I feel uncomfortable being
part of a side show all the time.

999
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,890
Do you think it's acceptable
for a tall man to date a tiny,

1000
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:48,960
a tiny women, tiny woman is what you
mean? Do I think it's acceptable?

1001
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:53,730
Yeah, it's totally acceptable.
Date with who you want to a date.

1002
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,421
What's not?

1003
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:58,230
What's not acceptable is dating someone
you're not comfortable being seen within

1004
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,150
public?
Um,

1005
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:05,270
I would work on not giving a fuck or
I would get out of the relationship

1006
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:06,660
because,
uh,

1007
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:12,160
I don't know how she hasn't
picked up on it already. But, uh,

1008
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:16,620
if you're not comfortable with the
person you're dating, I mean, I mean,

1009
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:20,520
I don't know if someone can walk down
the street with me and be comfortable

1010
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:25,350
walking down the street with a fucking
redheaded freak. Um, I think that,

1011
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:29,760
ah, you know, you could get
comfortable with her and when you,

1012
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:32,550
when you walked down the street with the,
you don't have her like fucking,

1013
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,980
you know,
what are those?

1014
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,560
You don't have them. One of
those kiddie things, you know,

1015
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:44,790
where she's sitting on you that
your chest like a fucking primate.

1016
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,700
I guess we're all primates,
aren't we? You know,

1017
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,850
in monkeys when the fucking monkey
just hangs on the other, you know,

1018
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:54,360
wraps her arms around your back.
Yeah, I'm being a Dick Right now.

1019
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:58,860
You ever in a fanny pack? See this? I'm
doing the exact fucking thing. Well,

1020
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,440
you got to understand that's what people
are going to do. You got to understand.

1021
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:02,280
If you're a different looking,

1022
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:06,360
couple people are going to give you
shit and you just got to get beyond it.

1023
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,760
You know, that's all I can say. I
shouldn't have made those jokes.

1024
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,220
Cause now you're probably thinking
like see you being a cunt to,

1025
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,570
I'm not being a condom.

1026
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:20,200
Being a guy who is not even remotely
funny this fucking week trying to trudge

1027
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:24,340
through 15 fucking minutes, 50
minutes of a podcast. All right?

1028
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:29,260
So I have to make fun of everything. So,
uh, I dunno. She's adorable. She's nice.

1029
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:33,960
If you think she's the one I
would, I would stay with her. Um,

1030
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,620
if you don't think she's the one,

1031
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:40,000
get out of it immediately because
even if she's not the one,

1032
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:43,630
eventually you'll have feelings for.
And then when you break up with her,

1033
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,350
you know, when you sat her on
the coffee table and say, look,

1034
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:48,430
we have to have a talk.

1035
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:56,320
I'm sorry dude, I'm on any
joke, any, any port in a storm,

1036
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:01,060
I gotta fucking do it. And she starts
crying. You know, it's the worst.

1037
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,900
That's why you know something. I'll
tell you right now. This is why like,

1038
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,380
I love how it's unacceptable to break
up with somebody over the phone.

1039
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:13,590
You know who came up with that is women
because they know how guilty they can

1040
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:16,930
make us fucking feel
when they start crying.

1041
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,000
They want to make us feel is,

1042
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,480
it's a total vindictive fucking mood.

1043
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,350
There's nothing wrong with breaking
up with somebody on the phone.

1044
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:31,000
There's nothing wrong with like that
dude on sex in the city who wrote it on a

1045
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:35,410
post it and stuck it to the TV.
I have a girlfriend.

1046
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,980
I have seen some episodes of that show.
Um,

1047
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:43,420
although I never get through the whole
one because I would always piss my girl

1048
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:48,421
off cause anytime the hoary girl would
make us anything she said in the show was

1049
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:53,560
always sexually related. And I told
you guys this before, need any lines?

1050
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:54,850
She said after she said it,

1051
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:59,851
I would just go cause she's a whore and
it would just piss my girl off to no one

1052
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:04,780
until by the end of the show she was
doing it too. But anyways, I digressed.

1053
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:09,550
Let's fucking, let's fucking just
plow ahead. There's nothing wrong

1054
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,550
no matter what.
It's going to make him cry.

1055
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,370
There's nothing wrong with breaking
up with someone through email.

1056
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,920
There's nothing wrong with
doing it with the post it,

1057
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:21,670
there's nothing wrong with doing it over
the phone in a way. There's actually,

1058
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:23,290
it's a caring thing that they're doing.

1059
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:28,270
It's like I care about you so much and
it would hurt me so much to see how much

1060
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:31,660
I'm hurting you that I can't even deal
with watching how much I'm going to hurt

1061
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:34,000
you. You know, and you're out.

1062
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,560
It's a vindictive thing that
women want you eyeball to eyeball.

1063
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,700
Watch you stand there and
watch you crush them by saying,

1064
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:46,210
I don't want to be in a fucking
relationship with you anymore. You know,

1065
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:48,370
it's fucking awful.
What I always do,

1066
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,280
and you know back in the day when I
used to have to break up with somebody,

1067
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,700
I used to just think
this, all right, dude,

1068
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:00,820
it's, it's two hours of your
life. The first leg of it,

1069
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:04,480
it's like the Tour de France, okay? We're
just trying to get to the mountains.

1070
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:08,890
All right? The first two
hour fucking leg, all right?

1071
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,060
She's going to cry. It's going to suck.
We have to stick to you fucking guns.

1072
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:16,010
All right? Sit down. Just say,

1073
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:18,500
and there's probably people out there
right now who need to get out of a

1074
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:22,250
relationship and you just don't know how
to do it cause you're young. All right?

1075
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,300
It's not going to get better.
You can't make yourself love the person.

1076
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,160
You just have to fucking get out of it.

1077
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,940
And this goes for the broads out
there too. He just have to go, look,

1078
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,220
we need to talk. All right.
I don't know what's going on,

1079
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:42,110
but I'm just not happy anymore,

1080
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:46,520
you know? And you can use all the
hacky stuff. You're a great person,

1081
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:51,860
but I'm just not, I'm not
feeling it. I'm just not.

1082
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,720
And you know, that's, that's
a hold of her is to it.

1083
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,360
Look at Murray, get nervous, just
picture of the girl crying, crying.

1084
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:04,430
It's all there. You know, you're, it's not
fair to you. It's not fair to you. It's

1085
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,430
so, what do you say? We care
can't work. And this is the thing,

1086
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:11,630
they try to fucking,

1087
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,730
they try to save it and you just have
to be like that dude in the first star

1088
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:20,750
wars. Stay on target,
stay on target. Right.

1089
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,900
Well, you know, I've, I've been
thinking things like that too.

1090
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:30,020
I just think we don't see each
other enough big, you know?

1091
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:32,450
And maybe that's what I've been avoiding.
You,

1092
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:36,960
you can't say that can't be mean
and just be like, look, no. Um, um,

1093
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,120
it's truly how I feel and

1094
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,380
yeah, that's, it's just,
it's just how I feel.

1095
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,980
And then just let them
a moat and let them go.

1096
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,863
You know,

1097
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,250
it's like deep sea fishing
when you get that line in,

1098
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,690
the fucking thing takes off. We
got a bike, you gotta let it go.

1099
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,060
You can't fucking clamp the thing
down and then snap the line.

1100
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,480
You know, zen, she's free.

1101
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:12,110
She's going to come back around and
attack the fucking boat, like in jaws.

1102
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,110
You gotta let her go jump up out of the
water, flop around and get fucking tired,

1103
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:24,680
you know, and, and uh, yeah, and you just,

1104
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,700
you just, it's a two
hour fucking thing. Okay.

1105
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,300
And all you have to do is just say how
you're feeling and then just let her

1106
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:34,850
fucking run and start fucking crying

1107
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,500
and go through all the emotions
she needs to, to, to get through.

1108
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,200
And you just have to sit
there and stick to your guns.

1109
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:48,890
All right? And then
comes, the hardest part

1110
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:54,470
is, uh, if you're in her
apartment, that's a great thing.

1111
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:56,030
So you can fucking leave.

1112
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:00,740
It's worse if they do it in your apartment
because then you have to kick them

1113
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:04,670
out. So yeah, that's how I feel. And, uh,

1114
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,990
I need you to vacate the premises and
right as you say that you got to have your

1115
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:09,980
friends step out,

1116
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:14,500
dress like a bouncer with one of those
fucking cell ear ear piece. Thanks.

1117
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,120
Okay.

1118
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,440
Standing there like a bouncing,

1119
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,350
you know when they stand with their
hands folded in front of him one hand

1120
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,800
holding the wrist of the
other arm, you know, no,

1121
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,170
you got to do it over to
her place and just say,

1122
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:30,803
you know,

1123
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,140
okay,

1124
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,660
I'm not going to date anybody for a
while or whatever the fuck you guys say.

1125
01:11:34,661 --> 01:11:39,520
And I, I just, and if she says,

1126
01:11:39,521 --> 01:11:43,600
can I call you? You just, yeah,
you just say yes, yes you can.

1127
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:48,450
And then decide whether you really
meant that or not later. But, uh,

1128
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:55,570
and I dunno. And then you got,
I don't know, then you get,

1129
01:11:55,571 --> 01:11:57,190
you got to get it and then
he got to get away from him.

1130
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:02,960
You got to get away from him. Um,
because if you keep coming back,

1131
01:12:02,961 --> 01:12:07,220
it just starts the pain over again.
And then also

1132
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,580
on your level is you're going to have to
try to get over them even though you're

1133
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:15,200
are over him,
but still now you're going to be alone.

1134
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:17,990
You can have that panic attack.
Well, who am I going to be with?

1135
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:22,490
What did I used to do when I was single?
How did I fill up all this fucking time?

1136
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,510
Just ride it out. Just know it's going
to suck for six weeks. All right?

1137
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:32,480
Six weeks later you're out.
Football season starts,

1138
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,820
you know the smell of fall comes
through the fucking windows.

1139
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,730
Okay?

1140
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,670
You know?
Yeah,

1141
01:12:40,671 --> 01:12:44,240
buddy fucking brings over maybe a
couple of girls that were into sports.

1142
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,640
You find another one.
God Damn. I look at her

1143
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:53,660
and then you're a, you're on your fucking
way. It's spring again in the fall.

1144
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:59,300
See, it has a happy ending. That's
how you fucking do it. Jesus Christ.

1145
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,510
There was some advice for you.
How to fucking break up with somebody.

1146
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,960
Do you guys have any stories about like
the worst way you were ever broken up

1147
01:13:05,961 --> 01:13:10,190
with or the best,
best way somebody ever broke up with you?

1148
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:12,883
You know,

1149
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,200
I broke up with someone one time
and then I bought her a hot dog

1150
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:26,150
and it was weird. It was when I was a
little bit older and I just had a really,

1151
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:31,070
it was just totally fucking honest. I
just had an honest talk and I said, look,

1152
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:36,500
we're both, we're both couple
psychos. I mean, haven't you noticed?

1153
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:40,970
I had you ever have that fucking
relationship where everything,

1154
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,730
it just doesn't feel right
and then you freak out,

1155
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:46,340
you have an argument and
then you've just fuck,

1156
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,630
and then it feels right again.

1157
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,470
And then it slowly starts going off
course again and then you have a big

1158
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,660
argument and then you
fuck again right after it.

1159
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:00,580
And I know I just finally hit me. It
was just like, yeah, well this is just,

1160
01:14:00,581 --> 01:14:05,120
this relationship isn't working, really
isn't working. And then what happens is,

1161
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:09,530
is then we fuck. And it's
a lot of fun. It's just,

1162
01:14:09,531 --> 01:14:14,340
it's just based on sex. We're having a
really good time fucking before indicating

1163
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,130
if I could try to be a gentleman here.
That's basically what we're doing.

1164
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:23,510
But other than that, we don't
really enjoy each other's company.

1165
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,343
You want a hot dog?

1166
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:33,821
You know what it was,

1167
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:38,821
was I did it early enough
in the relationship where
the woman's still actually

1168
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:41,710
respected me and she
actually complimented me.

1169
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:45,660
I mean it was a little more
involved than that. MMM.

1170
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,720
But she actually called me. She
goes, you know what that was. Yeah,

1171
01:14:48,721 --> 01:14:50,760
that was a pretty good breakup.
I got to give it to you.

1172
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:52,860
Then you walk me down to the train.

1173
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,010
We waved goodbye as the
train slowly went away.

1174
01:14:56,570 --> 01:15:00,750
It was like the end of like a
fucking a film noir movie. What else?

1175
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:04,020
Classic films. He played it for
her. You can play it for me.

1176
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,361
Play it for me.

1177
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:09,720
They're fucking black guy who doesn't
get any lines cause it's 1940.

1178
01:15:09,721 --> 01:15:14,410
[inaudible] math. I um, I was actually a,

1179
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:18,840
the TV here in my walk in closet.
$400 a night fucking hotel.

1180
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:24,320
Um, okay. I was actually watching
that Turner movie classics, man.

1181
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:28,760
Jesus Christ. When I get on that
thing, forget about it. I was actually,

1182
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:32,420
I watched you don't like the road movie.
The Buddy road movie.

1183
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:36,830
I didn't realize this, the first ones,
the guys who invented that genre of movie,

1184
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,380
um,
was um,

1185
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,770
was it bing Crosby and fucking
Bob hope I had no idea.

1186
01:15:45,771 --> 01:15:49,380
And they will write as I had to
go out last night to watch, um,

1187
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:50,840
to go run my set.

1188
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:55,850
They had the third in their trilogy
and I forget of the buddy movies.

1189
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:01,560
I think they did more after that, but
I guess this was the best one. And I,

1190
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:04,490
I can't even remember the name of
the movie, but it, the, basically

1191
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,280
the premise of the movie was that
they went to some fucking Arabian,

1192
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:15,360
you know, back then there was no Middle
East. Everything was just Arabian,

1193
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:18,750
whatever the fuck that meant.
Or does that mean like Arabic country?

1194
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,680
I don't fucking know. But the whole thing
was they had to get out of something.

1195
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:26,700
So Bing Crosby cells,
uh,

1196
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:31,890
Bob Hope into slavery.
Like slavery was still funny back then.

1197
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,170
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

1198
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:36,480
All I know is I watched
the thing and bright,

1199
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:41,520
the movie that I watched right before
that was a movie called zero hour and it

1200
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:46,350
absolutely blew me away.
I'm sitting there watching this movie.

1201
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,940
I came in in the middle of this,

1202
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:53,540
this flick and there's a guy talking
about this guy who's got to try to land

1203
01:16:54,661 --> 01:16:57,640
this plane.
And the guy's name is Ted striker.

1204
01:16:58,670 --> 01:16:59,940
I'm going Ted striker.

1205
01:16:59,941 --> 01:17:04,380
That was the name of the guy in airplane
and it's literally the same movie.

1206
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,930
And I finally fucking realize that that
was the movie that airplane was Perry

1207
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,600
making a parody of,
um,

1208
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:16,610
was a movie called zero hour that came
out in like the mid fifties for the life

1209
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:18,480
of me.
I thought that they will make it fun.

1210
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:23,150
You know those movie airport
airports, 76 airports, 77,

1211
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:24,920
those ones with like George Kennedy,

1212
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,730
I thought that they were making fun
of those movies and they weren't,

1213
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:33,410
they basically almost did a frame
for frame remake of zero hour.

1214
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,950
And, um, if you don't
want to watch the movie,

1215
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:41,570
go on Youtube and watch
airplane versus zero hour,

1216
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:46,160
you can't fucking believe
how similar. I mean,

1217
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,340
all these subtle things.
They brings the kid up to the cockpit.

1218
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,910
A Billy ever been up in a
cockpit before and he's like, no,

1219
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:56,240
this is my first time
except in the real one.

1220
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,470
The first one it drops off there, but
an airplane. Then the guy says, Billy,

1221
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:05,660
you ever seen a grown man naked? They
added all that shit. So zero hour,

1222
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:08,880
check out that movie. I'll give you
the youtube videos for the week.

1223
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,130
Am I at least at 30 minutes? 44 minutes.
I somehow fucking did it again this week.

1224
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:15,380
All right.
Youtube videos of the week.

1225
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,830
Go check out a best have balls
of steel to jackass show from,

1226
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:25,010
I dunno, over in England. And
uh, these guys are fucking great.

1227
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,920
They're fucking,
they're just hilarious.

1228
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:33,680
And they keep going to this Mcdonald's
gimme fall big macs gimme seven double

1229
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:38,000
cheeseburgers and some fucking daddy
down. It's, and I know a ditty donuts are,

1230
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,820
but they just keep going and
some fucking Dedi down. It's,

1231
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,390
and it makes me laugh every time. And
I just butchered it. I'm telling you,

1232
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:49,130
it's funny. And also for you animal
fans out there, watch eagle verse goat,

1233
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,200
I guess in the wild.
This is how strong these eagles are.

1234
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:59,201
They find little goats and they fly
down to them that goes fucking runaway.

1235
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,660
The Eagles grab them,
pick them up,

1236
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:07,040
just we'll grab one of their legs and
they drag him off the cliff and just drop

1237
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,030
them.
That's how they kill him.

1238
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,150
But they actually have the ability
to fly a little bit with them.

1239
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:12,110
That's how strong they are.

1240
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,110
And they wait til they are high enough
and then they just drop them and they

1241
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:20,111
bounced down off the cliff like some
sort of x Gamer who lost his footing and

1242
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:24,590
uh, the goat dies and then they
fly down and they fucking eat it.

1243
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:28,760
And then you go. And I think that that's
going to be the podcast for this week.

1244
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:33,140
Cause I, uh, I actually
have to go a New York,

1245
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:37,970
I got to go do some shit. You
know, people don't go to New York,

1246
01:19:37,971 --> 01:19:39,200
just stay in the hotel rooms.

1247
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:43,880
That's how we justify making him so
fucking small God damn. Cons. Hey,

1248
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:46,880
let me, uh, let me hype some of the
Shit that I actually have coming up.

1249
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,980
Um,

1250
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,940
here's something that
actually fell out of the sky.

1251
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:56,660
I have a gig coming up in Chicago.
All right,

1252
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:02,290
and why isn't my fucking webpage
loading official site of Bill Burr,

1253
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:08,820

make you a better person. Um,

1254

Vaughn and Kevin James.

01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:24,210
It's part of that Vince
Vaughn wild west tour.

1258
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,110
We're doing the park West
Theater in Chicago, Illinois.

1259
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,050

Um,

1260
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:36,330
I'm just going to be doing
like 15 minutes, but it's
gonna be me, Vince Vaughn,

1261
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:40,710
Kevin James, and uh, I forget who else,

1262
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:45,420
but it's like just a ridiculously
star studded show. And I,

1263
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:48,000

out and bring your friends,

1264
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,940
bring everybody you fucking can.
All the proceeds from,

1265
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:58,650
uh, from the show will go to a,
the people who worked on the show,

1266
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:01,520
the performers, all the proceeds
will actually go to the performers,

1267
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,130
the performers, and we'll go
out and buy shiny shit with it.

1268
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:09,030
So just want to thank all
you guys ahead of time.

1269
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,300
After that,

1270
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,950
on July 31st I'll be at the shoreline
amphitheater in mountain view,

1271
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,510
California with like 10 other fucking
comedians doing something up there for a

1272
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:23,650
radio program.
And a,

1273

my next solo show though is going to
be at the comedy store in La Jolla,

1274
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:31,890
California,
which is just north of San Diego.

1275
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:34,950
So all you guys down to San Diego who
have always asked me when the fuck you

1276
01:21:34,951 --> 01:21:38,550
coming.
I'm coming on August 6th and August 7th.

1277
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:42,870
All right. And the last thing
will be, I'm going to hype,

1278
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:45,750
I'm Newport Yachting Center in Newport,
Rhode Island,

1279
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,370
August 12th and the Hampton Beach
Casino and Hampton, New Hampshire,

1280
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,500
Hampton Beach, New Hampshire on
August 13th. And I'm, by the way,

1281
01:21:55,501 --> 01:22:00,000
last week I did a little rant,
you know about the Lebron James,

1282
01:22:00,001 --> 01:22:02,530
you know,
being afraid of the big um,

1283
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
big stage in New York and actually went
down to the comedy store and a fuck you,

1284
01:22:09,451 --> 01:22:12,300
I always forget the
pipe that the damn page,

1285
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,550
the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right, the m M podcast.com.

1286
01:22:17,551 --> 01:22:19,110
Go to that.
That's the official,

1287
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:24,420
there's no other fan page for the Monday
morning podcast, the m m podcast.com.

1288
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,130
All the references I've made.

1289
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:30,960
I know I made a reference to something
fucking old a number of times in this

1290
01:22:30,961 --> 01:22:33,390
podcast.
He puts up all the references,

1291
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,350
all the youtube videos will be there
so you can just click on them as I'm

1292
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:40,920
talking about him. And um, anyways,

1293
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,530
we actually filmed,

1294
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,550
I did a different rant along the same
lines and they put it up on Barstool

1295
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:52,130
sports.
It got a ton of fucking hits and uh,

1296
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,910
touch her and, and Dave, is that the name
of the show? I'm such a Douche. How did I,

1297
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,620
how did I fuck that up?
I just pan.

1298
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:03,750
You don't want it is cause I
don't know how to read that.

1299
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:06,070
Actually thought toucher was
too sure as I was like, is it,

1300
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:11,020
is it too sure the guys on BCN
touch or enrich? There we go.

1301
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,970
My brain isn't fucking awake.

1302
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,150
I ain't have to look it up just for the
fucking record. What an, you know what?

1303
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,090
I just tried to thank those guys and
I fucked up the name of this show.

1304
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,500
Touch your enrich,

1305
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,430
played it and then actually it let
me call in and Ha and hype my show.

1306
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:28,330
So I'm feeling like I'm really becoming
Internet savvy because back in the day

1307
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:32,920
I'd have to get on a plane for six fucking
hours, land, get up two hours later,

1308
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,420
go into their studio,

1309
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:39,421
half asleep and half is funny as I
usually am and try to hype my gigs.

1310
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:44,050
I actually got a plug out a month
beforehand or three weeks before,

1311
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:48,580
two weeks. I don't know what the date
is. Touch her and rich. Sorry about that.

1312
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:52,450
Guys want an asshole. Um, anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

1313
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:55,380
I hope you guys enjoyed it. And, um,

1314
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,110
I wanted to know was it easier to
download last week when I put it through

1315
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:04,111
garage band because I was actually
able to make it a smaller audio file.

1316
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:06,820
Did it download quicker?

1317
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,250
Cause I think I'm going to try to do
it again this week because I know it

1318
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,970
uploaded a lot quicker. Was
that interesting? You know what?

1319
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:16,810
I think that's very fitting that I said
something that wasn't funny to end this

1320
01:24:16,811 --> 01:24:21,040
podcast because that's how it's felt.
I know I came out with a head of steam,

1321
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,090
you know what I mean?
I came out guns a blazing,

1322
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,120
kind of like a Peyton
manning football season.

1323
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:32,440
Just lighten everybody up and then
right in the end when it really counts,

1324
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:36,370
I shit the bed. Wow. Did I
really have to trash him?

1325
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,390
I think I did. All right. You
guys have a great week and a,

1326
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:44,650
if you're in the Chicago area, police
come out to the show. Um, and that is it.

1327
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,450
Have a great weekend.
All

1328
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,283
right,

1329
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:54,480
cool.
Then they won't be there.

1330
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:59,740
[inaudible] on a rooftop with us.

1331
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,180
It could be your true click. It's a
random t. Just smoked food away. To me,

1332
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:13,230
the entity within the industry without
a history of to live on my life,

1333
01:25:14,191 --> 01:25:16,710
expressing my liberty,
you got to be done properly.

1334
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:18,690
My name is in the middle of the quality.

1335
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,350
People follow me and number chassis here
will flow and assume I'm the real one

1336
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:23,480
with deliveries like I'm suffering.
