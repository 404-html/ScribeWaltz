00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,180
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,540
April 20th,
April 20th.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,250
I you doing what's going on?
Talking to you from the road.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,490
Don't you know, I'm sorry. I'm
in the middle of nowhere, man.

5
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,490
I'm in fucking Chattanooga,
Tennessee and I haven't seen shit.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,530
I haven't seen shit here yet.
I ain't seen shit air yet. Um,

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,970
I'm in the middle of the southern
tour here. Uh, traveling on the bus,

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,910
fueling up next to truckers. It's a whole
other world, man. Whole other worlds,

9
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,800
those truck drivers, you
know, but you know what?

10
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,920
I only saw one real fat one
or sell one fatty, you know,

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,010
one big guy was just
like, dude, you need to,

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,380
you need to start jogging some
laps around your truck, man,

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,640
that's gotta be the hardest fucking
job to stay in shape. Holy Shit.

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,220
Yeah.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,330
So one guy has fucking sitting there.
He's got a dog in there, you know,

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,610
how the fuck do you make any time
when you've got a dog? I mean,

17
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:02,920
do you get to fucking pull
over every couple hours, right?

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,030
I guess you got to get gas anyways.
I think they had to take a shit.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,033
You know,

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,750
it's like you just fucking pull it over.
It's a goddamn 18 wheeler oh 18.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,060
Um, anyways, this is the
Monday morning podcast.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,210
This is going to be a fucked up one cause
I'm an a silly ass mood and I have no

23
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,250
idea what's going on
in the world right now.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,690
I know that there was some refugees
that floated over on some little boat,

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,100
not a little boat lake, 700 people.
Uh, God, I fucking hate those stories.

26
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,940
They always skip the part to where they
go. There's some bodies being seen.

27
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,640
They didn't never talk about all that.
Quint from Jaws Shit,

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,470
the amount that we're treading water and
got eaten by sharks. Dude, you know bad.

29
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,200
A country has to be for you to fucking

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,910
okay.

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,770
Take your chances doing that.

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,270
This or you wouldn't get me
up front of fucking lake. I,

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,890
I don't,
I do not fuck with I go into poles.

34
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,840
I will in a pool all goddamn day.
Fuck that. I wouldn't go on a pond.

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,233
Fuck that.

36
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,280
Goddamn people trying to
cross the Mediterranean Sea.

37
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:17,390
I don't even know where they were
coming from. Jesus Christ. Now,

38
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:22,220
how do you it as a dictator, dead point
d d how do you not know at that point?

39
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:26,330
Like, Hey, maybe I, uh, maybe I should
ease up a little bit on the people here.

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,213
They're fucking,

41
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,810
they're trying to cross the
Mediterranean on a Goddamn Hooptie

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,870
will fucking boogie boards and shit. At
that point, you got to know, you know,

43
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:42,890
it even if you didn't give a shit about
them, you'd have to be thinking like, um,

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,820
I think there's going to be an attempt
made on my life pretty soon. You know,

45
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,800
considering 700 people just died.

46
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,980
You figured they got to have a bunch of
people that loved him, right? It's eight,

47
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,630
three people loved all those people.

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,640
There's 2100 people that want to fucking
kill me extra today as a dictator.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,260
Um, you know, probably help affect,

50
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,920
she looked to see which one it was the
only dictator I knew when that got beaten

51
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,740
to death by shit from auto zone.

52
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,670
Remember that Guy Kadafi he got beaten
to death with like fucking car batteries

53
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,200
and antennas walking around with half
his fucking uniform on and I was a

54
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,550
travesty,
you know what I mean?

55
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,290
That was like worse than seeing Emmitt
Smith playing for the Arizona cardinals

56
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,061
and all that.
You know,

57
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,240
like when you just see like a
me versus you talk about that.

58
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,300
Patrick knew Patrick Ewing when
he played for like Orlando.

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,040
Just seeing him in that uniform,

60
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:41,041
seeing Kadafi walking around with half
his boy scout uniform on begging for his

61
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:46,180
life. Like I was a fan.
But you know, it's like,

62
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,320
Gee, you got an, you know,

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
you gotta know when to get
out of show business and that,

64
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,350
that includes being a dictator. You
gotta know, you gotta be able to feel it.

65
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,210
You gotta be sitting there going,
all right,

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
people are leaving this country w and
shit boats just to get away from me.

67
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,250
How much longer are they going
to put up? Put up with me? How,

68
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,420
how much longer can I,

69
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,780
can I keep the facade going that I can
beat everybody's ass one on one here in

70
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,080
this country? You know
what I mean? I Dunno man.

71
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,150
Hang on a sec.
Let me find it.

72
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,650
Can we at least have the decency for
the victims to know where that went,

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,400
where it went? You know, that's terrible.

74
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,900
That's terrible that
that happened to them.

75
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,050
But I gotta tell you it's good for
the baby seals. You know what I mean?

76
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,190
Cause that's 700 less people eating
fish now and they actually fed fish.

77
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,460
What they did was tremendous. You
know, if you guys seen that story,

78
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,520
it's like there's like baby
seals washing up on the ocean.

79
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,300
I'm going on the ocean washing up on
the beach just cause they're starving to

80
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,110
death because the oceans
are so fished out.

81
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,430
This is probably a bad thing to bring up.
You know,

82
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,810
when he's sitting there
reading this thing, alright,

83
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,500
London rescue grabbed scrambled.
Why? I want this stock fucking thing.

84
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,980
Let me select it. There we go.
All right, where did this happen?

85
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,020
It's being reported from
London Mediterranean, uh,

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,860
crossing Europe to
Europe from Africa. Okay.

87
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,803
All right.

88
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,660
Okay.

89
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,040
More than 17 vessels. We're searching
for the survivors. Uh, my God,

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,420
70 miles off the coast of Libya now,
Olivia,

91
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:18,740
and as in that where Kadafi used to
fucking cut all his hits and he used to

92
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,670
record out there.

93
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,723
Okay.

94
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,300
All the, you know, the fucking
teen idols sensation out there.

95
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,960
I gotta look this up here. Libya. Libby,

96
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:34,660
a dictator. D a Tor
dictator. Who Do you got?

97
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:38,700
Who Do you got on more?
Sadat. Momar. Kadafi.

98
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,460
Okay.

99
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,240
And I fucked. Do you take shit from
a guy named Momar? You have to do it.

100
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,040
Moma. I said no, fuck him. He never
looked like he was a bad ass daddy.

101
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,970
He just always looked like a,
he just thought that was just bad casting.

102
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm going to go dominant.
Votech guy.

103
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,960
Worst like most unintimidating
like fucking dictator ever.

104
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,530
He just look at his face. I don't know
what he looks. He just looks like a,

105
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,830
you know, he looked like to
me was a, what's his face?

106
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,930
Oh Christ. What's his name? Bobby. Uh, AH,

107
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,940
fuck. I'm the worst. I
got to get off the road.

108
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,160
The fuck is his name.
Oh Jesus.

109
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,920
It's the perfect fucking analogy too.
It's going to tour it. I'll remember it.

110
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,400
I'll remember it by the end of this.
Um,

111
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,350
anyways, I'm just saying the guy's
face. He looks, you know what it is.

112
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,020
He looks like this guy that I know
that I can't remember his fucking name.

113
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:39,400
This is going off the rails over
here. Um, all right. Anyway,

114
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,460
so we're on the, we're on the
southern tour here. We did a,

115
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:46,900
we did Savannah the first night and uh,
just a great crowd,

116
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:51,370
beautiful city and um, you
know the usual shit. We go up,

117
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:55,420
me and me in a fucking lie ahead.
We flew out on the 17th,

118
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,940
because we're coming from the west
coast and we show up. You know,

119
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,340
we don't have a Wii. We don't have a
vehicle with staying out by the airport.

120
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,820
So we're nowhere near downtown Savannah.
I didn't see anything in Savannah.

121
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:09,400
I didn't see old town. I didn't see
shit. I always wanted to go there.

122
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,790
I never even got to it cause we was
staying way out by the airport and the bus

123
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:17,050
hadn't shown up yet. Right. So we say to
the lady downstairs, right? First of all,

124
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:20,440
they fucking check and she takes
my driver's license. And as always,

125
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,230
just starts typing shit in. I
go, what are you doing? She goes,

126
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm typing in your home address.
And it's just like, for what? Well,

127
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:31,510
just in case you leave something,
while if I leave something of value,

128
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,550
I'll call you guys. I'll notice. And then
I'll call you guys. And then you guys,

129
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:40,630
of course, we'll say you couldn't find
it because it was of a v. It was a value.

130
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,260
The housekeeper that you're not
paying shit is going to keep it.

131
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,130
There's no reason for you to
fucking take my home address.

132
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,310
You just going to sell it to somebody
else to make a little bit of money.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So today I went to go check in the
hotel and she takes my fucking driver's

134
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,290
license. She goes, type in. I
said, what are you doing? She goes,

135
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:03,100
I'm typing in your home address. And I
go, uh, I don't want you to do to do that.

136
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,780
She goes, you don't want me to do that?
I said, yes, I don't want you to do that.

137
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,800
She goes, okay, how about just
a zip code? And I said No.

138
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,000
And she said, okay. So that's what I
learned today. It's fucking optional.

139
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,460
Fucking assholes.

140
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,500
This fucking take your Id.

141
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:26,460
Just telling these people to just start
fucking typing your God damn address in

142
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:30,180
there. What the fuck he
get doing? Renting a room.

143
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,920
Here's my credit card.

144
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:36,090
Here's my id saying that's my credit
card now fuck off and give me a room.

145
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,840
You got to know where I lived.
Huh?

146
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,520
You fucking Weirdos telling you
people don't do that. Don't do that.

147
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,830
Cause they uploaded onto their
shit and then, and then it's just,

148
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:49,440
it's just out there.
And next thing you know,

149
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,560
I don't know what if you're lucky,

150
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,580
you just getting spammed by a red roof
inn getting shit sent to you directly.

151
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,550
You're really unlucky.
I don't know what happens.

152
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,000
Some of these fucking steal your identity.
Somebody shows up at your fucking,

153
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,330
I mean,

154
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,330
either way it's rude and it's
completely fucking unnecessary and a,

155
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,320
and I'll tell you right now, I'll
tell you right now, this, this,

156
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:17,820
this freckled face cunt
is a, is against it. 100%.

157
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,870
100%. Um, so anyways,

158
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,060
so we say to the lady downstairs at the,
uh,

159
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,030
at the hotel where like, so,
uh, you know, we walk in, right?

160
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,100
I see la had,
had sees me,

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,980
we obviously know we're going to start
drinking immediately. And I ask, you know,

162
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:40,710
we walk in his hotel bar still open. She's
like, no, now it isn't a jazz closed.

163
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm sorry. You want me to go
make you some? You're down south.

164
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,630
We're really polite. And I was
like, no, that's all right.

165
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,600
You don't have to make it some is
there a bar nearby? And she goes, yeah,

166
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,780
there's one on her and her hair
straight. And I'm like, all right,

167
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,190
can you walk there from there?
She's a, Oh no, Nah, y'all, y'all.

168
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,550
Y'All can't walk here from, Hey, you
can't walk or it's too far again,

169
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,240
why you all get attacked
by a wild cat or something?

170
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,900
And I was just like, all right, well
let me look this fucking thing up.

171
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,230
And I looked it up. It was like, it
was like a fucking barely a mile away.

172
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,870
Yeah. It's like, what do you
eat? Meat, you can fucking walk.

173
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,820
So we fucking walk over there.

174
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,560
We literally walk half the half a mile
of the walk was getting out of the

175
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,570
Goddamn fucking hotel area and
then we just took down the streets.

176
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:34,880
We see lights, we see civilization.
Ah, you can't walk down.

177
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:38,810
I mean you could do it, but I mean, I
don't know what, what happened to you?

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,830
So we go all the way down.
She didn't even talk like that.

179
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,980
I just like the southern accent and
fucking annoying people from where I'm

180
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:48,320
touring.
So we fucking head all the way down there.

181
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:51,350
We ended up walking to this bar.
Is this a little band in there?

182
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,770
Guy On guitar and a guy playing
drums that both killing it,

183
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,950
singing all this shit from the 90s.
Fucking tremendous.

184
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,110
We'll fucking drinking right now.

185
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,680
You get shocked was they'd go given the
shots at Jamison and glasses that they

186
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:09,410
had just taken out of the dishwasher.
So the glass was off.

187
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,550
Those was between warm
and kind of hot was gross.

188
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:17,510
It was making me sick to my
stomach, but I can't drink. Um,

189
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,500
and I don't know what happened.
We just sat there laughing our asses off.

190
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:23,900
We were watching some
sort of, some, some game.

191
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,390
I don't even know what the fuck we
were watching. And next thing you know,

192
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:26,691
I really,

193
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:30,350
I looked up and we were the only two
people left in the place and we were too

194
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:34,580
drunk to fucking walk back.
We didn't want to. So, uh,

195
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,730
this,
the dude at the bar,

196
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:41,090
this gay dude who was wearing a kilt
for whatever fucking reason, I think,

197
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,980
cause it was an Irish bar,
he gave us a ride home.

198
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,230
So that's how it started.
It was a great guy.

199
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,800
He came walking over and he
just took off fucking beers,

200
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,440
put them in paper cups and
he does let us drink it.

201
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,240
That last little mile on the way home.

202
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,160
And then I walked in to the hotel and
I said to the lady, you know, hey it,

203
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,690
can you still order room service?

204
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,960
Is there any way we can order
some servers up to the room, some,

205
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,210
some service room service
stuff. He's like, ah Nah, Nah,

206
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,340
I can't just clouds clouds.
I'm salary.

207
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,210
I'll you want me mama go hostile and go
kill a fathom. Fari I'll cook it out.

208
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,730
I'll brand it how deep frack manky
some dumplings. And we like, Nah, Nah,

209
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,630
that's cool.
That's cool.

210
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:28,631
And I went over and I bought a bag of
fucking potato chips and went upstairs and

211
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,390
laid in bed drunk in,
ate a bag of chips and fell asleep.

212
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,820
That's how the tour started.

213
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,440
Remember I told you guys I was going
to try to not put on any weight.

214
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,570
That's how it started.
That's what set the fucking tone right.

215
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,080
Then the next day the Goddam bus pulls up,
right?

216
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,210
The bus pulls up and we see that
thing and it's just, I don't know.

217
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,560
We've been actually been doing pretty
good though as far as, um, you know,

218
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,690
I went out and I got a, I got
some cereal, I've got corn checks,

219
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,070
right? I get some bananas. So that's my
breakfast. And then I got some Turkey,

220
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,390
did all of this in Walmart.

221
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,230
So God knows what level of quality
this shit actually is. Oh my God, dude,

222
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,090
you go into a Walmart.
Holy Shit.

223
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,470
You cannot believe the loss of hope
and those fucking people's eyes.

224
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,510
This fucking lady, this fucking
lady, when I went up to the Deli,

225
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,500
I mean, I was just like, hey, how you
doing? I'm fucking turning on the charm.

226
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:28,240
I have what's going on? How I, and she
just fucking looking at me. She's like,

227
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,780
what do you want? Just like, uh,

228
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,240
can I get a, uh, pounded that
smoked Turkey police? She's Zadie.

229
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,690
It as like a, you know, didn't come
in. You real hi. Hey, how you doing?

230
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,020
And some of you just fucking hits you
with your attitude and you immediately got

231
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:45,760
to adjust all the way down to them.
You know,

232
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,240
it's like the way I lost
out on the negotiations last
week on the rug, you know?

233
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,460
And um, so I go from, hey, how's it going?
[inaudible] uh, yeah, we'll have some, uh,

234
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,320
helps them Turkey. She's
like that it, that it,

235
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,260
that's what she said that
it, and I was like, uh,

236
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,660
yeah,

237
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,650
I can't get like, you know, 15 slices
of cheese, you know, white Cheddar,

238
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:11,170
white American. Whenever
he got, she's like, Yep,

239
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,820
she fucking goes over and just cuts it up.
And like,

240
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,390
I can't even tell you the way
she like handed it to me. Well,

241
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,940
just sort of looking off into
the distance down the isles,

242
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,580
you know, and uh, it was just,
you know, so now, you know,

243
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,950
I'm shaking it off,
right.

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,780
I'm getting some fucking
condiments for the sandwiches,

245
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,870
pickles that got my mustard and I get it.
I get down to the booze,

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,250
I realized I don't have any hard stuff.
So I throw in a six, a fucking blue moon,

247
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:41,710
whatever.

248
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,710
That's the best they got here and this
fucking assholes have the nerve on a

249
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:52,650
Sunday to not let me buy a six pack of
beer. The lady took it away from me.

250
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,800
I had it on a little conveyor
belt and she's fucking, you know,

251
00:14:55,801 --> 00:15:00,210
boop boop corn checks boob,
right? Half Gallon of 2% milk.

252
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,910
Everything's going fine and then she goes,
she goes,

253
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,530
I can't let you have this and took it
away from me and set it on the other side

254
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,920
of the register. Like I was going
to lunge after it or something.

255
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,270
I can't let you have this.

256
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,440
It's before 1230 on a
Sunday and I was just,

257
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,330
I a second. We fucking adults
here. You already, I'll do

258
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,340
the way they fucking treat
their employees there. How bad,

259
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,190
how poorly Walmart treats
their fucking employees.

260
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:33,300
They're going to have the nerve to
not let people drink before noon.

261
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:37,980
They should be letting those people drink
on the job. I was fucking miserable.

262
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:42,120
They treat those damn people.
How do I know they treat them miserably?

263
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,210
I don't know.
I just heard they have,

264
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,920
they won't give me my beer. So now I'm
trashing up. That's what I'm doing.

265
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,410
I'll tell you, they got some
fucking clothes in there though.

266
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,230
They got some decent clothes.
You know,

267
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,420
if you just adjust your
ego down a little bit,

268
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,480
they got some decent clothes and Walmart,
like you could make it work.

269
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,191
You don't feel it gives you,

270
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:06,410
maybe if he just fucking spend a little
more money on your pants, then I know.

271
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,980
You know what? You got it.
This is what you gotta do.

272
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,970
If you're going to fucking
go cheap on something,

273
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,980
you can't do anything near eye level.
You can't,

274
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,650
you can't get away with a cheap shirt.
You know what I mean?

275
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,620
You just got to buy in real nice shirt.
Then the rest of it can look like shit,

276
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:23,010
but you have to be charismatic to keep
people looking you in the eye because the

277
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,830
second you start losing their intention,
you're their attention, you know?

278
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,430
And they started looking down
at the guy like guy, Guy,

279
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,700
what am I looking at this motherfuck
why am I talking to him? Right.

280
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,740
They're going to see your shoes
and it's going to be over.

281
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,860
I think it'd be like this
motherfucker shops at Walmart.

282
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,540
He goes down to Wally
world. Shit, we all do.

283
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,040
We all go down there to buy fucking
an eight pound box of fucking weedies.

284
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,460
We all do that shit.

285
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,430
But this guy actually goes down there
and buy the shirts and I know what you're

286
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,590
saying right now bill,

287
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:55,580
why are you making fun of people who
can't afford to shop any place else other

288
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,070
than Walmart?
And there's a simple answer to that.

289
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,250
They're not in the room with me right now.
Okay.

290
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,700
They can't do me any harm and I am
unbelievably tough on my podcast.

291
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,760
A fucking trash. Anybody. Um,

292
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,260
okay.

293
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,030
My dream is,

294
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,260
is that people who wear Walmart clothes
climb over the walls of gated community

295
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,040
someday and they just start murdering
bankers and heads of corporations.

296
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,600
Okay.
And then in the fight everybody dies.

297
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,310
So then you weed out your
mouth breathing racist. Okay.

298
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,380
And their spawn.

299
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,150
And then you get rid of the guys up top
and then once you got in the middle is a

300
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,980
bunch of regular fucking people
don't want to get fucked with.

301
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,490
They're willing to get up,
go down the street, you know,

302
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,970
sell some apples, come home. Right.

303
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,660
That's what I do in my dream world.
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

304
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,450
How much bullshit that I just
throw it. Yes, that was good.

305
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,730
18 minutes of your life,
you're never getting that back.

306
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,600
How do you feel you're getting through
the traffic? When he listening to this?

307
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,060
I'm open. I'm open. The volumes fine.
And in the last couple of weeks,

308
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,940
every once in a while the volume gets bad.
It sounds fine to me.

309
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,950
Did I just spell Libya? L Y.
Bia? I think I did lie BF.

310
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,330
Who's that guy from Labia? I don't know
who he is. He ain't from here. Oddly.

311
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,000
We should mom. But you're in a
fair on, on my own. Battle Nail,

312
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:25,170
nail nail. Um, all right. Let's get this
a little bit of advertising for this week.

313
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,710
Oh, by the way, I got to talk
to you guys about Blake Griffin.

314
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,070
I like Blake Griffin.
I enjoy watching the guy play basketball,

315
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:36,300
but it is impossible for me to do that
when I'm sitting next to fucking Paul

316
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,520
Versey or Jason Law had
they fucking trashed thing.

317
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:42,790
No matter what the guy does it matter what
he does. He fucking dunks on somebody.

318
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,450
Yeah, the guy got there
late. That was more the past.

319
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,140
I did it on some second string guy.
Chris Paul does something.

320
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,180
They're fucking jerking off.

321
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm not saying Blake Griffin's as
good as is Chris Paul, but I mean,

322
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,950
you know the man is wildly entertaining.
He is electrifying.

323
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,670
He fucking has dunked on everybody in
the Goddamn League. Get off his back.

324
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,630
They're acting like he's Joe Barry Carroll
out there like they wasted a bunch of

325
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:10,950
fucking money. That guy, he, he's
helping to put the clippers on the map.

326
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,980
You could fucking walk up to a
clippers game before that guy came out.

327
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,360
He didn't give a shit about that.

328
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,180
Dairy is miles guy doing
the fucking antenna thing.

329
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,530
That's the closest they ever came to.
Anybody given a fuck about them. Right.

330
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Billy Crystal deserves a god Damn Sports
Medal of honor for the amount of games

331
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,380
that he has sat through.
That guy said,

332
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,590
fuck the Lakers and
everybody else who goes down.

333
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm going with the clippers guys go and
he's contrary. You know, by the way,

334
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,260
did I mention,
I did you guys,

335
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,280
we have you guys been watching
the comedian jet fucking
great show and the pilot

336
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,224
episode,

337
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,430
that pilot episode where they're trying
to get that show off the ground the way

338
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:58,410
they did that. That's pretty much
almost exactly just the, the,

339
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,820
the conversations putting two guys
together that don't want to be together,

340
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:04,980
but they were, they were,
their careers are at,

341
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:09,981
they kind of have to be a half baked
fucking concept of bad fucking meeting.

342
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:12,930
You talking to your manager,
you need guts saying don't do it.

343
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:14,670
You end up fucking doing it.
I mean,

344
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,220
the way they executed that
in the pilot was just,

345
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:21,600
it was off the charts tenant 10 out of 10,
as far as old freckles is concerned.

346
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,750
But anyways, Billy crystal has
been going to these clippers games.

347
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,580
I remember I went, I went to a, um,

348
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,070
a clippers games that they have the
old La sports arena. He was there,

349
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,740
the black dude from a different world.

350
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,150
Remember the guy who wore the glasses
probably had some weird name for his

351
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:42,930
character that fucking killed his
career, like cockroach. You know,

352
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:47,860
anytime you get one of those names, you're
fucking done, right Dougie. Not Dougie.

353
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,690
He actually got out of it.
Jesus Christ.

354
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,140
How the fuck do you pull
out of the mud Dougie? Um,

355
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,280
Urkel you fucked cockroach.
You fucked. It's another one.

356
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,800
Screech.
Get done.

357
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,270
If anybody is getting into the act of
game, I will tell you this right now.

358
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:10,210
If you fucking do,
turn it down.

359
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,910
If your character just has a
nickname, you're fucked. You fucked.

360
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,530
Unless you have the,
the,

361
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:21,610
the talent to start writing your own
shit and producing your own shit.

362
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,160
Then you can get out of it.
You can get out of it,

363
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:28,090
but your whole fucking life you'd
done right. My out of my mind.

364
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,440
Oh, go fuck yourself. I don't know. I
don't know what I'm saying here. Anyways,

365
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:32,851
so anyways,

366
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:37,851
so I go to the La sports arena and it was
Allen Iverson's rookie year and I went

367
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,980
down there,
um,

368
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,560
to watch a game and biggie smalls was in
the crowd and that was the trip within

369
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,341
like five days.

370
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:50,341
He was dead on that trip and I fucking
walked right by him and he sorta had like

371
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:53,740
these security guys around, but he's
just sort of standing there hanging out.

372
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,180
And I remember that thinking like,
wow,

373
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,540
I guess that whole East Coast West
thing is a west coast thing is over.

374
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,950
But anyways, Billy crystal was there,
um, the fuck am I talking about?

375
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:03,490
I don't get it back.

376
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,640
So last night we were at the bar and I'm
sitting there trying to enjoy the game

377
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,260
and we got into this fucking,

378
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,470
we got to like three of the
loudest sports arguments.

379
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,230
I just remember seeing the bartenders
and Knoxville just sitting there laughing

380
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:18,250
at us is we're screaming at each other
about shit that they didn't even care

381
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:21,940
about. I remember one point, this guy
came up, he had a red sox shirt on.

382
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,960
And first he just goes, he goes,
how you'll red sox fan down here?

383
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:29,020
And the guy goes, I'm from Boston.
And then, you know, fuck the Yankees.

384
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,870
And then they get in this big fight and
then in the end versus going, you know,

385
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:34,680
what the fuck you guys yelling
at me for? It's like, firstly,

386
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,300
you started with the guy. And he goes,
no, I didn't. He walked up to me and said,

387
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:41,610
hey, fuck the Yankees. It's like, Paul,

388
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,370
you're not wearing anything that says
Yankees on it. You started with Tim,

389
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:49,120
this guy's wearing a red sox.
Teesha and he'd gone, I did.

390
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,650
You know that level drunk you are where
you just fucking, you ignore everything,

391
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,350
all types of logic.
Um,

392
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,090
so all I'm trying to do is enjoy
it. And the, the fucking assholes,

393
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,270
they won't get off Blake Griffin's back
when we met him, I had, in my mind,

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,010
they're going, ah, we're not saying,

395
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,750
we're not saying he's not a perennial
all star. We're not saying that you know,

396
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:12,460
he, he's not a, he's not a good player.

397
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:16,930
We're just saying that he should be
doing more. It's like, I don't know.

398
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:20,850
What you just listed was pretty fucking
impressive, wasn't it? I don't know.

399
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,290
Fucking know. All right, let's,
let's, let's do a little bit of a,

400
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,640
still a little bit of advertising
media. All right. Draft, draft kings,

401
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:30,580
everybody draft kings.
The wait is finally over.

402
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,930
Baseball season is here at last.
Oh Great.

403
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,380
And the excitement
continues@allseasonlongatdraftkings.com
the official daily

404
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:46,100
Fantasy Patna of major league baseball.
Shame on you.

405
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,140
Daily fantasy means no season long
commitments, just instant cash,

406
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,400
instant gratification. Why wait until the
end of the season, everybody to clean,

407
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,900
to claim victory when you can win
huge cash every day at draft kings,

408
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,850
that's like a brand new season.
Every time you play,

409
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,560
just select two pictures and a positional
players stay under the salary cap and

410
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,290
you could be on your way to an
enormous pay day. They've actually,

411
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,030
every time I read that, that
sounds actually, you know,
oh, he's on my fantasy team.

412
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,430
The fact that you're actually selecting
this thing and he got to stay under the

413
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:17,264
cap.

414
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,640
And just how there's some math
nerd that figured that out,

415
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,750
actually sat down,
you know,

416
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,090
and figured out like the fact that you
have to stay under the cap, you know,

417
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,170
on the roulette wheel.

418
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,700
Those are the two green numbers that
tip it and draft kings favor, you know,

419
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,410
but you still going to show up.

420
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,340
You still think you're going to be right
because you are that man right there.

421

423

playing fantasy baseball.

424
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,670
Some other guy named Chris is
sucking Dick in a bus station.

425
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,620

fucking cool way to watch baseball. No,

434
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:25,310
actually I get a little
schizophrenia because she's
still not watching the games.

435
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,580
You want you the guys,

All I know is anybody who plays
fantasy football, fantasy baseball,

437
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:34,250
by the end of one season they
could actually announce the game.

438
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,060
They know so much about
the players. Um, all right.

439
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,610
Oh me undies. Every buddy, me undies,
me undies, no more sweaty balls.

440
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,150
Me undies, me undies. You wear
them right through the fall.

441
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,860
We're up your nuts on some wet leaves.
Stick on the underwear.

442
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:55,010
It's like a sleeve. It dries out
your balls. Then you feel good.

443
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:59,120
Then you get your Dick sucked. Oh yeah.
When you're wearing some fucking undies.

444
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,550
Alright me undies,
90%.

445
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:06,440
That's the percent of your
life that you're in your
underwear and your underwear.

446
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:10,970
It gets old fast. You know that feeling
of putting on old saggy underwear,

447
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,750
you know, it's like if your
grandmother's arms where your ball bag,

448
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:15,770
that's what it feels like.

449
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,790
You need to know the feeling of great
fitting underwear that is two times softer

450
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:23,600
than cotton. You need to know about
me. undies.com Mondays, Mondays,

Me undies is the most
comfortable underwear you will
ever wear and it's insane

453
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,970
how good they make you feel.
They fit perfectly.

454
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:36,971
They don't ride up on you
and they literally pull
moisture away from your skin

455
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:43,260
so you stay cool. I have
mine on right now. Do I? No.

I need to order more.
They're actually,

457
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:48,150
I actually really like them because they
don't ride up on me and I don't have

458
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:51,510
sweaty balls, but if I ever, if I
ever was going to have sweaty balls,

459
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,590
it wouldn't be a problem with me undies.

Mandy's keep in that left
and right real dry. Um,

502
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,220
Anyways, let's get back to the shit.
I'll tell you this right now, man and I,

503
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,290
one of the most depressing places I've
ever been to is the u s airway terminal

504
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,740
connecting out of Charlotte,
North Carolina.

505
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,350
I was taking the red eye in.
Oh my God.

506
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,500
The fucking humanity that I saw.

507
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,360
Oh my God. People just
sitting there, you know,

508
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,110
guy comes in with the, I'd been smoking
fucking cigarettes my whole life.

509
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,410
You know what? The tubes up his
nose carrying an oxygen tank.

510
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,630
Somebody else sitting there,
you know, with a plate of
Nachos, right? And right now,

511
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:09,090
lap, beautiful girl just sitting there
killing herself, just eaten poison.

512
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,960
Everybody just poisoning themselves. It
was like a fight. There was like this,

513
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,860
like this mass suicide that was going
on as I sat there and the term or not,

514
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,660
nobody making a fucking quality choice.

515
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,320
Everybody just choosing
misery in the future.

516
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,410
I don't even get me started with
the fucking shoes. I was really as,

517
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,900
I was like going, wow man, this is
this, this is flying to Savannah.

518
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,930
Then I realized like, Nah, you know,
some of them are going to other places.

519
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,100
It was really depressing, you know,
that's how that days, you know,

520
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,130
it was coming to a close,
but then you know the wonders of the road.

521
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:44,964
Next thing you know,

522
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,320
I walk to a bar and I'm with Jay and I'm
getting a ride home from a gay guy in a

523
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:54,030
kilt. I mean, you know, you always hold
out hope that it's going to turn around

524
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,770
if he's listening,

525
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,690
thank you for the ride and thank you for
putting the beer in the fucking paper

526
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:06,650
cups. It was, it was tremendous. What a
night, right? Oh, so we ended up going,

527
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,720
we ended up going out to this speakeasy.
Right. You know, which is, you know,

528
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:16,490
it's just a fame thing right now. The
key, we met these two fucking women.

529
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:21,230
They work for like the uh, Savannah PD or
whatever. So now we'll get you in, right?

530
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:24,950
So we all fucking head over there and
was sitting in this bar then making some

531
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,000
good drinks and everything.

532
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,450
And I wish I had these two ladies on
the podcast because I was just grilling

533
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:33,590
them. I was like, what is,
what is the fucking weirdest?

534
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,460
I go, don't tell me any of the sad
ones when people are calling the cops.

535
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:41,450
Give me the weird ones. The weirdest
one. This one woman told me it was,

536
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,380
somebody said that their neighbor was
jerking off and they could smell the

537
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:52,550
semen. And she goes, Oh, you
know, okay, so what do you mean?

538
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:57,470
Like is he standing in the window?
Can you see him? She goes, no,

539
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:01,330
I can't see them, but I can smell
it. I can smell it through the walls.

540
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,310
They had to send somebody over
there. So when he goes, all right,

541
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,250
you could smell it. I
got to tell you, ma'am,

542
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:17,870
I don't want to start an argument here,
but I cannot smell any ges. You know,

543
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:19,870
I think you have a
wonderful home here and uh,

544
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:24,710
maybe you ought to get some
medication. Um, but anyways,

545
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,310
uh, so thank you to everybody who
came out to Savannah, by the way.

546
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,620
And everybody who came out to Knoxville,

547
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,400
the fucking theater I played in Knoxville,
I think rightly said,

548
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:37,310
Ralphie may did a special there and I
can see why it's one of most beautiful

549
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:40,040
theaters I've ever been to. It was, um,

550
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,510
the Tennessee theater built in 1927 or 28.
You know,

551
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,770
just this unbelievably gorgeous place
where you used to go down to watch movies.

552
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,180
You know, I swear to God, if I
could be alive back in the day,

553
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,590
like I think I would go back to when
they first built a lot of these theaters

554
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:01,160
that I played in just to watch movies.
No one,

555
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:04,640
everybody gets dressed up and
it's like a real big fucking deal.

556
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,140
And they had this giant Wurlitzer organ
and I forgot to look for the thing and

557
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,270
find out where it was.
They got it refurbished,

558
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,050
send it out to some maniac in Reno
that redid the whole God damn thing.

559
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,330
He's like a,
he's like the guy,

560
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:21,890
I guess if you're going to have you
fucking giant Wurlitzer organ redone.

561
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,270
And um, the crowd was, uh,
was phenomenal. You know,

562
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:30,920
it was hilarious was we were
fucking, uh, on the way.

563
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:35,530
Their law had such a big basketball fan.
He wanted to fuck and

564
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,210
he wanted to do,

565
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,370
he wanted to go see like the Tennessee
volunteers trophy case. See Pat Summit,

566
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,310
you know,
trophies like women's basketball.

567
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:51,310
That's like how psycho into
fucking basketball he is. And uh,

568
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,220
he ended up,

569
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,730
he ended up doing this pat summit joke
on the bus that had us die and laughing

570
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:02,870
but like verse, he goes, Dude, you got
to do that on stage. And I said, Jay,

571
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,830
don't do that on stage. Don't do that
on stage. This is like their fucking,

572
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,620
this is like their female Jesus,
you don't do that. Don't do it.

573
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:14,660
Dementia joke on there. And then what's
his verse? He goes, he should do it.

574
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:18,410
So I said, all right, do it tonight.
Okay. And I go in, if it fucking bombs,

575
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,120
all you got to do to save it is
just, it was basically a, you know,

576
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,380
she's got dementia. It's like, well,

577
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:27,680
if you saw that much women's
basketball over the years, you know,

578
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:31,580
you'd want to forget about it to
write a silly joke as silly joke.

579
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,950
But if you say it in Knoxville,
it's going to be a problem.

580
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,110
Or if there's some current who blogs,
they'll,

581
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,830
they'll fucking flip out about it.
And the,

582
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:44,740
where my grandfather has dementia and you
made me sad Monday morning podcast tee

583
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:48,410
shirt, right? And then, then all of a
sudden there'll be a controversy, right?

584
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,360
Fucking baby seals starving to death,
washing up on the fucking sand.

585
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,870
They're going to fucking give a shit
about a joke. Somebody told Knoxville.

586
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:58,690
So anyways,
so he was supposed to go out,

587
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,170
he was supposed to go out there and just
do the fucking joke. And if it bombed,

588
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:06,410
I go. Just say, Hey, I gotta be honest
with you. You know, for, as he said,

589
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:09,260
don't do it. But first he said,
do it. Bert said, don't do it.

590
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,520
I learned something here next time,

591
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,320
listen to the headline or
something cute like that.

592
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:17,240
So he guts to go doing it
and he does that shit first.

593
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,700
Go on. I don't know, I'd said this
joke on the bus and that are now,

594
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,390
I don't know if I should say.
And the crowds, like God said,

595
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,070
like he totally got him into it and
it bugged me because then it ended up

596
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:33,430
working and then he said verse,
he's right. It's like now you, well,

597
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,280
once you did the fucking UNICEF
speech before the joke, you know,

598
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,260
you almost questioning that goddamn
comedy manhood about whether they're going

599
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:46,690
to laugh about it or not. But uh, anyways,
I'm just breaking that balls. Where,

600
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,340
when a good time out here.
So, hey, Chattanooga people,
if you listen to this today,

601
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,080
let us know what there is to do out here.
I never been here. This is fucking cool.

602
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:58,530
This tour, because I've only
ever been in Nashville. And, um,

603
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,110
we actually drove up from Savannah
on the bus and it was so beautiful.

604
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,210
One point going through some
of these, um, national parks.

605
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:11,070
I was actually sitting up front for like
John Madden on my way to green bay for

606
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:15,780
a game or something. I was sitting up
there absolutely eastern Tennessee,

607
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,660
south east of Knoxville, fucking
God's country. I'm telling you,

608
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,980
Tony, if you can just deal
with them, fucking hillbillies
out there and you know,

609
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:29,160
every once in a while somebody is going
to, they are going to be coming for you.

610
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,750
You know, I don't know
what goes on out there. Um,

611
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,180
I could never get me to live out there.
She's a city girl. You know what I mean?

612
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,980
The way I get nervous on a subway, she
gets nervous when she sees the woods. So,

613
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:44,850
uh, you know the deal, you know who's
going to make her more miserable?

614
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,700
She's gonna make me more miserable. She
went, so we stay in the fucking city,

615
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,450
stay in a city, in a state where we
are going to be out of water in a year.

616
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,410
How funny is it that I just put it in
an immaculate bathroom at my house,

617
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,020
spent all my fucking money on it.

618
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,300
Didn't spare any expense we'll put was
already probably not going to make my

619
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:10,960
money back because they're just going
to look at it as square footage anyways.

620
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:13,150
And I added no square
footage to my fucking house.

621
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,083
MMM.

622
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,380
But at least I had this great
fucking shower, you know?

623
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,940
And now we're going to be out of water.
And once again,

624
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,850
nobody seems to be a alarmed by it.

625
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,050
Nobody seems to be talking about it.
Like what? What exactly is going on?

626
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,113
You know,

627
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,670
population seals washing up
fucking running out of water.

628
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,020
Everybody just stay in the course.
I think that's the game plan.

629
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,480
I think that is the game plan. You just
fucking act like everything is fine.

630
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,500
And then one day you just take that
asteroid to the face and it's over.

631
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:55,370
Maybe that's the way to do
it. I'm starting to give
into it, you know, fuck it.

632
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,020
You know, y'all, I can't do
anything about it, but fuck.

633
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:03,980
He call you don't go home. Do
you go kill yourself? Pick,

634
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,520
put it on a spit.
You won't dig a hole.

635
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:11,540
We don't cook a picked day. I want to
go to a fucking pig pickin down here.

636
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,910
Oh, by the way, uh, when we go to New
Orleans, a, the Pelicans are playing,

637
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:19,490
the fucking warriors come out and play.

638
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,330
I think we're going to try and go to the
game. We've got a day off down there.

639
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:27,950
How fucking cool is that? Um, but
anyways, I absolutely love Knoxville man.

640
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,640
Um, and I have to get back there
again. The crowd was awesome.

641
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:34,760
I have got to get back there for a game.
Um,

642
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,330
and I was asking him what game to go
to and everybody was go, you know,

643
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:42,890
go to the Tennessee, Georgia game.
Uh, they play Oklahoma next year.

644
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:43,880
That'll be a good game.

645
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:46,220
And then this fucking old time
I came up to me and he's like,

646
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,630
game you want to go to is the Alabama
game. And I was just like, right there.

647
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,040
All right, that's the game we're going
to go to. Why wouldn't I go to it?

648
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,090
That might be my goal.

649
00:38:56,091 --> 00:39:00,380
I'm going to go to what every sec team
when they play Alabama and root against

650
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:01,520
Alabama because it's just,

651
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,310
it's just so much fun to root against
those fucking guys and screamed.

652
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:09,530
The dream ends tonight. You know why
bill, why do you give a shit about it?

653
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:12,980
I really don't. I just like being
a cunt. I'm telling you guys,

654
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:16,460
I'm going to retire and I'm going to buy
a house in Alabama. That's my game plan.

655
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:21,440
That is my exit strategy. You know,
God willing, we still have water.

656
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,370
When I retire,

657
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,260
somehow in La and my house is actually
worth something and it hasn't turned to

658
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:30,650
dust, I am then going to go out.
I'm going to buy me a spread.

659
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,260
Maybe eastern Tennessee,
you know,

660
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:38,120
it'd be far enough inland
that those fucking hurricanes
will slow down. You know,

661
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,030
maybe every once in a while there's
a micro burst and the trees lay down.

662
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:45,590
But I'm inside. I'm a nice
brick house. Brick House.

663
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:50,900
All right, let's get to some of the
questions here. Uh, um, for this week.

664
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,610
Oh, by the way, um, for the, for
the Thursday, Thursday afternoon,

665
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,660
Monday morning podcast.
Just before Friday. Um,

666
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,630
if you would like, do you know stuff
that you want me to talk about?

667
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:05,390
Articles for me to read, videos,
questions, any of that shit.

668
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,690
You do it through Twitter and have the
Hashtag t a m m p tango Alpha Mike,

669
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:16,340
Mike, Papa. Sorry. Anyways,

670
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,530
I'm just Hashtag or is that,

671
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:21,440
and I'll fucking scroll through at two
seconds before he start and you'll get to

672
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:25,880
listen to me read out loud. All right.
Factory made diamonds. Okay, bill,

673
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,840
this is a followup from Thursday clip
where you answered a question about real

674
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:33,590
diamonds versus fake ones and whether
or not women should be cool with the

675
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:35,100
factory made ones.
Uh,

676
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,870
please ask listeners to go back and
check it out if they haven't already.

677
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,330
All right, we'll go back and listen
to that. I guess it was last week.

678
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,320
I don't even remember
talking about this shit. Uh,

679
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:50,090
a a big Billy dildo.
I was listening to your clip.

680
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,493
MMM.

681
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,120
You replayed on the just checking it.
Oh, well from last week. Oh, that's why,

682
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,180
because it was what? It was a
throwback clip from last Thursday's.

683
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,650
Just checking in on your Thursday
afternoon, just before Friday,

684
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,630
Monday morning podcast. Um, he said,

685
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,850
I know what this magical stone is.

686
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,360
Okay,

687
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,430
all right. I'll tell you the name, but you
can choose to skip over it if you want.

688
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,690
If you don't want the secret to get out,
it's called a,

689
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,680
I can't even say it.
Moist Sinai.

690
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,670
M. O. I. S. S. A. N. I. T. E.

691
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,940
It's not actually an
exact diamond replica,

692
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,770
but it looks identical to everyone
that isn't trained to know difference.

693
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,990
The good news is that your secret
amongst amongst dudes can be safe.

694
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,130
The only way to tell the difference is
if you take it to a jeweler to figure it

695
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:47,420
out. If it's a dude, they're not going
to fucking rat you out. If it's a check,

696
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,160
well then you've got a
wildcard aren't your hands,

697
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,990
but there's nothing you
can do at that point.

698
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,320
I just know I'll do metal work in jewelry
stores are also cons because they're

699
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:59,270
going to want, because they're going to be
like, oh yeah, he bought you a fake one.

700
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,840
And because they know that the woman's
going to go home and fucking loser shit

701
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:06,280
and the guy is going to come back with
his tail between his legs bringing the

702
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,970
God damn bag of cash to buy a real one.
Um, I'm going say, okay, so I can't,

703
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,290
I can't even pronounce it
moist, Moist Sinai. Um,

704
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,510
he wrote it all basically
in lowercase letters,

705
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:21,960
so I don't know where to accent
that word. It's m o, I s s a N. I t.

706
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:25,460
E for guys who need to buy their
woman in an engagement ring.

707
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:27,440
But you don't want to blow a
bunch of money on diamonds,

708
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,810
just get them one of this
and they'll never know.

709
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,800
That's actually a great thing too,
to see if he got a gold digging whore.

710
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,020
She actually goes down and checks it out,

711
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:39,350
like immediately to see what it's worth.
Sexy. You already fucking leaving me.

712
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,210
What are you doing here?
Right. Um, all right. He said,

713
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,890
I just bought one for my girl last week.

714
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:50,891
Actually I looked up the exact diamond
equivalent and it was between 6,500 to

715
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:55,220
seven grand just for the diamond.
I paid 750 bucks.

716
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,460
The best news is that my girl is totally
on board with this idea and her idea

717
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:05,480
was to pocket the extra to go on a
bad ass honeymoon. Yeah, absolutely.

718
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:07,220
And then if somebody fucking goes,
you know,

719
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,610
gimme a fucking diamond ring or your life,
you just give it to me,

720
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:12,540
go Christ,

721
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,920
that's fucking brilliant.
Uh, you know what?

722
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:22,820
You should have counterfeit cash in your
wallet to just walk around everything

723
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,310
fake. I love this. By the way, you know,

724
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,760
made up that thing about spending
three months salary on a ring.

725
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,950
The fucking diamond companies,
of course they did.

726
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,290
They had a whole marketing
campaign around it,

727
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,510
so they're really fucking you over on,

728
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,800
on top of the fact that they
have a fucking monopoly so
they can charge whatever

729
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:43,660
the fuck they want for real
diamonds. It's a total sham. Anyways,

730
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,270
just wanted to spread the word and
let other dudes know that there is an

731
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:50,570
alternative that makes both the
girl and your bank account happy.

732
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,290
Go Fuck Yourself. You know what, the
more I hear about all of this stuff,

733
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,010
best thing ever, it's gotta be
real estate. You know what I mean?

734
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,160
You can walk up to it, you can
touch it, you can live in it.

735
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,580
Obviously if you've got a building on
it that's just gotta be the way to go.

736
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:11,190
You know, fucking stock market. I have
shares in this. Oh yeah, where are they?

737
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,550
You got them in your pocket.
You know,

738
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,970
I am a firm believer of um,

739
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,260
investing shit that you could just end
shit that you could walk up and touch.

740
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,210
But now with the diamonds, I dunno,
that's the whole diamond gain.

741
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:30,120
Now, if you, if you buy
into the diamond game now,

742
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,990
you have to that the,
the people at the top,

743
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:37,050
the evil doers actually,
uh, keep that monopoly.

744
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,600
Cause if they don't and you get
free enterprise going on there,

745
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,940
then then what do you have if you get
like sprint starts digging for diamonds,

746
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,650
right? Nokia and all these other cons.
And then what happens? You've got to,

747
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,950
you got to shit storm on your hands.
I swear to God people,

748
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:55,470
I'm going to buy an apartment building.
I'm going to become a slum Lord.

749
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:59,820
That's what I'm doing. I'm going to
buy apartment buildings, fixed them up,

750
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:04,800
read them out to people, and then I'm
going to slowly back out of this business.

751
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,850
I want to retire the way Sinatra
did the first time. That's my goal.

752
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:11,460
I don't know if I'll be able to do it,
but I would love the way he did it.

753
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,840
He's singing this song and he just goes,
excuse me while I disappear,

754
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,670
was the final loan line of the science
of Jesus Christ the final line of the

755
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:21,504
song,

756
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,670
the final long and assign the final
line of the song. There we go.

757
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,950
And um, it's for that pet. So
joke, look at me. I'm already
losing my mind here. Um,

758
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,720
and he just stepped out of
the spotlight dis that if he,

759
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,590
if he fucking left that way.
Come on man,

760
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,980
that's even better than if Jordan left
after he hit that shot against Utah.

761
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,570
I know I've already talked about this,

762
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:50,750
but I am obsessed with how to get out of
his business now as I've hit the middle

763
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:53,430
part of my career,
I feel 23 years ago,

764
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:56,940
I was 23 at 20 almost
24 23 years from now,

765
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,740
I'm going to be 70 just like that. Boom.
Fucking over. What am I going to be doing?

766
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:04,050
Huh?
70 years old,

767
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,360
you read the religion at that point they
put you out to pasture in fucking Vegas

768
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,800
or you're on cruise ships, but
either way, either way, they're like,

769
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,570
let's do you just stay right here,

770
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:20,490
their grandpa and we'll bring
the people to you. Fuck that.

771
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,010
Okay.

772
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:26,290
Fucked up. I'm going to buy a bunch.
I'm going to become a slum Lord.

773
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,540
I'm going to buy a bunch of
fucking apartment buildings
in the middle of nowhere

774
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,920
and I'm going to buy a white on
white suit, put on some weight,

775
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,960
and just look like boss Hog,
right?

776
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:42,590
A redheaded fucking boss Hog and I'm
going to walk around a white hat,

777
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,300
you know, and a big cigar that I never
liked. That's what I'm going to do.

778
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,080
There's actually some people that you
know who ended up great fucking retirement

779
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:54,711
out of this business.

780
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,760
The smothers brothers and what they
told me you were at the Orleans casino,

781
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,510
both of those guys,
they started their own a winery and a,

782
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,590
they have their own vineyard
and all that type of stuff,

783
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:10,410
and they got that thing going up
where it was making enough money to,

784
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,230
you know what's so cool about them?
When they retired,

785
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:13,700
they didn't even tell
people they were retiring.

786
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,220
They just did their last
show and they just left

787
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:22,210
total fucking class act, no
begging, no hat and the hand,

788
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,290
they'll fucking cry and no being broke.
They had their money.

789
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,990
They had a good fucking time.
They were done with.

790
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:33,850
They left and now they're sitting
on a fucking vineyard. Jesus Christ.

791
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,410
You fucking tell somebody, let me ask
you this. What's your guys game plant?

792
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,390
If you weigh,
what's your fantasy?

793
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:44,900
My fantasy is that I somehow fucking,
I dunno,

794
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,030
have enough money in real estate rental
properties or something. I don't know.

795
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,670
I'm just spit balling here,
right?

796
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,170
That you're actually making as much
in rent as you were doing your job.

797
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:59,980
So then you can quit your job and
just seamlessly walk over to that.

798
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:03,070
You can just be like, yeah, I'm
not working anymore. You know,

799
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,430
you got all your building's paid for.
You got all your things rented.

800
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,970
Everybody's cool. I know this isn't
going to happen. This is a fantasy.

801
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,420
And then the check just
comes in, right? You fucking,

802
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,830
you go live the middle of fucking
nowhere where it's cheap as hell.

803
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,630
No property tax,
no nothing.

804
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,780
Get a giant ass fucking TV.
All the sports packages,

805
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,213
right?

806
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,600
Get yourself a fucking book on, uh,
on how to eat Vegan or some shit.

807
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:38,601
So you stay in shape telling you and
then every night you just get shit.

808
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,060
Be fucking tremendous. Tremendous.
That's what I want to do.

809
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:49,990
I got to do it like that.

810
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:53,590
I can't be like these athletes that I
see that go around fucking acting like

811
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:57,100
jerk off sell whole career. Then they're
like, oh fuck, I'm in my final contract.

812
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,810
What am I going to deal with? And they
just keep playing and playing and playing.

813
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,860
Fucking try on half the
fucking jerseys in the league.

814
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,650
That ain't going to be making,
you know,

815
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,180
just like Paulie in Goodfellas, that
guy's going to die in jail. Okay.

816
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,540
Then ain't going to me. They ain't
gonna be me. Hey, smarten up. Right.

817
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,360
I hope that didn't hurt here. It's like
it just did mine. All right. Let me, uh,

818
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,970
get onto the next thing here.
Um, alright. Ditched Bio lady.

819
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,090
All right.
A dear old Billy freckles.

820
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,770
I had a date tonight with a lady and the
plan was to go get dinner and then see

821
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:33,580
it concert.

822
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,940
She was really cool and we went out to
a good restaurant near my apartment.

823
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,740
Dinner went well. I was making her laugh,
et cetera. And after I paid the check,

824
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:44,590
I told her I had to use the bathroom.
She said she would,

825
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,360
she wait right outside the restaurant.
So I went in and did my thing,

826
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:53,470
but when I came out I couldn't find her.
I had only taken a piss.

827
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:56,410
So it's not like I was taking
a long time in the bathroom.

828
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,920
I called her and it went
straight to voicemail.

829
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,350
Then I waited around and texted her and
she said that she had to leave because

830
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:09,400
her friend's boyfriend had just broken
up with her and that she needed to go

831
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:14,020
back to the apartment right
away. Uh, Jesus Christ really?

832
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,640
And she couldn't wait
to say goodbye to you.

833
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,380
I asked her if she couldn't have at least
told me before she left and she said

834
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:24,250
she was sorry. We both have tickets
to go see a concert next week,

835
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,950
which we had planned a before we planned,

836
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:31,230
but I think it's just going to be really
awkward and I don't want to do, uh,

837
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,590
and I don't know what to do because
I'm pretty sure she just ditch me.

838
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:39,090
I would love to hear your Boston
accent. Give me some advice. Thanks.

839
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:43,230
And Go fuck yourself. Um,
yeah, you either got discharge.

840
00:50:43,231 --> 00:50:46,200
She's unbelievably fucking rude. But
yeah, you can't hit your wagon to,

841
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:46,951
this is no way.

842
00:50:46,951 --> 00:50:50,700
There's no way you're putting a baby in
that the fuck you have a baby. You know,

843
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,340
when all of a sudden you know, she
squirts it out and you're like, oh my God,

844
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,174
look at it honey.

845
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,520
She fucking takes off again.
Yeah, you can't have that.

846
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,720
She's, she, she, I dunno. I don't know
what her fucking deal is, but why,

847
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:08,660
what all I need to do right now,
right now. Okay. You and this woman,

848
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,523
it's fucking over.

849
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:10,843
Okay.

850
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,080
And your be your best hope
if you still want a Banger,

851
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:16,020
is to stick by your guns that you,

852
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,120
that you don't put up with the shit that
it's fucking over and just be a matter

853
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:22,480
of fact. Just say no. That was really
rude. And I was also very immature.

854
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:26,580
If you weren't having a good
time, he should have just
said something. Um, there,

855
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,370
no, no, no. My girl fan boy.
And then, and then on top of
that, you lie to me. I mean,

856
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,020
I'm actually glad that all
of this happened because I
was able to see you know,

857
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:38,020
that you're not the kind of person that
I would want to be in a relationship

858
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:38,854
with.

859
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,040
You know, that fucks
with them. Wait a minute.

860
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,440
He's not mesmerized by my pussy anymore.

861
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:47,743
Right.

862
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,910
Next thing you know, she's riding. Yeah.
These are all just fantasies. People.

863
00:51:51,911 --> 00:51:54,580
I don't know if there's any of this
shit's true. Um, all right, so wait,

864
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:56,860
does she have one ticket
and you have one ticket?

865
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:58,370
Okay.

866
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,440
I Dunno.
I Dunno what the math is on a ticky said,

867
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:03,230
we both have tickets to go to
the show. Well, here's the deal.

868
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:04,790
If you have both the tickets,

869
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:05,900
okay,

870
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,520
then you just take somebody else.

871
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,523
MMM.

872
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,050
Yeah. And I don't even think you'll, you
don't think you over a phone call either,

873
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:18,460
do you? Or maybe you do. Yeah,
maybe do. I would just call
him. Just say, yeah, listen,

874
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:20,950
I'm taking somebody's, ah,
no, no, no. Don't do that.

875
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,250
If she has the tickets, sell,
tell it. If you keep them,

876
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,120
keep them. Yeah. I don't know.

877
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:36,140
This thing is over, dude. You don't
need me. You know what the deal is?

878
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:37,100
It's fucking over.

879
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:38,730
Yeah.

880
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,940
I gotta be honest. It's fucking hilarious
that she just left. I've done that.

881
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:45,210
I did that when I was young and immature.
I did that one time.

882
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,080
I met this woman and she wanted
to go out and go see this band.

883
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,970
And so we went out there and
next thing you know,

884
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:58,110
she was up on the stage dancing
while the band was playing,

885
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:02,880
pointing at the crowd as if
she was in the band. And um,

886
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,680
I didn't have the emotional maturity to
wait till she got off the stage to be

887
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:12,570
like, uh, yeah. I don't know what that
was. It seemed like you were enjoying it,

888
00:53:12,571 --> 00:53:16,920
but, um, it, uh, you know, I'm going to go

889
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,200
and, you know, I, I just
left and I'll tell you this,

890
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,620
I regret doing that because I think it
was really mean of me to do that to her,

891
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:31,510
if that's how she likes having a good
time and likes going up there and dancing

892
00:53:31,511 --> 00:53:33,460
in front of a band that
she's in and you know,

893
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,540
in front of a group that she's not in
pointing at the crowd is if she wrote the

894
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:40,840
song, if that's what the fuck
she likes to do, then, you know,

895
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,273
okay.

896
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,420
I guess, you know, I should
have let her do that. I was, uh,

897
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:52,050
the very least, they should have been a
man enough to fucking walk away. So, um,

898
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,030
trying to think is anybody. Yeah,
I've had a woman do that to me too.

899
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,840
I don't want more. One time was totally
into me. It was over. It was a lay up.

900
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:03,500
She was going to bang me and I went up
and I had a bad set and I got off and she

901
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:04,334
was gone.

902
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,590
I bombed so bad that a woman who was
willing to have sex with me thought better

903
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,150
of it.
And this is the best part.

904
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,600
It was a festival and it
was only a 15 minutes set.

905
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:20,970
Okay.

906
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,410
In 15 minutes.

907
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,793
Okay.

908
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,930
15 and I have to think that halfway
through my set, because I got off stage,

909
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,240
she was gone.
So about seven minutes in,

910
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:34,980
she did a one 80 and just fucking
walked out. So it came back to me.

911
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,750
Oh, it always comes back to you. All
right. Crime that pays your bill.

912
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:44,710
If you could get away with any,
with a major crime, which would, uh,

913
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,550
which would you be more proud of?
A bank heist and art,

914
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:52,050
robbery and assassination of an evil world
leader. Oh, assassination all day long.

915
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:53,280
That was the first thing I thought of.

916
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,410
That was the first thing I thought of
that if you went to like the last supper

917
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:03,720
of every dose, making people's lives
miserable, you know, pretending like,

918
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:06,600
you know, they don't have, they know
those people who buy up patents,

919
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,470
so we can't get, um, energy,

920
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,290
electricity and gas and
all that shit easier.

921
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,620
People who just fucking get in the way
of that progress, rape the environment,

922
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:20,400
fuck over poor people, all of
those, they all go to the same meal.

923
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:22,490
Yeah.

924
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:26,480
All right. And you just fucking, I dunno,

925
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:31,510
Yoga and like some photo or some shit
with one of those guns that they have on

926
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:34,920
like a fucking, I dunno,
you ever see that one?

927
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:38,200
That was an Argo when they went down the
runway and they had that machine gun on

928
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,970
that fucking jeep,

929
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:43,120
whatever and m 60 southern people are
tearing their fucking heroin right now

930
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:46,720
cause they know exactly what I was like,
Hey, I'm sick day made an f 60 16 years.

931
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:49,510
It's an AMD 60, 80 this point buddy. Um,

932
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,000
and you just fucking mow them down.

933
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:57,010
You just mow him down and it's old and
then all of a sudden, and then what bill,

934
00:55:57,011 --> 00:55:59,410
then who's going to run us?
Cause I know it's not going to be me.

935
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:03,700
Then somehow decent people all take those
jobs and make the right decisions and

936
00:56:03,701 --> 00:56:07,240
everybody's fucking chill and there's
enough for everybody and everybody can

937
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:08,510
relax.
Okay.

938
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,483
All right.

939
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,800
That's what I would do. Um, I would
never do an art robbery because

940
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,390
I don't have an appreciation
for a lot of it,

941
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,390
especially if it's just a
bunch of scribbles, you know,

942
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,650
if it looks like a sleeve tattoo or yeah,

943
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:25,680
somebody kind of call it
in your arm there, buddy.

944
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,330
I can kind of see a bird spider web.
I don't know what else is there. Um,

945
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,280
a bank heist. I don't want
to do that because, uh,

946
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:38,730
that fucks with regular people's money,
you know, art, robbery, then, you know,

947
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:43,520
next scene or Butler's out of a job.
Yeah. I probably shouldn't have said that.

948
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:47,240
I had assassinated evil word leader
probably put me on some fucking list,

949
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,123
you know,

950
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:52,160
just added to the fucking audio that they
have been the fucking basement of the

951
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:56,870
Pentagon. Um, it all, it all
ends up. Y'All end up, you know,

952
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,750
you just end up in a worker camp. I think
that's how it goes from here on out.

953
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,680
All right.
Roll the dice.

954
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:05,450
Dear bill and my wife has a friend
who we've known for a long time and it

955
00:57:05,451 --> 00:57:09,830
happens to be very attractive.
Let me read this again. My wife's.

956
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:10,470
Yeah,

957
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,780
my wife's, you have more
than one wife here, buddy.

958
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,380
My wife has a friend who
we've known for a long time.

959
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,740
It happens to be very attractive. Okay,
so you've already rubbed one out to her,

960
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,070
possibly thought about or why
you're banging your wife. Okay.

961
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:26,190
The other day over a couple
of drinks with my wife,

962
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:31,770
she admits that she wants to experience
a threesome and she wants it to be with

963
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:34,950
us. Oh, Jesus.

964
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,640
No.

965
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:44,020
Oh my God. Here we go. Here we go. Jesus,
we should have closed with this question.

966
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,850
This, this is a close bid right here.
When my wife first tells me this,

967
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:52,960
you can imagine my excitement,
but then she adds the kicker,

968
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,850
her friend while confessing,
um,

969
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,390
her desire for threesome ads that
she has genital herpes bump on.

970
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,170
Wow.
I did not see that left turn coming,

971
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:14,450
but she swears that it is dormant
and we're not at risk. Well,

972
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,650
how do you think she got it?

973
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,623
Okay.

974
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,680
Oh, that's such a stupid thing to say.
Maybe she fucks him guy. Well, you know,

975
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:23,110
you always have to fucking, you know,
look out for the women in these,

976
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:25,450
maybe she fucks him.
Douchebags scum bag guy.

977
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:29,530
Like you've seen their fucking dig on
a billboard out in La. It, it says,

978
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:32,640
do you trust him? And there's a
guy laying there with his shift,

979
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:37,030
the look on his face with this woman
looking at him, HIV positive, you know,

980
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:40,240
type of thing. Well they would never
have a billboard. Do you trust her?

981
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,950
It's unfucking believable. Like you know,
I saw to time one of these magazines,

982
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:48,610
right where it says, uh, you know,

983
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,860
reasons women cheat top 10 reasons women
cheat in the top eight out of 10 was

984
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:56,230
were because of Gat was was
something that guy was doing.

985
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,970
It's fucking unbelievable. Anyways,
plowing ahead. I am close to your age.

986
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:01,870
So I asked you,

987
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,450
do you roll the dice and go for it
knowing that this may be your last shot of

988
00:59:05,451 --> 00:59:09,100
the threesome or do you play it safe
and politely declined the offer?

989
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:13,450
Thanks and go fuck yourself in
parentheses with protection.

990
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,640
Uh, no dude, you can't. You can't do that.

991
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,900
You cannot do that because right now
you're going to have a fucking threesome.

992
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,380
All right? Even if you did, it's going to
make it weird between you and your wife.

993
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:27,190
It just is. As much as you're going to
try to be cool, it's, it's, you know,

994
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:31,960
you'll be cool with it. She won't
be on some level. She won't be,

995
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:35,050
you fucking moaned a little
too much with the other one.

996
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:39,070
It's going to be a fucking shit show.
All right? And then on top of that,

997
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,070
you're on, or you're going to be reminded
once a goddamn month that you did it.

998
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:46,670
Fuck that. Fuck Carla. That
all right. This is the deal.

999
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,820
All right? If your wife is
willing to fucking do it, that,

1000
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:53,510
why don't you do it with somebody who's a,
you know what I mean?

1001
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,880
Who doesn't have any prior
convictions here? All right.

1002
00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:00,770
Get somebody with a clean
slate and, um, but um, I dunno,

1003
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,950
I'm sort of a firm believer that
you can't do that with your wife.

1004
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,060
You do that with somebody that you're
not going to be married to. I just think,

1005
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,500
uh, you know, I don't know.

1006
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:15,650
You ever see that shit when people like
fucking drink too much water and they

1007
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:19,220
die cause like the, the, the walls
of their cells like burst open.

1008
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:23,990
Like that's what I think happens when
you have a threesome with your wife and

1009
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:28,310
somebody else. And it's basically the
lining to your relationship. It's fucking,

1010
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,900
it's split. It's done, it's
over. Right. And then it becomes,

1011
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:36,410
then her next thing is going to be
like, well, let's do it again this time.

1012
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:39,410
Can we do it with a guy and a,

1013
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:42,920
well now I want to do what a fucking guy
because there's nothing in it for me.

1014
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:47,600
You know what I mean? What the fuck? Well,

1015
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:50,870
there was nothing if fuck you,
you enjoy the women can enjoy other women,

1016
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,790
you know, and you get into that, well
that's a double fucking standard. I go,

1017
01:00:55,791 --> 01:01:00,590
suck a dick already. Leave me out of it.
I'll be downstairs. You know, you just,

1018
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:02,600
you just walking into
that whole fucking world.

1019
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,550
MMM Jesus Christ.

1020
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,640
But you know, you gotta give it up to
this woman for just being totally upfront.

1021
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,920
Gee, I mean that, look,
there's something going on.

1022
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,520
The fact that you're excited by this
and not shocked and that your wife is

1023
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:20,730
willing to do it.
All right?

1024
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,640
You guys all seem like this is
all pretty loosey Goosey here.

1025
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,870
I Dunno dude. Even with protection,
they see you can still get it, dude.

1026
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:36,750
Fuck that. I don't know.
I, I wouldn't do it.

1027
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,010
I would politely decline

1028
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,960
and then ask for references if she hasn't
anybody she knows that doesn't have

1029
01:01:42,961 --> 01:01:46,620
herpes as wants to do it. I don't, I don't
know what to tell you here, buddy. Um,

1030
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,260
okay.

1031
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,270
I would say don't listen to your Dick.

1032
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,680
What would you tell a friend of
yours if they were in that position?

1033
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,063
Oh my God.

1034
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:02,340
I guess the question I haven't
asked is how hot is this woman?

1035
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:07,470
Is it worth the risk?
I don't know.

1036
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:09,870
You don't want it is I, I
just, I can't get beyond like,

1037
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:13,330
what is the conversation afterwards?
Okay.

1038
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:19,030
You Guys Bang. First of all, do
not bang in your own fucking house.

1039
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,710
Okay? You want to walk away from that
crime scene. You understand? All right?

1040
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:28,690
But then you gotta be thinking like,
okay, then you get in the car now.

1041
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:29,980
Fuck that.
You got to have that,

1042
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:35,490
you know that awkward goodbye.
Oh my God.

1043
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,380
Yeah, that was, that was
fun. Hopefully it went well.

1044
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,090
Hopefully you don't get so excited,
sir. That you fucking, uh, you know,

1045
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,700
you get a false start there.
Right.

1046
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,550
Let's just hope the whole fucking
thing goes well. And then he got,

1047
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:54,460
he got that ride home in the
car. Yeah. You both get in there.

1048
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:57,730
You're both trying to make you don't
want is, you don't know what to say.

1049
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:01,050
So you just making noises like
sitting down and like, Heh,

1050
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,940
putting on the radio.
He looked like a yeah.

1051
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:12,130
Got a new Costco down here. Huh? You know,
God knows where the fuck her head's at.

1052
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,550
I'll tell you this right now.
There's no fucking way.

1053
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:20,430
She's not going to ask some questions.
So you know,

1054
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:24,730
like what are you thinking
right now? Oh, I would,

1055
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:28,320
we normally think and I'm thinking,
fuck, you don't even start this shit.

1056
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,120
This is the thing. I think you have
to have that conversation beforehand.

1057
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,200
If you're going to do it, you gotta say
to your wife, all right, here's the deal.

1058
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:39,340
We're going to do this shit, but no being
fucking weird afterwards. All right,

1059
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:45,010
none of this did you like it? And he lent
jai hair my then meet and none of that.

1060
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:50,580
That's all off the table. All
right, then what are you then?

1061
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:55,950
Then she's sitting on it and then you know
what she do? Then she'll start crying.

1062
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,393
You know,
I know.

1063
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:06,360
I'm just presenting the worst
case scenario or even worse.

1064
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,500
She fucking loves it and
wants to do it all the time.

1065
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,220
And then that just leads to just, ah,
it's just going to lead the other shit.

1066
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,280
It's gonna lead the other shit. I Dunno.
I Dunno. Who knows? It could be fun,

1067
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:24,540
could be fun. I just presented all the
hazards that could possibly happen.

1068
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:27,280
Who knows? Man, you can fucking
go do it. Bang, Bang, bomb.

1069
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:30,510
You guys never fucking talk about it
again. You get to check that off the list.

1070
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,710
You know, you stare at your
Dick for a good 30 to 60 days.

1071
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,140
Nothing looks funny down there. And
you know what? You got away with it.

1072
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,320
Just like Woody Allen and
crime and punishment, right?

1073
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:45,160
You just sort of get away with it. Who
knows? Maybe it happens, I don't know.

1074
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,540
All right? And with that,
stamps.com everybody,

1118
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:33,700
All right. Let's wrap this thing up
here with the final question. Um,

1119
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:38,250
I know what you guys do. Have
you been watching hockey?
Yes, I have. Yes, I have. Uh,

1120
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:40,620
I've been watching the Ottawa
Montreal series, of course,

1121
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:45,180
rooting against Montreal, um, Ottawa
or giving them a way tougher series.

1122
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,190
Then I thought they were going to,
they played great. They just, um,

1123
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,980
Montreal is just fucking relentless,
relentless. I can't even talk.

1124
01:07:52,981 --> 01:07:56,610
I'm so fucking out of it's
God damn late nights. Um,

1125
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,460
they've just been so
fucking relentless and,

1126
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:02,190
uh, I dunno, man.

1127
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:07,640
They had to win. Obviously they had
to win the last game three zero.

1128
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:10,580
I don't see Montreal losing four straight,
although if they do,

1129
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,463
mmm.

1130
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,850
I will book,
what can I do next week on the podcast?

1131
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,520
If they somehow lose four games in a row,

1132
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,763
I don't know what I'd do.

1133
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,830
It would just be the greatest thing
ever. I wouldn't, I would truly enjoy it,

1134
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:26,360
but then I would get
nervous because we did that.

1135
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:29,120
We blew up three games to
none lead against March, uh,

1136
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:33,410
against the flyers and then the neck.
Very next year we won the Stanley Cup.

1137
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,090
So I hope that doesn't happen.
I hope they don't lose four in a row.

1138
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:43,150
Do I? I don't fucking know. What am I
talking about? All right. Mother herb.

1139
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:46,240
Dear Billy Bong rip.
Um,

1140
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,340
Monday is four 20,

1141
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:53,020
and I know the Thursday podcast is now
designated towards good vibes, man.

1142
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,310
While the Monday morning remains your
bleak outlook on humanity, it really does.

1143
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,410
However,
in the spirit of the holiday,

1144
01:08:59,411 --> 01:09:02,320
can you please tell us something
crunchy about yourself?

1145
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,790
I don't even know what that means.

1146
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Perhaps a time when you connected with
nature or saw the human race is won or in

1147
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:13,600
the least tell about a
song or movie you saw. Hi.

1148
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:17,000
That was awesome. I love you. Love Nia.

1149
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:21,900
This guy wrote this when he was
high. Love both of you guys, man. Um,

1150
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:25,750
I do. I always seen the human
race's one. I've always seen it.

1151
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:28,210
That's why it's so fucking
depressing to watch the concert,

1152
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,530
the top do what they're doing.

1153
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,730
That's why my fantasy is to take all of
'em out and then people who are actually

1154
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:35,410
responsible going and do the job.

1155
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:38,200
When they fix the world and I don't have
to do anything after I'm done pulling

1156
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:41,650
the trigger and my life is totally easy.
Maybe that's selfish.

1157
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,400
I don't know what it is.
Maybe I'm an idealist.

1158
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:49,160
You want me to tell you something
crunchy about myself? It's not enough to,

1159
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:50,530
you know that I make pies,

1160
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:55,100
Huh?
From scratch.

1161
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:57,580
Okay.

1162
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:01,200
All right. You know what? I have a
lemon and lime tree in my front yard.

1163
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,083
All right.

1164
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,280
And I get excited when I walk out there
and I get to pick them off the tree,

1165
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,430
you know? And then I bring them in
the house and I go, you know what?

1166
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:13,050
I'm going to make a key
lime pie out of this.

1167
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,560
And then I come back later when I
realized that I forgot to tell my wife and

1168
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:20,940
she's fucking used the
limes that I needed. See,

1169
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,940
it's still going to go back
to something bleak, you know?

1170
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,660
Cause that's what's like physics.
There's a, there's the balance man.

1171
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,050
You know what I mean? Man. It's like,
you know when life gives you lemons, you,

1172
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:30,910
your wife's can eat a man and it's just,

1173
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:34,240
you just gotta be all right with Ted man.
He's got to look down at your toes,

1174
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:38,680
wiggle Amenia sandals, and just kind of
wait for the other ones to grow, man.

1175
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:41,860
You know? Um, how was that? Was that fine?

1176
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:46,750
Was that okay?
We're in something crunchy by me.

1177
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:49,570
How about the fact that I'm going out
to all these tertiary cities? Yes.

1178
01:10:49,571 --> 01:10:52,660
I just did use that word. Did I
pronounce it correctly? I don't think so.

1179
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,190
How about that?

1180
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:57,040
How about I liked going out and fucking
hanging out with the people afterwards.

1181
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:02,010
I actually enjoy people on a one to one
basis if they're not conscious. Right.

1182
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,630
I, you know what? You got me,
sir. I think you stumped me.

1183
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,240
I don't know that I have anything crunchy.

1184
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:13,690
No. Sorry. I tried.

1185
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,700
What do you want from me

1186
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:21,060
baby seals washing up on the fucking
beach has killed me this week.

1187
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,770
Is that crunchy enough for you?
Okay.

1188
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:23,620
Okay.

1189
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,550
It's made me not eat fish
the whole fucking week.

1190
01:11:25,551 --> 01:11:29,270
I think I might be done with fish. I'm
done eating animals that we can't grow,

1191
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:34,100
you know, breed or whatever.
Even then, I think it's,

1192
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,270
I don't know, I go back and forth
with, if it makes me a piece of shit,

1193
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:42,800
if I eat fucking animals or if you know,
they would have gotten eaten anyway.

1194
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:47,550
What the fuck would a cow we doin
if we didn't have a fence around it?

1195
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:51,420
It would be walking around like a big
slow dope and it'll get, you know,

1196
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:54,540
there'd be a fucking mountain lion
around his neck within two seconds.

1197
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:59,580
Just hang in there slowly suffocating
the thing. Well, we got the decency.

1198
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,220
They have that ceiling
gun hover over its head

1199
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,230
and knock them out so you can get
yourself a prime god damn ribs.

1200
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:12,080
I know there's a lot of questions. I
liked that angle, man. Try to draw it.

1201
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,640
The crunchy side of me that
made me really uncomfortable.

1202
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,140
There was a nice feeling.

1203
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,890
Everyone's so why you got to get
out of your comfort zone? All right,

1204
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:22,230
that's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1205
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:27,090
I'll check in on you on
Thursday. And, uh, you know what,

1206
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,630
I'm rooting for the Tampa Bay lightening
because they have been hab killers.

1207
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,810
God knows the Bruins weren't.
So that is my adoptive team.

1208
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,700
I haven't watched a second of the fucking
capital's islanders series that seems

1209
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:39,900
like it's going to be a great one.

1210
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:44,460
And I'm loving that the islanders in
their last year in that building, uh,

1211
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:49,020
are going out like champs here, you know,
going down, swinging. If I got the time,

1212
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,780
the Games keep coming on the east
coast ones when I have shows.

1213
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,490
So I'm in central time now.

1214
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:57,740
Maybe I can watch the first
period of, uh, what does it,

1215
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:02,250
I guess it's game for. All
right. That's it. That's the
podcast. Go fuck yourselves.

1216
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:03,240
I'll talk to you next week.
