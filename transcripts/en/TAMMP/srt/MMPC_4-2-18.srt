1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,640
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:08,641
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for April 2nd,

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,900
2018 what's going on?
How

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,040
welcome to April everybody. Oh, you
didn't think you'd make it, did you?

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,690
Oh the God damn snow just kept falling
out of the fucking sky and all these

6
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:26,260
fucking liberal concept talking
about global warming. Oh yeah,

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,600
I'll fucking cool you off when
my fucking toes. You can't. Um,

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,460
global warming.
I love on people who fucking,

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,470
when it snows in the winter,
people just go to global warming.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,470
Um, I dunno bill, don't try
to be a scientist. Okay.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,860
You've tried to be a lot of things
on this podcast and failed miserably.

12
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:55,180
Why would you pick such as smart vocation
to start off with? Well, you know,

13
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:59,380
cause I'm an arrogant ass.
Oh,

14
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:02,410
did I sleep well last night?
You know,

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,880
I uh, um, you know, I got my big,

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,070
big birthday coming up my 50th birthday.

17
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:15,071
So my deal was there's a certain weight
I wanted to get down to and a one of

18
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:17,270
those gene companies,

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,970
you know that advertise on my podcast,
I can't remember the fucking name of them.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,580
It's one of those people, you know,
we were two broke college kids,

21
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:28,160
so we started a fucking Jean factory kits.
Like,

22
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:32,150
well how the fuck did you do that?
Thought you were broke.

23
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,930
You know, if you're trying to be all
down to earth and next thing you know,

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,960
you gotta you gotta fucking company.
What are you telling me?

25
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,630
You just sold them yourself.
Yeah,

26
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:44,040
we'll make you a pair of
pants set will be about a,

27
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,360
I don't know what we got to
learn how to sell first. Uh,

28
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:48,500
well cause we're Bronx sir.

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,620
We can't afford any sewing machines and
people that know how to operate them.

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,483
Okay.

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,340
Paulagy accepted and I'm sorry
too for yelling, but you know,

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,890
if you want jeans from us,
it's just going to take a moment.

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,693
Yeah.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,310
So staying up on this thing so I can
measure your, do your inseam. Yeah.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,481
So anyways,

36
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:14,481
they sent me a pair of jeans
that were a 30 to 32 would I,

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,350
you know, I was 34,
32. Uh, and now I'm 33,

38
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,350
32. So my, my goal is to get back to that.

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,630
I think that's the size that I had in
high school slash when I started, um,

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,410
started doing comedy. So I'll
see if I can, I don't know.

41
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,700
I don't know if I want to do that.
Cause you know,

42
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:40,100
this is one of those things
where like if your, uh, if your,

43
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,920
your high school weight when you're
my age, but you never really went up,

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,300
I don't think you look that bad.

45
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,210
But like if you get down to your high
school weight and you were actually like

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,020
an adult males weight, uh, you
kind of look like you're dying.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,620
Okay.

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,860
Um, but we'll see. Uh,

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,120
I am back on my little health kick here.

50
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,830
Um, I told you last Monday, you know,

51
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,550
I did the goddamn comedy jam and,
um,

52
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,950
I had a shot at Jamison before the show,
you know, sort of a tradition, you know,

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,720
drink a little shot of fucking courage.
And then after the show I went out,

54
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,670
I was just going to have one
beer and it was going to go home,

55
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,370
but I showed up and somebody already
bought me another Jameson. So I had that.

56
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,690
And then I had a beer, but you know, the,

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,170
the shot and the beer was stretched
way out between the first,

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,950
like the whole show went
by like three hours. Um,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,130
and I had a couple of
waters after the first shot,

60
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,380
so it was really just the
shot of Jameson in the beer.

61
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:42,010
And the next day I woke up. And, um,

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,140
aside from the fact that I stayed
out till one in the morning,

63
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,640
my lovely daughter gets up at like, oh,
six, six 30, I just woke up and I just,

64
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:53,200
I wasn't worth a shit until like
fucking two in the afternoon.

65
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,090
And, um, I was just like, I can't, I,

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,910
I can't do this.
I just can't fucking do this.

67
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,030
So I didn't drink

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,690
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

69
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,260
and then Friday I performed at arguably
my favorite theater in the country.

70
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,450
Um, the Brady theater and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

71
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,860
And it's,

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I cannot expect fucking place and the
people that show up there and the way the

73
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:30,550
laugh sound in that room and the sound
and the look of that fucking place,

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,750
it's, it's unreal. The amount of
people too who've never been there.

75
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:38,200
When I told them I was going to Tulsa,
Oklahoma, they were like Tulsa, Jesus,

76
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,140
you know, thinking that it was going
to be like tumbleweeds and stuff.

77
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,170
It's a really fucking hipster replace.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Like the food scene alone

79
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,320
is crazy and you know when
the food is really good,

80
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,620
then you're going to have the record
store, which I liked the record store.

81
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:58,420
I don't necessarily like, you know, the
Douche is that go in there, you know,

82
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,590
I, you know, I'm a Douche to,

83
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,230
but like I was actually riffing about
that on stage where people like, dude,

84
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,960
it's sounds so much better.
It's like I can't hear the difference.

85
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,310
I can't hear that Daniel knew the CD was,
it was a lie man.

86
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,580
Everything got compressed and two,

87
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,620
they just get into a whole
fucking sound thing. And I'm just,

88
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,850
I just like records because they
reminded me when I was a kid, you know,

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,640
and you feel like you kind of got
more for your money. Well, you know,

90
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,480
you open it up and there was all these
pictures on the inside sleeve and all of

91
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,900
that shit. Um, I dunno.

92
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,260
As opposed to now you just download
it off off like iTunes and it's just

93
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,930
floating in the air man.
Um,

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,750
so anyways, I uh, so gifts getting
offstage that night, it was like,

95
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,090
I'm not going to drink.
And I just felt like, uh,

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,710
you know the habit of me doing
that being like, come on man,

97
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,580
just have fucking one.
Cause I was flying after the show.

98
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,860
It was like that show in Tulsa.

99
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,070
Every fucking reason why I
ever wanted to be a comedian.

100
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,060
It was so much fucking fun.
I was barely doing my act.

101
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,460
I forget what I did. Oh, I know why
I, I connected. I flew to Dallas,

102
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,450
connected there and then went up to Tulsa.
And um,

103
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,990
the second I got on the plane in Tulsa,

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,290
like there was just like three or
four really big people, you know,

105
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,150
not just fat but just big ass fucking
people. So I was just riffing on that.

106
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:30,180
One of them. Two people was so big
and fat they had to use wheelchair.

107
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,830
So I was just riffing on
the fact, you know? Yeah.

108
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:37,910
Are you really helping them out if you're
wheeling them around like a fucking

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,880
toddler and you know,
it's like,

110
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm not trying to like
bring back segregation here,

111
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,030
but I really think wheelchairs to
just be for people who can't fucking,

112
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,500
whose legs don't work.
It's like your legs work,

113
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,930
you asshole lay off the cookies.

114
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,203
MMM.

115
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,180
I actually said you guys so fat that
even if he has a full head of hair,

116
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:05,110
you can still see most of his scalp. You
know, cause even that, it's just get,

117
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:08,890
even his head is getting like fat. It's
like stretching out. It was unbelievable.

118
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:11,560
This guy sat in the chair in
front of me and the fucking chair.

119
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,740
It was like coming down and it was one
of those things like an action movie,

120
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,620
like it's just going to fucking stop
or am I going to get crushed to death?

121
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,640
And it stopped about two inches
from the bridge of my nose.

122
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,240
I think I audibly exhaled like,
you know, cause it's like,

123
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,070
I mean, watching that guy tried to
get up, it'd be like my daughter,

124
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:36,990
she's still can't do like a sit up.
You know what I mean?

125
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:38,760
She just doesn't have the strength.
It's hilarious.

126
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:42,380
She gets like three inches up and she's
making this face and she's staring at

127
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,270
yeah. And then I just start laughing
and then she laughs, which, you know,

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
makes her fall back down again.

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,073
MMM.

130
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,300
So anyways,
she said Dad die now all the time,

131
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,390
but she was in the crib this morning and
I'm always the one that goes out and I

132
00:07:57,391 --> 00:08:00,690
get her and then, uh, you know,

133
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,850
pick her up and I figured out, because
she gives the best hugs, but she's also,

134
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,760
you know, a toddler now, so she
just wants to look at everything.

135
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,710
So when she says she only
does it for half a second.

136
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,490
So the way to trick her into giving
you a nice minute long hug it,

137
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:19,590
she got to sing to her and she loves sea
itsy bitsy spider right now like that.

138
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,780
That's your fucking jam,
right?

139
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,640
So I just come out there
and she's like, hi, hi.

140
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,140
Hi. Hi. You know, showing off the
word that she knows how to say.

141
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,020
And then I just pick her up and she gives
me the quick hug and then immediately

142
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,270
is pointing over to the
changing table cause you know,

143
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:39,660
she wants to get that over with so she
could then go in and watch a little

144
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,810
cartoons, you know, and drink
a bottle of milk. Right.

145
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,930
That I got it down now I just
pick her up and I just go,

146
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,400
oh the itsy bitsy spider went up.
The water spout.

147
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,080
Dow came though Ray,
they're wise to spider out and by,

148
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,790
she's already later head. I
sing. It's sweeter than that.

149
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,950
I kind of pushed through with you guys,
didn't want to creep you out,

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,300
but she fucking uh,
puts their head down on my shoulder.

151
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,470
It just sits,
there is content.

152
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:12,400
I could sing the song like six times
in a row and she'll just lay there.

153
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,970
And then when I get sick of that song,
I just sing the abcs and uh,

154
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,140
and did she does this thing, if you
squeeze her and you go give me a hug,

155
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,200
her too little fat hands.
She grabs two handfuls of your shirt.

156
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,260
That's fucking adorable.
Um,

157
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,900
I'm starting to realize why dad's
cry at their daughter's wedding.

158
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,770
You know, I used to do, I think
it was some weird shit though.

159
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,020
They would just like thinking
like, oh, this guy is good.

160
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,370
Even if even if they haven't
already bagged, he's got a
banger now tonight. Yeah.

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,910
Oh God, you pluck an ass hole. And I got
to pretend like I like, um, you know,

162
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,890
thinking like that shit. It isn't,
they're thinking about the Etsy be like,

163
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,870
I used to sing this kid, the
itsy bitsy spider, you know,

164
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,940
where did the fucking decades
go? So anyways, going back to my,

165
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:06,440
uh, you know, the booze
and, and shit like, um,

166
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,720
I dunno. So then, uh, you know, that man,

167
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,240
it's like that's already going to be the
greatest moments in my life are going

168
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:21,241
to be those and I just don't want to be
all banged up and extra tired and God

169
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,630
forbid grumpy. So, um,

170
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,790
I dunno. So then San
Antonio, I did two shows,

171
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,030
fucking amazing crowds down there.
Um,

172
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,620
and once again I just carried
over whatever happened in Tulsa.

173
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,160
Uh,
I've learned how to do that though,

174
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,230
as far as like what happens as you know,
when you go out on one night,

175
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:48,800
you just in the zone and you're not even
doing your act the next night you come

176
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:49,401
on stage,

177
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:53,570
you're like hoping that you're going to
be in the zone again the night before.

178
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,870
You weren't hoping that you were going
to be in the zone. It just happened.

179
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,350
So then you going out there and now
you're hoping it's going to be like last

180
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,580
night. So now you're walking on stage
and you're thinking about last night.

181
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,430
So you're not,
you're not like mentally,

182
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,650
they're not to get all trippy.

183
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,040
So what I do is I try to
let go of the last night,

184
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,880
but do the same fucking
thing that I did in that.

185
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:24,470
I'll just talk about something that I
just fucking saw except this time it's in

186
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,310
San Antonio.

187
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,050
And I just came out and I was bitching
about the fact that I didn't realize that

188
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:34,880
the final fucking for
Pfoa was in San Antonio.

189
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,420
I kind of figured it out when it was 500
bucks a night at a Goddamn red roof inn

190
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:41,330
bought up by the fucking airport.
Um,

191
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,220
and then it was just like this going to
be a real problem with transportation.

192
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:50,100
I had to hire this company,
you know,

193
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,900
to make sure they get picked me
up the airport. Get Dean, you,

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,920
it was out there with del Rio del rape.
Fucking murdered so hard in Tulsa.

195
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
He had a sustained round of applause.

196
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,530
Like he had to wait
before he introduced me.

197
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,150
That's how fucking hard
this guy's killing.

198
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,880
So you got to go see dean
when he's out in the road.

199
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:11,290
Actually watch them do like a full set.
I know he has an album coming out to uh,

200
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,220
on vinyl, I believe,
speaking of records. So, um,

201
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,733
anyways,

202
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,100
I went out and just did the same thing
and on both shows I just, you know,

203
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,850
fucked around and rift about some shit
and it just got me into this place.

204
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,340
And then it was fun cause I was,
you know,

205
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,840
both nights I was teasing people about
having an ar fifteens and telling them

206
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,020
how they should go about talking to people
on the left about why you have an ar

207
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:45,250
15. And um, it just,

208
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:49,540
it just was a fucking great night
both nights. So what does my point?

209
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,940
So my point is, I just, you know, through,

210
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:54,670
I was watching the Zen
diaries of Garry Shandling,

211
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,620
this fucking incredible
documentary that Judd Apatow did.

212
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,290
Um, and it is such the standup
comedian he experience,

213
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,360
I literally had to take breaks from it.

214
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,030
I had to shut it off or hit pause.
I'd be watching the thing right.

215
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,320
And I would just,

216
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,450
something he would write down because
Gary I guess kept all these diaries and

217
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,220
stuff and judge just,

218
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:25,990
we'll just like film like just
a line or two that he wrote.

219
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,000
And uh,

220
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,320
it would either be something that I
thought or something that I never realized

221
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:34,030
and it's just like, yeah, that's it.

222
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,070
Or just an experience that I had and
obviously all my experiences are in a way

223
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:42,880
less like whatever experience he had at
the tonight show or hosting the Emmy's.

224
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,500
I had plane,
you know,

225
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:48,490
uncle fuckees and you know
that Swampscott Massachusetts.

226
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,930
Um, but I just kept fighting. I would
be watching this. She was hilarious.

227
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,710
It'd be watching the show and he would
be like in the other room and then she

228
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,190
just hit me in the other
room just going like, ah,

229
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,480
and
um,

230
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,770
just watching how the way
this thing is put together,

231
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm not going to ruin it for you.
But just seeing how,

232
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:17,380
like one like major event,

233
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,020
when you're a kid with
your developing mind,

234
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,570
be it positive or negative,

235
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,600
how it just shapes and informs the rest
of your life and the way that it is done

236
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,920
is so fucking masterful in
this documentary. And um,

237
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,930
I don't know, I just can't
say enough things about it. So

238
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,900
I was sitting there after having watched
it, or actually I'd watched up to the,

239
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,180
like the first half hour of part two.
I mean,

240
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:49,540
it's like four and a half hours
long and it's fucking amazing.

241
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,970
And I was actually out on the road going,
fuck,

242
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:57,590
I wish I could watch the
rest of that right now. You
know, it's just, you know, I,

243
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,390
it's hard to find four and a half
hours when you got, you know,

244
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,330
you've got a 14 month old
to just sit down in a row.

245
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:05,690
So I was out there and I was
just thinking about, you know,

246
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:09,740
I was mad at myself that and went
out after Tulsa and I had a drink.

247
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,870
I had one drink and then
somebody sent one over to me.

248
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,210
And of course I'm going to drink that
cause they didn't want to be rude and you

249
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:17,420
know,
I'm a bit of a Booze Hound and um,

250
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,310
I kinda just was sticking
to myself. Like, uh,

251
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,260
I told myself I wasn't going to drink
until fucking June and I already fucked up

252
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,070
on the road. Not even cause I wanted
to just started like, you know,

253
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,730
I'm flying high and fucking wide awake.
I don't want the night to end,

254
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,410
you know, um, to awake to
fucking go is still to sleep.

255
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,720
I got an 8:00 AM flight,
let me just fucking have one.

256
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,190
And then next thing you know,

257
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,740
I'm fucking staying out till
like one in the goddamn morning.

258
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,080
I gotta get up at six for the
flight is what am I doing?

259
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,040
I should be out here getting
sleep for when I come back.

260
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,760
So I going to be a better dad. This is
stupid. So, because I watched, you know,

261
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,340
at that point,
the first half of the zen diary thing,

262
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,500
I actually had a notebook because I was
writing out some of the drum parts for

263
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:06,020
these songs. I got to sing with
Dell Rake, not saying sorry,

264
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:10,970
play on Tuesday night out
here at the Avalon. And uh,

265
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,470
I was just like, why don't
you just write down, you know,

266
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:19,190
these goals? Cause sometime if he,
sometimes if you just fucking think them,

267
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,980
they're not real and then I feel
Sam or write them down anyways,

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
how my brain works,
it becomes real.

269
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:29,150
So I just kind of wrote it down the
shit that I wanted to do, you know,

270
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:33,980
the shape I wanted to be in and
yeah,

271
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,920
I just wrote down that I was just for
the month of April. I'm just like,

272
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,210
I'm not smoking any fucking cigars.
I'm not drinking any booze.

273
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,700
Um, you know, not
watching any fucking porn,

274
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,080
you know,
fucking stupid online porn,

275
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:53,690
lonely shit you do on
the road and that porno,

276
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:58,520
I swear to God it's going to come out
like how bad that is for you, your brain,

277
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,380
you know what I mean? Cause I find
myself now when I watch porno laughing,

278
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,650
like I'm watching a sitcom,

279
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,620
it's always something that just
strikes me is fucking funny. Um,

280
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,040
yeah. And it's just like, I
shouldn't be laughing while
was this, this weird. Right.

281
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,820
And then you also think
like, you know, you go back,

282
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,200
I don't know how many fucking years,

283
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,180
like if you went back like a hundred years
and you showed somebody like a laptop

284
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:29,570
and be like, yeah, you realize you can
watch this and you just put it on the,

285
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,170
I swear to God, they would burn you at
the stake. Lik you were a fucking, which

286
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,540
like how fucked up it would be that a
human being could sit down anytime they

287
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,710
wanted and just watch endless
hours of that shit. Um,

288
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,410
I bet I did some brain damage. Something.
It's like you fucking, it's like you, I,

289
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:48,940
I really feel like, um, um,

290
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,840
destroying my soul by watching that shit

291
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,660
on some level. So I was
like, good to not do that.

292
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,340
I'm going to fucking continue to work out
all of these, just sort of these, these,

293
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,710
these,
I dunno,

294
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,970
health goals and then I
got to work on my, my, uh,

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,590
my anger issues because my daughter
doesn't realize I have them yet and it's

296
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:18,000
just inevitable. She's going to,
I've been doing this joke on my act,

297
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,750
how it likes a couple of times
she seen me start to slice. She,

298
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,180
she honestly hasn't even met me
yet as far as like who I really am.

299
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,990
She's met the side of
me that I'm proud of,

300
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,980
but all this shit that I'm ashamed of,
she hasn't really met yet.

301
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,670
She's seen a couple of glimpses, but I'm
always able to joke my way out of it.

302
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,830
Like, Oh Daddy, always through
the laptop through the Weirdo.

303
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,480
She's laughing because she doesn't
know what those words mean or that,

304
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:49,410
that behavior is fucked
up. Right. So I dunno,

305
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,270
that's just shit I have to
work on. So, uh, I don't know.

306
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:57,510
I don't think I would have written that
down and it would have become real had I

307
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,650
not watched that. Uh, Zen diaries,
a Gary Shayla, I'm telling man,

308
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,920
you gotta you gotta fucking see
that thing and speaking the way HP,

309
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,960
I was killing it this month
because they have like a,

310
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:11,760
they got one on a documentary on like
Andre the giant, Martin Luther King.

311
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,500
Um, Elvis. I mean they just, I mean,

312
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,900
and I think it comes out every Wednesday.

313
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,280
So if you're not watching the NHL
rivalry fucking Wednesday, uh,

314
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,520
or even if you are just tape some of
these things, because you know, HBO,

315
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:30,030
they always do everything
fucking top shelf. It's going
to be amazing. So anyways,

316
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,100
I have some things to, uh, have
I made you guys laugh once yet?

317
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,130
I've just been fucking being an
idiot here talking about this shit,

318
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:42,840
but it's also, I just feel
like I'm doing is very me. Um,

319
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,270

B I l L Y B a l d for The win win.

333
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,850
Um, anyways, you know, it
was fucking hilarious. I,

334
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,700
I did the Brady theater in Tulsa.
I pull up and uh,

335
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:52,190
this is one dude standing outside,
you know,

336
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,710
the fucking, the stage door. All
right. And uh, I got to sing.

337
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,610
I hate meeting people before the show,
after the show, I don't give a fuck,

338
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,340
but before the show, I, I can't,
it's just, it's weird to me.

339
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,470
It's like I haven't done
my fucking thing that I do.

340
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,450
So, um, I'm thinking about
doing that. You know, I don't,

341
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,410
I, I I no problem after,
before it just weirds me out.

342
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:19,830
So I go to it and this guy
goes, he's like, yeah, hey bill,

343
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:22,340
a big fan of getting mega good gum.
I,

344
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I go to sign his fucking shit and all of
a sudden I feel like this sticky thing,

345
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,530
like I had like syrup
in my hand or something.

346
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,980
I handed back to Penn and I looked down
at my fucking hand is just co cop might

347
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:36,630
get the ink,
the pen exploded.

348
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,120
Okay.

349
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,010
Oh fuck.
I look like I don't know what I look like.

350
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,110
So I walk in and it's really like thick.

351
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,953
Okay.

352
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,440
Like black or blue ink.

353
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:51,550
I went in the bathroom and I'm like trying
to scrub the skin off my fucking hand.

354
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,430
Yeah.

355
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,970
And um, you know, del Ray's laughing
at me and shit, look at literally shit.

356
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,890
You know, my hands are so pasty, so I got
this, it's like my cancer in black face,

357
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:02,520
right.

358
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,510
So I'm fucking scrubbing the shit off
and I was able to get most of it off,

359
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:11,400
but there's still like, you know,
you can see the stain of it. MMM.

360
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,960
I wish I talked about that
when I went out on stage. Um,

361
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,490
but I did.
So I went out and I did the show.

362
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,610
And as I go to walk off the stage,

363
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:26,820
who comes walking down to the front of
the stage, hey bill, but blah, blah, blah,

364
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,120
blah. I already met here.
I already signed you shit.

365
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,640
And I already got the egg all over
my hair, but he's getting married.

366
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:35,890
So going over Shay, man,
thank you. I go, you know,

367
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,040
good luck with your
marriage and everything.

368
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,550
Okay.

369
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,430
So that I fucking walk out.
Right.

370
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,690
Okay.

371
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,060
Just talking to Dana. I'm like, Dude,
how fucking unbelievable is that theater?

372
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:49,830
You'd say, Oh, you know, the
sound is unbelievable crab
about blah. You know, Dean,

373
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:54,750
that show was fire,
right? So we go outside

374
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,350
and uh, we go to leave the places
like 10 or 15 people there, right?

375
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,920
So I'm fucking day guys, thanks for
coming out, talk to people, you know,

376
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,030
signing shit or whatever and this fucking
guy comes up again and he wants me to

377
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:08,830
sign more shit.
And I'm thinking in my head,

378
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,470
it's just like this flickers guy coming
back from fucking second. So mean,

379
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,660
why did you, you know,
there's other people here.

380
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,460
We already did this and I shook your hand.

381
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,540
So I got to sign something fucking else.
Study has and I feel this sticky thing.

382
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,350
He gave me the same fucking 10 again
and I was so stupid that I went and I

383
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,300
grabbed the thing and I just like that.
Yeah, you fucking asshole. You Go,

384
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:30,640
you've got an exploded pen here.
And then he just starts laughing.

385
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,160
Yeah.

386
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,150
And now I got to shit on my fucking
hand, my hands, all the exact same,

387
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:38,160
almost exact same fingers and all that.

388
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:42,810
Obviously I'm not ambidextrous switching
my hands and I'm just like in Dean's

389
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:45,300
fucking ned deed signed something,
forms we bowls,

390
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:46,800
walked back into the fucking car,

391
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,010
we got ink all over our hands and the
drivers laughing his ass off at us because

392
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,190
he saw me when I went in and go that
fucking asshole. It exploded pen.

393
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,460
So as this is the thing,
as I go to get in the car,

394
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,110
this same dude who I already signed,
his shit, got ink on my hand,

395
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,730
shook his head after the fucking
show. You know, as a walking offstage,

396
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,700
shook his hand, sign more, shit, got
more fucking exploded in my hand.

397
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,800
Even when goes, he goes, hey bill,

398
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,820
did you go to a Po address that I could
send these six to these pictures I took

399
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:21,810
on his cell phone. I just
go, now you fucking asshole.

400
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,480
I got a call over my hand again.
And he just starts laughing.

401
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,050
Then they felt bad and go,
good luck with your marriage.

402
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,520
Yeah,

403
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:29,951
we get in,

404
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:34,120
the cars would drive it away and I just
was just riffed about the poor woman

405
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:36,820
that is going to marry that fucking guy,
you know?

406
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,220
Cause it was something about them.
You couldn't get mad at him.

407
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,120
But I really think that that
exploding pen was a fucking omen,

408
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,920
you know, that he was just
going to be like, I dunno.

409
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,490
Jesus Christ. So anyways, I um,

410
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,710
let me read a little bit of advertising
and then I'll tell you about San Antonio

411
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:02,770
going down there with the final
four experience going on. Um,

412
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,990
where the hell is it? What do we got
here? What do we got this week? Oh,

413
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,500
it don't cheat.
Oh,

414
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,390
talk about how a made to measure suit
fits compared to a generic off the rack

415
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:18,970
suit. Well, unless you're like
a generic off the rack size,

416
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,440
I imagine your ankles are going to be
showing and your balls are going to be

417
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,540
snugged or uh,
you know,

418
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:28,240
you're going to be looking like you have
your big brother's pants on if you're a

419
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,074
little shorty.

420
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,100
Yeah,

421
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,870
I mean obviously do I really need to
explain to people that if they actually

422
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,080
take your fucking measurements, I
mean, if they take your measurements,

423
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,040
it's going to fit

424
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,600
okay

425
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,150
the way it's supposed to fit it on.

426
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,990
All of a sudden women are going

quality fabrics and the option to

your jacket off and you fucking put it

sit down and just watch regular
people talk shit and go in the ring.

467
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:11,680

I Dunno.

468
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,870
Every once in a while I, I know I keep
saying this, but you know, I'm so site,

469
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm gonna have a ringside seats that we
sit and rig side for the whole fucking

470
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:22,230
thing. That'll be another
added thing cause I don't know,

471
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,280
I don't know how to commentate.
I'm not Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan is,

472
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:30,960

Yeah.

473
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,210
Okay.

474
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,980
With his abilities and his understanding
of combat. Me On the other hand,

475
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,190
[inaudible] just going to sound
like I was just some loud shithead.

476
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,270
Sit next to you on your couch. Okay.
That's what I'm gonna do. Alright.

477
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,240
MVMT movement.
Uh,

478
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,450
here's my problem with
sunglasses. I didn't know I
had a problem with sunglasses.

479
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,980
Why are you putting words in my mouth?

480
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,170
I got all these cheap pairs that look
terrible. No, I don't. I am nice pairs.

481
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,200
Okay.

482
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,400
But every time I buy 200, $200
pair, I feel like I get ripped off.

483
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:08,170
That's not what I feel. Here's
my problem with sunglasses, okay?

484
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:11,080
If you buy a fucking cheap pair,
they don't do anything.

485
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,610
You still squinting behind them.

486
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,220
Now your face is all mushed
up wearing sunglasses.

487
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,730
You look like a fucking asshole and
they're digging into the right above your

488
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:22,150
ear on your scalp.
But then if you buy a nice expensive pair,

489
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,700
then you got to sit there going like,
oh my God. Oh my God, what if I,

490
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,780
what if I lose it? What if I sit on, I'm
in. And inevitably that fucking habits.

491
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,920
Okay, movement. That's what I
feel about fucking sunglasses.

492
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,750
How dare you put words in my mouth.

493
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,610
Okay.

494
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,940
And I don't feel like I got ripped off.

495
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:41,750
If I pay $200 I feel like a fucking
asshole when I lose them. All right,

496
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,040
well our friends at movement.
Yeah,

497
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,580
the watch guys, they kind
of felt the same way. Oh,

498
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,370
I didn't know if they agreed with
me. So they, they thought screw it.

499
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,510
I think they thought fuck it.

500
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,350
How about we make quality
trendy glasses at a fair price?

501
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,880
These things aren't plastic.

502
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,020
They acetate.

503
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,210
You can get them polarized.
Is that a word?

504
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,050
As [inaudible] tape?
I gotta add that word.

505
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:14,410
I'm going to fuck it.
I'm a S. I would have,

506
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,010
it's a goal of mine today to
throw that word in with my wife.

507
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,310
Okay.

508
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,290
See what the fuck.
What the fuck does that mean?

509
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,550
Okay.

510
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,420
Do, do you ever go look up a
fucking word on Wikipedia? What?

511
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:31,850
What is that writing when you're
trying to figure out how to spell it.

512
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:34,580
It looks like it's in Russian.

513
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,410
Yeah.

514
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,830
Is it is a salt form by a combination of

515
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,970
Seti acidic acid with an alkaline,
earthy,

516
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,960
metallic base of, fuck this. I don't give
it. I don't need to know what it means.

517
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:53,570
I just know how to say it.
Nobody knows.

518
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,560
Nobody knows what this fucking word means.
You just say it and people like, wow,

519
00:30:57,561 --> 00:31:01,010
that guy's guy's smart. Look at that.
Look at his custom lining on a suit.

520
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,330
All right, here we go. Ready
everybody. This is thing. Okay.

521
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:06,650
If you're a supported this podcast,

522
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:10,550
you have to work this word
into your day with somebody.

523
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:13,160
Who would you that you know very well?

524
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,970
Who's going to know that you have no idea
what this fucking word means and your

525
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,950
goal is to try and fucking play it off.

526
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,110
Like you've always had
this in your arsenal,

527
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,890
like this was part of your fucking
pitching rotation. Here we go.

528
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,710
Come on,
say it.

529
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,950

530
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,193

You're fucking

This is like,

535
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:51,700
it's the end of the world and that's
like some morning and the future.

536
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,530
You know.
Everybody get the fuck out of here.

537
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,550
You're correct.

538
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,840
I think we just lost Mike.
All right. Sorry about that.

539
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,440
Uh, that was my, my version of like alien.

540
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,930
All you need in the background

541
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,900
Oh God.
Oh God.

542

What's going on here?
Acetate affects oil.

543
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:23,360

544
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,340
when they have music that makes
you not think that's an a ship.

I want to talk about? Oh,

671
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:08,790
another thing with that Gary Shandling
think that that documentary really

672
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,010
affected me was,
you know,

673
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:15,300
one of the things that happens
to a lot of comedians is, uh,

674
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,830
whatever the fuck happened to us
that made us become comedians. Uh,

675
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,470
you just start chasing,
you know,

676
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,700
selling out clubs and get known
and becoming famous and all that,

677
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,490
and thinking that that's going to fucking,
you know,

678
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:35,100
get rid of your demons
and, uh, it doesn't.

679
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:38,310
And then you put off
the major party of life,

680
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:43,300
which is finding love and starting
a family and all of that shit.

681
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,820
And, um, you know,

682
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:50,650
the other day I was talking to somebody
and they were in their early thirties,

683
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and I brought up the Garry Shandling
documentary and the person said,

684
00:40:57,101 --> 00:41:01,960
who's that? Right? And
then I also mentioned like,

685
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:06,370
uh, somehow I brought up Robin Williams
and I mentioned that he had, you know,

686
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,020
committed suicide a few years in and
she didn't even realize he was dead.

687
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,150
And she was just like, Mrs Doubtfire.
And I was like, in my head,

688
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,390
I'm just going to, these
people are fucking legends.
And it's just like, you know,

689
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,500
every generation has their people,
you know what I mean? So it's like,

690
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,500
it was like so fucking profound.
What's like,

691
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:31,730
you chasing all of that fucking
shit. And you know, once you,

692
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,540
once you're past a certain nick, no one's
going to give a shit anymore anyways.

693
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,530
So it's like you're trying to,
I dunno,

694
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,270
it's not like a tangible
thing that you can depend on.

695
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,700
And I had this big fear when I was
going through comedy that I was like,

696
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,360
uh, I was like, Oh man,

697
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,690
am I gonna be the guy that doesn't
get married and never has kids?

698
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,360
Because I've seen the other side of that
as like, I don't want to fucking, yeah,

699
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,580
I don't want to end up being that cliche.
And then just being in that fucking,

700
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,580
that older fucking comic,
you know,

701
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:08,610
and then you got you sport coat on to
hide your middle and you're talking to,

702
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,800
if you're talking at this point,

703
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:15,801
you're hitting on women that don't know
who your bands are and don't know all,

704
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:18,540
all,
all your cultural references.

705
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,920
They don't even know who these fucking
people are and the level of fucking

706
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:26,730
sadness that the, how lonely that feeling
would be at. I used to fucking wake up,

707
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,600
I didn't literally wake up,

708
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:32,400
but I would be laying in bed on the
road thinking about shit like that.

709
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:36,300
And when I was watching this
documentary, I remember, you know,

710
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,670
thinking, uh, as I was watching
Gary wrestling with his demons,

711
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,610
I literally said to Nia one point, I
was like, marrying you and having a kid.

712
00:42:45,611 --> 00:42:49,420
He's the smartest fucking thing I ever
did. Thank God. I know I did it late,

713
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:53,260
but thank God I fucking did that
because if I didn't, you know,

714
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:58,261
I'd be 70 years old in some fucking God
damn hotel on the other side of this

715
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:00,340
shit when nobody gave a fuck.

716
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:04,360
And I would just be laying there
drinking myself to death going Acetate,

717
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,663
acetate.

718
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,750
That literally makes me scared
just saying that acetate. Um,

719
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,530
anyways, so, uh, I think what
I'm gonna do, cause I don't
think I'm a diary person,

720
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:19,941
but I think,

721
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:23,500
but I'm going to do is I'm just going to
kind of write down in the beginning of

722
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,260
the day, just I find it
just one day of doing that.

723
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,120
It's really vivid and lives now rather
than just being this fucking random

724
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:33,740
thought. Like, you know,
I need to work on this.

725
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,780
Maybe just have a fucking
goal each day. So my kid, uh,

726
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:43,810
I can kind of kill off this fucking anger
demon that exists in my family tree.

727
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,450
I would love to see my family tree.
It's got to look like a,

728
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,980
that'd be this weird combination
of like, oh, that's really nice,

729
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:56,570
but a little upsetting.
You know,

730
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,160
like a tree in the beginning of winter,
um,

731
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,750
at a certain time of
day, you know, you know,

732
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:08,480
that certain time of day
would trees are beautiful,

733
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,990
but they start to look a little ominous.
That's probably what it would look like.

734
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:17,030
Uh, a tree that's trying.
All right. Let's, uh,

735
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,331
oh,

736
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:22,331
I didn't tell you guys about my
fucking journey back from San Antonio.

737
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,170
So, uh, I had a 6:00 AM flight
to Tulsa, Oklahoma. You know,

738
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,840
I normally I would have flown in the
night before, but I got the kid, you know,

739
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,530
I can't, can't miss those
hours. So I flew in, no problem.

740
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:35,370
Everything was great.

741
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,140
The next day I had an 8:00 AM flight to
San Antonio for whatever fucking reason.

742
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,320
I mean, it's not that long a flight.
We're in the same time zone. Wow.

743
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,310
How come I couldn't get like
the 10 o'clock flight? Right?

744
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,420
So we check into the hotel, we
do the show, everything's great.

745
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:54,810
And then the next morning I had a 6:00
AM flight and I got off stage of 12 and

746
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:59,790
couldn't get to sleep till like
one 32 in the morning. So, uh,

747
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,470
it was just like, all right,
I'll just sleep on the plane.

748
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,140
So we get up at like four
30 in the fucking morning,

749
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:06,510
quarter to five go down there.

750
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,810
And my big thing is when I
only get like two hours sleep,

751
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:14,250
all I'm trying to do is get on the plane
and once I get on the fucking plane

752
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:16,350
it's like I'm just going to go to sleep.
You know,

753
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,120
I forgot my eye mask and one can't always
has to have their fucking shade up,

754
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,990
you know, cause they're a morning
person and fuck everybody else.

755
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:28,680
You know no consideration for somebody
who just fucking stop working at,

756
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:32,880
you know, 12 1230 right. So we get there

757
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,200
and I'm laughing at dean cause
we are like so fucking tired.

758
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,420
It's like you literally like
you're hung over or like food.

759
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:41,790
All I gotta do is get on
that plane and he's like,

760
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:45,750
I know I'm going to go right to sleep
and then I'm going to land at seven 30 la

761
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,440
time. Right. By the time I get to my
fucking house, it's going to be eight 30.

762
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:51,040
My daughter just got up a half hour early.

763
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,360
I'm going to get that whole time with
her before she does her first nap.

764
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,490
Fucking perfect. Um, and all
of a sudden they're like, uh,

765
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,810
the flights now going to fucking
leave at six 15. You know,

766
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:05,910
cause they said they had
to reset the airplane,

767
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,750
which I don't know what the fuck that
means. Is that some computer shit?

768
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:14,160
I have no idea. And then six 15
became six 45 and I was like, Oh God,

769
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:16,290
don't do this.
Please don't do this.

770
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,610
And then it became seven 45 and
then it got fucking canceled.

771
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,020
And then because it was the final four,
all the fucking planes was sold out.

772
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,480
And the next one they
could get us on was 7:00 PM

773
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,270
and I was like trying to keep my cool,
which of course I didn't.

774
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,640
And they said, sir, it's okay.

775
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,070
We're going to send everybody
on the seven o'clock flight.

776
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:42,690
We're going to send on an excursion
today, paid by Delta. I'm like,

777
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,010
I don't want to go on an excursion. I
want to go to Los Angeles. And she goes,

778
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,900
they're going to take you to world.
It's like, Oh yeah, I think in it.

779
00:46:50,901 --> 00:46:53,790
Buy me a giant fucking lollipop.
I don't want to fucking,

780
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,710
I don't want to watch an incarcerated
killer whale doing fucking jumping through

781
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:01,830
a hula hoop. Okay. I don't want to see
that. What I would like, can I go there?

782
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,230
And once you set that
fucking thing free again,

783
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,290
I would see that that would be worth it.
You know,

784
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,160
watch a jump over a little boy is it goes
out out of the bay into a fucking the

785
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,190
ocean like free willy.
Um,

786
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,670
so anyways, so we say Fuck Delta, not
fucked delta. Literally fucked Delta,

787
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,080
but fuck this situation delta put us in.
Cause I know all the airlines this,

788
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:29,480
it's just a, hey, it happens. Okay. The
fucking planes not working right. I it,

789
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,270
but I'm also frustrated. So I go down to
southwest, all of this shit is filled up.

790
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,020
Um, so we're like, what about Dallas?

791
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,980
Can you fly us to Dallas love field
and we'll just fly back. Can't do that.

792
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,290
Um, and then we just say, what about
Austin? And they go, okay, well Austin,

793
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:49,540
we have a 10:00 AM flight at
this point. It's like, you know,

794
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:54,450
getting close to nine. We have an 11 and
we have a two 15. So I'm like, all right,

795
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,200
put us on the fucking two 15 and you know,
it's an hour and a half drive.

796
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,590
So Dean goes to get a fucking
rental car. And I said, fuck this,

797
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:05,710
let's just Uber then we don't have to
deal with picking up the rental car,

798
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:08,170
the shuttle and all that.
So we did fucking ubered.

799
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,890
I passed out in the fucking car,
I got out of the car,

800
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,920
I left my fucking headphones in that,
this is my third time.

801
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,660
Second Time I've lost those
Bose headphones. Um, I always
keep the charge of the,

802
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:24,640
if anybody has a set of
those silver fucking bows or
the black ones and you need

803
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:29,020
that little charger cord, uh, send me
your address and I'll mail it to you.

804
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:34,630
Um, cause I'm going to have three of them
is I just ordered another fucking pair.

805
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,360
So anyways,
uh,

806
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:41,290
we get out and we got there so fucking
fast cause there was no traffic.

807
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:44,710
We actually got on the 1115 had to
connect through fucking Phoenix.

808
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:49,000
It wasn't that bad and uh,
it all worked out. And uh,

809
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:53,020
and because I had written down that Shit,
you know,

810
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:56,200
that I want it to like maybe talk to
somebody about my temper or something like

811
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:58,000
that.
Um,

812
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,090
I was actually completely aware that I
was fucking snapping when I snapped like

813
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:08,350
that. That's as far as I've ever been
able to get to with my temper. You know,

814
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,510
the old new,
I would just snap and not think about it.

815
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:13,720
Now I'm actually thinking about it as
I do it and have no control over it.

816
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,720
So it's even more like torturous now
because now like watching myself, ah,

817
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,950
you go bill yelling at people that like
build, they're trying to save your life.

818
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,630
Do you think they're not flying because
they want to go through this giant

819
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:34,120
fucking headache?
On some level,

820
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:37,570
they're probably losing money because
one of their planes cannot fly.

821
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,950
Would you like to get up to a cruising
altitude and then plunge back to the

822
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:45,490
fucking earth and never
see your family again? Oh,

823
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:50,400
Boohoo you have to wait 12
hours to continue living.
He was selfish, stupid cunt.

824
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,120
Um,
but I can't hear anything at that point.

825
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,470
I'm in the fucking acetate mode.
Um, are, I'm killing that joke. Uh,

826
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,030
by the way, um, I am so
back into def Leppard now.

827
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:08,650
It's ridiculous. I downloaded pyromania
and uh, what was it? High and dry,

828
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:12,730
the one before that. And
uh, I'm so into them.

829
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,850
I'm actually looking at
lefthanded flying V's, you know,

830
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:19,510
like maybe this is the guitar. I'll know
how to fucking, I'll actually stick with,

831
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,400
um, cause I was just watching their
lineup. But what's that guy's name?

832
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,860
Pete Willis is the guy that the
head on the, on the high and dry.

833
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,300
And then they had, um, what's
his face filled in for him? Uh,

834
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,330
I always forget his fucking name and
it's literally the same name as somebody

835
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:39,950
else. Famous. It's Phil
Collins, not Phil Collins.

836
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,390
He came in and filled in form.
Um, but like that, that album,

837
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,510
uh,
pyromania when that came out,

838
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:52,130
that's just one of those albums that came
out during this awesome time and your

839
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,350
life.
Um,

840
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,730
first time he had crushes on
fucking chickson you're graded shit.

841
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:03,410
And that fucking album came
out, you know, and I did the,

842
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,980
and this is what I would do rather than
thinking, what can I say to this chicken,

843
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,980
my fucking class that I like this lady,

844
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,410
I would actually just,

845
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:16,400
I would just go home instead and I would
listen to Pyromania fantasizing that I

846
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:20,270
was in the band playing the guitar
and singing in front of the school.

847
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:21,850
And even in the fantasies,

848
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:24,440
she would just see me do it and
I would still never talk to her.

849
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,130
I'm a fucking mess. Um, and that's what
leads you. Then they'd just say, well,

850
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,750
I can't sing and I can't play guitar.

851
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,730
I guess I'll go up there and
tell shit jokes. I guess.

852
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:37,760
Thank day time I became a comedian.
All right. Rough and rowdy.

853
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,490
Charlotte April 13th.

854
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,830
Billy's going to wear a fucking silly
suit and he's going to fucking make some

855
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:47,360
jokes. You got to watch it. Pay per
view. Uh, all right. F One dear.

856
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:50,070
Silly Billy. Greetings from Monaco. Oh,

857
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:55,071
the sovereign state on the French
Riviera originally from Portugal.

858
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,150
I'm a very big f one fan since
I was four years old. Well,

859
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:00,740
it seems like you saw the hay day of it,

860
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:04,370
the second golden age of it
with Michael Schumacher. Uh,

861
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,780
my grandfather says I wouldn't take my
eyes off the cars even if a storm took

862
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:09,920
the roof off the house.

863
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,840
It's a beautiful and graceful
sport despite how loud it can be.

864
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,130
I first saw you from Chappelle and then
saw you on an interview on the Internet

865
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:23,870
from Montreal. Let my brother showed
me because he's a huge fan of yours.

866
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,030
I now am two. Oh, that's great. Thank you.

867
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,320
I think this is a very
important time in F1.

868
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,570
This sport is going to continue to move
into the mainstream because the stars in

869
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:36,170
the sports and the storylines
of competition are starting
to match the popular

870
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:40,710
culture of today. Oh, that's very, uh, uh,

871
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,230
what's the word?
All I can think of is acetate.

872
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,870
That's a very astute analization.
Is that the word?

873
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:50,510
I know it can be very Shakespearian.

874
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,450
I appreciate you talking about
the drivers with respect.

875
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:57,560
Even if you're not a fan of
everything they do is incredible.

876
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:01,720
How talented these men are in.
Some women are able to navigate it.

877
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,300
Some women are able to navigate
with precision. That's hilarious.

878
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,750
Um,
little chauvinism there.

879
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,550
I would like very much to see you at more
racist and perhaps talking to drivers

880
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:16,910
and Cruz. Thank you. And bless
your family. Yo, you and me both.

881
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,590
Oh look who's here.

882
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,930
A lovely Nia and my lovely daughter.
You know what?

883
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:25,790
She has the cutest on today.

884
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:29,300
She has all these gray sweatpants
and pants with this matching Hoodie,

885
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:33,380
that short sleeve. It looks like
you got a little Bella check. Hi,

886
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,000
how are you? How was
your breakfast? You know,

887
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:43,690
see you rant and rave and scream and
yell and your podcast for Damn near 15

888
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:47,240
years. And you know, I never say anything.

889
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,020
And then I'm having breakfast with our
lovely daughter and we're laughing and

890
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:52,490
we're joking or singing songs.

891
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:57,491
And you have the nerve to come in and
tell us to keep it down a cup of cheese.

892
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,330
I know. No, I'm just, uh, yeah,

893
00:54:02,331 --> 00:54:06,800
but this is also putting a roof
over our head. What's up buddy?

894
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,450
How you doing? We can have fun today. Huh?

895
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,420
The itsy bitsy spider.

896
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:19,060
What went off the wall is about game.
Was

897
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:26,030
okay in the sun and dried
up all the way and you get,

898
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:29,360
see bitsy spider went up this bout again.

899
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:34,700
Yay.
Aww.

900
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:39,080
Look at that smile. All right. You want
to read some of these with mania? Sure.

901
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,980
Okay. What do we got here? Um, I, yeah,

902
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:44,890
I absolutely would love
to talk to the driver.

903
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:47,870
This guy say saying he's from Portugal,
he now lives in Monaco.

904
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,590
How much is this guy
crushing it? Oh, and this is,

905
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,290
listen to what he says about
female drivers near let's say this.

906
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,010
He says it's incredible how talent these,

907
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,050
these men are and some women are
able to navigate with position.

908
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,050
Oh, thanks. Thanks for that.
Some women are, what, what,

909
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,230
where's he going with us?

910
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,620
He was just saying that he would love
to see me talking to more drivers and

911
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:13,970
being at more, more racist. Oh,
well I know you would like that.

912
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:15,283
I would love that.

913
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,480
And I think if I could navigate with
precision down to the pit area and if you

914
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:23,510
don't trip and fall because
you're a woman, right?

915
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:29,660
Yeah. Yes. I'm a chauvinist
pig and I attract these people.

916
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,440
They need a pot chauvinists needs
podcast too. All right, let's,

917
00:55:33,441 --> 00:55:38,210
let's talk about 45 she liked records,
right? Huh? Yes I do. Hey Sweetie,

918
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:41,890
you want to talk about 40 fives
huh?

919
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,473
Okay.

920
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,140
You're gonna tell us the story.
What's so crazy right now?

921
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,250
She totally has obviously has all these
thoughts and she knows what she's saying,

922
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:57,990
but she doesn't understand that we don't
talk her jibberish so she'll just be

923
00:55:57,991 --> 00:55:59,880
sitting there making all
these hand movements,

924
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:03,730
like she's making these profound
points and she's going, I shake shack

925
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,510
and she's still making,

926
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,660
was she still into that noise that
she can check crap that she was doing?

927
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:16,740
She's really trying to say words
now. Okay. Can you say baby babies?

928
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,613
A baby?

929
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:26,300
Oh, there you go. She said so
you liked that frog and it break.

930
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:31,170
But they do number Michigan. All
right. 40 fives. A Billy burr hole.

931
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,320
A long time fan of the podcast.
Well thank you.

932
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:39,150
I traveled a lot in your Massachusetts
vibes. Always remind me of home. Uh,

933
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,680
recently. Don't touch that. Don't touch
that. Don't touch that. Um, recently.

934
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,430
Um, it's so funny. They
always go for like,

935
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:50,550
the thing that's going to hurt them
the most is all this stuff here. Shoes,

936
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:53,490
chairs and all that. Goes
right for the hot tea. Uh,

937
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:57,900
recently my fiance and I surrendered
our weekend nights to playing card games

938
00:56:57,901 --> 00:57:02,330
alongside tasty beers at home.
I should just playing 45.

939
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,880
That sounds like fun. Yeah, we
were just saying how we hate those.

940
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,930
Like you go to those parties with
other adults and they have game night,

941
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,250
so he's fucking cards against
humanity and all of that stuff.

942
00:57:14,251 --> 00:57:18,420
I don't want to do that. Um, but we've
got to get to bring back cards. Right.

943
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,650
But isn't that a game? That's a
game night. If you play cards you,

944
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,520
but cards are cool.
It's not like playing mad libs.

945
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,010
I like cards against humanity though.

946
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,380
I feel like if you get kind of high or
a little bit drunk, Adolf Hitler's Tate

947
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:43,540
good jokes and cards against humanity
are as bad is when you fly southwest.

948
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,580
I hate to make fun of them
cause I loved that airline.

949
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:49,070
But listening to those people do comedy,
I just can't,

950
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,980
I get angry at the people encouraging
them through. This guy was Sydney,

951
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:56,360
we were going down the uh,
you know,

952
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:58,040
we're going down the runway like what?

953
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,190
Go on the tarmac or whatever and
he's doing the Darth Vader voice.

954
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,440
Everybody put on your feet belt.

955
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:09,271
No,

956
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:12,750
it just annoys me that that person doesn't
get heckled cause it's just like if I,

957
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:14,340
if I did a joke like that,

958
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,940
people would be throwing their chair at
me and this guy's getting laughs because

959
00:58:20,341 --> 00:58:23,930
I feel like maybe people feel
obligated because it's the,

960
00:58:23,931 --> 00:58:27,630
the flight crew and you want to be on
their good side. It's exactly what it is.

961
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,110
It's the awkward silence
and people are just in,

962
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:36,350
in the silence of the joke bombing
people then laugh because they feel

963
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:40,710
uncomfortable because this is overall
nervousness that what we're about to do

964
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:45,540
could kill us. Right. So then the
level of comedy that they have to do,

965
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,880
you know what I mean? When you're
scared, you'll laugh at anything.

966
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:51,390
You just walk in like the rain's
really coming down, isn't it?

967
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,150
It's like you didn't say
anything funny there.

968
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,480
Wow. That was close. Nervous
laughter. There we go. Uh,

969
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:08,460
I suggest playing 45, which I
know Nia. Are you kidding me? No,

970
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,840
that'd be cool. We got it. We got,
we got to get a cool stereo man.

971
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,450
Well, yeah. You know what?

972
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:20,340
We should have our own kind of like
night, you know, and music and you and me.

973
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,720
Why don't we do, yeah,
let's sing some songs.

974
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,370
Hug and kiss a little bit
where the little ones down.

975
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:31,070
Why don't we do that instead
of sitting there going, yeah,

976
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,590
I liked it. Yes. Could
have said that. Cars again.

977
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,220
Hairy asshole. Ooh. Ooh.

978
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,350
I think southwest writes those
punch lines on those stupid cards.

979
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,291
I just don't like that.

980
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:51,880
You don't write the punchline and
then you get credit for it. I'm sorry,

981
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,860
I'm too, until when did they jump too far
deep into the joke? Gay Man. Yeah, right.

982
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,890
I don't know. Anyways, we could
hardly find any rule. Okay.

983
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,470
I suggest playing 40 fives which I can,

984
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:06,010
which I had always played
growing up on the north shore,

985
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,300
uh,
in trying to find the rules online.

986
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:15,280
I was surprised to learn that it's pretty
endemic to Massachusetts. What rules?

987
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:19,750
What are we talking about? Oh, we
thought he met at 45 as an records.

988
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,230
What is fives? It's obviously some
kind of game that we don't know about.

989
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
We thought you were talking about right?

990
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,800
They don't know about 45 it's like you
don't know what acetate means. I guess so.

991
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,960
Yeah. We can hardly friend.
Can you do me a favor?

992
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,961
Can you say acetate three times in a row
with a pause and just no life in your

993
01:00:37,661 --> 01:00:41,650
voice between each one? Just pause. Just
say acetate three times in a row. Okay.

994
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:45,470
Acetate. Acetate. Slower

995
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,850
acetate. No, I meant longer.
Pause. That was pretty good. Okay.

996
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:55,760
We'll definitely call you back for
the audition. So what was his thing?

997
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,180
We can hardly find the rules anywhere.
In any case,

998
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:01,480
just curious whether you ever played
this game growing up or had any other

999
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:04,150
traditions you found to be a
Massachusetts thing once she left.

1000
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:08,770
Thanks and hope you can come to Vermont
or Montreal sometime soon. Okay.

1001
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,650
Yes and yes. Oh, I'm so old. I
thought you said buy records.

1002
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,971
That's what I thought it was.

1003
01:01:12,971 --> 01:01:15,460
Because somebody gave me some records
in Tulsa and then they aren't.

1004
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:20,390
One of them was a 45. Um, so many I have
to get the adapter. Yeah, I don't know it.

1005
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:24,910
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.
No, you just, when you're just,

1006
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:27,400
you just want to spill
that, don't you? All right.

1007
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,290
40 45 game.

1008
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:35,160
Yeah. Senior game. Hold on a second. Yeah.

1009
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,010
40 fives game 45 it's a card game.
Yeah,

1010
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,030
that's what I figured.
All right.

1011
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,270
Why is my Internet's so slow?
All right.

1012
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,730
The Ace of heart is
always the best third box.

1013
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:54,300
I was playing with a regular deck
of cards. This isn't like old maid.

1014
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,160
You guys remember old maid,
you know,

1015
01:01:57,161 --> 01:02:00,640
and then the classic that I never
played granny fucking water.

1016
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:04,480
There's another Cape, there's
another card game. Nia did.

1017
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:07,210
Everybody in the Midwest knows about,
uh,

1018
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,910
euchre and that game would Joe Barton,

1019
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:15,070
Nick and j law had talked about card.
They were like freaking out.

1020
01:02:15,071 --> 01:02:19,000
They were just going like entire families
had stopped talking to each other on

1021
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:23,270
Christmas because of that game. That
game is evil. That's like a Pittsburgh,

1022
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:27,500
Cleveland, Detroit, that type of
area. I think people play euchre.

1023
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,430
The ace of hearts is always the third
best. Trump. Yeah. Week. This is good.

1024
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:34,160
This is good. Clean Fun here. The deal,

1025
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,980
robbing the Trump object of the game.

1026
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,040
The goal is to accumulate the
most chips by winning tricks.

1027
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,770
How to keep score irregularities to do
this. This is, this is a game night bill,

1028
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,410
so I don't know why you're talking
about you're so against the game night.

1029
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:52,250
This is what, because I don't like, you
know what? I don't like the modern games.

1030
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,300
I'll play cards.

1031
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:57,170
My grandmother was a Bozo and
amazing and my aunt against humanity.

1032
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,790
Do you ever play flinch? No flinches
another one. Uh, I, maybe we can. What?

1033
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,290
You're going to get all these card games.

1034
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,120
Have you ever played spades as a
black people play? Uh, oh, look at me.

1035
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,510
Do you have a play hearts?
That's what white people play.

1036
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,193
No.

1037
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,660
Oh, we got, we got to get some
cards now. We got to get some cars.

1038
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,710
We explore each other's like
heritage through card games. Yeah.

1039
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:29,590
You teach me spades.
I got to remember how to play hard.

1040
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,880
I don't know how to play spades.
I've maybe played it.

1041
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,770
I knew black people's
like Domino's. Well, no,

1042
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,800
we're not talking about Domino's.
We're talking about a card game.

1043
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,410
I know we're not talking about Domino's.
Why could you just give me that?

1044
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:44,180
That I actually knew something that
was like the Chappelle show sketch.

1045
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:49,200
I know black people. Dominoes
is, come on. I just said,

1046
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,840
okay. Jesus. Fuck. Okay.
Sorry. She's so protective.

1047
01:03:52,841 --> 01:03:57,550
She's so protective of her culture.
You know that Nia market this little,

1048
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,430
oh, you kissing the baby. Oh yeah.

1049
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,740
Why are you so protective? We just
want to start an argument. You know,

1050
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,460
why are you so protective of your
culture? Well, you let me in.

1051
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,070
You've never taught me how to
taught me how to do let you in.

1052
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,630
As good as say, you never
taught me how to do the, uh,

1053
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,890
do you know Nia could do the whole
Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation Dance? No.

1054
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:24,750
Miss you much. Yeah.
Yeah. That's the thing.

1055
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:29,280
She'll just bust that out out
of fuck. Sorry. Out of nowhere.

1056
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,790
And she could really do it. You
know what I mean? It's not like me.

1057
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:35,580
I could do like the peewee Herman
dead, dead dead. A dead end.

1058
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,960
I think I'm all impressed.

1059
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,690
Okay.

1060
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,340
Oh Damn. All impressive. Right. China's
surveillance. Oh, Neil, you know,

1061
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:45,320
people are going to ask you
to fucking Instagram that.

1062
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,360
I know it's not going to
happen. No. Okay, I'm back.

1063
01:04:50,361 --> 01:04:54,800
Sorry. The, uh, the batteries just died
on this thing. Um, all right. We are,

1064
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,350
I think I'm well over an hour
here at this point. I have to be,

1065
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:02,060
I don't really know where I'm at at this
point. All right. Shyness. Surveillance,

1066
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:05,990
man. All right. If, if, uh,

1067
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,390
you want me to just do the rest of this
because it seems like she's getting

1068
01:05:08,391 --> 01:05:12,980
ready to, uh, run around here, so I don't,

1069
01:05:12,981 --> 01:05:15,330
I just don't know if that's going to
be annoying to people to hear go home.

1070
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:18,090
I but I. Dot. I love is I'm sitting
talking about all this stuff,

1071
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,530
the doorbell to them as it is. Yeah.
That's the one thing you got to remember.

1072
01:05:22,531 --> 01:05:27,420
Your kid is adorable to you. Everybody.
Everybody thinks the kids are adorable.

1073
01:05:27,421 --> 01:05:31,290
Then after awhile it's just
like, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Um,

1074
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:35,520
China's surveillance, dear
bill, Bunker Hill. I love it.

1075
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:38,850
I'm a software engineer. Makes sure she
doesn't shut her hands in the door there.

1076
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,020
Um, oh, down like a ton of bricks.

1077
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,750
It is amazing that they always
fall in there, but yeah.

1078
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,593
All right buddy.

1079
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:52,963
Okay.

1080
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,710
All right, Cutie Pie. I'll see
you in a few minutes. Bye Bye.

1081
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,990
Oh, all right. I'll see you lovely
ladies out there. All right.

1082
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:11,991
I'm a software engineer
and system integration
specialists at a prominent firm

1083
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:13,890
in a major city.

1084
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,480
I won't stay my political affiliation
because I know you hate that move as much

1085
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:19,980
as I do. Good. Let's get into it.

1086
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:24,180
I'm terrified that my children will
have little to no privacy in their adult

1087
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,330
lives.
Being in tech,

1088
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:30,870
I'm becoming aware of the capabilities
and advances in surveillance systems and

1089
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:33,120
as an ordinary human
being with the Internet,

1090
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,540
I've maintained an understanding that
our government under both parties have

1091
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:40,800
been constantly expanding
their surveillance reach
and continue to lie to us

1092
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:43,740
about what information is being
stored. Yeah, it's ridiculous.

1093
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:48,150
And all the major fucking news
organizations don't say anything about it.

1094
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:53,130
They don't do anything to protect us.
They just sit there fucking making money.

1095
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,280
Uh, China isn't very different. Uh,

1096
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,710
it's definitely more
aggressive and more intrusive.

1097
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,620
The biggest is what Snowden
was trying to warn us about.

1098
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:06,600
We all left that guy twisted on the vine
and everybody was afraid because they

1099
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:10,470
wrapped what this guy was doing and to
trying to beat Isis. So then it was like,

1100
01:07:10,471 --> 01:07:10,591
well,

1101
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:13,680
I can't say anything because then I don't
support the troops and then I'm going

1102
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:16,860
to get the Dixie chicks
fucking treatment. Um, that's,

1103
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:19,020
that's all that's all they're
fucking doing right now.

1104
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:22,830
That just destroying people individually.
Um,

1105
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,410
just snowed is a fucking
hero as far as I'm concerned.

1106
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:30,330
God Damn fucking lunatics. It's like how
much more do they need to know about?

1107
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:33,300
You just sat down at the airport,
you go through fucking security.

1108
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,580
Then it's like you don't
understand in that now go now,

1109
01:07:35,581 --> 01:07:39,540
go through Tsa gotta answer all this shit
and get fucking fingerprinted and now,

1110
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,550
now that line's clogged up.
So now the next one,

1111
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:44,670
people will fucking stick in
that goddamn retinas in there.

1112
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,833
It's unbelievable.

1113
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,600
All right.
Drop your pants and spread your butt.

1114
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:53,210
Cheeks is going to be the next one. Don't
get through the line fucking quicker.

1115
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,210
And people would do it because
there'll be more convenient. All right.

1116
01:07:56,211 --> 01:08:00,740
The biggest differences that they have
the decency to not try and hide it or

1117
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:03,530
maybe you think it's better to
be lied to? I don't know. Well,

1118
01:08:03,531 --> 01:08:07,190
I think it's because China could
just fucking, you know, I don't,

1119
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:09,020
as far as I know in mainland China,

1120
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:13,280
you're the level of rights that you
have versus what you have over here.

1121
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:17,240
I think over here you have to lie because
they don't have the right to do what

1122
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,710
they're doing. Probably, I dunno,

1123
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:23,740
this article lays out the way in which
our government surveillance is going to

1124
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:27,020
be able to access everything
in a Chinese citizens life,

1125
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,250
both at work and at home,
um,

1126
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,630
in which government and our government,

1127
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:37,070
one of the most important advancements
being made is not just the collection of

1128
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,540
data,
but the sorting

1129
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,510
or of data and the ability to sift
through billions of communications for

1130
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:45,680
specific content.

1131
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,920
This is why the FBI and CIA have had
information on terrorist activity,

1132
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,610
but had no way to access it if
through all the bullshit. Yeah.

1133
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:58,670
So the thing is, so what people will
say, well, as well as least as Lou,

1134
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,660
as long as I'm not out there trashing
a, you know, saying I'm a Muslim,

1135
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,310
I won't have a problem, uh, back to my
kids more. I, because this is the thing,

1136
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:12,311
they're going to use that to then access
all this other shit as they always

1137
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:16,970
still as they always
do. Um, back to my kids.

1138
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,710
Most government technology eventually
makes it, makes its ways to the public.

1139
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:23,540
When my children are in their adult life,

1140
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:27,980
all of their previous years will be
stored somewhere to create a case against

1141
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:32,000
them based on the person that they
were and not who they've become.

1142
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,700
Jesus Christ.
That last statement,

1143
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:37,650
there might be most intelligent
thing anybody's ever sent in. Um,

1144
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:40,970
I will send you guys, um, this,

1145
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,710
this link to this story and read it and
it just be informed and know that you're

1146
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,210
going to be all right.
All right.

1147
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:50,270
Cause I don't want to send
all this doomsday shit
that's gonna make you go into

1148
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:52,250
a depression,
but you also do need to know.

1149
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:57,440
It would be nice if people knew what
was going on and uh, I think like, uh,

1150
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,820
this is a time where people,

1151
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,650
I just feel like everybody wants to
start speaking up like what are we doing?

1152
01:10:03,651 --> 01:10:07,430
And not in an anti USA fucking way,
but you know,

1153
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:10,460
at some point somebody has to
kind of step up here. You know,

1154
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:13,460
I think we kind of need to look at
the finances of how much is fucking

1155
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:17,650
non-ending war is costing us.
And uh,

1156
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:19,880
at some point we're going to
have to pay all of that back.

1157
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:25,160
$700 billion a fucking year.
I mean, I, I, we're really,

1158
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:30,161
we would really be a sad thing if 3,500
fucking jerk offs that train on a jungle

1159
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:34,280
gym were to bankrupt this great nation.
They made some point. We do have to,

1160
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,930
there has to be a way to discuss that
without somebody yelling at you saying you

1161
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:43,340
don't support the troops just to, you
know, cause maybe they haven't worked out.

1162
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,950
Maybe there was a solution.
It would be nice as a citizen

1163
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:52,370
who's paying ungodly taxes, who would like
to see them go to some shit over here,

1164
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:54,740
like pup making public schools good again.
You know,

1165
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,130
maybe get some people off the streets
that need some help. You know,

1166
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,530
baldies shutter island,
people fucking walking around.

1167
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,420
They used to have facilities
that they could go to.

1168
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,800
You combine that with the fact that they
can now go in and buy a bazooka and not

1169
01:11:09,801 --> 01:11:12,410
have to wait longer than three fucking
minutes and all of a sudden he started to

1170
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:13,280
have some problems.

1171
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:20,150
You fucking call me mother
fucker. Don't bring that up. Uh,

1172
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,250
why did I blame myself for
that? You know, that's not true.

1173
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,760
I should sound like I've got to get a
good, good, good corporation impression.

1174
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:32,110
You're clearly against the
United States of America. Um,

1175
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,870
wife believes in ghosts. Oh
Jesus, Dear Billy Burger basket.

1176
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,890
Uh, I love my wife dearly in on
most topics we are in agreement,

1177
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:44,850
but recently something has come between
us. She believes in ghosts and I do not.

1178
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,390
Oh Dude, fucking let it
go. Who gives a shit? Okay.

1179
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:51,900
As long as she's not trying to talk to
them and acting like Whoopi Goldberg and

1180
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:55,410
saying that they're entering her body.
But even then if she does that,

1181
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:59,040
to just dedicate one of your rooms to
that and just have her fucking make money

1182
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:03,900
off of other dopes that believe
what she's doing is real anyways.

1183
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:06,930
I'm not so bothered by her
belief. Sure. It's a bit Kooky,

1184
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:10,860
but she's free to do it and so it's not
hurting anyone. All right. There you go.

1185
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,310
The problem is, is that she's offended
that I don't believe in ghosts as well.

1186
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,970
Oh Gee, look at that. I gave you a
lecture and you were already fucking,

1187
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,570
you were already where I was
telling you to go. It's like, okay,

1188
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:26,550
you believe in ghosts. Good for
you. But I don't fine. Well,

1189
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,540
cross. Is there anything
worse than cold tea? Sorry.

1190
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:32,510
Just started confident how to
take a little swig there. Um,

1191
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,480
I stopped believing in
ghosts around the same time.

1192
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,270
I stopped believing in Santa Claus and
the Easter Bunny back when I was a kid.

1193
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,970
So when a full grown adult
tells me they see spirits,

1194
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,060
I can't help but wonder if there's
something wrong with them. Mentally.

1195
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:49,280
She is afraid to go to the restroom at
a certain restaurant in our town because

1196
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:53,180
it's a story about it being haunted.
She says the last time she went in there,

1197
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,740
she felt an Erie chill,

1198
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:58,820
but it's a draftee bathroom in a 90 year
old bill building for Christ's sake.

1199
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:03,830
She also has this old photograph she
took through a window at an abandoned

1200
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:08,540
mental hospital that she claimed
shows a ghost face. When I look at it,

1201
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,110
I only saw blurry bullshit.
I tried to be nice about it,

1202
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:16,070
but I think she felt like I was calling
her stupid or crazy when I didn't see it,

1203
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:20,150
when I didn't see it too.
I didn't want to lie about it besides,

1204
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,640
she would know if I was lying.
Anyways,

1205
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:25,130
I don't know how to approach
this topic without upsetting her.

1206
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,600
Do you have any advice
for me? Yours truly, um,

1207
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,730
this guy left his fucking name. I don't
know if this is a reference to somebody,

1208
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,090
uh, at a movie. Let me see.

1209
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,280
Yes, this has gotta be somebody's,
uh, this has to be a movie joke.

1210
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,413
Okay.

1211
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,540
Oh, doctor Peter Venkman. Oh, okay.

1212
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:55,950
This was bill Murray's
character and Ghostbusters.
Okay. Hilarious. All right. Um,

1213
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,200
I don't know how to approach
this topic without upsetting her.

1214
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:04,740
Do you have any advice for me? Yours
truly Dr Peter Venkman? Uh, yeah,

1215
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:05,980
don't bring up these topics.

1216
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,020
Don't bring up the topic and uh,

1217
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:18,230
you know, I, I would just,
I would just be like, look,

1218
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:22,760
I get it. You believe in ghosts and
I don't, uh, don't say it like that.

1219
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,340
Just feel like I respect the
fact that you believe in ghosts

1220
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,840
and um,
I don't,

1221
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:34,730
and if the tables were turned and there
was something that I believed in and you

1222
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:37,310
didn't,
I would respect the fact that you didn't,

1223
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:43,370
and a rather than do, you know,
getting upset with you. Okay.

1224
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:47,030
You see ghosts. Evidently you are born
with the power that I was not giving.

1225
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:51,350
So you should feel thankful for that,
that you're able to see these things.

1226
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,920
I am a mere mortal. I'll don't say that
cause then that's passive aggressive.

1227
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,900
I'm the worst. Something along
those lines. It just say, listen,

1228
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:02,240
I love everything about
you and we get along great.

1229
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,720
But I just feel like there's
this tension about this that Eh,

1230
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:10,460
that you're trying to force me to feel
something that I don't feel and I don't

1231
01:15:10,461 --> 01:15:12,410
think that that's what you
do to somebody you love.

1232
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,540
And I wouldn't do that to you.
Okay.

1233
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,720
So come on over here and if
there's not a ghost between us,

1234
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:22,700
could you give me a hug?
Some along those lines?

1235
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:28,610
All right, last one here.
My sister's friend. Oh boy.
Hi Bill. Hi Bill. You can't,

1236
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,570
I'm an 18 year olds from England and I
need some advice. All right. You're pasty,

1237
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:35,480
crooked teeth dose around two months ago,

1238
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:39,740
one of my sister's childhood friends
came to visit her for a weekend.

1239
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:44,630
They'd been friends since they were three
and she moved five hours away when she

1240
01:15:44,631 --> 01:15:47,390
was 12 so they barely
see each other anymore.

1241
01:15:47,391 --> 01:15:51,380
They were playing to go out on
Saturday with a group of friends say,

1242
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,060
and I was planning on staying home alone.
Well,

1243
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:57,380
my sister went to pick up a few of
her friends to meet at our house.

1244
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:02,180
Me and her friends flirted a bit,
but nothing major.

1245
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,770
We exchanged snapchats, et cetera. I
love how that's flirting now, long,

1246
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,180
long story short,

1247
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:14,050
my sister's friend pretended to be ill
and came home early so we could hook up.

1248
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:20,240
Dude, you are fucking crushing it.
Your sister's bringing them home to,

1249
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:24,320
you know you have to go out.
Good for you.

1250
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,620
The only thing was my sister was genuinely
ill and also came home early around

1251
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:34,730
30 minutes after her friend and she
caught us in bed together. Well,

1252
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:37,280
what the fuck is she doing
walking into your bedroom.

1253
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:38,880
Okay.

1254
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,500
My sister got insanely angry and
stormed out by you should said, hey,

1255
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:44,970
don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

1256
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:50,760
And it just lit a cigarette.
Oh my God.

1257
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,560
I think this is fucking funny.
This is fucking hilarious,

1258
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,490
dude. Do you realize how hard you're
crushing it? You're fucking at home.

1259
01:16:59,491 --> 01:17:01,020
You're not even trying to get late.

1260
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,830
She just says her friends come
over for the bullshit. Okay ladies,

1261
01:17:04,831 --> 01:17:06,750
you ready to go out and in that moment,

1262
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:08,670
whatever the fuck you
did made one of them,

1263
01:17:08,671 --> 01:17:12,480
pretend be sick and come back
and hook up with you. Dude,

1264
01:17:12,481 --> 01:17:13,830
you're a fucking hero.

1265
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:16,110
Okay?

1266
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:20,160
There's no reason to get, oh, I don't
care how mad you assistant gets. Just,

1267
01:17:20,161 --> 01:17:24,840
I would just keep smiling and just
be like, hey, I can't help it man.

1268
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,860
You know the ladies love
me sweetheart, sweetheart.

1269
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:32,910
I wasn't trying to hook up.
I was at home.

1270
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:37,650
I was innocent. I can't help it.
If women are attracted to me,

1271
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:41,280
I would just go totally fucking
arrogant at the matter she get.

1272
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:45,530
I would just keep laughing and I
would never take it seriously. Uh,

1273
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,960
my sister has suffered with depression
and anxiety. I forget what, I just,

1274
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,660
I didn't see that part.

1275
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,890
My sister has suffered with depression
and I'm so excited for you that I didn't

1276
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:59,430
even read this next book. She suffered
with depression and anxiety for years.

1277
01:17:59,431 --> 01:18:01,380
So whenever something like this happens,

1278
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,870
my family almost always sides with her.
Oh,

1279
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,290
that's easy. Then you just divide
and conquer with you, with your dad.

1280
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:13,920
Just be like, Dad, I can't help but I,
I inherited your charisma. What do you,

1281
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:17,610
what do you want from me?
She, I didn't go out with,

1282
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:22,230
she came home to me if
it fell right in my lap.

1283
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,590
What was I supposed to do?
What was I supposed to do?

1284
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,300
Yeah,

1285
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,660
they don't and he'll, I don't, I,

1286
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,840
there's no fucking way I get mad
at my kid in the morning. I mean,

1287
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:36,040
he's mad because you're making her upset,
but he's not mad at what you did.

1288
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,500
I'm guaranteed your dad's
telling his friends at work.

1289
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:42,580
It's fucking son of a bitch and you have
to leave the fucking house to come to.

1290
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,520
They come in to him.
Uh,

1291
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:48,090
in the morning she threatened to
never talk to me again for what I did,

1292
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:53,130
but I said something along the lines
of I feel a connection with her

1293
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,790
or some bullshit like that to calm my
sister down. The thing was I didn't,

1294
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,820
but her friend did.
Oh No.

1295
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:08,660
We started dating and after round two
weeks I re I realized that I fucking hated

1296
01:19:10,381 --> 01:19:14,790
this girl. She is generally stupid as
shit. Yeah, dude, this is all good.

1297
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,740
This is all good stuff because
you're learning lessons,

1298
01:19:16,741 --> 01:19:19,350
which is supposed to in
life, especially at 18. Okay.

1299
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,440
This whole thing started with a lie.
Okay.

1300
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,960
And that you did to protect
your sister's feeling.

1301
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,570
So you just got to come clean.

1302
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:31,440
You've got to dump the dummy
and just tell her like, listen,

1303
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:36,420
I love you so much that I actually
started dating somebody that is fucking

1304
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:40,360
stupid. All right, I'm sorry you have the,

1305
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,140
then she'll get mad that you'll be
like calling her friends stupid.

1306
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,970
Are you saying my friends is stupid?
No,

1307
01:19:44,971 --> 01:19:47,460
I'm saying that friend that
is a friend of you is stupid.

1308
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:53,160
The other ones seem really smart
and you know, tell all of them.

1309
01:19:53,161 --> 01:19:55,840
I wouldn't mind if they fake six and
came home and hooked up with them.

1310
01:19:57,410 --> 01:20:01,020
All right. I said I fucking hate you.
This girl, she's generally stupid as shit.

1311
01:20:01,021 --> 01:20:06,021
My original plan was to pretend I was
into her for a few months and then when I

1312
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:07,750
go to university,

1313
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:09,910
uh,

1314
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:15,420
in a few months I break up with her
because of the long distance. Do it.

1315
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:18,360
Don't do that because you might
break her heart. All right?

1316
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:21,780
But that's some dumb shit
you do when you're 18. Uh,

1317
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:24,800
that way I'd say my
relationship with my sister and,

1318
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:30,360
and mother and get rid of this stupid
bitch. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1319
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:34,340
Don't talk about women. You don't need
to talk about him like that. Okay.

1320
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,040
Feel lucky that you, you know, you got a
better brain than cheated. Yeah. Don't,

1321
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,020
don't play with people's
feelings like that. All right?

1322
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:41,430
Cause I'm telling you right now that you,

1323
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:46,470
that if you're any sort of an actual
human being, uh, breaking someone's heart,

1324
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:50,220
the guilt of that never
fucking goes away. Um, however,

1325
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:55,020
I recently received news that my first
choice university turned me down and my

1326
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:57,390
second choice was the
only one that accepted me.

1327
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,600
The problem is she lives 15 minutes away
from my second choice university and

1328
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:05,040
now I don't know what to do.
You got to come clean.

1329
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:09,570
I can't go through university
hitched to a girl I fucking hate,

1330
01:21:09,571 --> 01:21:12,870
but I can't afford to risk my relationship
with my family for obvious reasons.

1331
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,670
Also,

1332
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:18,090
another girl who I think I generally may
have a connection with recently broke

1333
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:22,350
up with a boyfriend of two years and I'm
pretty sure that if I could, if I could,

1334
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,510
we would be dating right now.
Uh,

1335
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:29,511
it also doesn't help that this girl is
a nine out of 10 looking model and I'm

1336
01:21:29,581 --> 01:21:32,730
probably a six and a half out
of 10 at best. Thanks for you.

1337
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:36,030
Help you freckled Twat all right.
Through this is what you got to learn.

1338
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,470
You're going to learn, uh,
honesty here. All right?

1339
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,710
I'm fucking break up
with that woman today.

1340
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,600
All right?
And you have to come clean,

1341
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:51,940
okay?

1342
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,300
With everybody in your house
and you have to say, you know,

1343
01:21:55,301 --> 01:21:59,170
you have to put your foot down that
your parents cannot be choosing.

1344
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,600
I would maybe I would have this
conversation with your parents.

1345
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:06,601
They can't be choosing your sister over
you straight across the board because of

1346
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:11,410
your sister's depression
and anxiety issues. Okay.

1347
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,700
I don't know how severe they are. All
right. If they're chemical, then yeah,

1348
01:22:15,701 --> 01:22:18,610
that's a major problem. But you
know, if she just needs to fucking,

1349
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,570
you know, get out of a funk, then I dunno.

1350
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,440
I Dunno where she is on the
whole depression spectrum
if that's the proper thing.

1351
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:29,680
But like you shouldn't have to
be suffering like this, dude,

1352
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:34,420
you got to live your own fucking
life, all right? Just live your life.

1353
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,670
Live your life,
and when you live your life,

1354
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:38,200
sometimes people are going to get hard.

1355
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:40,010
Okay,

1356
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:44,610
all right, fuck that. Break up with this
woman and go ask the other woman out.

1357
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:46,360
That's it.

1358
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,990
That's what the fuck you do and if anybody
in your family has a problem with it,

1359
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,510
let them vent to you and
all that stuff and just say,

1360
01:22:52,511 --> 01:22:57,511
I'm sorry that I am doing what
my heart is telling me to do.

1361
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:01,450
All right. I am not trying to
hurt anybody in this family.

1362
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:07,020
Had I known that hooking up with that
girl was going to cause this level of of

1363
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:10,730
drama, I wouldn't have done
it. I regret that I did it.

1364
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:15,820
I actually felt so bad that actually
fucking dated or for two weeks the whole

1365
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:18,740
time and it was like
talking to a fucking chair.

1366
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:22,220
Say all this stuff nicely.

1367
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:23,670
Okay.

1368
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:26,100
All right.
There's a woman that I like,

1369
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,850
then I want to pursue and I'm going
to do that, and if that's wrong,

1370
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,140
that God damn it,
I don't want to be right and walk out,

1371
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:35,951
okay,

1372
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:40,750
and don't let them hold your sister's
fucking problems over your goddamn head

1373
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,910
because that's good. Look, we'll
do what it's already doing.

1374
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:45,340
It's causing you to fucking date
people you don't want to date.

1375
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:48,310
So then she's going to be depressed and
you're going to be living this life of

1376
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:52,660
fucking misery because you didn't do what
you wanted. Okay? Now, having said that,

1377
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,930
don't call women bitches,
all right? Don't do that.

1378
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,290
I'm not saying don't call them out
on this shit and stand your ground,

1379
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:02,920
but the don't don't have a do the name
calling thing, all right? Because it's,

1380
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:03,761
it doesn't die.

1381
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:07,930
It gets you not only does it and it
makes the other person not hear what your

1382
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:08,710
point is,

1383
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:12,040
then they can bring that up for the rest
of your fucking relationship and God

1384
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:16,180
knows they're going to do it. All
right? That's the fucking podcast. Oh,

1385
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:19,840
fuck yourself. I'll check in
on you on Thursday. Bye Bye.
