Dave, what's going on dude? Happy
to be here at brother. Yeah,

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,320
welcome to the podcast.
I told you before we started,

16
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:58,820
I made a major fuck up on my last podcast.
Yes.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,080
I called the band the
specials. The smiths. Okay.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,540
And oh boy. You know,
that is not good at all.

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,980
And that was going on and on about how
much I love this set and all that and I

20
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:13,730
fucked up and I want to
apologize to everybody that
actually met the lead singer

21
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:18,610
of the band and the guitarist and the
lead singer. That band, uh, said, uh,

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,940
he real quick, it was just like, oh,
I love the way you say the word cat.

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,980
You say it right. And I was just, and it
was like the greatest compliment ever.

24
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:25,641
Absolutely.

25
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:29,720
It's like when my buddy Joe to Rosa was
in Scotland in a bar at like four in the

26
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:33,470
morning. And some Scottish guy said too,
it was like, oh, you can fucking drink.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,500
And he's just like,
it was like the greatest compliment ever.

28
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:40,490
So I got to apologize to
them. Okay. It's, it's,

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,170
it's my fault. The fucking music I
listened to in the 80s, you know,

30
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,700
I was into the fucking metal and all
these skater guys and everything up the

31
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:54,010
street. My brother hung out with, uh, you
know, stopped a mess and Oh, around ball.

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,150
And I'm like,
these guys aren't singing about the devil.

33
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,260
They're not wearing women's clothes.
I'm not listening to these guys. I mean,

34
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:05,250
I was, you know, I was very, I was
closed off back then, you know, so, um,

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,400
you know, so you saw
it, you saw it when I,

36
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,810
I've been taking lessons with you for
about what, a year and a half or so.

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,040
They can come in and Margaret and
all that man we get to right is,

38
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,240
it felt like 10
I went in there,

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,240
I came in there like the crypt keeper,
like I'll fucking

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,750
crunched over and shit, holding
the sticks, wrong forums,

41
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,420
everything all jacked up. And
I got to tell you like, um,

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,450
you're on here besides the fact
that you're a good friend of mine,

43
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,520
you're on here because you have a new,
uh,

44
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,470
a new drum instructional video route
called getting out of your own way. True.

45
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,960
Which I actually got to watch a lot of,
uh,

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,330
last night and it's all this stuff,
you know, that you've been teaching me,

47
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:51,980
which was I was basically
fighting the kit and yourself.

48
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,610
Yeah. I was like, yeah, it
was all crunched over. I was
holding the sticks wrong.

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,920
I was just playing uphill.
Nothing was at the right. And uh,

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,740
for the drummers out there
who listened to this podcast,

51
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:07,660
I cannot tell you like the stuff that
you showed me just getting me to sit up

52
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:11,320
straight, hold the sticks right
and have shit where I can hit it,

53
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,630
do to my body type.
Yeah.

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,770
It's made so much stuff that
used to be really difficult,

55
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:21,370
like borderline effortless now,
however,

56
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,620
I still suck because
at the end of the day,

57
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,660
no matter how much you
teach me to sit up straight,

58
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,460
I am still at the mercy of the talents
that I was blessed with. But um,

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,383
but I'm still,
you know,

60
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,960
yeah. But it's a whole different ball game
than when I first saw you man. I mean,

61
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,400
oh you work your ass off too.

62
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,120
It's like I can show you
show people how to do things,

63
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,880
but at the don't put in the work,
nothing's going to change. You know,

64
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,340
you work your ass off.
So

65
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,980
I'm a lunatic Dave. Yeah, I know.
I get into shit. That's my point.

66
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,270
That's exactly what I'm saying.

67
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,920
That's why I always stayed away from
hard drugs because I would have like,

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,980
I'd have like a fucking monogram
coke spoon. I would just be,

69
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:02,570
I would be a coke heads coke head.
I know if I did it. So I try to,

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,670
I try to send it into a positive areas.

71
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,250
So, uh, it's a good point.
Well, look, I gotta ask you,

72
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,070
I don't know if I've ever even talked
to this talk to you about this,

73
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,400
where it's just like,
so you grew up in northern California,

74
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,880
you said Hell or this Hella
Dad, I'm sure. Right? Yes.

75
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:23,330
I got made fun of a lot when I moved
to La Sacramento Kings Fan. Maybe

76
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,210
I didn't see the sharks

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,650
for hockey when I was,

78
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,990
oh fuck. I just realized, I
mean this fucking leather chair,

79
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,570
if this is gonna make a bunch of noise
when I'm moving around like that Benny

80
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,403
Hill sketch,

81
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
you'll see that one where he wore the
leather pants when the great sketches, no,

82
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,540
every time he had to deliver a line,

83
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,140
he would walk across the room and it was
just a sign of his leather pants and he

84
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,350
was sitting down crossing his legs and
then the other person would talk fucking

85
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:51,180
genius. I have to check it out.
Um, anyways. Um, so when you start,

86
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:55,440
what made you like want to play drums?
Like what got you started? What band?

87
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,680
Oh, what band? You know, I
don't know if there was a,

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,040
I mean I had a friend who was taking
drum lessons and I like slept over at his

89
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,850
house. I was like nine or
something. And he's like,

90
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:09,080
all my drum teachers coming over to
give me a lesson. And I was like, oh,

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,300
hang out and watch. And then I
was like, oh, this seems fun.

92
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:16,680
And then I sat down and I could just kind
of do it like it was you had that gift?

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,050
Yeah. It was like, oh, I
can kind of do this. And uh,

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,220
I'd never really had that experience
before, so I just immediately got hooked.

95
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,490
Uh,
and so I was like nine or 10.

96
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:31,110
So this is like 93 94.
Right. So this is like

97
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,880
God, I'm old when I was 25 and 26. Yeah,

98
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,510
that's crazy.
Yeah.

99
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,690
But this is like old dude.

100
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,960
But remember when we were sending
each other youtube clips about, uh,

101
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,650
um, I sent you that faith, no more clip
and you sent me the was a skid row.

102
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,340
Is that what it was? I don't remember.
Probably skewed. I love skid row.

103
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,670
It was that,
it was like SNL performances and yeah.

104
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,591
Oh my God.

105
00:05:55,591 --> 00:06:00,591
Skid row on fucking SNL and it was like
the same year and it was like check out

106
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:00,800
the,

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,800
we were talking about the shift in music
like right around like 91 92 I think it

108
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,840
was.
And it was like how,

109
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,200
like right when grunge and all this
stuff was coming out and it was just like

110
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,060
hair metal to grunge was just like,
you were like, what the fuck they was.

111
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,990
It was abrupt. Yes. It was like a,

112
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,460
how a lot of divorces go down in la where
there's like the day after the prenup

113
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,840
expires, Bam, divorce papers. Thank,

114
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,980
that's the way the musical shift
was. But like as a kid, I was,

115
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,410
I at that point like, uh, what
year was that? When, when,

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,970
when think it was [inaudible]
91 [inaudible] 92 yeah. Yeah.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,650
And that's good roll album. I
fucking love that album. Right.

118
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,400
And they were crushing. Crushing, yes.

119
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,170
Sebastian's voice was just like this one
of the great front men. Yes, absolutely.

120
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,570
Of all time.
And I had,

121
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,720
I didn't see that shift in music coming.

122
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,240
I think a way a lot of those bands didn't,

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,280
cause I remember when Nirvana came
out, I was like, what the fuck is this?

124
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,890
And I couldn't really even
hear how good a band they were.

125
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,410
And then that first video they had the
teen spirit when he was like doing like

126
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,280
uh, uh, basic solo and he was kind of
acting like he was doing the tap on Solo.

127
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,460
It was clearly making fun of all the guys
that I like. Totally. I was like, dude,

128
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,010
fuck these guys,
fuck this band.

129
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,180
And it wasn't until I saw
them on unplugged and I
got in Utero and everything

130
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,620
and I was just like, wow, this,

131
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,800
these guys are making like this is a
beautiful album night. And it took me,

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,910
but it took me like two and a half
years of of being like, wait a minute.

133
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,260
The 80s or over?
Yeah,

134
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:41,030
because I'm old now because you have
that shit juxtaposed right next to each

135
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:45,350
other and you're growing from spandex and
lipstick and straightened hair to like

136
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:49,460
flannel shirts and Glam thing
was only about three years. Okay.

137
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,540
It was right around 85,

138
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:55,541
86 everybody got the kick started dressing
like men again around 87 88 they had

139
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,570
a round table meeting and we're
like, look, stop blowing up the hair.

140
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,020
Let's go back to, let's try to get a limo,
Allman brothers here and a little less,

141
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,220
uh, grease, whatever the fuck
they were doing. But so yeah,

142
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:11,510
so that was the scene I was growing up
and when I started playing was what we're

143
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,410
talking about right now. So
you missed all, all this shit.
You would just, you know,

144
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,820
10 years old. I mean, I mean,

145
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:21,260
I definitely listened to a Shitload of
Phil Collins when I was like a little

146
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:25,250
Katie's Phil Collins or like, like the
later stuff that everyone makes fun of.

147
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,420
Well [inaudible] yeah,
I mean, you know, yeah.

148
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,810
I wasn't like listening
to that song specifically,

149
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,610
but like you're sure about that.

150
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,520
A little bearded 10 year old day dancing
around sue sue Tsuneo I did come out of

151
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,110
the wound with a beard by the way. Oh,
you did? Yeah. Just always been hearing.

152
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,420
It's what it is. That's why you went
to the drums. You were fucking animal.

153
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,460
That's true. I've heard that more than
once. Um, did you, uh, so then when, when,

154
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,070
when you, uh, when all
that grunge stuff came out,

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,930
was that just sort of music to you as
opposed to like being like all this is a

156
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,360
choice. You weren't old
enough to realize like, wow,

157
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,470
we just went from this to that? Not at
all. That's what I'm saying is like,

158
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,040
because that happened.
I remember listening to sir,

159
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,630
it's actually funny like
saying this, like, I listened
to it so much Phil Collins,

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,010
but I would hear like new wave stuff
or 80 stuff like tears for fears and be

161
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:23,920
like, oh, gross. And now I
love, love that stuff. Right.

162
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,980
But at the time it was like the
least cool shit ever. You know,

163
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,180
I went back to the eighties a
bunch of times going, oh wow,

164
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:32,580
this band was actually pretty
good. Yeah. Yeah. And it's,

165
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,320
and a lot of that stuff
is so like interesting and
esoteric and weird ways that

166
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,780
you check it out now.
And some of it's aged poorly,

167
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:42,600
but some of it's aged in
like a really cool way. Yeah.

168
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,160
I didn't like a lot of just the sound.
Yeah. Shit that came out in the 80s,

169
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,360
whatever that sound was,

170
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:52,140
I saw somebody sent me a video and you
know about how they came up with that,

171
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,150
that sound for the drums,
right.

172
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,750
That was the Phil Collins
[inaudible] sent me.

173
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,410
And that was just a complete accident
where there was a Mike on in this studio

174
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,890
and somebody played a Phil.
Yeah. And it was, yeah, it was,

175
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,370
it was in the control room or something
like that. Phil Collins was apparently,

176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,450
there's various stories, but apparently
Phil Collins was playing drums on one,

177
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,470
a Peter Gabriel's solo albums and he
was trying out fills or whatever and

178
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,180
someone hit the talk back,
Mike. Uh, so if you, you know,

179
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,960
for people who haven't
recorded in a recording studio,

180
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,070
when you're in the control room,
you hit the talkback Mike and they,

181
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,860
you can then hear what the
person's saying, uh, or,

182
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,430
or if you're in the
studio or tracking drums,

183
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,810
you can't hear what anyone is
saying in the control room. Right.

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,220
So they have to hit a talk back Mike a
button so you can hear what's going on.

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,640
And basically they went to talk to Phil
and they hit the talk back Mike and he

186
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:51,090
played a drum fill over that and the,
the, the talkback might picked it.

187
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm just got super blown out and
they were like, whoa, that was crazy.

188
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,420
It was like a complete accident.
And that's how that gated,

189
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:02,400
like Peter Gabriel was like, I liked
that sound. And then, which is probably,

190
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:06,710
I imagined a cool sound
initially and then it, it,

191
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,800
it was just overused and then,
and that's how everything happens now.

192
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,090
It's totally like in vogue again,
like everyone,

193
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,800
I mean it's sort of starting
to get overused now,

194
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,550
but it just went through a whole thing
over the past five years where that was

195
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:24,110
super hip again. Let's go on in my
business right now where they just, they,

196
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't know what's they just rebooting
everything that I already watched that

197
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,810
just going the point through IMDP
to be like, is this guy still alive?

198
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,400
Do you think he wants to do a WHO's the
boss again and fucking now who's the

199
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:38,370
boss? Uh, I'm trying to think of
something more obscure than that. Um,

200
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,140
she's the sheriff. Is that a show that
wasn't show? Really no reason why.

201
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:46,110
I know that is because a friend of mine
was on it for a couple of episodes and

202
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,700
he said at one night and it was just like,
dude,

203
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,660
that's one of the great
fucking references. I don't
even know what that is.

204
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:54,070
That was a, uh, beautiful

205
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,760
woman who was on, um, Suzanne Somers.

206
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,750
Um, she started it and
evidently she was a sheriff.

207
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,100
She's the sheriff and she was just this
hottie who was the sheriff and everybody

208
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:10,660
had to listen to what
she did. It, you know,

209
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,800
I think it was for like people who were
into like dominatrix and like women tell

210
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,600
him that piece of shit and they're
under arrest. It was sort of something,

211
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,890
there was an underlying sexual thing.
Everything that was done back then,

212
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,830
you know, you can't do any of that now.
Now she'd be a fucking hero, you know,

213
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,590
whatever the fuck I,
whatever the, you know,

214
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,630
the pendulums completely
swung the other way now.

215
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:32,440
So every guy's a fucking taking his dick
out and peanut and on a plant blocking

216
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:37,360
a door. And women are all like fucking
Joan of arc. There's no middle ground,

217
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:38,770
there's no middle ground.
That's what it is.

218
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,070
We're going to go from not listening
to women to not vetting any of them and

219
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:45,230
then saying every fucking guy's a
complete piece of shit through some of the

220
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,710
shit that's coming. Like some of
these guys got friends of mine now.

221
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,710
It's like literally ex girlfriends
who are mad that they're famous now.

222
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,420
Totally just coming out, going like, oh,

223
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,860
lives get ruined. They're like, man,

224
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,960
I don't like you anymore if
I'm going to ruin your life.

225
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,910
I mean, well, the fact that
this, if, if, if there's gonna
be no due process, I mean,

226
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:05,420
who is safe? No one. It's crazy. Yeah.

227
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,640
I think it was emotionally abusive
and said, I haven't got it.

228
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:11,420
I've got emotionally abused and like
at least 85% of my relationships.

229
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,910
I spent the last fucking week in
my own fucking house on eggshells.

230
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,920
What? Back in a good place. But it's just
constantly, you know, emotional abuse.

231
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:25,880
I mean, women have the fucking
market cornered on that. This is,

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,570
this is a different podcast.
So anyways, that's a different
topic. So your, your, uh,

233
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,480
your, your, your, um, uh, instructional
videos. Yeah. You put it though,

234
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,650
first of all, you know, you're,
you're already ahead of 90% of people.

235
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,940
Just by the way it looks,

236
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:44,540
the quality of the way it's shot
because so much of it is just somebody,

237
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,610
you know, literally wearing
a Gopro, staring into a
mirror, why they play drums.

238
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,550
So you supposed to try to fucking
learn something out of that.

239
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,060
That's, well, that's exactly
why I made this thing. I mean,

240
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:58,410
I've been teaching for like
20 years and I work with,

241
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,170
you know, a lot of pros, a
lot of my contemporaries,

242
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:05,800
a lot of big name dudes who are out in
the real world touring with big bands. Um,

243
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,780
in addition to me touring and
recording and, um, I never, you know,

244
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,610
I always wanted to do
an instructional thing,

245
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:16,320
but with the way technology's evolved
with Instagram and youtube and everything,

246
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:21,270
like everyone's a quote unquote
teacher now. Yeah. So, um,

247
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,461
by the way,
there's,

248
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,700
so there's this inside thing that I
always see something and I think it's

249
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:30,350
fucking amazing. A drum thing and then I
send it to you and you're just like, eh.

250
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,060
You know what that reminds
me of is when I, you know,

251
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,450
it's when people come up to me
and then they just pick like some,

252
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,830
somebody super popular at the moment,
like, what do you think is so it's,

253
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,270
that person is really funny.
Huh? He got to be like, yeah.

254
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,950
I mean they're up there
talking and well Mike, yeah,

255
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:51,230
they're on stage doing things.
Yeah.

256
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:54,560
They're saying things that people
are really reacting with. Laughter.

257
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,910
You just have to say straight up facts.
Yeah, I know. I what I do, I just like,

258
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,720
I would never take down
another comment publicly,

259
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:05,960
but on the phone with my
friends or which it is,

260
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,220
we fucking eviscerate so many people and
then eventually it comes around to us

261
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,130
and then we just start trashing each
other and just laughing our ass off.

262
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,150
And then the end, everyone we trashed, we
just go, Hey God bless them. Bless them.

263
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,970
They're out there. That's what it's
all about. I do that same shit too.

264
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:22,580
I have text threads with friends
of mine where we do with the same,

265
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,750
same thing and were just as brutal to
work to each other and towards cells.

266
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,030
Do you know how many jokes
like back in the day when I,

267
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,270
when I was working in the comedy cellar
in New York, how many jokes I lost,

268
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,750
how many shirts I could never wear again.
And all of this cause we sit,

269
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:39,440
just sit there and like the guys used
to go down and they would watch you on

270
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,770
stage and they would be
staring at you with like the,

271
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,240
it would be Patrice rest his
soul. Oh Man. Uh, Voss Norton.

272
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,180
And they would just stand
in there in the doorway.

273
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,830
We could see and none of
the crowd could see him.

274
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:55,700
And you had to like totally commit
to your fucking act. Wow. And uh,

275
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,670
I remember Kevin Hart when
he first fucking came down
and he's like 20 years old

276
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,880
and they were doing that to him.
And I remember he didn't get rattled.

277
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,631
He did a little bit.

278
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,840
And then the first time and then he didn't
and we'll have to once he didn't get

279
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,280
rattled and I remember thinking like, wow
man, this kid is uh, he's got the force.

280
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,570
Wow. Yeah, because I was sitting there,
those guys were all my contemporary. Sure.

281
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,530
We were like 10 15 years older than
Kevin and these guys are my contemporary.

282
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:20,900
Then I could fall. I was like, Oh
God, they're going to stare at me.

283
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,370
And then you almost felt yucky.

284
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,150
Deliberately had to say something
to bomb or some shit like that.

285
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,370
So I don't know.
Do you guys ever do stuff like uh,

286
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,640
do you have a watch to go out and see,

287
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,980
see if like for a comedian to
watch a friend of yours bomb.

288
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,190
If not,
if it's like if the set means something,

289
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:39,560
but if they just stuck there and they
try a joke and they just eat shit,

290
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:40,700
it's one of the funniest things ever.

291
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,040
Like when you watch a
friend of yours play drums,

292
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,720
they go for a fill or something.

293
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,570
If they eat shit on it yet
it's totally different.

294
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,450
Just by the nature of what your doing.

295
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:54,020
So much of it is just throwing
shit against the wall and
seeing what sticks and

296
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,130
just being like, Hey, I
fucking try it like that.

297
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,110
I love Comedians and I respect
Canadians so much because you know,

298
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:03,470
I'll go around town and see you or other
builders go out one night and go to the

299
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:07,460
comedy store or something and someone
will walk up on stage with a slip.

300
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,360
I've seen you do this and a bunch of
other people like, oh yeah, just like, Oh,

301
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:13,450
I'm just working some shit out. Oh
yeah. You know, like subjects like Ah,

302
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,620
that didn't fucking work.
You know, and, and like that,

303
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,790
you can't do that with music.

304
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,740
Like people were there to see a show
and they botch something. It's like you,

305
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,610
you want to put up a bit about
the, uh, the jam section.

306
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,320
Isn't that what you guys call it?

307
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:31,310
When you look at each other then
you just wait and like there are,

308
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,580
there are like this, there's not a
different musical situations with this.

309
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,640
There's some bands go out like we're
planning exactly like the record. Sure.

310
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,220
And then there's other people, like if
we play it like the record one more time,

311
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,920
I'm going to blow my brains
out. Can we? Yeah, absolutely.

312
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,810
And there's certain situations where
you can jam and improvise and uh,

313
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,160
you know,
like I would do that

314
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,350
with the Mars Volta or like,
or like anti mass.

315
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:55,350
There would be certain sections or are
we just go way out into outer space for

316
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,730
half an hour. What was that like
when, when you got that Gig and,

317
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,090
and you had to follow?
It was crazy.

318
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,670
All of those amazing drummers
that were in the band,

319
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,830
all this shit that they came up with
and didn't even have some like something

320
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,630
ridiculously,
uh,

321
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,300
a short amount of time they have
to learn it and all that. Um,

322
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,640
basically,
uh,

323
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,420
I got the call to do it.
And um,

324
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,890
and Juan,
the bass player who,

325
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,560
who used to play bass in racer
x, by the way, for the last,

326
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,800
I heard of the band. I don't
know who they are. Okay.

327
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,990
I'm sure I'll fuck up their
name on the next podcast.

328
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,780
We'll talk about eighties in
spandex and feathered hair.

329
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,880
They're pretty deep into that scene.
But yeah,

330
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,910
so Juan came over to my studio
with a fellow Bass player.

331
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,340
This Guy Jonathan Hirschi,
really good buddy of mine now.

332
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,390
And John came over just
to watch me like so,

333
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,080
so Juan came over and we plugged in my
iPod and he's like, do you know this song?

334
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,330
You know? And I'm like, I don't know.
I've never played along to this stuff.

335
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:59,340
I just kind of like the first record.

336
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,790
So one's playing with me and John's just
sitting there like two feet in front of

337
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,680
me just staring at me, watching
me like, and then Jesus Christ.

338
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:11,400
Yeah, I know it's stressful and a, and I
never played the music. I was just like,

339
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,550
I kinda know this thing. Or you
know, just from being a fan of that.

340
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:17,580
What sort of prep did you do before then?
Nothing. It was like, Hey, I'm lying.

341
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,270
I'm in line at Starbucks when he called
me and then I had to go to a recording

342
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,650
session all day.
And then I was like,

343
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:26,850
I can meet you after I'm done with this
session at night. And then he was like,

344
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:28,200
okay. And like, you know what I mean?

345
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,320
How bad did you need that Mars Volta
Gig at that point, your career?

346
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,770
Was that something that was huge? Yeah,
it really put me on the map. I mean,

347
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:38,730
because of the lineage of dudes that
were in that band and how like the

348
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:42,810
reputation that band has. Um, I
mean I had done things before that,

349
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:47,190
but nothing of that level,
you know, so, um, it was huge.

350
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,850
So I had about two weeks,
you know,

351
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,340
to learn the music and it was a two
and a half hour set. Uh, you know?

352
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,920
Yeah. And what did you do? Shut it out.
Yeah, I charted everything out. Um,

353
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,880
how long does it take you to and when,
when like how true to the original,

354
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:06,600
like John Theater was shit. Well, yeah.
Well I'd love, I'd love John's playing.

355
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:09,570
I think he's amazing and I
think his parts are incredible.

356
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,550
I think that first record
is really a masterpiece.

357
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
So I wanted to do everything that I
could in the time that I had to play

358
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,760
everything. Note for note. Cause I
think that's really important with that.

359
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,530
It's like, it's like what situation
we're talking about earlier.

360
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:24,531
Like people go to see those songs off
that first record and they want it exactly

361
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,750
right.
Like I would want to see that.

362
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,010
So I went out of my way to get everything
totally note for note, which, you know,

363
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:36,050
it was easier and more difficult in
some certain circumstances. But, um,

364
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,770
there were other, you know, other songs
where it wasn't really important as much.

365
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,690
Um, so two and a half weeks
to get it together and, and,

366
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,260
and like how often were
you jamming with the band?

367
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,550
I didn't meet the band until I got to
Amsterdam and then we, I mean me and Omar,

368
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:55,220
the guitar player and won like got the
three of us jammed a little bit. Uh,

369
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,660
I went down to Mexico and the three of
us played through the arrangements and it

370
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,660
was like, he was like, yeah,
this is one. I was like, this
is fine. Like, you're fine.

371
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,190
But then I went to Amsterdam. How much
of a relief was it to hear that? Well,

372
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,560
we rehearsed everything without vocals,

373
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,550
which is difficult because I used vocals
to like sort of know where I am in the

374
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:13,384
song a lot.

375
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,870
Oh yeah, I've made that
mistake, I've done that.

376
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,570
So he was like,
dude,

377
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,220
you know, you don't even need to be
here. This is fine. It's all good.

378
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:27,360
And I was like, okay, great, but you're
still like freaking out, you know. So, uh,

379
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:31,440
I get to Amsterdam, meet the rest of
the band, then we run through the set.

380
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,200
And this is kind of funny cause I,

381
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,000
I wrote out all my charts
and I put an extra floor,

382
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:39,600
Tom on my left and like a crash cymbal
on my left, the left of the high hat.

383
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,410
And I just put my charts on the floor,
Tom, like hoping like no one would see,

384
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:44,370
you know.
Right.

385
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:47,040
And I get up halfway through and to
go to the bathroom and I came back,

386
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,760
it was all gone. Oh,
somebody took it. Yeah.

387
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,800
And I like look over it one and he's
like, dude, you don't need that shit.

388
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,830
You're good. And I was like, okay.
And then everything was fine.

389
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,160
We ran through the rent or the two and
a half hours because there's a lot of

390
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:03,590
visual cues I was going to sink. But
if, if they liked that, yeah. If,

391
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,261
if they,

392
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:07,830
if you went there and they weren't
during the first rehearsal wanting it,

393
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:10,890
note for note, that must
have been something a little
bit easier where it's like,

394
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:14,850
okay, these guys aren't going to
be like Nazis about this and this,

395
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:16,530
this going to be room for me to kind of,

396
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,370
yeah. Pull based on the situation based
on sort of where they were coming,

397
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:25,290
the situation they were coming out
of there were so like exhausted.

398
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,640
Um, so there were just
like, you know, this is,

399
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,260
this sounds like they were basically like,

400
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:34,170
we sound like a band again and it
sounds like a record. Oh, cool.

401
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:39,150
Which is great because I was did that
first gig. Yeah. What was, uh, that was,

402
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:43,050
um, it was in Oslo. Um, I love that.

403
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:47,910
Then those people, a great comedy fence.
Oh my God. I, some of my fucking lunatic,

404
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,490
some of my all time best friends are
from, are from Oslo. So many of them. Uh,

405
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:55,700
and so many amazing musicians
from there. It's insane. My first

406
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,310
really good show I ever had in
Europe was in Oslow. Really?

407
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,340
I don't know if it was them or
I just found it was just like,

408
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:03,410
just cause I was too much in my head.

409
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,960
[inaudible] and other places
like I'm in a different country.

410
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,810
Are they going to get this right?
I'm talking about shirts.

411
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:11,990
Do they have shirts yesterday dude,
they are wearing shirts. Oh Shit,

412
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,970
my timing is completely up. And I was
so fucking fed up with mediocre sets.

413
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,280
I think that when I was in
Oslo I just didn't give a fuck.

414
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,250
And then they were also
like picked up on it. No,

415
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,240
they were kind of maniacs where
they would like drinking and shit.

416
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,030
It's just like, ah, these are the
kinds of people I hang out with. Right.

417
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:33,290
And then just Kinda,
I felt comfortable and uh,

418
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,650
and then the rest of the tour.

419
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,380
And then I wanted to Stockholm
and all that and it just,

420
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,570
everything else I've just sort
of fell into place and saying,

421
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,920
oh just act like you're here, which
I've got here in Oslo. No, no, no.

422
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:47,510
Act like I'm in America. Oh Oh, oh Gotcha.
Cause then even if they don't get it,

423
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,490
you get to play the
arrogant American of like,

424
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:52,670
oh you should know everything about my
country and I should know nothing about

425
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,550
chores. And they almost want
you to say that cause you,

426
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,440
you feed into their stereotype of like,

427
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,460
yes they are self-involved conch and we're
better than they are and they love it.

428
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,300
Um,
I jumped around a lot.

429
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,980
No, that's okay. I get it. It's not like
I've never listened to this before. Yeah.

430
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:13,540
It's a shit show. So
yeah. So that first show,

431
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,110
yeah man, I was insanely
nervous. Um, but it went fine.

432
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,050
And then as soon as I was like halfway
through the show, I remember I was like,

433
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,450
yeah,
I'm feeling good luck.

434
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,310
I'm going to try and like put on a
little bit of a show here. Like visually.

435
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:28,990
Right.
Cause that's always very important to me.

436
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:32,950
Like there's nothing more boring than
seeing someone just up there just like

437
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,570
looking like they're doing their taxes.

438
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,460
That's me. That's how I look. Not Anymore.

439
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,540
A little bit better, but holy Shit. Oh we
got to talk about videotaping yourself.

440
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,690
Well, playing drums, which you
made me do and Oh my God. Yeah.

441
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,000
My self esteem has never been lower.

442
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,250
I've never looked worse doing anything
ever. Even my early standup tapes,

443
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:59,000
which I have on Vhs, which
I can't even watch. I don't
look as bad. Yeah. Cause you

444
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,630
word slouching. You know like, but you
won't. So you don't slide this, you know,

445
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:05,300
you don't slouch when you,
when you walk around and when you,

446
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:08,770
when you do stand up,
it's when you sit down.

447
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,970
No, but actually, you know
something, my posture is,

448
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,400
my posture I've learned from my shoulder
being fucked up is all my weight is on

449
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:21,710
my knees. And I've noticed a lot of
people do this. When they stand up,

450
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,800
they actually their,
their um,

451
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,300
their hips are forward and you're sort
of leaning back like standing like this

452
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,470
and what you're actually supposed to do.

453
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,610
You like to stand up totally
straight like this. Okay.

454
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,670
I feel like I'm puffing my chest out.

455
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,140
Acting like you like you want
to fucking fight. Yes. Uh,

456
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,300
especially coming from where I grew
up in such an angry crazy state isn't

457
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,330
outside of Boston.
Forget about Boston itself.

458
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:49,550
I was in the suburbs and
that shit was fucking nuts.

459
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,500
Stand up straight and then your knees
are just slightly bent and your arms had

460
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,990
just hanging down and your
shoulders are a little, you know,

461
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,640
I feel like their back but they're
not, that just lines up. Exactly.

462
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,660
This is what I have to
like learn how to do.

463
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,900
But this is exactly what I've said
to you and what I say to everyone,

464
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:09,890
especially all these big, big name working
pros is it's like if you're slouching,

465
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,520
that's your sort of normal goto setting
and you think that that's you sitting up

466
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:19,550
straight. Right. So that when you
sit up straight or stand up straight,

467
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,530
it feels like you're
puffing your chest out.

468
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:25,460
Cause that's that cognitive disconnect.
So he has to rewire everything.

469
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,430
So it's much more accurate.
So that's, that's the thing,

470
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,490
when I work on all this technique,
body mechanics stuff with people,

471
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:35,810
like that's why I tell them to videotape
themselves because you can't tell what

472
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,950
you actually look like. It's
brutal. It's brutal for everyone.

473
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,950
It's brutal for everyone, including
me. It's never, it never gets easier.

474
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:46,860
So when I started to talk about it,
yeah.

475
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,080
So when you were,
you started playing drums and everything,

476
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,610
I imagine you just sat down and grabbed
the sticks the way any other kid would

477
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,540
have. Like when did you start to
break down what you were doing?

478
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:01,680
Did you get hurt or did you just see a
video of some guy where he made it look

479
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:02,514
effortless?

480
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,040
Good question.
Uh,

481
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,250
I think when I started getting really
serious when I was like 14 or 15,

482
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,630
it was a matter of me
just constantly going,

483
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,950
how lazy can I possibly be?
Like,

484
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,750
how can I play all the stuff I
want to play and just be as like,

485
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,650
how, like how much, how can I continually
just make this easier on myself? Like,

486
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:28,350
why would I do this if I
could just do that instead?

487
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,360
Why do you think he thought that? I
don't know. Maybe I'm just lazy. No,

488
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,760
I was going to say that, but you're
not, you're, you're a driven guy. Sure.

489
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,020
I think I've just became obsessed
with like efficiency. Um,

490
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,580
not like for the sake of it in
and of itself, but to be like,

491
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,830
I can play in more or say more or do more,
the more efficient I am,

492
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,950
there's more I can do. It's more, I
can say the more it can emote that way.

493
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,000
Maybe it comes from, you
know, my dad collects cars.

494
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:01,380
Maybe it comes from growing up in that
culture of like talking about, you know,

495
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,320
how, you know, a difference between like
a Hemi and a wedge. Right. You know,

496
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:08,610
like the different having dual sparkplugs
versus single, like, I don't know.

497
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:12,220
I mean maybe it all sort
of mashed up together. Um,

498
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,610
I think it just,
I w you know,

499
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,930
if I wanted to play everything and
I realized from a young age probably

500
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:23,880
subconsciously like I need to
be as efficient as possible
so I'm not getting in

501
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,610
my own way so I can play this
stuff. I want to play. You know,

502
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:29,820
it's like the first time you heard
becoming, you know that Penn terra song,

503
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,330
first time I heard it I had to put
it on a cassette tape and put it in a

504
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:36,720
handheld recorder and slow the speed down.
Right.

505
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,460
I remember standing in my mom's kitchen
putting it up to my pump up to my ear,

506
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,650
slowing the speed down,
going what the fuck is going on right now?

507
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,540
Like having no clue how he could
possibly do that physically and then just

508
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,910
sitting there and breaking it down
and going, well that wouldn't work.

509
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:54,960
I still feel that way about a lot
of this stuff. Which by the way,

510
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,800
way man, you got to give a shout
out to Vinny. Good Lord Man.

511
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:00,710
That I was literally talking
about it texting with you.

512
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,710
Yup.
Cause talking on the phone.

513
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,500
Yeah. And I was just going like,
why is this guy so fucking good in,

514
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,910
in like two hours later you
sent me the texts that he had

515
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,380
passed away. Man, it's fucking
brutal. I know, man. I was really,

516
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,490
I haven't been that bummed out or I
haven't been like affected that much by

517
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,680
someone's death. Like who? I, I hadn't
really know him. I met him once, you know,

518
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,110
but I mean he was a real hero of mine and,
and to a lot of people,

519
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,760
uh, and he just had such a commitment
to an a very specific aesthetic.

520
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,170
Like he's like, this is the sound,
this is the feel, this is the vibe.

521
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,960
And like I'm 100% committed.
Like,

522
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,790
and the fact that they were doing,

523
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,430
when all the shit that I was talking
about that I was listening to that's just

524
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:49,840
face planted and then all this grunge
came out and they were just like, Nah,

525
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,730
we're going to keep doing this.

526
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,100
That's a great southern train kill. That's
the records of bow. As them being like,

527
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,710
fuck all these trends.
Like fuck this crunch shit.

528
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,220
Like we're going to stay true to our
metal roots and just keep doing this,

529
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,650
you know,
and like all that on that live record,

530
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:06,380
that live hundred and one proof
record like I love that dude.

531
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:09,980
Fill in some holes in between
Song Banter is incredible.

532
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,310
There's your for all your spoken pretty
blown after show recording for control.

533
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,210
Normal Ward Faulconer Obama nerve
ball shoot. I always love it.

534
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,910
That's pretty before can log in American
Harget Larry to strop from Auschwitz.

535
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,670
It's just like all this shit that you,

536
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:30,260
if you set it now you'd be my favorite
thing and I always talk about on this is

537
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,160
when he,
when when Vinny counts off broken.

538
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,320
It's like in the middle of Phil talking
like why are strong or knowledge called

539
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:44,210
on broker and I'm a look in the excess.
Yeah. The I'm having a good job.

540
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,000
That time is already playing and
it was just like, did they do that?

541
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:53,240
Cause that was fucking cool. Always
Vinnie. Like Oh God, shut up.

542
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,600
I want to drink.
I think it was part of it.

543
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,650
Yeah. I think he was probably just like,
fucking here we go. You know, like,

544
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,371
I love that.

545
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:05,670
That's such a great moment in that
record because you can tell they're just

546
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:08,640
fucking having fun dude.
And that's why that shit,

547
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,900
that's part of the reason why that shit

548
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,270
feels like never went to
go see them because I heard
the music and I had an idea

549
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:16,240
in my head what the crowd
was going to be like.

550
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm going to get the shit
kicked out of me at this thing.

551
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,600
But that's one of the funny things.
I was just talking to a buddy of mine,

552
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,110
Jamie, who I've been giving
Skype lessons to in London.

553
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,820
It's an every week for years.

554
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,800
And he was telling me he went to
see the Bronx the other recently,

555
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,920
it's like, you know, pretty heavy
like punk rock band. And he said like,

556
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:40,250
he brought his wife and she was like,
they left.

557
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,250
They had a great time at the
show and like everyone, you know,

558
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:45,230
someone falls down in the pit,
someone picks him up.

559
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:47,270
Like everyone's looking out for
each other. And he said like,

560
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:51,590
they left the show and his wife was like,
or he said, I forget. They were like,

561
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,250
we felt more unsafe walking the streets.

562
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,390
Then you did it at the show,

563
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,090
like with all these dudes beating
the shit out of each other. Yeah.

564
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:02,250
It just sounded like when
I listened to their music,

565
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:04,800
this a bunch of guys that
were mad at their dad,

566
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:07,530
we're going to show up and then they were
going to take the childhood out on me.

567
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:09,900
I just, you know, and I had fucking
orange hair and it was just like,

568
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,390
I just didn't think it was going
to end well. So it's just like,

569
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,590
but that is one of my big
regrets that I didn't,

570
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,960
there was a number of those bands that
I didn't go out and go see because I was

571
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:21,510
just like, dude, I love this
music, but I'm going to go,

572
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:23,610
I'm going to get the fucking shit
kicked out of me. And you know,

573
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,840
I was also in my fucking,

574
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,740
my stupid single Bass
Drum Barnum d dope pedal.

575
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,630
The music didn't require it, Bill, I don't
care. He could do more with one foot.

576
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Did this guy just saying all this shit
that other people and just completely

577
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:39,730
ignoring the, this entirely new, uh,

578
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,450
type of drumming and in all of these
pioneers who were just, it was like,

579
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,280
there was no roadmap on what to do
when I was listening to all these other

580
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:53,840
fucking guys who were just saying shit
that had already been said. And like,

581
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,060
and if basically if you could have
a foot is fastest bottom right,

582
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,310
then you were bought them. Something
like that mean it this way. My head was,

583
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,560
this is what I love doing when we're
doing lessons together and just shooting

584
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:07,730
the shit or whatever is,
is,

585
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:12,731
is that massive amount of carry over
between drumming and standup comedy.

586
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,740
I mean, it's huge. And that's
what's so fun about it. Difference.

587
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,340
It's the exact same fucking
thing of like, you know, uh,

588
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,210
the difference between a guy who change
comedy versus a guy who's just sort of,

589
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,560
you know,
doing comedy or if you're on stage,

590
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,220
like just reciting your act versus being
up there and having an idea and the

591
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:43,530
crowd reacts one way, which actually
affects how the show goes. And everything.

592
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:44,364
And um,

593
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,530
I used to be so envious of musicians that
could just sit down and play what they

594
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:52,560
could feel or react to
what another musician did.

595
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,140
And I just did not have that ability.

596
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,470
So when I got into stand up,

597
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,030
I remember like stand up. I had the same
feeling you had like when you got down,

598
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,870
when you sat it at a kid. When I first
time I remember when I went to a,

599
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:08,640
it was my second show is at
this place stitches comedy club,

600
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:11,730
which no longer exists.
And um,

601
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,650
I went in there for this open mic and I
remember just walking into all of these

602
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,830
open makers up at the bar,
all in different levels.

603
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:24,030
And I just remembered feeling like,
like, like for the first time,

604
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:28,440
like I was with a demographic of
people that like, I, I didn't know,

605
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,100
I was just like, yeah, these guys are
the same kind of fucking weird that I am,

606
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,980
this,
these Weirdos feel normal to me.

607
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,460
And it was the first time when
I went to stand up, you know,

608
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,590
even though I obviously had to learn
from all these people, there was, I,

609
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:46,560
I had like this feeling of, I know I
don't really know exactly where I'm going,

610
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:49,010
but I kind of know where I'm going.
Like I know that I,

611
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:54,011
I just have to do this a bunch of times
and what I feel in me is t his is like

612
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,390
that this is the right thing is
going to kind of come out. And uh,

613
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,460
so when I am in the, I'm trying to
think, one of the first guys I ever saw,

614
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,470
just a winger set.

615
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
I saw this Guy Frank Santa Rally and he
went up there and knowing what I know

616
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:11,280
now about comedy,

617
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:15,120
I think it was because the host brought
them up and they were playing this weird

618
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:18,720
music and she started doing this dump
dance and he did it with her and he had

619
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:20,100
this totally serious look on his face.

620
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:22,410
He was already killing before we
even took the mic and the mic stand.

621
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,710
But I think that little improv exercise
opened him up and he just went up there

622
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,290
and it was like he was just fucking
talking and I'd seen his act a bunch of

623
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:38,880
times and a then I remember thinking like,

624
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,370
oh he should be,
should do that again.

625
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,790
He should do like
everything was so precious.

626
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,390
She got to hang on to every
Friday thing you ever said.

627
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:47,620
And it wasn't like listen
to the musicians were the,

628
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:50,610
that whole those types of bands
where it's just like, yeah,

629
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:53,340
just how the song came out that night.
That was the mood we were in.

630
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,130
And I remember trying like
I tried to apply that.

631
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:56,531
Yeah.

632
00:35:56,531 --> 00:36:01,450
Cause it's the exact same thing I have
people say it's still hard at what you do

633
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,580
cause you wake up when you're a baby
mama. Dot. Dot. You were already playing.

634
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,630
You're already talking.
I'm just talking into a microphone.

635
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:11,220
I have to learn how to speak.
Yeah, but use through sounds. Yeah,

636
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,040
but putting an instrument but you
being able to stand up and wing a set.

637
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,760
You have to be just funny. Inherently
funny. Obviously it takes work,

638
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:22,360
but you have to be a funny person to be
able to do that as opposed to someone

639
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:25,870
who has, all you do is when
it, if it doesn't work, you
just make fun of yourself.

640
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,020
It's the, it's the, it's like
literally, you know, if he can't dance,

641
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,620
you just learn a little two step and let
the woman do all the fucking work and

642
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:37,000
sane, it's over. It's the same fucking
thing. But go up there, you wing an idea.

643
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,570
If it doesn't either just make fun of
yourself or you blame the crowd. Yeah.

644
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:43,660
But that's like he's saying like, Oh yeah,
when I go to do a drum solo, it's like,

645
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:46,600
yeah, just kind of played the
Tom's a little bit and then
the symbol. No, it isn't.

646
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,530
That's what I'm saying. It isn't. Yeah.
So I'm saying the same thing to you.

647
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,520
It's not, it's not that
easy. Like, I mean, but that,

648
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,000
that, you know, I have, uh, you know, to,

649
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,940
to I teach who are like mainly Torin
guys put with like pop acts or whatever.

650
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,730
They're like, I can sit down
and play the shit out of a show,

651
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,390
like from start to finish nail everything.
But if I sit down and someone's like,

652
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,610
Hey, play a little bit like I
don't know what the fuck to do.

653
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:12,600
Like I can't just play by myself and
that's the same also type of a thing.

654
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,350
Someone has a routine or
bits of show put together,

655
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:20,340
they could kill it but then if they just
walk up and talk to somebody heckles

656
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:22,410
him and fucks up there.
Yeah,

657
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,380
I guess that's the exactly
the same in music and comedy.

658
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,360
Someone throws a fucking beer
bottle at you or whatever.

659
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,120
Yeah. People throw shit at you
guys. That does not happen.

660
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:34,810
I mean I've had shit thrown at me but
like usually to serve this you guys would

661
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:39,190
just be up there singing and for some
reason somebody just wants to throw a

662
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,380
bottle.
I don't know why.

663
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,320
In a lot of times it's like the band
is like the crowd is enjoying the show.

664
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:47,620
It's like they just want to connect with
you less. I hit him with the bottle,

665
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,600
like the plastic water
bottle I was drinking at my
fingerprints are on it and it

666
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,930
touched him. So, and then he
yelled at me. It was epic.

667
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,380
People are crazy. What, um,
what's the most fucked up
thing you ever saw in a show?

668
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,660
Cause you're the drummer, you
get to see that he'd be, he sad,

669
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,620
your lead singer go to crowd surf and
just sort of disappear in the crowd and

670
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,110
the people can't find them and you
guys are looking at each other like,

671
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:12,160
how are we going to end this song?

672
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,420
You know, one of the most brutal
things I ever saw, it was,

673
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,340
I wasn't involved. I was
just a spectator. But um,

674
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,770
I was seeing,
I think it was with some,

675
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,000
it was some Mike Patton band who's he
look Melvin's or Fanta Moss or he's in

676
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:33,380
that dead crust now, right? Yeah. I got
to see them in Bartow. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

677
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,580
I can't remember who it was. Um, anyway,

678
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:41,320
they brought up like a jelaby off road
to like sing a song and he went to go

679
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,510
like, this is maybe five, 10 years ago.

680
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,420
And he went to go like state
like stage dive or whatever.

681
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,160
And it's the first step he took.
He said that on some girl's face.

682
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,870
Oh No. Then just ate shit
like, like family guy fall,

683
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:59,220
how it's like one frame and then
your arms are behind your back. Oh

684
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,920
Shit.
And it was just like,

685
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:06,160
took him like 10 minutes to get back
on stage and it was just like, oh,

686
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,390
what is the band doing where they
just blank kept playing and you know,

687
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:14,170
it was just like, oh God.
Brutal. So what do you do?

688
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:17,280
Does the guitar player play a
Solo? Like how do you eat? I mean,

689
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,690
I think they just kept, you
know, patent was up there.

690
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,250
I think they just kept like going,
you know,

691
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:23,950
and he eventually made his way back on
stage or whatever, but it was just like,

692
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,640
boom. It was like, whoa.
Oh yeah. Um, I mean,

693
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:32,170
maybe you like for me playing,
there's a drum cam video on, on,

694
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,390
on Youtube. I think it's the first thing
you saw of me. The, the volt, the Goliath.

695
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,820
Oh yeah. And I didn't understand
your technique. I'm like,

696
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:42,370
this guy's fucking arms are
going to fall off. Yeah, yeah.

697
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:46,690
Cause I was going ape shit and go
nuts and hitting super hard and um,

698
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,180
or it looks like it's hitting hard.
Um,

699
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,630
and one thing Cedric he used to love to
do is he would just like take my crash

700
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,890
cymbals away from me.
Like,

701
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,660
so there's a part in that video
where he just takes my crash, uh,

702
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:05,350
and I only have two. So he takes
my crash and then like, you know,

703
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,370
like basically just jumps on it,
uh,

704
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,070
and like throws it up and down and then
takes the symbol often stomps on it,

705
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:16,650
and then takes the cymbal stand and
throws it over my head and almost hit it,

706
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,820
takes out the camera. And
I'm like, this is the,

707
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,900
this was the first time he'd
ever done this. So like,

708
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,460
did you know that he did shit? Like, no,
no, I mean, not really. I don't think so.

709
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,590
Did you think it was
because of your playing? No,

710
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,900
he was just like rock and rock and roll,
you know,

711
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,980
like my fucking self esteem.
It'd be like, he hates me,

712
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,020
I'm getting fired and then it'd
be getting mad at me like, dude,

713
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,320
a fucking trash my shit. Well, I
did get mad eventually. Um, uh,

714
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,600
and my company was like, what
the fuck? Um, but anyway, yeah,

715
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,270
cause he had to keep sending you shit.
Yeah. They were like, Shit, what the fuck?

716
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:50,860
We send you symbols to play knock to get
broken by the lead singer, you know? So,

717
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,380
uh, so yeah, this is the
first time he ever did it.

718
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:55,600
So you can see me like turning
around to my tech, like,

719
00:40:55,601 --> 00:41:00,160
hey fucking give me another symbol and a
stand, like, come on dude. Like, and a,

720
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,550
and he's like, hold on a sec. You know,
and then, uh, and then he was just like,

721
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,440
I got to make sure and wait
until he's actually done.

722
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,000
I don't know how far he's going
to take this. Oh yeah, yeah, no,

723
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:11,500
they wait until he's out of that mood.
Yeah. And then he eventually, you know,

724
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,890
eventually brought another one
up and it was fine. But like, uh,

725
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,310
well not to get into the gossip, we, you
able to just kind of sit there and say,

726
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:22,870
hey buddy, I love being in the band man,
but I need my sympathy. I mean, it was,

727
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,840
I got to a certain point where I was
like, dude, like really? You know, like,

728
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,320
come on, cause he actually
plays drums too. I was like,
you know, you know how much,

729
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,170
you know, annoying that that would be
right. You know, he's like, Oh shit. Yeah,

730
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,730
you're right. Sorry man. Let's get
carried away. You know, I used to,

731
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,060
when I was five,
eight,

732
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,380
if I ever saw that on TV or if
I was in the crowd or whatever,

733
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,290
when I was a kid and I was
playing drums and everything,

734
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,670
I used to just be a tech to just give
it to me. Right, right. I need a simple,

735
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,430
totally need to sit there and
just break it in front of me.

736
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:51,560
It's just like I would have
loved to have had that. Yup.

737
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,970
Like when I ever watched like the
WHO or whatever. Yeah. And you know,

738
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,870
it's funny cause I don't know if they just
had like some piece of shit, you know,

739
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,860
the Japanese version of
the lesser or whatever.

740
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:04,240
Or if it was an actual one eat now,
like all those vintage instruments,

741
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:08,800
how much they're worth. Like I Pete
towns in his probably, you know, no,

742
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:11,770
my God,
probably seven figures and guitars.

743
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,260
Oh, at least. Yeah. Yeah. My Buddy,

744
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:20,020
my buddy Jerry plays with Dick Dale, you
know, and uh, he brings out this like,

745
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,410
I don't know what it is if it's like
an explorer or a Les Paul or something,

746
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:28,411
but it's like from the 50s and his amp
has also from the 50s and it's like that

747
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:32,020
shit's worth several hundred thousand
dollars and he tours with it.

748
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,053
It's crazy.

749
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,910
Well, yeah. And, and he's the guy
who did, who's to plays or frock,

750
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,900
but he plays like, Oh, right
handed guitar, lefty upside down.

751
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:42,070
It doesn't change the strings.

752
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,790
That sounds right to me. Yeah. He does
something super fucked up and weird. Yeah.

753
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,950
That's all that, that pulp fiction
song. Yup. That's it. Yeah. Okay.

754
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,290
Well where can people get this video?
They can go to my website,

755
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:58,420
[inaudible] dot com spell your name.
We're dumb dumb over here. L I, T,

756
00:42:58,421 --> 00:43:03,190
c h, Dave [inaudible] dot com. And you
can just click on instructional course.

757
00:43:03,191 --> 00:43:07,390
It'll pop up there and you
can get everything there.
It's just streaming and uh,

758
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,930
you know,

759
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,170
everybody does these sort of subscription
based courses now and then they just

760
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,320
take your money forever. Then I didn't
want to do that, so I'm like, you know,

761
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:17,800
you just pay for it once you stream
it forever, as long as you want.

762
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,040
I'm not going to charge your credit
card for seven years and you know,

763
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,220
like I don't want to do that. So, uh,

764
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,260
I've had a couple of those and
then you forget you have exactly.

765
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,900
Somebody is looking at your stuff going
like, dude, what the fuck is this dude?

766
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:32,290
I haven't tell you. I had, I had a
cell phone number for like 15 years.

767
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,460
Never used. Are you serious? Yeah. Like,

768
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:39,360
I was bitching to my wife
going like, uh, is that mine?

769
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,480
Oh, Siri, you know,
worse. Um, I was paying,

770
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,590
just seemed like a ton of money.
All of a sudden for my cell phone.

771
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:51,870
It just kept going up and up and up. I
said, I don't understand why I'm paying.

772
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,510
Why am I paying so much more than fuck?
It was going up to like fucking three,

773
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:59,460
400 bucks. Right. So she goes, let me
see it. And she looked at it. She goes,

774
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:03,900
all right, first of all, I think I had
three cell phone numbers. Why? Yeah,

775
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,170
she's looking at me. Yeah. Like,

776
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,580
like I got like fucking chicks on the
side and I'm like, no, I don't know.

777
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:13,530
We looked at up, all right, here's
what it was back in the day. Um,

778
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,510
when you were on the road,
you know,

779
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,870
you'd bring you your fucking
big thick laptop or whatever.

780
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,590
And all these hotel rooms were
charging anywhere from seven, 10,

781
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:24,540
$11 a day for the Internet.

782
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,440
So I went and I was working
places Tuesday through Sunday,

783
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:31,050
so it was like six times, you
know, 10, 11 bucks. It was like,

784
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,370
man with the tax has cost me
like $70 to be on the Internet.

785
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:40,180
So, uh, my buddy Robert
Kelly, right? He's like, dude,

786
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,290
you want to do a Gig?
He knows all the fucking technology goes.

787
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:46,840
Did you get the fucking, it's,
this was his hotspot thing.

788
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:48,420
So it had its own number.

789
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,920
You plugged it in to your computer
and blah, blah blah. Right.

790
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,960
So I tried to use it twice and it never
worked. Now says he's fucking digs,

791
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:58,920
never fucking work.

792
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,610
And I knew in the back of my head it's
like I gotta call these guys up and

793
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:07,320
cancel it or whatever. And I just, I just
never did. And I just forgot about it. Oh,

794
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,940
recently I actually founded, I still
have the thing. So that was one of them.

795
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:15,510
I forget what the other one was, but it
was like two things that were of that.

796
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,980
One was like a fax machine
number and the other one's like,

797
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:22,590
like all this outdated shit. So
she got, she got that taken off.

798
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:26,430
And then I think one time when I left
the country I switched my plan and they

799
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:28,540
didn't quite switch it back or something.
So now,

800
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:31,160
now it's down to like a buck 80 a month.
It was your,

801
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,450
was your mobile hotspot like the
size of this fridge? No, you know,

802
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,450
it was the size of a hockey puck.
I mean it was big,

803
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:40,280
was a big plastic thing and you just
had a, and you had to come up with a,

804
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,630
all this stuff that trips me up,
you know,

805
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,530
you got to come up with a password
and just like, oh, just a couple, two,

806
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:49,440
three of those hoops that I have to
jump through. But yeah, that's too much.

807
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:53,010
But I've been working on lately
though. Um, I remember seeing,

808
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,260
maybe I was watching one of the
interviews you did or whatever you said,

809
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:59,220
how you think everyone should have a
therapist if you just talk to somebody,

810
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,100
the world be a better place. Well, um,

811
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,610
I haven't gone to therapy
and like I finally, at one
point I was just going like,

812
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:08,440
dude, I'm always going to be fucked
up. I mean, I can sit here like, well,

813
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,140
I'm done talking about my childhood,

814
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,110
so I'm just going to be talking about
the dumb shit that happens every day.

815
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,420
I'm like, it was, it was Phil
started feeling a reality show,

816
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,420
but one on one reality show. But, um,

817
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,450
recently I've been really been working
on my not snapping over little things.

818
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,160
Uh,
and I,

819
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:29,520
I started to snap this morning for the
first time in like four days and it

820
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:34,110
actually felt a little
weird, but, um, I want,

821
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,230
I'm just gonna keep trying to do what I'm
doing with it and I keep talking about

822
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:40,290
it and loud, so I remember it
because, you know, it's like, Hey,

823
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:43,320
I'm going to go to the gym, you know,
and then that week you fucking crush it.

824
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,890
Next week you three quarters, he crushed
it. By a month later you've eating Oreos.

825
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,530
Sit on a couch. So what do
you, so what are you doing?

826
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:53,090
Like you just like breathe deeply years.
Like when you say Aye,

827
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,980
well, big thing is driving. Sure.
So when I get in the fucking car,

828
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:03,420
I just say like, uh, first of all, I
leave enough fucking time to get there.

829
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,820
I don't leave the utopia time.
This should take a half hour. Nope.

830
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,960
How dare these other people in front
of me have other plans in other lives.

831
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,790
So I leave plenty of time and then I,
it's just weird.

832
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,810
I drive slow, slow early. I'm probably
driving somebody nuts behind me.

833
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:25,850
I drive slower. I stop at yellow
lights. I let people go. I,

834
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,710
I chill out. I actually, uh, is another
thing. I swear to God, this is like,

835
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,830
they use this for premature ejaculation.
I'm actually using this.

836
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,040
I've listened to baseball.
He's day think I'll think about baseball.

837
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,150
I never understood that be,
if you don't want to fucking bus the nut.

838
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,680
I started thinking a fucking Carl
Yastrzemski now fucking get a hard dick

839
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,790
thinking about the fucking left field
or the red sox. And it's just confusing.

840
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:51,140
It's like, wait, am I
attracted to this guy? Um,

841
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,420
I just didn't feel like you were
present. Uh, sorry, I was busy.

842
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,490
I was thinking about fucking a
Jerry Remy. No, I put on like,

843
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,740
there's something about
smoking a cigar and listening,

844
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,020
listening to baseball on a radio.

845
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,910
It's like some old man shit and it's
slows life down. I don't know what it is.

846
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,250
So I uh,

847
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,880
I just have it on and they just have
a wonderful day for a ball game, man.

848
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,640
It's just crazy. The lineups, blah
blah blah blah blah. You know,

849
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:26,641
he's just extending is bratty of Aa
and you just sort of drift along.

850
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,960
And I just, and I just know and I
just, I don't have a hate saying this,

851
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:34,390
but you know that people always say like,
you know,

852
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,870
you got to give up like
expectations and shit. First of all,

853
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:42,190
I also like googled how to stop snapping
over little things in the first thing I

854
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:43,960
clicked on was this woman going,

855
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:47,110
did you ever hand is you have a blunt
in to say everything that I've done?

856
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,360
Like yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So she goes,

857
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:53,830
here's four techniques and I'm reading
this shit and I am like five minutes into

858
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:56,740
reading this and before she says,
you know,

859
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:59,310
I've been doing this for like
a week and I'm like, what?

860
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,930
Literally started snapping.

861
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,460
Like you don't change in
a week. Okay, this is,

862
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:13,840
this is going to take me. I just turned
50 this will take, if I work my ass off,

863
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:18,470
this will take all of my fifties
to not to not do that.

864
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,930
That's why I was joking
with a buddy of mine,

865
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,120
why one of the most realest characters
ever in any movie was was private hawks

866
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,840
in police academy.
Remember she was always held mousy.

867
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,360
That black girl hang and then
the end she'd be like, no.

868
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,480
And I remember joking, you know every
movie she'd go back to being mousy again.

869
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:40,810
She had the exact same character arc and
it's just like when does she, you know,

870
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:46,470
in reality is is that's what it's like
to try to change yourself as a person,

871
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,820
as you have, you know, fucking up,

872
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:51,700
fuck it up it up for 90 minutes
and then whatever or whatever.

873
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,180
How much time the move goes by in the
movie and then you had that breakthrough

874
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:59,500
moment and you don't move dirt bag and
then the next day you know you're going

875
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:03,150
to fall back again or maybe two days
later or whatever. So yeah, but that's,

876
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,220
that's the, but when you, you know,

877
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:11,221
if you continued to do that work on
yourself where you fall back isn't as far

878
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:17,200
down the ladder as you were
before. You know what I'm
saying? Yeah, no, no, I, yeah,

879
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,260
believe me dude,
like I'm,

880
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,400
I am committed to this because it's going
to make my relationship with my wife

881
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,300
so much better. I'm telling you, dude,

882
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:29,210
if I could just stop snapping at
little shit, dude, she's got nothing.

883
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,950
He's got a real motivation.
She's got nothing. No,

884
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,570
because what I'm still doing,
this is something else that I'm going to,

885
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,270
I'm starting to let go of is the way
when you were in a relationship with a

886
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,104
woman,

887
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,260
like thinking the way a guy thinks you
think I'm going to do this and then it's

888
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,950
to then it's den.

889
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:52,380
She's going to be happy with me and
she'll be in a good mood and then I'll,

890
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,870
the egg shells go away. Right.
And what you realize is that,

891
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:01,190
that that's yeah, you're chasing a
a, that it's like a Ponzi scheme.

892
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,730
Like there's, there's no meaning having
expectations for your actions is, ah,

893
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,450
no,
I just like,

894
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,330
okay,

895
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,530
I'm just always going to win.

896
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:16,531
Neuer inherently just because I'm a man
and I'm not going to see things the way

897
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:21,390
she does because she's a woman
and touching that and what,

898
00:51:21,391 --> 00:51:24,890
what she views as important
versus what I view as,

899
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,630
or she views is not a big deal. And I
think is a big deal is not going to Mesh.

900
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,750
Not because she's a bad
person or I'm a bad person,

901
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,550
it's just because we are
wired differently. And uh,

902
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,580
so I forget something happened

903
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,660
just this morning and I started to
get upset and I was just like, well,

904
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,910
why would I think that she would blah,
blah, blah. And it just fucking went away.

905
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,640
That's great.
So I kicked,

906
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,980
but I'm afraid of this because now I'm
filling in which to become this spineless

907
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:56,380
guy or hell, you know, sitting
there holding her purse.

908
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,630
You know what I talk about
the same shit I have with my,

909
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,280
with my therapist a bunch of times.
Uh,

910
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,450
because coming with not even necessarily
talking about that specific thing as a

911
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:08,481
human being,

912
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:12,950
but talking about that specific thing as
being the source of your creativity in

913
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:15,260
some way. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like

914
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,660
now there's, there, there is a thing
with comedians. What's a, if I get happy,

915
00:52:18,661 --> 00:52:21,420
I won't be fun anymore.
Which is what musicians too.

916
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,620
It's a huge myth because I'll
tell you why. What happens is,

917
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:30,030
is like once you get everything
you want, you know, as far as like,

918
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:34,040
you found love and you have the kid and
your kid comes home is going. Dot, dot,

919
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:38,640
dot, dot. Big Smile students. The fucking
greatest, greatest fucking thing ever.

920
00:52:38,641 --> 00:52:41,340
It's one of the few things in the
world that lives up to the hype, right?

921
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,270
Other than downloading your
fucking video, boom, Bam.

922
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,500
Cross promoting. Um, what uh,

923
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,770
what replaces all your angsty Lolita is
sort of sleeping on a futon and shit.

924
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,910
Is this new fear of that you're
now going to lose it all?

925
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,360
Like what if something happens?
Like I can't tell you since having a kid,

926
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:04,470
like any new scenario like, hey, I'm
going to go take her on the swing.

927
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,240
Like immediately this horror movie
that Steven King could not fuck with.

928
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,760
Oh, maybe that maybe he has kids
or something. That's how he writes.

929
00:53:11,761 --> 00:53:16,440
But like the shit that goes through
your head about the possible stuff that

930
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:20,490
would happen. And always in the end I'm
either murdering a person or an animal,

931
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,170
one or the other.
Dude,

932
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:30,171
I've actually had fantasies of jumping
down on a cougars back in somehow I know

933
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:34,560
that UFC move where your choke it out
and I wrapped my legs around its belly so

934
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:35,460
it can't claw me.

935
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,110
And I sit there while I'm
eating a sandwich thinking
of all of this because my

936
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:44,010
wife said that she's going to like
just take her out in the backyard,

937
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,610
um, turns into a Joe Rogan episode. Yeah.

938
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,670
Yeah. So all of that. And then
like those fucking crazy thoughts,

939
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:58,580
we'll then we'll then fuel your,
um, your act hopefully. So. Um,

940
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,530
and he goes, well, I have to, I got to
read a little bit of advertising. Okay,

941
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,290
you want to see some comedy
here? Um, once again,

942
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,790
my apologies to the Special Smith.
I feel so fucking bad about that.

943
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,900
And I told,

944
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,890
I told the singer I'd throw a couple of
concent form and then I called his pant,

945
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:17,490
the smiths, and then I had all these
fucking mopey Morrissey people.

946
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,840
He left at Penn 30 years ago.
Man,

947
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,100
they're never getting backed
in other people freaking out.

948
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,260
Did they get back together? Like I
caused like this whole fucking thing.

949
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,140
I feel like such a f

950
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:34,120
by the way. You're, you're, you need to
film like a video of your Morrissey dance.

951
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,510
Oh, the Morrissey dance. Oh
yeah. Have you done that yet? No,

952
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:40,450
I got to get it down better. It's one
of my favorite things I've ever seen.

953
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:42,230
I don't dislike more soon.
I just made,

954
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,670
I like irritating people that are really
into shit. Like star wars fans. Oh,

955
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,880
I saw them. I saw one, I saw one
of the newer, newer star wars ones.

956
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,370
It was fucking great.
It was actually really good.

957
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,850
Now that it's not like a muppet movie.
There was two, like it was like,

958
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:00,190
it was like muppets with space
and then some bad self help.

959
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,590
You know, this guy's good. He's in
the league, his light sabers, blue

960
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,140
dude.
I think star wars is great,

961
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,850
but when people like make their
lives revolve around it, I just,

962
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,310
it's like there's so much other
shit out there in the world.

963
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,730
That's why people don't like baby
boomers because baby boomers,

964
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,420
like they just make so much about what
they grew up in and fucking all the stuff

965
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:21,900
they did.

966
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,040
If they just fucking just did what they
did and just shut the fuck up about it

967
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,470
and let them other generations
realize how cool they were,

968
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,870
they would have been fine. Um, all right.

969
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:33,270
I got to read a couple of these
things here. All right. Okay.

970
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,970
Bill stitch fix sent you
close while you were in Paris.

971
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:39,120
They're actually really normal and
wearable and much better than the other

972
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:42,840
clothing companies we've had. I probably
shouldn't read that out loud. All right.

973
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,733
This is going to be,

974
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,680
I guess these guys make really
normal wearable clothes. Okay.

975
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,690
Did you hear that? That was the
sound of money going out the door.

976
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,900
Stitch fix everybody a convenience
stitch fix understands that Louie,

977
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:03,120

978
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:06,600
Stitch fix understands that
life gets busy. So tell,

979
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,010

980
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,580
and your personal stylists will pick
out clothing for you based on your

981
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:18,540
preferences. Try before buying. If an
item doesn't fit or you don't like it,

982
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,230
no worries.
Just send it back free of charge.

983
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,710
No clue what you did in those clothes.

984
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,830
They must have a giant washing
machine that it just goes in.

985
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:31,600
Some guy in a hazmat suit shows up style.
Some of us habits, some of the stone,

986
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:35,170
but just because a sense of style seems
elusive for some doesn't mean it's

987
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:36,940
impossible to entertain a,

988
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,310
there's no time like the
present to discovered the style.

989
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:43,900

else's talent and you can with a little

help from our friends at stitch fix that.
It's not somebody else's town.

991
00:56:47,181 --> 00:56:49,660

eighties movie where they do like a

992
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:51,810

998
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:10,990

1000
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:18,790

1005
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:32,260

the best things I ever did,

1053
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:25,120
it was getting life insurance. Oh
yeah, I have it too. It's like the,

1054
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:29,510
isn't it like a relief? My uncle works
for farmers and he was like, dude,

1055
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:33,230
you got to get it. Like let me hook it
up. And it was super cheap. Yeah, breezy.

1056
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,450
Yeah. When you're young. Yeah, I
didn't, when I was old they were like,

1057
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:40,160
how old are you? He smokes cigars.
Occasionally we'll give you the old guy,

1058
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:43,460
occasional fee. Here's supposed to say
no, no, I know. But now what they do,

1059
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:47,390
they literally, they fucking,
they take your blood now,
right? I know. And they, yeah,

1060
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:50,150
you so you can lie all you want. They're
going to find out what you're doing.

1061
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,810
I say admit to more
shit that you're doing.

1062
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:56,360
So they don't take your blood and
figured out what you're actually doing or

1063
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,940
they're like, oh, it's not that bad
considering all this other shit.

1064
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:00,770
And you've been doing whatever.

1065
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,730
But I just liked the fact that when I
die that everybody's going to be taken

1066
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:08,450
care of. And it's not going to be like,
you know, I've had buddies of mine die,

1067
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,250
you know, unexpectedly, you know, my age,

1068
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:13,790
it's unexpected and your
affairs are not an order.

1069
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,600
And then it's the double whammy.
Yup. Where you know, it's the,

1070
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,640
you're no longer there.
And then people are like,

1071
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:20,840
how the fuck are we going to live?

1072
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:24,050
How are we going to pay the rent and
take care of every? And that's sad,

1073
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:27,560
but you know, it isn't sad. Is
that joy of your new drum video.

1074
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,800

1075
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:34,040
I'm so happy for you because for the
longest time I've been telling you with

1076
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:37,370
your skills to utilize the internet,
get out there,

1077
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:40,780
especially because you got something
to say and all that. And uh,

1078
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,530
I am thrilled for you and I hope this
podcast can help blow up the video because

1079
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,180
you're the fucking man. Because I
sucked at drums and I'm a comedian.

1080
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:52,610
I've actually had people come
up to me and say, you know,

1081
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:55,990
I've gotten to the point where people
come up to me. Yeah. That wasn't that bad.

1082
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,300
And before it was bad,
it was definitely a dude.

1083
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:05,830
That video where you were at
Dean's birthday was fucking
crushing. Uh, oh my God.

1084
01:02:05,831 --> 01:02:09,850
Dude, that was so much fun. Yeah.
Yeah. The fuck out of everything.

1085
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,030
That's what it's all about, man.
You know. Oh yeah, that was,

1086
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,860
yeah. I gotta be honest with you. Like
those, those fucking, all of those things.

1087
01:02:17,861 --> 01:02:19,890
When Krishna hooked me up
and I got the jams. Yeah.

1088
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,480
A couple of those guys know those rice
stuff and slap, I mean, just like,

1089
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,493
um,

1090
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,940
those things are the biggest of anything
I've ever done in this business.

1091
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,590
Um, those are the biggest, those have been
the play with fucking Nikki Sixx. Yeah.

1092
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,990
Dude, that's fucking ridiculous.
Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah,

1093
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:43,190
because I really didn't earn it.
That's what I,

1094
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,960
cause I always feel like with stand up
as much as, you know, doing Letterman,

1095
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:49,140
the HBO special dudes like that,
it's like I did the hell gigs.

1096
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:50,760
Like I fucking earned it.

1097
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:54,960
And the cracker barrel at three in
the morning and Nebraska or whatever.

1098
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:58,500
But there's these drum and gigs. It's not
like I had to audition. It's just like,

1099
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,680
oh, that guy's funny. I'll
play a song with them.

1100
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,330
I'm sick of the guys in my band. Get up
their freckles. Let's see what you can do.

1101
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,700
All right. That's the Thursday afternoon

1105
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,830

And, and one more thing. Yeah.

1106
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:26,170
I can't imagine you had a fucking student
more difficult than meet the fucking

1107
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,100
teach. Oh, I definitely have believed in
that. Right? I don't say anything. Um,

cuts and I'll see you on Monday.

1116
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,233
Okay.

1117
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,900
[inaudible]

1118
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,370
what's going on?
It's Gilbert,

1119
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,940
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

1120
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:57,040
June 28th,
2010 right off the bat.

1121
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,780
You should be thinking,
you know what, Bill,

1122
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,730
there's something weird with your voice.

1123
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:06,130
Why does it sound like you're whispering?
Because I am fucking whispering.

1124
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:10,000
You're fucking Douche bag.
Why don't you go with your gut?

1125
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,780
You know, didn't you fucking brain
just tell you that I was whispering?

1126
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:20,140
Did your parents beat you down mentally
that bad? That you literally question

1127
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:25,490
what that fucking voice in in Saudi
was even saying. That's the voice.

1128
01:06:25,491 --> 01:06:30,491
It makes you fucking when you go on a
hike and if that little voice in he has

1129
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,090
gone. Is there a mountain lion
staring at me? Yes, there is run.

1130
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,030
All right.
Um,

1131
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:42,410
I'm whispering because I'm doing this
fucking thing at eight 20 in the morning,

1132
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:44,210
my girlfriend is sleeping
in the other room.

1133
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,800
I take this fucking thing last night,
but for some reason I screwed up.

1134
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:50,780
Okay.

1135
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:53,600
And it didn't record 50 minutes.

1136
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,920
I fucking did it and I was going to upload
it at midnight, just like last week.

1137
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,200
Okay.
And just like last week,

1138
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,460
I am once again Douche bag
of the week back to back,

1139
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:10,040
just like the Lakers and my douchebag.
Two years in a fucking row,

1140
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:14,930
uh, two weeks in a row, I should say
her two times in a row, whatever.

1141
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:16,430
You know the analogy I'm trying to

1142
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:20,690
let you guys know that I'm a
fucking idiot when it comes to this,

1143
01:07:20,691 --> 01:07:23,660
the past two weeks and kind of
try and trash the Lakers anyways,

1144
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:25,880
but they don't give a fuck.
They got their rings right.

1145
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,760
You know what a wonderful organization,

1146
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,260
they actually had to switch their parade
route because they're stupid fans were

1147
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:36,650
riding so much bunch of fucking animals.

1148
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:41,840
Eric, Billy, ever going to let the
Lakers Celtics series go? You know what?

1149
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:46,010
I don't think I'm gonna.
I'm reminded of it constantly.

1150
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:50,330
Like I started watching World Cup soccer
and watching all those fucking people

1151
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:51,860
flopping around on the ground.

1152
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:56,960
Anytime anybody kicked it back of their
socks reminded me of watching Pau Gasol

1153
01:07:56,961 --> 01:08:00,350
play basketball, the
fucking flopping. Fag.

1154
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,700
All right, let's not be this angry.
You can't be angry in whisper.

1155
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,140
Ever seen that?
You've see a couple fight in public.

1156
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,550
They do that angry whispering.
That's not what he said. You know,

1157
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,240
Goddamn well what the fuck's on right
here? No kill. Shut the fuck up.

1158
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,470
That's what I'm going to
be doing. So anyways, um,

1159
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,610
I actually did the podcast
last night already and uh,

1160
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,090
fighting through,
I was like sweating.

1161
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,810
I was so god damn sick.
I did Vegas this weekend.

1162
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,570
I performed at the Orleans casino.

1163
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,910
Now few standup nerds out there or fee
fans of the podcast who listen every week

1164
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:44,630
you read, you know that the
Orleans casino was the last place.

1165
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:49,130
George Carlin did a stand
up before he died. So, uh,

1166
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,040
I went there and I asked
them a ton of questions.

1167
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,770
People who work there with totally cool.

1168
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:00,290
Even one of the guys was actually telling
me how Carlin put together as hours of

1169
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:01,970
material.
You know,

1170
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:06,920
how he would come in and it would be
like an hour and 20 minutes and before a

1171
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:07,700
special huge,

1172
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,480
he'd watch them whittle it down and by
the end of the weekend it would be the

1173
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,040
AEC an hour right on the nose.

1174
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,470
Gave me chills listening to it and
also made me really feel like, uh,

1175
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:22,880
I need to start working harder as a
fucking comedian. And, uh, someone,

1176
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:26,840
they're also gave me a, a ticket stub
from his last show was fucking awesome,

1177
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:32,120
but I made the mistake. I, um,

1178
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:36,030
the Orleans Orleans casino is actually
off the strip. It's kind of cool.

1179
01:09:36,031 --> 01:09:40,980
So my hotel room at a view
of the entire Strip and, uh,

1180
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:45,230
I would have been content to just stay
out there at the Orleans casino cause I

1181
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:49,550
liked it. I liked the vibe. The
crowd was a little bit older as am I,

1182
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,950
you know, so there wasn't a
lot of craziness going on.
It was just straight up,

1183
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:59,660
let's booze, let's eat,
let's gamble. You know,

1184
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:05,210
I wasn't a bunch of people fucking,
you know, in Alec, a Gaggle,

1185
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:08,130
a chick screaming out the
sunroof of a fucking limb out.

1186
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,470
You know, we got a lemma
beaches in Al, you know,

1187
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:17,630
everybody tags everything
with bitch nowadays.

1188
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:22,730
Is that from the Rick James Sketch?
I'm Rick James Bitch.

1189
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,470
Then everything became bitch,

1190
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:29,360
whatever long fucking story.
You know what I'm doing right now,

1191
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:32,240
I'm looking at my laptop and
the screen saver just has all,

1192
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:37,300
all the albums on my iTunes or all the
albums that don't really fucking exist.

1193
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,230
The covers to the digital
singles that I downloaded.

1194
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,130
I'm actually looking at one that
says Elvis speaking of Las Vegas.

1195
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:48,980
And I came out to uh,

1196
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,430
to LVC entire weekend.
I had to do it.

1197
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:56,840
I came out to that song that's used to
be cute and now I realize that it's about

1198
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:59,660
stocking someone you know,

1199
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,210
has a fucking song go had in the kitchen,

1200
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:06,180
had in the hall and gonna
do you any good it out?

1201
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,900
It was one side something man.

1202
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:13,130
The kids in start a team allowed
Hawes is good and Tamar us apart.

1203
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,940
It's like really? Elvis does. Does
the woman have any say in that?

1204
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:19,440
Okay,

1205
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,170
I'm going to fuck and Zaha I'm Volvo.
But Elba.

1206
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,440
Yeah. Stuck on you. Stuck on
you. You would think that, uh,

1207
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:33,140
that with them, it's a guy in love.
But if you really listen to the lyrics,

1208
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:33,520
it isn't,

1209
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,520
it's a guy who can't accept the fact that
the relationship is over and her mind

1210
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:40,010
and she wants to move on.

1211
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:41,910
Okay.

1212
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,560
Eh, you know, hey, he just

1213
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,700
won't fucking leave her alone.
It keeps pressing his sweaty out of shape,

1214
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,860
iconic stomach up against
her as he kisses her.

1215
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,750
I mean,
that's what I got out of it,

1216
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:00,770
but it was a great sign to come
out to nonetheless. So anyways,

1217
01:12:00,771 --> 01:12:03,870
you probably asking, hey
bill, you whisper douche.

1218
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,980
How did you get sick?
I don't really know,

1219
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,930
but I know who I'm going to blame it
on. How about that? I was fucking, uh,

1220
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,520
like I said, I was content to stay
off the Strip at the Orleans casino,

1221
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,770
you know, but I brought my girlfriend,
so you know what that means.

1222
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,540
They want to do stuff.

1223
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,080
Yeah,

1224
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,130
that's counter this strip.
I heard they had some stores.

1225
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,140
They are stewards on the strip.

1226
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:37,940
Let's go to the Strip and go to the store
and see where to go to the stores and

1227
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:41,160
the Strip a sweetie.
Sweetie,

1228
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:43,250
do you want to go to the
stores on this strip? Okay.

1229
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:48,330
No, of course. I don't. Why know?
Why would I want to do that?

1230
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,370
If I had something I needed to buy, I
would go, but I doubt I don't want to go.

1231
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,220
Yeah.
But I fucking learned.

1232
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:01,780
I've learned to get through
the fucking relationship.

1233
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,200
You got to say yes to some shit.
You don't want to fucking do.

1234
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:10,780
So I go, yeah, yeah. Let's go to the
fucking stores on the Strip. Right.

1235
01:13:10,781 --> 01:13:14,890
So we fucking go out there and uh,
you know,

1236
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:20,110
we go into all these fucking stores.
I noticed those really high end stores.

1237
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,580
When you go into them,

1238
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,720
they only have like 40
pieces is they call them.

1239
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,320
You don't, it's very, it's now
like when you go into old navy

1240
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:37,290
a, what's waist size area? We
got a hundred of that. You know,

1241
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,110
we get a hundred every fucking size and
their stack from the floor up to the

1242
01:13:41,111 --> 01:13:42,130
goddamn ceiling.

1243
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,570
And we got that ladder at fucking
slides right across the wall.

1244
01:13:46,571 --> 01:13:49,580
That's how much product we have in here.
And that's just the goddamn change.

1245
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:52,270
And you know why?
Cause they're 30 bucks a whack,

1246
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:57,520
but you go into those fucking high end
places and it stops being jeans and

1247
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:59,740
dresses.
It starts being called pieces.

1248
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,550
Yeah.

1249
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:05,870
And all of a sudden there's like 28
things and there's a ton of space and

1250
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:07,040
everybody in those stores,

1251
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:10,220
it looks like Mike Myers and that
fucking sketchy used to do, you know,

1252
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:15,250
re danced like the fucking German guy
who liked to get shit on sprocket or some

1253
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:17,301
shit.

1254
01:14:17,301 --> 01:14:20,620
And I came out with the fuck name was
stressed all in black and he put his hands

1255
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:24,010
on his hips and he only moved his legs.

1256
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:26,650
Can you guys hear that person?

1257
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:28,900
There's somebody giggling
like a maniac downstairs.

1258
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,340
The person moved out downstairs,
not the old guy.

1259
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,890
My apartment's over two
different apartments.

1260
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,780
It's a little fucking spread out.
So anyways,

1261
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:45,110
we start going to those God damn shops.
Long story short,

1262
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:49,140
I got to actually admit a Louis
Vuitton when you go in there. Uh,

1263
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,820
I really liked their luggage van.
That luggage is fucking insane.

1264
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:58,880
Like it's handcrafted. Say No,
I lied that, you know, look
at that handcrafted. Yeah.

1265
01:14:58,881 --> 01:15:02,780
Some guy took a hammer and nails on the
inside, look at that craftsman ship,

1266
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:04,631
you know,

1267
01:15:04,631 --> 01:15:09,240
and they have an old Louis Vuitton trunk
from like the early 19 hundreds and

1268
01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:10,650
it's still functional. You know, why?

1269
01:15:10,651 --> 01:15:15,450
Cause it was made by hand using great
materials. So I was like, you know what,

1270
01:15:15,451 --> 01:15:19,110
I liked his shit. I like,
it wasn't made by a machine.

1271
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:20,880
It was made by a human being.

1272
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:26,120
So I asked him the smallest
fucking piece of luggage they had,

1273
01:15:27,271 --> 01:15:30,240
which I guess would be considered
kind of like a jewelry box.

1274
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:37,430
And I asked him how much it was
and they were like $4,000 and a,

1275
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:42,690
I did the Eddie Murphy in Beverly
Hills Cop, you know, you know,

1276
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,500
I just totally played it off like I
could afford it as that guy has. Great,

1277
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:48,030
you know? Okay. Now.

1278
01:15:48,031 --> 01:15:51,480
Why don't you close up this handcrafted
thing and put it back up on the fucking

1279
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:52,314
shelf?

1280
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,820
I was actually pissed
afterwards for grant.

1281
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:00,970
They fucking look me right in the eye
when they said four grand for gray.

1282
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,680
You look at the fucking floor when you
throw a goddamn number up like that

1283
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,220
should be ashamed of yourself
charging that much fucking money.

1284
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,760
I don't understand.

1285
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,710
Do you know how fucking rich you'd have
to be to buy a $4,000 fucking jewelry

1286
01:16:16,711 --> 01:16:17,544
box?

1287
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,160
Okay,

1288
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,010
Jesus Christ. Most people, their
jewelry isn't worth that much

1289
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,660
and then where the fuck do you take it?

1290
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:29,410
That's the thing about buying really
nice clothes and really nice stuff.

1291
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,840
I got my legs crossed right now
and I'm swinging my foot around.

1292
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:35,800
The fuck is wrong with me. She caught
myself on a really a feminist moment,

1293
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,930
whatever I'm allowed on a um,

1294
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,690
what? What the fuck are you going
to do? Like someone will like,

1295
01:16:46,691 --> 01:16:47,770
that's when you know you're rich.

1296
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:50,900
When summer will mug you not
for what's in your luggage,

1297
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,350
still just mug you for
your fucking luggage.

1298
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:59,790
You know, when I go to do
the David Letterman program,

1299
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:02,430
I go always go out and I
buy a nice God damn suit.

1300
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,190
I always lose money
whenever I do that show,

1301
01:17:05,191 --> 01:17:08,880
but I'm not going out there looking
like a bum and I love the suits and I

1302
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:14,150
wearing them. But the second you put them
on your freaking out like Oh my God, ah,

1303
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,850
anything that you go to brush
up against you freak out

1304
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,500
because it's an expensive God damn suit
as opposed to when you shop at old navy

1305
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,520
in the gap,

1306
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,160
you know the Anti Pussy
where that they sell.

1307
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,880
I wouldn't give a shit if I was
walking through a fucking pig sty.

1308
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,960
I mean I freak all my God
pig shit. Oh God. Okay.

1309
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:44,690
I'm wearing gap jeans. I've never
wore gap jeans. I would never do that.

1310
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,790
Do you know there was a
kid in my high school,

1311
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:50,300
his nickname was the gap nerd
and he'd, he, he, he had no idea.

1312
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,080
People use, no one said to his
face because he was a bigger guy,

1313
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:58,670
but he always wore a gap jeans
and he wasn't even that big of a nerd,

1314
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:04,430
but he always talked to shirts in
cause it was the 80s and a yeah,

1315
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:05,570
they called them the gap nerd

1316
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:13,010
and that was the end of his pussy getting
career. He had no idea, had no idea

1317
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,700
she had to deal with his big six foot,

1318
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:21,930
four inch fucking red corduroy gap jeans,

1319
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,700
big stupid tag on the back gap.

1320
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:31,080
It's like don't you notice that
everybody else's says Levi Strauss.

1321
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,060
That's what you want to have on.

1322
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,590
And then the couple of kids whose
dads have mafioso connections,

1323
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:41,820
there's actually actually
have guests jeans, you know,

1324
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:47,610
which in my world was chick
jeans back then. Um, anyways,

1325
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:50,310
I'm getting off the fucking beaten
track. So anyways, so we will look,

1326
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:53,010
we're going through all these,
these high end fucking stores.

1327
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,830
I went into the Tom Ford store,

1328
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,980
some of the most beautiful
suits have ever seen in my life.

1329
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,500
Also some of the most expensive,
but you get caught up in it.

1330
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:09,000
I was actually in there because Tom Ford,

1331
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:12,210
his entire line is not just the line,

1332
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:17,240
it's like a lifestyle and it's like
dead dull [inaudible] beer guy.

1333
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:22,770
Stay thirsty. My friends, it's
like Steve McQueen man's man.

1334
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:25,500
They had a fucking raw,

1335
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,480
a cigar cutter cutter made
out of like a fucking,

1336
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:32,190
I was going to say a rhino horn.
It wasn't,

1337
01:19:32,191 --> 01:19:35,700
it was an ox horn and
ox horn cigar cutter.

1338
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:39,120
One of the most manliest
fucking things I've ever seen.

1339
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:43,650
And I'm actually thinking about buying it.
I'm holding this fucking ox horn.

1340
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:48,600
Yeah. Now they had a ram horn
cigarette lighter. I'm not even lying.

1341
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:53,000
I'm not even joking. I'm actually
considering buying this fucking thing.

1342
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,520
Fortunately I walked out of the store,
you know,

1343
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,370
and by 10 minutes went by

1344
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:06,310
and then I just kinda had like that
little fucking gut check moment there,

1345
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,000
whatever. Kind of looking
at myself like, dude,

1346
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:13,170
did you almost just by a fucking
[inaudible] Garth cutter.

1347
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,910
Did you really? Almost too. Did you,

1348
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:18,870
did you get that fucking caught up and
that bullshit? It's like, yeah, I did.

1349
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:23,610
Couple of things kept snapping
me back into reality. Um,

1350
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:25,681
I don't like my,

1351
01:20:25,681 --> 01:20:29,880
I don't like buying shit made out of
animals unless it's a leather jacket.

1352
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:32,160
It's just a stupid cow
ate hamburgers anyways.

1353
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:35,790
It'd be fucking hypocritical when
it fucking cows already dead.

1354
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,660
Why don't we go to the native American
route and use up this whole fucking cow?

1355
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,090
Yeah.

1356
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:44,580
You know,
but I don't eat ox,

1357
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:49,210
although I did go to a Mario Batali
restaurant one time and I got an oxtail

1358
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:51,750
fucking stew or something. I can't
even remember what the fell it was,

1359
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:56,400
but it was delicious. Um, but anyway,
since she's just no fucking need,

1360
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,100
unless the ox was already
dead and you're like,

1361
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:01,890
well we might as well sof,

1362
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,470
it's fucking horns and turned
it into a cigar cutter.

1363
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:09,950
Anyway, so we get out of that
thing and speaking of fucking cows,

1364
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:11,740
yeah.

1365
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:16,330
So I dunno, my girls like, let's go
get something to eat. And I said,

1366
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:20,650
all right, there's a fucking
Mcdonald's right there. And she's like,

1367
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:25,720
do you want to eat there? And Soda was
looking down at the ground, all sad,

1368
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:31,180
you know, just doing that classic
female manipulation thing.

1369
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,840
She knew I wanted to eat there.
I just said there's a Mcdonald's there.

1370
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,090
And then why would she say,

1371
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:40,300
do you want to eat there
and look down at the ground?

1372
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:44,920
This question is for all the young male
listeners. If my whispering podcast,

1373
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,800
why would a female do
that? Do, do, do, do,

1374
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:54,160
do. I'll tell you why.
Because she doesn't want,

1375
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:56,290
if not only does she not
want to fucking eat there,

1376
01:21:56,530 --> 01:22:00,020
she already has a place where
she wants to eat. She's our,

1377
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,610
she's already had this
place that she's wanting,

1378
01:22:02,611 --> 01:22:06,520
wanting to eat it for probably a
month before you ever went to Vegas.

1379
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:11,230
But she's not going to tell you about
it because if she tells you about it,

1380
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:15,130
they'd give you time to do research on
it and find out how fucking expensive it

1381
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:19,360
was. So she's like, do you want to
eat? And she looks down at the ground.

1382
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:22,780
So immediately, despite the fact
that I know all this about females,

1383
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:27,190
I take the bait. Why? Where
do you want to eat sweetheart?

1384
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,920
Um, there's this burger place at
Mandalay bay. I heard it with Israeli.

1385
01:22:32,921 --> 01:22:37,460
Nice. Do you ever watch top chef? Uh,

1386
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,330
only when you're watching it,
sweetheart. I don't like that show.

1387
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,580
Fucking show is annoying. I hate when the
shift starts screaming at those people.

1388
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:52,190
It's fucking foreign accent. He called
dead a fucking grilled cheese sandwich.

1389
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:57,980
Get the fucker in my kitchen. Hey. Hey,
you think I'm fucking afraid of you?

1390
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:02,750
You fucking Dosha. You got a fucking
problem with my grilled cheese sandwich.

1391
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,220
You come up like a fucking
gentleman and you take me aside.

1392
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:09,940
Don't fucking be screaming at me.
Why get these fucking knives in my hand?

1393
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:14,140
Stick it right to your goddamn trachea
when you think about that. Huh?

1394
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,570
I'll give you a fucking blow hole right
out the front of your fucking neck.

1395
01:23:19,571 --> 01:23:24,571
Get out of my goddamn face before I take
you by your fucking hair and Moshe face

1396
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:28,900
into this pile of shrimp. Huh? That
I haven't taken the shells off.

1397
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:33,010
So I'll give you a bunch of
little razor cuts. Sorry.

1398
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,950
Could you actually smell there's
somebody there. You know,

1399
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:39,580
I used to work in a restaurant where,
uh, I worked the mesquite grill.

1400
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:44,440
I worked in a fancy restaurant called
the sable cafe and Cary North Carolina,

1401
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,790
very short lived.

1402
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:51,880
It was supposed to be five star dining
yet they had me working on a mesquite

1403
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:52,240
grill.

1404
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:57,240
Glassed in with a big chef hat is all
these fucking people will be looking at

1405
01:23:57,851 --> 01:24:00,250
me,
you know,

1406
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:03,250
and I had to cook up all this
shit and I was done, you know,

1407
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,010
burgers front bro Sheds
to chicken sandwiches,

1408
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,950
whatever the fuck we will make
in the swordfish specials.

1409
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,930
And then I turned around,

1410
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:15,130
there was a little window and I'd hand
it to the fucking Metallica fan who I

1411
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:18,340
worked with who had a stick his hair
up in the hat with his pre pubescent

1412
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:23,341
fucking mustache even though he was 19
that was a funny thing about that job is

1413
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:28,030
I'd be sitting there looking at all these
quote on quote elegant people in Cary,

1414
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:31,930
North Carolina and then I'd look through
the little port hole where I would

1415
01:24:31,931 --> 01:24:36,640
stick the food through to give to
the fucking drug addicts on the lie.

1416
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,780
I remember who, they had a guy back
there who was on a work release program.

1417
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,420
Like at night he was in jail,

1418
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:47,080
but it during the day he cooked
at this fucking restaurant.

1419
01:24:47,081 --> 01:24:48,400
This guy was a douchebag.

1420
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:50,280
Okay.

1421
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,730
And one time we went, we were on
our way to going out of business.

1422
01:24:53,731 --> 01:24:56,100
So at one time I was
literally the grill chef,

1423
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:58,770
the busboy and a dishwasher.

1424
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:03,060
Let's not even get involved in the amount
of fucking health code violations that

1425
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:04,570
they're involved in there.
Cause I would,

1426
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:07,590
I did not have time to wash my
fucking hands, put it that way.

1427
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:13,260
Um,
so one day we were slammed,

1428
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:18,090
I'm in back going, hey, we need
some more glasses. You know,

1429
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:23,091
because we were running low on glasses
and the fucking Douche on the work

1430
01:25:23,341 --> 01:25:27,750
release program goes, well,
why don't we wash some Aha,

1431
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:31,650
a novel idea,
you know,

1432
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:36,900
like he's fucking intelligent
or something. Ah, a novel idea.

1433
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,370
It was only because the guy was,

1434
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:45,390
was in fucking prison that I
didn't say anything to him.

1435
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,810
He had that sort of credibility. But
looking back, he was a fucking pussy.

1436
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,920
God Damn Little Shit.
He wasn't even that tall.

1437
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,450
And this is back in the day though,

1438
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:59,040
when you weren't that tall and if you
weren't that tall, you weren't that tough.

1439
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,260
You were tough for a little guy,
but you were still a little guy.

1440
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,570
This is before Jujitsu had made
it to America. There was no UFC,

1441
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:10,370
you know,
remember the first fucking UFC and hoists,

1442
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:14,330
Gracie kept fighting all those big guys
and you think that he's about ready to

1443
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:16,970
get punched in the chest and
the fucking face or whatever.

1444
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:20,450
And then all of a sudden he grabbed
that little finger and bend it back and

1445
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:23,060
whatever the fuck he was, he didn't know
what he was doing. It was like magic.

1446
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:24,570
Okay.

1447
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:27,010
He was like, oh, that little guy's
going to get the shit kicked out of him.

1448
01:26:27,011 --> 01:26:31,660
And the other guy would be like, I
ran a a ride or rhetoric. So, um,

1449
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:34,503
yeah.

1450
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:36,223
Isn't that hilarious?

1451
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,610
There's nothing worse than taking shit
from somebody and you don't give him shit

1452
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:43,090
back because you know why?
Because 23 fucking later years later,

1453
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,040
it's still bugs Ya.

1454
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:45,590
Okay,

1455
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:48,110
you guys hit it. There's a,
there's a great one. If you
guys want it, you want to,

1456
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:52,150
you want to, why the fuck is
the word I'm trying to say here?

1457
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,610
If you want to participate in the podcast,
what's the law?

1458
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,120
I want to find out what the longest like
who the oldest person is on my podcast.

1459
01:27:00,121 --> 01:27:02,880
What's the longest you've held
on to some shit. All right.

1460
01:27:02,881 --> 01:27:07,881
There's one that was from 1987
88 at least 22 fucking years ago.

1461
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,370
It still bugs me every once in a while.
Just pop in my head.

1462
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:12,730
Yeah.

1463
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:16,630
Well, why don't we watch some
glasses are a novel idea.

1464
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,400
Yeah.

1465
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:18,760
Hey,

1466
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,910
why don't we not live a life of fucking
crimes so we don't have to go to jail?

1467
01:27:21,911 --> 01:27:23,260
You fucking piece of shit.

1468
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,540
You know the fuck did you do to get in
jail? You dumb fucking idiot. You do.

1469
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,690
I bet you one of those guys who pulled
his shirt over his fucking head and try

1470
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:34,340
to rob a seven 11 on a whim.

1471
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:39,540
It was another thing before they
had really good security cameras,

1472
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:42,130
so this asshole wasn't on
America's dumbest criminals.

1473
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,760
I really fucking hate that guy.
Still to this day.

1474
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,770
I remember I had a math
teacher one time and he goes,

1475
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:53,190
he was asking questions and
he goes for number seven,

1476
01:27:53,191 --> 01:27:55,980
let's call on the dumbest kid in the room,
Bill Barr.

1477
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:57,750
And it's still fucking bugs me.

1478
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:04,220
That was like fucking 24 years ago.
You know what?

1479
01:28:04,221 --> 01:28:08,740
I think that that's what heaven is to me.
When I die,

1480
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:14,050
I go to heaven and then there's just
the line of fucking people that gave me

1481
01:28:14,051 --> 01:28:17,860
shit throughout my life and I never
punched him in the face and they just come

1482
01:28:17,861 --> 01:28:20,080
one at a time and I blast them in the,

1483
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:24,700
they say what they said to me then and
I blast them in the face and it doesn't

1484
01:28:24,701 --> 01:28:28,960
even hurt my hand cause it's heaven
and hell and I always fucking win.

1485
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:34,930
Um, wow. It's a lot of anger,
isn't it? Okay, let's plow ahead.

1486
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:38,350
So I go, all right sweetie, let's fucking
go up to the God damn Mandalay Bay.

1487
01:28:38,351 --> 01:28:42,280
I've never been there. So
anyways, like I said, it was,

1488
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:47,310
it's run by one of the winners
of Hell's kitchen or some shit.

1489
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,560
And when the reality is, is
what I'm not realizing is, um,

1490
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:54,850
okay.

1491
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:56,200
People who win that show.

1492
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:57,670
Yeah.

1493
01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:00,090
I'm now really starting to believe like,

1494
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:01,893
okay,

1495
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:06,210
it's like last comic standing. You go to
go to the winner of last comic standing.

1496
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,330
Oh, this guy, one last
comic standing and then you,

1497
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,500
you're going to go see some open miker
who's got 10 fucking minutes and material.

1498
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:16,290
I'm basing that on the first season.

1499
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:19,890
I don't know who won the other fucking
seasons, but it's a reality show.

1500
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,050
So I imagine it, it's,
it's a fucking, I dunno,

1501
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:29,890
somebody with like a fucking Hula
hoop going around their head.

1502
01:29:29,891 --> 01:29:33,450
Somebody with some Soda Hook.
God knows that's how this business works.

1503
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,960
You gotta have a hook,
you know,

1504
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,400
if anything told me that it was,
uh,

1505
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:43,690
looking at the people headlining and
Las Vegas. Yeah, that's not true.

1506
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:46,270
There's actually some real
comedians out there. George Wallace.

1507
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,250
I know Bobby Slayton worked
out there for a while.

1508
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:54,450
There was real comics out there, but
the guys who make the big fucking bucks,

1509
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:55,880
okay,

1510
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:00,020
they just do shit. But yeah, buff puppets.

1511
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:05,340
How the fuck is that
still entertaining in 2010

1512
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:08,043
you know

1513
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:12,940
like what I can't do ventriloquism
is that right?

1514
01:30:12,941 --> 01:30:14,350
Ventriloquism is that the right word?

1515
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,120
You want to hear me talk without moving
my fucking lips? I can do that shit. Hey,

1516
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:23,540
there they are. Dummy. What did
you do today? Yeah. Fuck you bill.

1517
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:27,590
Your darker than I am. Isn't that funny?
Huh? The downy thing. You're fucking dumb.

1518
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:32,290
Oh wait, I got to have a
stupid voice. Right? Take it
to another level. Hulu, who?

1519
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:36,140
Who could fucking,
it's sold out shows at Caesars.

1520
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:40,820
10 million a year entertainer of the year.

1521
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:45,620
Bill Barr and fucking ham face.

1522
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,430
Whatever the fuck you're
fucking puppet is.

1523
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:54,560
Why is the fucking puppet always smarter?
Can't somebody switched that up?

1524
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:01,170
I'd be arguing with my puppet. The second
the puppets started giving me shit.

1525
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,730
Oh really?
You're so fucking smart.

1526
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,310
What if I take my hand out
of your back now look at you.

1527
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,520
He just fell on your wooden face,
didn't you? He had dumped. Fuck.

1528
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,990
Then I turned on the crowd with the fuck
is wrong with you people. What is it?

1529
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:17,190
The 1930s. She's we want, we,

1530
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,930
what do you want me to do after they see
what's my fucking encore come out here.

1531
01:31:19,931 --> 01:31:21,260
I do the Goddamn Charleston.

1532
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,030
Yeah.

1533
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:26,450
Charleston. I could even say it.
All right. 25 whispering minutes in.

1534
01:31:26,451 --> 01:31:28,220
I'm actually starting to get a louder,
but you know what?

1535
01:31:28,221 --> 01:31:30,980
The Sun is a little higher in the sky.
And you liked that.

1536
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:35,320
Did I sound like a native
American? Um, anyways, uh,

1537
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,780
so let Jesus Christ,
let's get to the fucking Mandalay bay.

1538
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:40,440
Okay.

1539
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,720
So we go over to the man
late pay and oh yeah, that,

1540
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:47,120
that's what I'm realizing that
I'm eating at an open mic.

1541
01:31:47,121 --> 01:31:51,180
Her's fucking restaurant. I didn't
even realize that until afterwards.

1542
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:55,470
I eat the Burger. I got one of
the Coby beef burgers. All right.

1543
01:31:55,471 --> 01:31:59,670
Now let me say something
positive about Mandalay Bay, uh,

1544
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,900
before I get out of that day,

1545
01:32:01,901 --> 01:32:06,340
had some fucking insane shows
coming up at their house of Blues.

1546
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:11,410
All right.
Joe Rogan friend of this podcast and uh,

1547
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,150
he had me on his podcast last week.

1548
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:18,151
Joe Rogan is going to be performing
there on July 3rd at Mandalay bay.

1549
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,640
At the House of Blues the day before the,
uh,

1550
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:25,860
the big UFC fight you off shoe job,
your triple the wound.

1551
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:31,480
Um,
do you have a seat that Joe Rogan video,

1552
01:32:31,481 --> 01:32:32,820
the buffer three 60.

1553
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:37,180
You got to see that just a fucking
search that there's a fucking,

1554
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:41,290
I don't know if it's a youtube
video or if it's just on his, uh,

1555
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:45,160
website Joe rogan.net. But check that
one out. Really fucking funny video.

1556
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:50,440
But anyways, he's playing there and
lamb of God, if you're into that,

1557
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:53,050
a tolerable sort of death metal,

1558
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,840
that guy's still sings in
that fucking, uh, you know,

1559
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:00,220
Tom waits voice,

1560
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:05,200
Tom Waits is really the father of death
metal if you listened to is the way that

1561
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:08,320
guy sinks. Oh to Dow, Dow,

1562
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,450
you know, or maybe Louis Armstrong,
I think it goes Louie Armstrong,

1563
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:17,380
Tom Waits and then fucking death metal.

1564
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:23,560
Dossie Drees of green red roses too.

1565
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:28,480
Um, anyways, so that's a
good shit at Mandalay bay.

1566
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:30,520
The bad shit is we go to
this fucking burger place,

1567
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,660
I can't remember the name of it.
And we go in there and I,

1568
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:38,750
I order a $16 and 50 cent fucking Coby
beef burger and they're talking about how

1569
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:44,230
it's the greatest Goddamn
Burger. I'll, you know, the
highest quality fucking meat,

1570
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,450
Yadda,
fucking Yada.

1571
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:51,280
My girl orders want to 1615
1650 what is that? Kids,

1572
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:55,750
that's 33 bucks plus fries plus drinks,

1573
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:59,530
all that bullshit. You know, the
mob doesn't run Vegas anymore.

1574
01:33:59,531 --> 01:34:01,810
You can't go out and
get yourself a $2 stake.

1575
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,040
The whole fucking place out there
now as a God damn, it's a fuck over.

1576
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:11,920
So whatever costs me like 40 something
bucks, 50 bucks with the goddamn tip,

1577
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,350
I eat it. You know, it
wasn't even that good.

1578
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:15,650
Okay.

1579
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,900
My girls like, how's your burger?
You know what I said? I said,

1580
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:20,900
it's good just keeping the peace,

1581
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,940
keeping the water nice and smooth.
Nice and fucking still on the horizon.

1582
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,300
Okay.
So anyways,

1583
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,060
I get back to my hotel.

1584
01:34:33,061 --> 01:34:36,840
My girl already tells me she doesn't feel
too good at that burger sitting in or

1585
01:34:36,841 --> 01:34:39,960
like a God damn boot. And I'm
like, you know what? I feel fine.

1586
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:45,030
I get ready to do my show.
I earned my button down shirt,

1587
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:49,140
put a little conditioner in my hair,
what's left of it,

1588
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:54,141
shape it up a little and I head
downstairs to go work the Orleans casino,

1589
01:34:55,290 --> 01:35:00,180
the last place, Carlin ever the place
where the smothers brothers retired,

1590
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,533
you know,

1591
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:05,920
smothers brothers who
were so fucking edgy.

1592
01:35:06,190 --> 01:35:10,320
They actually lost their sketch show
during the Vietnam War. They did sign,

1593
01:35:10,321 --> 01:35:11,410
I forget what the sketch was,

1594
01:35:11,411 --> 01:35:15,390
but they had the balls to
say no to the network and do

1595
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:21,990
a sketch that was actually criticizing
what the fuck we were doing over there.

1596
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:26,740
And they lost the Goddamn show. You
know, I don't know about you guys,

1597
01:35:26,741 --> 01:35:31,060
but for me, that's lifetime
for respect. So anyways,

1598
01:35:31,061 --> 01:35:35,410
I walked down there and I'm going through
the Orleans casino and then all of a

1599
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:40,150
sudden it just fucking hits me. Boom,
right in my stomach. Like some capsule,

1600
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,310
some time release.
CIA,

1601
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:45,670
you're going to shit your
pants fucking capsule goes off.

1602
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:51,030
And I know there is no question that
whatever I just ate was not good for my

1603
01:35:51,221 --> 01:35:51,730
body.

1604
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:56,730
And it was about to reject it one way or
the other without getting crude people,

1605
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:00,640
when something goes into your stomach,
if it's coming out,

1606
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:04,480
it only has two options.
All right.

1607
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:12,310
Anyways,
I just thought of a really,

1608
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:15,760
really bad joke for the fucking third one,
and I'm not going to say it,

1609
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:20,530
but it involved stabbing yourself in the
stomach and you can fill in the blanks

1610
01:36:20,531 --> 01:36:24,880
on that one. All right. So anyways, um,

1611
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,190
tell him he gotta be fucking do you
got to be shitting me? No Pun intended.

1612
01:36:30,191 --> 01:36:33,040
So I go in the back way,

1613
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:37,540
the same way that Carlin used to go in
because I've already asked everybody

1614
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:41,020
every fucking question. Literally so
much. I'm into Carlin. How did he leave?

1615
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:42,880
Did he hang out now?

1616
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:45,790
We'd say good night and he would go
right out the door and he'd be in the car

1617
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:48,190
and he wasn't difficult to work with.

1618
01:36:48,191 --> 01:36:50,650
I guess he had arthritis at
the end of his life. And, uh,

1619
01:36:51,130 --> 01:36:52,600
the sound guy was saying one show,

1620
01:36:52,601 --> 01:36:57,601
he forgot to take the bottle caps off
the water bottles and he saw the car loan

1621
01:36:57,721 --> 01:37:01,750
was struggling with them and when he
got off because George, I'm so sorry.

1622
01:37:01,751 --> 01:37:05,890
I'm so sorry. And George just
like whack Matt. Al, come
on man. I don't give a shit.

1623
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:09,100
Don't worry. Just walked out. I guess
he was a really great guy. So anyways,

1624
01:37:09,850 --> 01:37:14,560
I'm walking through this legendary door
and uh,

1625
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:17,590
you know, and what's worse is like,
I know what's going to happen,

1626
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:21,730
but I know it's not going to
happen for like another 15 minutes.

1627
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:27,180
And coincidentally the fucking show starts
in 15 minutes and I'm going on first.

1628
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,700
All right.
And this guy,

1629
01:37:30,701 --> 01:37:34,450
when you're backstage literally
says 20 minutes till showtime,

1630
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:37,780
20 minutes till showtime.
He liked counts it down.

1631
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,240
I never get nervous before shows,

1632
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:43,000
but this guy counting down
the show is making me nervous.

1633
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,760
15 minutes till showtime. Okay. And
it's starting to get worse and fuck it.

1634
01:37:48,761 --> 01:37:53,140
Get literally gets down to two minutes
before showtime and I'm questioning,

1635
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:57,730
can I make it through a half set?
And I was like, you know what?

1636
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:01,780
Fuck this.
The show can't start without me.

1637
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,430
My opening music is Elvis Presley.
Anyways, the fuck do I care?

1638
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:10,260
They can listen to that song.
I'm going robe, buffoon. He goes,

1639
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:14,220
lose your long black hair
slam you four can fly.

1640
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:18,610
You solve the fucking sink a
Ho, Ho Hoo. I don't give a shit.

1641
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,900
And I said,
fuck it.

1642
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:26,370
And I fucking ran into the bathroom
and I will spare you the details.

1643
01:38:26,711 --> 01:38:31,700
But you know, when something
either amazing hello,

1644
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,240
uh, something amazing
happens. They make a statue.

1645
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:39,710
If something horrific happens, a lot
of times they will preserve the area.

1646
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,860
You know,
like Dealey Plaza.

1647
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:45,620
Fuck a president gets
his brains blown out.

1648
01:38:45,621 --> 01:38:48,890
All of a sudden we can't change one blade,
a fucking grass.

1649
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,600
Okay.

1650
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,960
The horror that happened in that
fucking bathroom, ladies and gentlemen,

1651
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:58,040
I never do shit jokes. They should
have retired that fucking bathroom.

1652
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:01,590
That's it. They should've
just fucking, uh,

1653
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:05,690
air sealed it and just
put a glass fucking door.

1654
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,750
Two people could look in and,
and,

1655
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:13,190
and realize why they closed that fucking
burger joint at the Mandalay bay.

1656
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:18,020
And a, I got to met, dude. I
have, I haven't, this is Monday.

1657
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,360
I'm finally back to normal.

1658
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:25,060
So there you go.
There's my big shit story.

1659
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:30,240
I had a burger over at the
fucking Mandalay bay and
it almost ruined my fucking

1660
01:39:32,261 --> 01:39:36,430
show over at the Orleans. So if you guys
saw me, anybody saw me Saturday night.

1661
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:37,631
All right.

1662
01:39:37,631 --> 01:39:41,110
You want to talk about a professional
because I extra fucking killed on that

1663
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:45,320
show.
If you knew what the fuck happened,

1664
01:39:45,321 --> 01:39:50,321
just know that the next time you go to
Vegas and you go to see Barry Manilow and

1665
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:54,740
he's singing that song,
Mandy,

1666
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:00,590
you sobbed and sobbed and then you stomped
there. But I still want to fuck you.

1667
01:40:00,591 --> 01:40:02,150
Oh Man.
D right.

1668
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:06,590
Just know that he could have just
been shit in his fucking brains out.

1669
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:12,490
Two minutes before he put on his ray on
fucking slacks with his horrific plastic

1670
01:40:13,161 --> 01:40:16,070
surgery is yanked back face.
I bet.

1671
01:40:16,071 --> 01:40:20,930
You know I was going to say
he need another face lift
if he fucking shit the way

1672
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,380
I did before my show. But that's
actually not true. There's no strain.

1673
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:28,570
There was no straining. Um,
anyways. All right, Bill.

1674
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:32,030
Jesus Christ enough already.
So anyways,

1675
01:40:32,031 --> 01:40:33,850
one of the things I like to
do when I go out to Vegas,

1676
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,360
I like to check out some of the acts
that are out there because Las Vegas is a

1677
01:40:38,361 --> 01:40:42,830
viable option for a standup comedian.
Um,

1678
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:47,630
if things aren't going well
for you in, uh, in Hollywood,

1679
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:52,610
but you're a huge draw as you
could actually go out there

1680
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:58,340
like, uh, you know, some of the comedians
that are out there, I won't name names,

1681
01:40:58,341 --> 01:41:02,090
but they're making a
ridiculous amount of money,

1682
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:06,530
you know, 3 million, four, five,

1683
01:41:06,531 --> 01:41:08,450
$7 million contracts,

1684
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:10,050
okay.

1685
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:12,450
For the year.
And you don't have to travel,

1686
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,050
you don't have to go on the
road or nothing. And believe me,

1687
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:20,850
I have thought about it.
I've thought about it. It's
like you fucking kidding me.

1688
01:41:20,851 --> 01:41:24,240
4 million. I'd stay out there
for a year. I just do it.

1689
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:29,700
I get a fucking, I think I already
talked about this. I'd have a, a, a,

1690
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:36,060
this is how I had a plan.
I was going to have a fucking of really?

1691
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:37,380
Yeah.

1692
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,430
Fucking slam and house that I would rent.
And then I would make the casino,

1693
01:41:41,431 --> 01:41:45,690
give me a car service and I would just
have him pick me up, drive me to the Gig,

1694
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:48,900
walk right in the back door,
like Carlin do my show and walk.

1695
01:41:48,901 --> 01:41:51,860
That's probably why I did it.
I fucking walk right back out,

1696
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:55,500
gave me the car and I get the
fuck out of there, you know,

1697
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:59,010
that way I wouldn't get sick of the
casinos or any of that type of shit or at

1698
01:41:59,011 --> 01:42:00,090
least it would take longer.

1699
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:05,010
But a summary One was telling me that
Celine Dion actually has it down and yes,

1700
01:42:05,011 --> 01:42:08,070
I am comparing myself to Celine Dion.
Cause sometimes,

1701
01:42:08,071 --> 01:42:10,380
I don't know if you guys notice
when I'm really feeling a joke,

1702
01:42:10,381 --> 01:42:14,100
I start punching myself in the chest.
Um,

1703
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:21,510
her fucking music is horrific. She's like
the white version of Beyonce, you know,

1704
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:24,990
where she's really successful.
I'd actually fucker,

1705
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:28,410
but the sound of her voice makes me
want to just fucking kill myself,

1706
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:33,690
you know? I mean, how hard is
Beyonce? But her voice is fucking,

1707
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:39,450
it's beyond horrific. It's like,
it's unacceptable. It doesn't,

1708
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:43,230
she sound like she's singing like two
octaves higher than she should be.

1709
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:48,360
The worst is when you're in like a
restaurant and they just have it on.

1710
01:42:48,361 --> 01:42:51,060
It's sort of low volume and
the background and you're like,

1711
01:42:51,061 --> 01:42:52,620
is someone choking on their food?

1712
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,290
Actually that wouldn't make sense
because that would mean that you could

1713
01:42:55,291 --> 01:42:59,800
actually get air out
if somebody sort of choking on their food.

1714
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:05,440
Is there a an s and m
couple in the corner booth

1715
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:12,700
and the dude is applying just
enough pressure. All right.

1716
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:17,350
Whatever. Um, anyway,
she had it down the best.

1717
01:43:17,351 --> 01:43:20,070
Celine Dion like she would live,

1718
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:24,310
she had a helicopter pick
her up at her fucking house.

1719
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:29,890
She the land on top of the casino and I,

1720
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:32,400
you guys don't understand how
much of a drain, the cysts,

1721
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:36,090
any performer who's
listening to this is fucking,

1722
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:42,010
it's got a fucking hard on at this
point. This is the ultimate. All right.

1723
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:47,030
Other than just having a fucking evil
twin robot who always kills and just goes

1724
01:43:47,071 --> 01:43:49,490
out and does your shows,
you know,

1725
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,320
and the fucking helicopter
would pick her up at the house,

1726
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:59,270
Flyer over to the casino,
land on top of the casino,

1727
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:02,630
and then she would just
go down, go out, sing,

1728
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:07,870
punch yourself in the chest and then just
fucking get back on the helicopter and

1729
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:09,434
ride back.

1730
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:14,990
Do you realize that means she was doing
her vocal warmup in like her bathroom,

1731
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:16,971
you know,

1732
01:44:16,971 --> 01:44:21,740
and like five seconds later or whatever
as she sat in her kitchen eating fucking

1733
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:26,500
fruit loops or some shit, you
know, total, total, total, total,

1734
01:44:26,501 --> 01:44:27,710
total knee hit the fucking

1735
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,820
sound of those helicopter
blades out doing that.

1736
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:36,600
We'd be listening to the theme from Mash,
bad band and, and, and, and, and Eh,

1737
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:38,003
you know,

1738
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:41,840
maybe some of that music that they
listened to when like apocalypse now.

1739
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,460
What are some of the music
that they listened to?

1740
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:48,670
Was that the one at one of
those war movies where they
would listen to the doors?

1741
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:54,370
This is the end.
Doodoodoo my only for Dan.

1742
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,580
You probably wonder why, Bill, what
the fuck are you singing so much for

1743
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,350
on your podcast this week?
I'll tell you why. Because, uh,

1744
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,300
I went out to Vegas and uh,

1745
01:45:04,301 --> 01:45:09,301
I saw a group out there that was selling
out and it was frustrating to me how

1746
01:45:09,311 --> 01:45:13,510
much people like singers.
This group had the worst fucking name

1747
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:20,070
of any group I've ever seen in my life.
I,

1748
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,240
it was four people,
three guys and one girl,

1749
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:29,050
all with like the fucking face lifts face
yanked back the fucking hair dyed all

1750
01:45:29,121 --> 01:45:33,770
well into their 50s except for
one of them who might've been 38.

1751
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,580
And I thought they were an acapella group.
They're not,

1752
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:42,581
they sing and they have a band there and
the name of the group was vocal soup,

1753
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:50,720
vocal soup.

1754
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:54,860
Is that not the most
disgusting fucking name

1755
01:45:57,070 --> 01:46:01,300
you've ever fucking heard who
came up with that vocal soup?

1756
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:06,730
So I'm like, I have to go, I have
to go on youtube, look them up,

1757
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:10,570
look up vocal soup and click
on vocal soup and concert

1758
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:17,150
and I'm going to sing you some of
their lyrics. They sing vocals, sip,

1759
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:19,180
Yay.
Yay.

1760
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:24,760
You take four cool voices and you make
them Ha and you give it everything you

1761
01:46:24,761 --> 01:46:26,770
get.
You get vocal soup.

1762
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:31,810
How fucking gross is that?

1763
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:37,510
It just makes you gag just to think
of it and the in the fucking lyrics,

1764
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:40,840
they do nothing to try
to make it less gross.

1765
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,090
There's actually a line in that.

1766
01:46:44,091 --> 01:46:49,091
Then they're stupid theme song that you
won't stop slurping till you're burping

1767
01:46:50,171 --> 01:46:54,310
up focal soup and the end of the video.

1768
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:57,610
I Shit you not speaking of Shit,

1769
01:46:58,570 --> 01:47:01,090
which is the reoccurring
theme of this podcast,

1770
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:06,390
they actually have an animated
bowl of soup that is shit Brown.

1771
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:10,150
It looks like a bowl of fucking diarrhea.

1772
01:47:10,151 --> 01:47:15,151
I know it's gross but I have to
accurately describe it and they have notes

1773
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:17,110
coming out of it with the steam.

1774
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,240
Okay.

1775
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:23,590
Vocal soup. Ah, it's fucking horrific.

1776
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:27,280
Vocal soup and this is what killed
me is the one guy in the band,

1777
01:47:27,281 --> 01:47:32,050
the rocker is actually this
guy from the group foreigner

1778
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:37,610
and it's just like, okay,
whatever. You know, I dunno.

1779
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:42,290
Foreign is broke up right now and you had
a bad deal. Some behind the music shit.

1780
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:44,150
You need money. A, I respect it,

1781
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:48,500
but how the fuck did you
sign off on vocal soup?

1782
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:53,890
Former person that was in
foreigner, you know, you don't,

1783
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,150
you didn't, you didn't speak
up like, hey guys, you know,

1784
01:47:56,151 --> 01:47:58,850
I don't want a big league anybody,
you know?

1785
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:00,030
Yeah.

1786
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:04,110
But I, I wasn't a band that
not, not only sold out arenas,

1787
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:05,910
not only had a number one record,
but I,

1788
01:48:05,911 --> 01:48:08,790
I want it to say we actually
had a pretty cool fucking name.

1789
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,480
I think we can do better than vocal soup.

1790
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,033
I mean,

1791
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:21,590
I don't want to go the hacky route here
with like what movie the rube shoots.

1792
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:24,590
What were the other options?
Throat Puke.

1793
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,753
Ah,

1794
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:36,490
fucking throat puke. Yay. Yay.

1795
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:41,350
You won't stop yakking until you
fucking burping up stomach acid.

1796
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,200
It's fucking horrific.
But of course they sell out,

1797
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:45,940
they sell out and everybody loves him.

1798
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:51,130
And I guess the piano player worked with
Frank Sinatra for 10 fucking years and

1799
01:48:51,131 --> 01:48:54,730
he also signed off on vocal soup.

1800
01:48:56,370 --> 01:49:00,940
Oh, it's just, I dunno,

1801
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:04,420
but they sell out, you know, that's what
the fuck happens at Vegas. And it really,

1802
01:49:04,421 --> 01:49:08,950
you know, Vegas will really help you
understand this business as a performer.

1803
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:13,980
Like why good things don't make it and
why shit makes it all you gotta do is

1804
01:49:14,801 --> 01:49:17,650
fucking go out there, you know, put
a fucking toilet seat on your head.

1805
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:21,370
Toilet seat head. Yay. Yeah.

1806
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:25,270
If you don't have a toilet and
you want to take fuck and shit,

1807
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:31,150
I'm all right. I think that says I'm
running out of fucking steam here. Uh,

1808
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:35,360
let's recommend some youtube videos here.
Um,

1809
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:38,760
youtube video. I already told
you to check out Volkl soup. Oh,

1810
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:42,950
it's just making me sick to my stomach
to continue to say that name a youtube

1811
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:47,330
video. Look up. Best cry ever. MMM,

1812
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:48,590
okay.

1813
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:53,270
It's unbelievable. And then of course
you gotta hit the auto tune remix of it.

1814
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:56,030
It really is the best.
Uh,

1815
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:56,890
yeah,

1816
01:49:56,890 --> 01:50:00,160
one ever. But don't look at the
Popeye's chicken one. I hate when they,

1817
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:05,080
people do those, that
racist Shit, you know? Um,

1818
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:10,000
anyways, um, and then there's another one.
This is just an uncomfortable podcasts.

1819
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:11,890
I talked to you about my bodily functions.

1820
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:16,120
I brought up vocal soup and just
for the Trifecta of disgusting,

1821
01:50:16,121 --> 01:50:18,550
it's usually not, it's never been
this disgust. And this, this,

1822
01:50:18,551 --> 01:50:22,620
I'm going to nominate this one for the
most disgusting podcast of all time. Um,

1823
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:26,860
and this is the cherry on top here
at the last youtube video, uh,

1824
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,230
is chimp rapes frog.

1825
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:34,480
It's really fucking,
I actually had to shut it off.

1826
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:35,860
Okay.

1827
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:38,170
I had to shut it off.
Um,

1828
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:39,310
okay.

1829
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:43,210
It started off as sort of
funny and then it's bizarre.

1830
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,690
And then the people in the background
who were filming it are so fucking dumb

1831
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,650
that you can't,
uh,

1832
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:55,120
I dunno.
They just,

1833
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:59,690
he just listened to him and you hear
that their parents and you know,

1834
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:04,010
you realize why we shouldn't have
tried to stop the swine flu, swine flu.

1835
01:51:04,011 --> 01:51:08,360
I can't even talk. Sorry. I'm tying to
talk and type at the same time. And uh,

1836
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:12,020
here's something new. Here's,
here's the fucking cool old car

1837
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,650
of the week. Go on. Um,

1838
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:21,480
go on youtube and look
up a Nash Metropolitan.

1839
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,180
Now I'm sure people made fun of this
and you're gonna be like a course.

1840
01:51:24,181 --> 01:51:26,520
You like this car bill because
you drive a fucking Prius,

1841
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:30,540
which you got to check this.
This car was a fucking bad ass car.

1842
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,870
When they will make an all
these huge cars back in the day,

1843
01:51:33,871 --> 01:51:37,980
they made this little fucking
car. I don't know. Check it out.

1844
01:51:37,981 --> 01:51:42,180
Tell me what you think about it.
Some people like redid theirs. Um,

1845
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:46,860
I know it's not a fucking Mclaren.
Don't be a cunt. Just check it out.

1846
01:51:46,861 --> 01:51:51,330
It's a cool fucking car.
Um, by uh, international,

1847
01:51:51,331 --> 01:51:55,690
I guess Nash and International
is somehow combined or something.

1848
01:51:55,691 --> 01:51:57,600
I don't what happened,
they became American motors.

1849
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,110
I really should have looked that part up,
but that's a fucking cool car.

1850
01:52:01,111 --> 01:52:03,450
It's got three on the tree,
you know,

1851
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:08,640
you know the old school cars where
you had like the a, you know, the, uh,

1852
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:11,230
if it was an automatic, the
park neutral, reverse drive,

1853
01:52:11,231 --> 01:52:14,710
all that shit was right on
the steering column. But uh,

1854
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:18,230
I think last time they made a car with,
if it was at,

1855
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:22,120
it was a standard and you shifted up
there. They called it three on the tree.

1856
01:52:22,121 --> 01:52:26,590
And I had never even heard of that until
I was like fucking 25 years old because

1857
01:52:26,591 --> 01:52:30,760
those cars were long gone. But this thing,
three on the fucking tree, check it out.

1858
01:52:30,761 --> 01:52:32,080
A Nash Metropolitan.

1859
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:35,920
And you know what that's going to be it
for the whispering podcast this week.

1860
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,950
And maybe it was a good thing that I
whispered it because it was so fucking

1861
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:43,360
disgusting. Let me, uh, let me hype
some of my gigs coming up here. Uh,

1862
01:52:43,361 --> 01:52:47,040
let me go to the official website of bill.
I'm going to be the next Gig I have.

1863
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:51,610
I'm not working again until,
uh, I actually have, uh,

1864
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:55,570
July 12th on my website,
but I have to change that.

1865
01:52:55,571 --> 01:53:00,400
I don't get to Montreal till the 13th
people. July 13th through the 17th.

1866
01:53:00,401 --> 01:53:02,050
I'm going to be in Montreal,
Canada.

1867
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:07,350
Speaking of cities that riot
after they win or loose,

1868
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:09,670
just like Los Angeles,

1869
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:15,570
another sports town of fucking animals
who attack police officers and tip over

1870
01:53:16,421 --> 01:53:19,660
cars. Even if they fucking
win, win our loose.

1871
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:24,100
Um, I'm going to be up at
the Montreal comedy festival,

1872
01:53:24,101 --> 01:53:28,870
the just for laughs festival.
I'm doing my new one hour of material.

1873
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:34,600
So while you fucking frogs up there, who
want to pretend like you're from Paris,

1874
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:40,360
I'm speaking to that
shit. Uh, I love the, uh,

1875
01:53:41,410 --> 01:53:44,350
my actually going to burn a job Burnett
show company. Fucking listeners do.

1876
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:48,130
I have actually, you know what, my, uh,

1877
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:51,900
the guy who actually set up my entire,

1878
01:53:51,901 --> 01:53:56,370
a podcast player told me a week ago,

1879
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:57,500
okay.

1880
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:02,500
That as of the beginning of this
month told me this a week ago,

1881
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:08,300
I had 1 million,
3000 something downloads of my podcast.

1882
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:12,430
Do you want to, do you fucking
understand that for a second?

1883
01:54:12,431 --> 01:54:14,110
Let's think about that for a second.

1884
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:17,740
If I charged a dollar a podcast,

1885
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:22,540
I wouldn't have to do this fucking
podcast anymore. That's actually bullshit.

1886
01:54:22,541 --> 01:54:24,040
First of all, people
wouldn't have, you know,

1887
01:54:24,041 --> 01:54:27,220
I know a lot of people go back
and they download all 150,

1888
01:54:27,730 --> 01:54:32,440
and if it was a buck a piece, they
wouldn't, but if I charged a dime a piece,

1889
01:54:32,441 --> 01:54:36,370
I would add 100 grant,
hundred fucking grant,

1890
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:41,560
you know, that's almost as much
as vocal soup makes a night.

1891
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:47,950
All right.
So anyways,

1892
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:51,670
maybe I'll do that.
Maybe I'll charge like a fucking dime.

1893
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:54,700
Cause if he didn't notice from the uh,

1894
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:56,360
yeah,

1895
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:01,160
from the story I was telling you about
working Vegas and not having to do the

1896
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:02,330
road and that type of thing,

1897
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:07,400
that's what happens to performance after
awhile is it's not the doing of the

1898
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:07,821
show.

1899
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:12,821
It's the fucking travel and you try to
figure out how the fuck I can get off the

1900
01:55:13,311 --> 01:55:17,390
road. Initially the road seems like
a cool, fun thing to do when it is.

1901
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:22,220
But then as you get older and you've
been pretty much everywhere, uh,

1902
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:26,930
you try to look for ways, what would
you guys do if I charge 10 cents now,

1903
01:55:26,931 --> 01:55:27,764
what would that be?

1904
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:30,680
10 cents you guys were really going
to expose me for how dumb I am.

1905
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:36,250
That means you can download the entire
podcast for 53 fucking years for 15

1906
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:38,534
bucks.

1907
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:39,950
Yeah.

1908
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:40,783
You know?

1909
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:41,670
Yeah.

1910
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:43,110
Be $15.

1911
01:55:43,690 --> 01:55:44,050
Okay.

1912
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:46,180
I'd have a hundred grand in my pocket.

1913
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:51,730
Granted it would go down to like fucking
50 after the Goddamn government came

1914
01:55:51,731 --> 01:55:54,030
in. But you know what? You
know what that would do?

1915
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,140
That would buy me a nude
fucking dodge challenger.

1916
01:55:57,010 --> 01:55:57,240
Okay.

1917
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:01,490
The fucking top of the line, one with
the fucking stripe on it and shit. Um,

1918
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,710
don't worry, I'm not, I'm
not going to charge a dime,

1919
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:06,930
but what I am going to
do is I'm going to start,

1920
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:11,820
I'm at the beginning of guilting
you guys into, to my new DVD, okay?

1921
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,800
Just for the simple fact,
dad,

1922
01:56:15,801 --> 01:56:17,870
I don't charge for this
motherfucker. I am real. I am.

1923
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:21,050
I am going to let you guys know that
I'm going to guilt you motherfuckers.

1924
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:25,290
All right? Pay Forward. It's not a,

1925
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:28,510
you can't just buy one of my DVDs.
You got to buy two,

1926
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:33,070
one for yourself to show all your friends
and then you got to buy the second one

1927
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:37,550
for somebody that you don't really like,
but you have to buy him a gift.

1928
01:56:37,551 --> 01:56:40,160
It's a great fucking gift.
You know your boss,

1929
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:44,600
you if Canty fucking sister in law,
you know,

1930
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:48,350
and you have to get him a gift cause they
get you a gift as that's a great gift

1931
01:56:48,351 --> 01:56:52,430
to get is my fucking DVD.
It's only fucking 20 bucks.

1932
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:53,601
There you go.

1933
01:56:53,601 --> 01:56:58,601
You can't shut your face and watch
this guy trash women for an hour.

1934
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:03,500
Um, that's it. Everybody. That's
a podcast for this week. I uh,

1935
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,670
apologize that it was so fucking graphic.
I usually don't tell shit stories,

1936
01:57:07,671 --> 01:57:11,150
shit jokes, bodily feel fluid
stories. But uh, it happened.

1937
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,070
What do you want from me?
But anyways,

1938
01:57:13,071 --> 01:57:16,580
I want to thank the Orleans casino for
having me. I had a fucking great time.

1939
01:57:16,581 --> 01:57:19,940
If you go out to Vegas, go to
the Orleans and casino, you know,

1940
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:24,020
if you a little more mature and you don't
want to deal with those fucking whores

1941
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,710
walking around.
Oh Hey,

1942
01:57:27,711 --> 01:57:31,670
I gotta I gotta give you guys the name
of this fucking thing. I actually,

1943
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:36,290
I'm not one of these guys who
was into art really. Bill,

1944
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:41,330
you just did a fucking shit joke
for fucking 45 minutes. If you guys,

1945
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:46,100
next time you go out to Vegas,
go out to the Peter Lick. Um,

1946
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:51,710
Gat Gallery, Peter Lik l. I.
K this guy takes pictures of,

1947
01:57:51,711 --> 01:57:52,550
of uh,

1948
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:58,270
like beautiful scenes in nature and he
uses this camera from like the 1930s that

1949
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:02,720
it literally takes a minute for the, the
camera to take a picture. And obviously,

1950
01:58:02,721 --> 01:58:05,630
I don't know shit about photography,
but I don't know what he does.

1951
01:58:05,631 --> 01:58:08,240
He opened something,
it's wide open and he hits it.

1952
01:58:08,690 --> 01:58:10,910
And because it takes so
long to take the picture,

1953
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:13,820
it gets all these unbelievable colors.

1954
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:19,080
It literally looks like
an HD TV picture and uh,

1955
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:23,060
they stick you in these rooms and with
these dimmers and what they do is they

1956
01:58:23,061 --> 01:58:26,480
dim the lights down.
You,

1957
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,950
it looks like the sun is going to,
I can't explain it,

1958
01:58:28,951 --> 01:58:32,610
but they have a gallery in Mandalay bay,

1959
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:36,360
the Venetian and the, uh, that mall,

1960
01:58:36,361 --> 01:58:40,590
that covered mall there
at Caesar's palace.

1961
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,750
Definitely check that out. If you
going out to Vegas, Peter Lik,

1962
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:49,500
you know when you're done checking out
Joe Rogan at the House of Blues July 3rd,

1963
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,610
go to the, uh, oh, you could do that.

1964
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:52,740
Okay.

1965
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:56,730
Go up there. Don't get a hamburger.
Checkout the Peter Lick, uh,

1966
01:58:56,750 --> 01:59:00,950
pictures and have them sit you down
in one of the,

1967
01:59:00,951 --> 01:59:03,950
in one of the rooms and have them dim
the fucking lights and check it out, man.

1968
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:07,610
Peter Lik, man, it's the shit. All
right. That's it. I hope it was funny.

1969
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:09,110
I hope it was a funny podcast.

1970
01:59:09,111 --> 01:59:11,900
I felt a little fucking hampered
by the fact I had to whisper here,

1971
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:13,433
but,
uh,

1972
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:17,960
what the hell did I do? Did I just shut
this fucking thing off? No, I didn't.

1973
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:19,380
All right, you guys.
Everybody have a good week.

1974
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:22,960
Alright.
Talk to you next week.

1975
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:49,450
[inaudible].
