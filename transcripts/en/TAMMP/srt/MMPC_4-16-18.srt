1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,970
Okay.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,500
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

3
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:05,990
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:10,550
April 16th,
2018 what's going on?

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,930
How,
how's it going,

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,250
man to do? You're on the
other side of it, Huh?

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,960
You paid your taxes.
You know Barb,

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,640
Barb and I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. Hey, take more than I make.

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:32,990
Who the fuck are my, I just did the
fucking job. Let me give it to you.

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,500
You're rich content.
What are you going to spend it on?

11
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:41,210
You have a dash and Douche bag. Uh,
that's what do you know something?

12
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:44,360
That's what really gets my freckled
fucking goat about paying taxes.

13
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:49,100
I got no problem given these fucking
douchebags the money. I get it.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,110
Being a citizen of a, of a country.
It's like cabin a membership.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,700
All right?
You want those fucking potholes filled?

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,830
Yay. What pens and pencils
down at the fucking school?

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,590
You want the red light and then the green
light. Did All the light bulbs changed?

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,380
You got to pay your fucking taxes
so I don't have a problem with it.

19
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,410
The problem I have though is when they
get more than I get and I did the fucking

20
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,860
job. How did you make more
off my gig than I did?

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,640
And I was the guy up there fucking,
you know, dancing around, you know,

22
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,070
going down to one knee in
the end. Like fuck it, Elvis

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,510
wrapping up,
singing his truth is marching on.

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,813
MMM.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,790
I don't get that part. I mean, I do
get it. I do understand that, you know,

26
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,990
we have a lot of expenses in
this getting this country.

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,590
We've got a lot of expenses. You know
what I mean? We were, we had, we had 50,

28
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:59,591
we've got a 15 year road trip that we're
still paying for right now going on 16

29
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:03,740
years, 16 years, because a
16 year fucking road trip.

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,060
I'll tell you what freaked me out.
Um, I did the rough and rowdy,

31
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:13,040
which was the fuck one of
the great experiences I've
had since getting into the

32
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,940
business of show. Uh, but
at the middle of it, uh,

33
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,160
Dan, big cat cats looked at me
and said, we just bombed Syria.

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,420
And my first thought was not like,
oh my God,

35
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,840
we're at war because that's been the
natural state for the better part of two

36
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,570
fucking decades.
My first fucking thought was,

37
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,540
how the fuck are we going to afford that?

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,650
We're going to start another
war and how are we going?

39
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,920
How are we going to pay for this?
Right.

40
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,110
This is like when you watch
and your friend at the
blackjack table go and, dude,

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,500
you got rent to peg. Come on,
it's over. Cards are cold.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,060
Let's go back to the
room there. Um, you know,

43
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:59,230
some day you want to buy a house.
Uh,

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,220
but fortunately I guess we didn't start
a war. This was more like a drive by,

45
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,421
you know,
we,

46
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,040
we did a drive by with France
as far as I can tell because,

47
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,870
uh, you know, one of them before I get in
over my head, which I think I already am,

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,101
I mean,

49
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,610
is there anything better than listening
to somebody discuss foreign policy who

50
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:23,050
doesn't even have the decency to watch
the news? Whatever the fucking news is.

51
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:27,190
Now, you know, I was reading this
article in rolling stone. Oh,

52
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,440
I'd read a little bit this
week, believe it or not. Um,

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,170
I read this article in rolling stone
above Facebook and the influence that it

54
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,470
had on news,
like inadvertently and all this shit.

55
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,570
And uh,
and how they allegedly have,

56
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,050
like when you click on an
advertisement on Facebook,

57
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:51,130
like they turned some fucking camera on
and they take a picture of your face and

58
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,830
they try to read the expression of your,

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,920
of your face and try to gauge the level
of joy that you have to determine which

60
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,900
ads you're going to see. And, uh,

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,800
the only thing creepier than
that to me is people like,

62
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:10,330
do what do I k and all that kind to
figure out like what I want to buy.

63
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,640
Okay.

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,290
Does it just as a fucking like human
being that doesn't freak you out that

65
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:23,490
somewhere, you know? I know they're
not sitting there looking at it.

66
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:28,030
It's some fucking computer
computer instead of punching.

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,490
It's an absolute random gag. Um, I dunno,

68
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,420
I just don't see any of this
going anywhere. Good. All right.

69
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,450
And then they're going to like in this
fucking unbelievably efficient way,

70
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,550
get you to buy something
else that you don't need.

71
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,270
So then you got to throw something else
out in your house that then ends up in

72
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:53,850
that swirl of fucking trash. And
it's just like, it just doesn't,

73
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,070
it doesn't need to happen. So, um,

74
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,540
I say that as,

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,530
I just clicked on something the other
day about ready to buy yet another snare

76
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,420
drum.
And I'm not even in a band.

77
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,520
I don't have any recording sessions
coming up. I just, I don't know.

78
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,040
I've been trying to walk away from it,
but I,

79
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,290
I keep thinking about this
snare drum and I don't know,

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,280
I think a part of the problem why came
out with the fuck I was going to look up.

81
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,750
I'll why,

82
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,830
why did we bomb Syria?

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,260
This is, this is how I
learned about us. Okay.

84
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,730
I'm going to click on the first thing,

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,860
the U s bomb to punish it for a
chemical attack. That's what I thought.

86
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,370
US bombing Syria in Russia's response.
You know,

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,850
Russia is in America. We act like we
used to date. You know what I mean?

88
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,770
So then when we had a bad breakup,

89
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:50,850
so mad at what anybody when no
matter what they do, we'll look to,

90
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,270
and then they do the same thing.
I'm a God. He says, David,

91
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,850
I can't believe I wasted time getting to
know that person. During World War Two,

92
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,330
the United States along with Britain,

93
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,490
Britain was there to Johnny gets
show and France bombed Syria.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,960
Does anybody in England
ever say jolly good show?

95
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,900
I've been to France like two or three
times and I'd never heard anybody go all

96
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:16,660
whole, whole, all right,
bombed Syria on Friday night,

97
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,560
Friday night. You know, let's, let's kick
the weekend off, right? That's Bob Syria.

98
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,610
The decision to strike came one week
after Syrian President Bashar Al Assad.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,330
That's like a fucking number one
draft pick name. Like a wide receiver,

100
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:37,060
except for the first thing you know

101
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,780
like Tayshawn al-Assad dude.

102
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,290
The guy ran like a fucking
four one 40 we just signed him.

103
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,230
I'm telling you right now,
guarantee calling you right now.

104
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,480
Put it on your fantasy team.
He's going to get,

105
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,870
get at least 1500 fucking yad this season.
All right.

106
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,070
Use chemical weapons against
civilians outside of Damascus.

107
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,210
I believe that's the capitol killing
at least 42 adults and children.

108
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,800
After that attack,

109
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:08,801
President Donald Trump promised to
exact a big price on the Assad regime.

110
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,360
The US and its allies deliberated
a response over the following week.

111
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:19,310
What are we going to do? And
again, you want to fire bomb, uh,

112
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,780
economic sanctions.

113
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,440
What he say a three to
seven missiles maybe,

114
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,340
um, including one on the outskirts
of, okay. And then on Friday night,

115
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:35,900
the country's hit three targets, including
one on the outskirts of Damascus,

116
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,990
all related to Syria's chemical weapons
program or research center store.

117
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,480
Uh,

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,480
our storage facility and an
equipment facility and command post.

119
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,810
Wait, they said we hit three targets.
They just listed three a for me.

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,070
Research Center,

121
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,480
a storage facility and an equipment
facility and command post.

122
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,383
Oh,

123
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,510
I don't fucking know. The map of
Syria shows the targets hit on Friday.

124
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,750
The strikes hit at the very hat of serious
chemical weapon program and Delta a

125
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:14,890
serious blow.

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,793
All right.

127
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,440
As fucking weird man. So
we did that and, okay.

128
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:28,230
And I guess that makes the world safer
somehow. I have no fucking idea. I don't,

129
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,020
I don't understand how kids, but my
husband has made my, here's my question.

130
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,270
All right. Cause God knows I
don't fucking pay attention.

131
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,470
What if serious somehow poisoned our
food supply or cook to our economy?

132
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,083
You know

133
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,120
what the fuck are we are started a heroin
epidemic. What the in this country,

134
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,080
what will we do to them?

135
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,300
Why don't they do a drive by on some of
these fucking assholes who are allegedly

136
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,330
American Airlines, American citizens?
What the fuck they doing here?

137
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,890
Is that ever going to happen?
Fuck No.

138
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,840
Because those cons donate to
the politicians campaign funds.

139
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,000
So everything they do,
it's like it never happened.

140
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,610
Yeah.

141
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,760
And then they also advertise on
these g so called news networks.

142
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:18,220
So they never talk about this shit.
Right.

143
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,820
But if all freckles goes down
and tells the Rog me to joke,

144
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,170
all of a sudden I get in trouble.

145
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:24,660
Okay,

146
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,370
this is the world we're living in.
I'm going to keep asking questions.

147
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,440
My voice will keep going up higher.
You know what series biggest problem is?

148
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,860
It's not that they used chemical weapons
is that they didn't buy advertising on

149
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:41,970
CNN and Fox before they did it and
donate it to the standing president.

150
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:45,960
Be He a Democrat or a Republican.
And I am saying he,

151
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,990
because there's never been
a oh man as president,

152
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,000
you know,
and I'll tell you right now,

153
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,550
as long as they keep bringing women
around like fucking Hillary Clinton,

154
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:57,010
I don't think it's ever going to happen.
Okay?

155
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,990
You got to have some
level of warmth to you.

156
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,820
You can't come out there with an Al
Gore smile with, with the fucking, uh,

157
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,850
w with the Mike Dukakis.
Look on you face thinking that you get,

158
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:11,640
you're actually gonna win it. Yeah.
It has nothing to do with your policy.

159
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,620
All right? You got to come out there,
but you got to look relaxed, you know?

160
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,410
Okay.

161
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,320
You got it. You got to, you gotta
a, you look like you're comfortable.

162
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,410
Okay.

163
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,360
He can't look like you're in way
over your fucking head. You know,

164
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,130
having that look on your face, like, do
they like me? Do they really like me? Um,

165
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,590
okay.

166
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,970
I don't think there was anything more.

167
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,500
Donald Trump's scowl was as terrifying.

168
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,770
Is the Hillary Clinton does
that and maniacal fucking smile.

169
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,923
Okay.

170
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,950
Well it was just like,
I can't like just imagine,

171
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,650
imagine you're hanging out with Hillary
Clinton and you tell a joke and then she

172
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:00,920
smiles the way she fucking smiled.
You would just be like, oh my God,

173
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,680
I think this person is going to bury an
ice pick into the side of my neck. Yeah.

174
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,750
And then Trump,
it would be over there while I look at it,

175
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,330
but that look on his face. I, I still
can't believe one of them want it. Well,

176
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,180
we came down to those two,
but we did

177
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,123
okay.

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,990
But we did.
And the comedy and shoes out of me.

179
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,880
Why am I talking about foreign policy
for fucking 11 minutes when you know what

180
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:27,480
I did this weekend? I went
to Charlotte, North Carolina.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,580
All right. And I went to the
third installment of the bar,

182
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,520
still rough and rowdy. A tough man
competition. And I'll tell you right now,

183
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,470
I have,
I don't think I've had

184
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,410
okay.

185
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,020
That much fun at any
fucking show business gig.

186
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,343
Yeah.

187
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,250
Since I can remember.

188
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,660
Okay.

189
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,350
Um,

190
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,350
I want to thank David Portnoy and a dead
cats full me sit there and run my Yap

191
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,070
for four glorious hours,
over 40 fights. Dude.

192
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:03,390
Somebody would get knocked out and it
was just like get them out of here and

193
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:07,340
then someone else would go in every fight.
There was a couple of boring once.

194
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,300
Um, but other than that,
every fight was great.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,000
And if it wasn't a great fight,
it was a funny fight.

196
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,130
Like when you'd get to fatties in there
and eventually they would get gassed and

197
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:22,350
the fight would just start
going into slow motion.

198
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,620
I don't know why I didn't think to
start commentating in slow motion,

199
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,200
like slow my not slow motion.
So my voice down,

200
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,090
up to the roach,

201
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,550
I literally couldn't talk that slow
and kept up with the action. But um,

202
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,250
all right. I got to give a
shout out to the, the fight.

203
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,980
There was three fights to me that uh,
maybe even more than that,

204
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,420
my top five fights in the
night, I would say. Uh,

205
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,810
okay.

206
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,500
All right. And in no
particular order, all right.

207
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,230
I would say the Milkman,

208
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,850
his dude went in his whole promoed,

209
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:06,360
he was dressed as a milkman
drinking milk and it was just like,

210
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,550
what the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,660
And then he gets in the rank proceeds to
beat the shit out of the other guy and

212
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,240
the guy gets a standing eight count,
if I remember correctly.

213
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,430
Now don't hold me to this.

214
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:20,220
There was over 40 fights and
after the standing eight count,

215
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:24,090
this dude came running across the ring
like Tyson did in his early days when he

216
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,350
threw that overhand right.

217
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:29,370
Like he was trying to throw somebody out
at the plate from the warning track and

218
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:32,670
hit that dude who looked like fucking
geese Osby from the globe trotters.

219
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Like he literally thought he killed him.
This dude did the same thing,

220
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,090
ran across the room except did the,
the inexplicably,

221
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:42,720
he threw an upper cut with no lead jab,

222
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,620
nothing to set it up. I said, well buster
Douglas do that one time. He got half,

223
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:50,730
we led with an uppercut. It got
drilled in the face and that was it.

224
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,420
Then that the night was over.
I'll never forget this guy goes,

225
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:56,190
you never lead with an uppercut.

226
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,720
Well the Milkman proved that theory wrong.
He ran across too.

227
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,480
He did a running upper cut,
if I remember correctly,

228
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,420
and just not this guy the fuck out.

229
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:10,830
And then I understood why he was called
the milk bet cause the milkman always

230
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:14,820
still livers.
Isn't that a nice story is a great story.

231
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:18,210
And in there there was head
trauma somewhere in that
story. That was head trauma.

232
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,320
All right. Then, uh,

233
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,350
the dude who came in after the main
event dressed as the pink power ranger.

234
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,190
This guy went in dressed as a pink
power ranger, five foot nothing,

235
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,330
a pink one Xeon with little red sneakers,

236
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,500
like the kind of sneakers that, you
know, people who embrace being a nerd,

237
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,380
where now and for some reason they don't
get the shit kicked out of him like

238
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:49,120
they did when I was a kid. Instead
they get glorified, you know,

239
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,460
is a nerd power.
It is.

240
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:55,840
So he goes in there dressed as the pink
power ranger and proceeds to take like

241
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:59,650
19 or 20 jabs to the fucking
nose until he's bleeding.

242
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,840
Just basically got his face red.
He didn't get the shit kicked out of him,

243
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:07,750
but he got fucking knocked around.
So at the end of the fight,

244
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,280
the post interview fight, he's standing
there with his nose fucking bleeding.

245
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,740
I just shy of profusely

246
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,140
and they're doing the interview
and they said, we got to ask,

247
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,750
why did you come in dresses? The
Pink Power Ranger, I'm sorry,

248
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:23,920
I don't know the character's name.

249
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,230
Why didn't you come and dress
as the pink power ranger?

250
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,790
And the guy just with a straight face
just goes, because she's a bad ass bitch.

251
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,710
I fuck her any day of the week.

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,050
I Dunno if the kid understood how
funny if he understood our folly,

253
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:46,140
what he just said was the
way he delivered it. Uh,

254
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,600
I would say that that's the
next great comedic minds

255
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,370
in Hollywood because it was very Andy
Kaufman stabby nose bleeding and the way

256
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,050
he said I'd fuck already day of the week.

257
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,970
He said it like the actress that plays
that pink power ranger would be thrilled

258
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,830
with that opportunity. Like, oh my God, I
could fuck this guy any day of the week.

259
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,040
[inaudible] the whole window
of opportunity just to
open. I, I to the point,

260
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,770
I'm almost dizzy with my new options.
Uh,

261
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,870
the thrill ride against
the Bavarian Hungarian,

262
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,330
the German versus the American,

263
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:29,280
which all night long people were
in the building chanting USA, USA.

264
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,460
Anytime anybody came in,
if you wore sweatpants,

265
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:36,120
if he had on a sports bra or whatever
the fuck you had, a Bandanna,

266
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:40,440
anything that had old glory on it,
people would start chanting USA, USA.

267
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,620
Even if the other opponent was also
from the United States of America,

268
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,550
a thrill ride lost a unanimous decision.

269
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:51,900
I thought it should have been a
split decision. Um, but he, he,

270
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,540
he fought a great fight
and the German one,

271
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,510
I'm just a fucking monster of a man.
That was a great fight.

272
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,620
And,
uh,

273
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,640
and then lastly was the frat boy versus
the blue collar kid and you know,

274
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,900
you think the blue collar kids going to
fucking come in and they're just like a

275
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:12,900
Hollywood movie and show
this rich so and so.

276
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,680
You know what a fucking knuckle sandwich
tastes like or whatever the fun and

277
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,260
that's not what happened. The frat frat
boy kicked the shit out of the guy.

278
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,500
Like the guy had no fucking
answers. And then, uh,

279
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,010
a fucking, the frat boy threw a
left and he must have missed any,

280
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,450
he separated his shoulder look like,

281
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,600
and then he grabbed his shoulder
in a backup and they got the video,

282
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,400
he popped it back in himself,

283
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,300
like fucking a Mel Gibson in lethal
weapon and he wanted to continue,

284
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:52,480
but ref was like, he can't continue.
So then the blue collar guy one,

285
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,300
yeah, I don't even think, I don't
know anything. He landed a punch.

286
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,040
So in the post fight, the
frat boy, his fucking pissed.

287
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,340
He's got all his frat buddies there and
the blue collar guy talked all this shit.

288
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:05,941
Oh yeah,

289
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,850
you're bringing all your frat buddies
where they're not going to be in the ring

290
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:09,630
to save you.

291
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,300
It's just going to be you and me and I'm
going to kick the shit out of you. Well,

292
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,810
the frat kid didn't eat all his friends.
They'd beat the fuck out of that guy.

293
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,500
And uh, and the post fight, they were
interviewing the Frat kid going up.

294
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,700
I must say it's a tough loss.
And the Frat kids going,

295
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,420
I didn't lose a beat the shit out of him,
which was true.

296
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,370
And then the interviewer just kept
going. Yeah. But you know, but you lost.

297
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,070
Yeah. But you lost, he kept
going. Yeah. But you lost.

298
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:36,420
And I saw at one point the Frat kid
consider punching the interviewer and the

299
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:40,110
face and I was actually
nervous for the interview,

300
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,690
or thank God the Frat kid
didn't do that. And, um,

301
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,690
then a special mention would
be the guy who came in,

302
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,730
he looked like an angry version of
the lead singer from Maroon five.

303
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,810
And he came in and in the first
round did not throw one punch,

304
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:01,830
just put his gloves up on either
side of his head. And we were like,

305
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:03,570
what the fuck?
This is like,

306
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,310
like El Pres seemed like he
was getting upset, you know,

307
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,070
like when Dana white gets mad cause
someone doesn't put on a fight,

308
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:14,910
the crowd was bullying and all
of this shit. And then, uh,

309
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,160
the comes out for the second round and
he kind of looked over in our general

310
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:24,930
direction but not quite at us. Smiled
and winked. And I said, Oh shit,

311
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,340
he's doing the rope a dope.

312
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,820
He just let this guy rock 'em
sock 'em and tire himself out.

313
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,540
And then he went back out there and
started doing the same thing again.

314
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,160
And I'm like,
what the fuck is he doing?

315
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:39,390
But then eventually he started
throwing punches. There are three,

316
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,350
one minute rounds and by the third round,
you know,

317
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,320
he'd thrown quite a few punches and
landed quite a few, but I still,

318
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:51,321
I thought the other guy was
a clear victory for him and
the judges came back and

319
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:56,640
they gave it to them. Maroon five guy. Um,
so there's a little bit of controversy,

320
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,680
but um,
anyways,

321
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:03,000
when I was sitting there fucking ringside
about rate to announce boxing matches,

322
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,280
you know,
this is something that I actually,

323
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:09,060
it's one point in my life I wanted
to be a sports announcer. And, uh,

324
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,440
before I realized that it was a lot of
work and uh, I had no idea how to do it.

325
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:16,050
So I just was like, well, I kind
of get in trouble for making jokes.

326
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:20,690
I'll just become a comedian. How about
that? Well, I was sitting in this,

327
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,920
that fucking ring,
the civic center there,

328
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,520
whatever the hell it was and
it looked like early eight.

329
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:28,080
The crowd looked like an early
eighties wrestling crowd.

330
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,010
And when they all started chanting
USA, USA, I was just like,

331
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,960
this is so fucking surreal right now

332
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,700
to be with this level of stupidity,

333
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,780
to be sitting in the middle of this.
I like,

334
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,130
this is the type of shit.

335
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:47,030
And I'm not saying that I'm
smarter than these people all,

336
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,850
I just haven't been around that level
of stupidity since I was the peep,

337
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,680
the average age of the
person in the crowd.

338
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,980
And I would go to event like
that and I would chant USA, USA,

339
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,660
would you like my credits?

340
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,290
I went to a live taping of Morton Downey
jr show and was screaming and yelling

341
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,140
and standing up and applauding.

342
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,380
I saw dice clay in 88 at
the Worcester Centrum and,

343
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,910
and with the crowd, we all tried
to bu the opening act offstage.

344
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,590
I booed and other standup comedian
before I was a comedian. Um,

345
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,790
and common came back to bit
bite me in the ass, you know,

346
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,830
when I fucking did that Philly show.

347
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,300
So I've been there and uh,

348
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,840
to be in an event like that, a tough man
event when everybody was chanting USA,

349
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,530
USA was so fucking surreal.
Um,

350
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,690
and I just pictured all these fucking,
you know,

351
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:54,640
all these liberal people fucking being
disgusted with it and it just struck me

352
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:58,270
as really funny and uh,
I dunno,

353
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,690
it took me back to,
I hadn't thought about,

354
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,230
I actually had to look the guy's name up.

355
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,080
Unfortunately Morton Downey jr I
couldn't remember his fucking name,

356
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,730
which is another reason why I'm so happy
I got married and had a kid because

357
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:13,510
that guy was so god damn famous and I was
such a huge fan of his in somewhere in

358
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:14,560
the back of my closet.

359
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:19,561
I still have a sweatshirt from that
go to the Morton Downey jr I got that.

360
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:24,050
I got up, this is what I did in
the 80s I went to that. I have a,

361
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,380
a bud man hoodie.

362
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,210
Do you remember when they used to have a,
a superhero for Budweiser?

363
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,490
I have that and I have a
Stevie Ray Vaughan tank top.

364
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,850
I didn't get to tee shirt. I got the
tank top because it was the eighties,

365
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:43,300
and I wanted to show off my pasty guns,
you know,

366
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,320
cause nobody did squats. Everybody just
did upper body in the eighties, uh,

367
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,870
from the instep Tor. Uh, that's what
I have left from the fucking eighties.

368
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:57,550
But anyways, um, I came in with
a fuck I was going with that,

369
00:22:57,551 --> 00:23:00,370
but it was, it was amazing.
And I want to go back

370
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,070
to that venue and I want to do a stand up
show in the round, in the middle of it.

371
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,110
That's how much I enjoyed
performing there. Uh,

372
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,420
I mean actually announcing that
it's how much I enjoyed the arena.

373
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:15,580
So I want to thank everybody
that came out. Once again,

374
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,640
thanks to everybody at Barstool,
if they'll have me again,

375
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,090
I would absolutely in a heartbeat I would,
I would, I would do it again because a,

376
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,680
that was just my first one
and I think I was funny,

377
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,470
but I think I could be a lot funnier.
I just had to,

378
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:33,490
it was just a lot of shit to take
it. It's like, what do I do here? Do.

379
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:38,200
I actually announced the fight. I
don't know shit about fighting. Right.

380
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,360
Do I just try to be funny?
And then I also had to figure out how,

381
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:47,780
you know Dan, Dave worked so I
wouldn't be in the fucking way.

382
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:52,100
So I kind of,
I thought towards the end got funnier.

383
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:53,770
So we'll see.
We'll see if I get an a,

384
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:56,930
if I get another shuttle I
would definitely do it. And
you guys, she got to fight.

385
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,980
You know, I want to thank everybody that
ordered it too, cause I think they, uh,

386
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,990
I think that was their best one as far
as, as far as what I heard. Anyways,

437
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,850
I'm taking the photo today for my tour,

438
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,280
which is simply called 50. You
know why? Cause I'm a rap fan. No,

439
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,040
because I'm turning 50 in June.
Um,

440
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,090

444
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:47,920

You just take the thing,

446
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,920
you put it on the scale, it figures
out what it was, then you're typing,

447
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:58,300
you're stupid. Does Zip Code. It's going
to and magically it gives you the answer.

448
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,950
It's like sitting next to a smart kid
that's not covering up his fucking test.

449
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:04,570
Okay,

microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeofbirdthatstamps.com
enter
bar.

454
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,730
Do you remember when you try to look at
some smart kids fucking test and he'd

455
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:24,250
cover it up?
You know,

456
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,070
and he'd get mad at them because
they did the fucking work.

457
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,110
I don't know where I stand with that.
I used to hate it when I was in school,

458
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,610
but now when I think about it,

459
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,230
the fact that that person did the
work and then I just want to show up.

460
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,410
I mean,
it's very,

461
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,960
the very least I could have offered
the kids something like, Hey,

462
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:50,740
I'll buy a buy an extra bag of chips at
lunch or some shit. You know what I mean?

463
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:51,730
Or whatever the fuck you want.

464
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,183
Yeah.

465
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,030
What, whatever. Whatever they used to
sell. They're right. All the junk food,

466
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,290
that's all they had was junk food.
They had a shitty meal and then they had,

467
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,910
it was like cookies, potato
chips, just a bunch of shit.

468
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,990
And I remember like for lunch
sometimes if I didn't like the lunch,

469
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,020
I would just take my lunch money and I
would buy all junk food and people would

470
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:21,520
say, dude, you're going to get a bunch
of Zits iffy like dad. And I was like,

471
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,950
I don't think I'm gonna. You
know, what am I going to do?

472
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,300
Have an apple and then get bullied.

473
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,220
He's eaten an apple, you know,
insert a homophobic shit after that.

474
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,590
All right,
let's talk some sports here.

475
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,340
Now I know this is a weird time
for most people in most cities.

476
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:44,590
Your hockey and your basketball team
are done for the year and now you're

477
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:47,080
looking at your baseball team,
but when you live

478
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,240
okay

479
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,800
in the city of champions,

480
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,790
or at least you were from there and
nobody won a championship until you left

481
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,600
like me. Well, the Celtics and the
Bruins went to when I was a little kid.

482
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,550
I don't remember. Although I did have
this little Bobby your sweatshirt.

483
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,360
My mother saves everything. I got
to find that thing. Oh my God.

484
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,100
That would be great.
Find that thing.

485
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,010
Put It on my cute little daughter. Take
a picture. Oh God. I got to find that.

486
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:16,950
Anyways. Um, if you live
in the city of champions,

487
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,460
not only did your basketball team
was 17 championships when it,

488
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,480
y'all hockey team was six
Stanley cups also one,

489
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,390
well maybe made it to the playoffs.
Let's start.

490
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,290
Let's start with the Boston Bruins.

491
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,920
They're up two games to none against
the original six Toronto Maple leafs who

492
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:38,250
are trying desperately
to end a 51 year drought.

493
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,720
I am a fan of the Toronto Maple leafs.
If the Toronto may police get bias,

494
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:45,270
I will root for them.
Okay.

495
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:50,130
I would like the suffering
to end in Toronto. All right.

496
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,750
I would also like us to beat them. I
want us to beat them first. However,

497
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:59,040
if they do beat us, then that will be
my team. All right. Having said that,

498
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,060
you got your acids quit in the
first two games of this series.

499
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,330
I mean just, it was easy. I mean I,

500
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,330
I'm not going to say it was the
first two periods of game two.

501
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,190
We're a little shit, little scary
period. One of the first game,

502
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,110
you know,
that 51 when he did that,

503
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,970
that fucking slap shot
from the fucking Blue Line,

504
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,820
that laser that hit the crossbar.

505
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,450
I was thinking like this game can turn
at any second and I kind of felt that way

506
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,950
for a lot of the second game.

507
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,720
It just never did because we have a guy
named David Pasta, knock on our team,

508
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:35,550
who's I would say at this point is
just shy of becoming a superstar.

509
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,230
The guy's got nine points in two games
he's making. It's so ridiculously easy.

510
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,240
He fucking scored the last goal.

511
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,650
He put the puck between his legs like
he was fucking around before the game.

512
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,583
Ooh,

513
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,060
right.
They should have been glove Tara music.

514
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,620
That's the second globe trotter
fucking reference. Yeah,

515
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,140
in the same podcast. Within a half
hour, 31 minutes. 32 minutes. Excuse me.

516
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,460
You find another podcast out there that's
going to bring up [inaudible] and then

517
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:10,600
swing is, it's fucking in a false set of
votes voice getting to talk right now.

518
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,890
Sig Sweet Georgia Brown. Huh? You tell me,

519
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,571
you tell me,

520
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,840
you show me a podcast that does that
and I will show you a more successful

521
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,930
podcast. And this one, uh,

522
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,270
nine points that whole fucking life.

523
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,750
Fucking Birger rod my Sean Pasta knock
and we're playing great defense to cause,

524
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,570
but you know,
making some incredible saves.

525
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:39,840
She can tell right now that I haven't
watched a lot of games this year.

526
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,150
All I know is that the front office of
the Boston Bruins has not gotten the

527
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:48,660
credit they deserve for the incredible
rebuild that they did it. This team,

528
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,490
they got rid of everybody.
Oh look who's here.

529
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,403
Hi.

530
00:32:59,170 --> 00:32:59,370
Yeah.

531
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,730
Oh, okay. Oh, so then what?

532
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:07,320
I have to watch my beautiful
little baby girl. Oh. Boohoo. Oh,

533
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:12,150
poor me. Okay. Come on. All
right. All right. No worries.

534
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,400
Yeah.
All right buddy.

535
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,963
Okay.

536
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,170
All right. Anyways. Okay.

537
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:24,960
Bye Bye. I just gotta wait til she leaves.
I don't say any bad words in front of,

538
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,260
um, anyway, so the vacuum ruins, uh,

539
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,160
we got rid of like
the whole fucking team basically.

540
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,970
Okay.

541
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,860
Other than Ciara, um, Marshawn and, and,

542
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:43,240
and Berge on,
essentially

543
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,620
as far as our big stars, we got rid of
Johnny boy, Chuck Ballade, Luci styles,

544
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,890
Sagan, Douggie, Hamilton, Tim Thomas.
We can get rid of the coach Clo Julian.

545
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,430
We got rid of everybody. And I
was thinking like, wow. All right.

546
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:59,490
I tried to put a positive spin on it.

547
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,460
I like watching a rebuild and
all of that stuff, which I was,

548
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:07,140
I watched him all this time until this
year when it all came together, you know,

549
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,720
but I have a good excuse, you know, you've
got the kid, what am I supposed to do?

550
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:14,400
Huh? Not go out there and
play with my kid. Course.

551
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:19,380
I got to do that. But, um, I dunno.
Where were like really young.

552
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,580
We're really fast

553
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,110
and then we still have some veterans and
then we get some other guys that have,

554
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:28,080
you know, yeah, we got some like

555
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,890
guys that have a plane like six,
seven years. It's just as great mix.

556
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:38,460
And then all these young kids that are
just flying around the fucking ice and uh,

557
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,380
I dunno what we're going to
do this year in the playoffs.

558
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,000
It's looking good so far, but, uh,

559
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:46,470
I am liking the future and speaking
about the feet. Speaking of the future,

560
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,420
the Boston Celtics,
that's what you're watching.

561
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:52,380
That's out on the court
because everybody's fucking
hurt. Kyrie Irving's out,

562
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,370
Marcus smarts out. And you know
what? I totally forgot about that.

563
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:59,760
Gordon Hayward kid played fucking
half a quarter of this year.

564
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,220
He's coming back next year. So I'm just
watching the Celtics this year too,

565
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,800
to see like a, as far as the
playoffs to see like Tatum rosier,

566
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,690
Jaylen Brown, all of these guys
getting all this, this, uh,

567
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,160
just quality minutes in the playoffs.
It's just going to help us in the future.

568
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:20,491
And you know,

569
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:23,340
I don't think that we were going to
get by Cleveland or even Toronto.

570
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,230
Toronto looks unbelievable.

571
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:30,231
But my favorite thing in the NBA playoffs
right now is the name of the Milwaukee

572
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,920
Bucks coach Joe Prunty. I swear to
God, every time they say it, it's like,

573
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:37,140
did they just say conti?
And I don't know why,

574
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:41,260
but if there was a drinking game that
every time they said Joe Prunty and the

575
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:44,080
broadcast that I watched,
um,

576
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,670
I would have been shit faced by the
end of the first quarter. Joe Prunty,

577
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,480
I guess. What's his face? Um, I can't
remember his fucking name either.

578
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,400
Jason Kidd. I don't know what
happened to him. Uh, he was there.

579
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:04,420
I don't know why he's not there. And,
uh, it's going to be great to watch.

580
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:09,421
I don't know how many games against
the boxing Yanis on Tito come.

581
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:13,360
Paul Anti-tau camp off CDC.

582
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,320
Um, we actually, you
know what, let me get,

583
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:21,340
let me get the proper pronunciation of
that. That was a fucking great game.

584
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,660
I mean, it's, it's, you can't,

585
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:26,350
as a Celtics fan not be disappointed
when you're watching it.

586
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,300
Seeing all our big guns
on the bench being like,

587
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:32,320
we would be kicking the shit out of this
fucking team if everybody was healthy.

588
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,170
Um,
Yannis on,

589
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,540
uh, take two compo, we say
you say this guy's fucking

590
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,740
pro nuns.
Cea Shun Ncaa Shun.

591
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:52,740
Here we go. All right. Oh,

592
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,810
Yanis himself is going to
explain. Here we go. Come on.

593
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,540
Oh my internet sucks.
My Internet's slow.

594
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,560
Wait, you got to see with a d. So I did,

595
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,810
but in the Greek way you saying with
the NC like answered to consult.

596
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,980
So I change myself. I'll give it as a
way, even going to say the last name.

597
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,420
Uh, whatever you or what have you got,
just say no, it's the, that it's a combo.

598
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,330
Not this young Auntie to come

599
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,280
on day two compo. You can say it with
a t of the d. You've got to love that.

600
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,920
The guy has that difficult last name.
He's like, Hey, I don't give a shit.

601
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,080
I don't give a shit.
I'm just going to be dominating the game.

602
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,610
That's another thing too,
was uh,

603
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,310
I get to watch this guy
for a number of games too.

604
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,680
I think he might be the next
one. You know, once Lebron,

605
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,610
Lebron ever gets old, I would say
this guy's going to be the next one.

606
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,990
It's going to be a,

607
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,150
well maybe it'll be Kevin Durant and then
amp as far as like the best guy in the

608
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:59,170
league. And I'm saying
that having, not really,

609
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:03,460
I don't really know shit about hoop.
You know, what the fuck am I? Why?

610
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:05,380
Why do you guys listen to,
so I don't know shit about boxing.

611
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,850
I'm commentating about it. I don't
know shit about foreign policy yet.

612
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:11,290
I'm talking about that.

613
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,850
Asking why we're not having
missile strikes on corporations.

614
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,950
Um, alright. Hippie music. Let's
do some reads here for the week.

615
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,730
We're going to do a couple of reads
here for the week. Oh, by the way,

616
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,140
I have to admit,
I got a,

617
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,220
I got to become a Jimmy Swaggart
had Billy swagger as far as my,

618
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:35,221
remember I said I was going to be vice
free 16 days and actually the final two

619
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:41,440
days in March is when I started this.
But I said I was going to be vice free.

620
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,520
Uh, I got to go a little Jimmy Swaggart
here. I have sinned against you.

621
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,370
I fucked up Saturday night.
I went out with my lady

622
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,140
and um,

623
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,320
we went out to go see some
live music at this little club,

624
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,890
uh, slash dive bar that we
really love going to. And uh,

625
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,120
we went there and he was like, come on
man, you're not going to have a drink.

626
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,490
You're not going to have a drink.
And I'm like, Nah, you know,

627
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:15,520
I told my podcast listeners I was going
to blah, blah, blah. And she's like,

628
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:19,980
come on. Yeah. What fucking trigger?
I said, fine, you want me to fucking,

629
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,470
I was really annoyed with it because,
uh, I realized how weak I was.

630
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:26,440
Do you want me to fucking
take a fucking drink? Right.

631
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,730
So I ordered some food and then I had
ordered a club soda with a lime and then I

632
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:32,920
was just like, if she doesn't
bring up having a drink again,

633
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:36,790
I'm not going to order one. All right. I
don't want to throw away all these days.

634
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,350
Right. So she finally just
goes, look, can he does,

635
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:43,930
he's just have a hit of weed or
something like that. And I was like,

636
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:47,350
I don't fucking like weed or whatever. And
she just, and I just find said, fuck it,

637
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:47,861
I'll do it.

638
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:52,390
So I went outside the place and I took
four hits off of this fucking joint.

639
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,710
And I hate weed. I just don't
fucking like it. And I go inside.

640
00:39:56,711 --> 00:40:00,220
And what happens every time I smoke weed
is I just get sleepy and I want to go

641
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:03,280
to bed.
So I'm watching this amazing band,

642
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,870
incredibly musicians, and they could
also sync too, which is a plus.

643
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,730
Um, but sounded like a, I like, I
like you were listening to a record.

644
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:16,300
They were so good and they ended up
doing a cover of a led Zeppelin since I'd

645
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:19,150
been loving you,
um,

646
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,300
that led Zeppelin would
have been proud of.

647
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,930
And I'm sitting there in the corner
of the bar being like, hey man,

648
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:27,900
I just want to go to
bed, man. Like, you know,

649
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,840
I think my pillow is like my best
friend, man. And I just, you know, so,

650
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,760
so I blew it. But you know what, I didn't
drink and yesterday was the big tests.

651
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,650
Cause now that I've, I fucked
up the whole month, I feel, um,

652
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,710
I'm just like, well well
now what? So now do I drink?

653
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,380
So last night I was thinking why might as
well have a fucking drink as I blew it,

654
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,930
I say I don't be a pussy.
Had a couple of hits of fucking weed.

655
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,000
It didn't enjoy it and he came home
and you went to bed. So whatever,

656
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,730
I hit one hurdle.
All right,

657
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:59,920
I've jumped over all the other
ones and I'm going to keep going.

658
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:03,340
Plus Ios also sober for
the last two days of March.

659
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,890
So,
uh,

660
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,600
but I still didn't make a month then I
basically made a, was that two days ago?

661
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:15,220
14 I, I went to 16 days. I don't give a
shit. I'm going to keep fucking going.

662
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:18,610
So whatever. I blew it. I blew it, man.

663
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:22,420
I gave into peer pressure from my wife,
you know,

664
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,000
she always ends up
knocking me off the wagon.

665
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:30,030
The Emma one time I went a year and
two days without a booze and we were,

666
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:35,270
we were in, uh, Norway at this fancy
fucking restaurant and it had like a,

667
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,070
like a 12 course meal.

668
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,980
All these little bites kept coming
out and I was just laughing going,

669
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:43,100
we're never going to get full. And
by the eighth loan it was like, wow,

670
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,880
I think I'm going to Puke. And they
just kept coming and then the end,

671
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,340
they came out with this
cheese plate for dessert.

672
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,070
That's when you know you're a ritzy
fucking place in another country.

673
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,570
Dessert is cheese. It's like you
eat cheese for dessert. Really?

674
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,610
And it was says pungent stings
the nostrils, anchorman level,

675
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:05,840
fucking Cologne. But it was cheese.
And Nia took one bite was like,

676
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:07,280
I can't fucking no way.

677
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,290
So I started taking giant bites out
of it and she was going to cut it out.

678
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:15,020
Don't tell him you're going to get sick.
And my eyes were watering,

679
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,620
my nose was running.
But her reaction,

680
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:22,250
how concerned she was for me was making
me laugh so hard that I ate the whole

681
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:26,510
fucking cheese plate. And it was, it was
fucking disgusting. But in that meal,

682
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:30,830
she knocked me off the wagon.
She's done it to me a number of times.

683
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,480
What I'm trying to say is
that I'm sitting, she's Nancy,

684
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,840
but I won't kill her someday.
Um,

685
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,910
so anyways,
but I have to admit that I really like,

686
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,530
uh, you know, the mornings
are the best. I wake up,

687
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:52,070
I feel good. I work out, you know,

688
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,330
they just four hits a week. The next
morning I woke up, I felt like shit.

689
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,080
I just felt like I needed to squeegee
my goddamn brains. So, um, I dunno,

690
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,280
maybe she reminded me why I'm doing this.
So I,

691
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,460
I think I'm going to do this right through
to my birthday and then I'm going to

692
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:11,810
be on vacation. Everybody, I'm doing
it. I'm doing a show in Dublin, Ireland,

693
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,750
and then I'm doing, um,
Royal Albert Hall in,

694
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,560
um, which I can't believe in London,
England, and then denim on vacation.

695
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,630
And, uh, for the next 10 days
or whatever, if I want a drink,

696
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:31,290
I'm gonna drink. If I want to smoke a
cigar here or there, I'm going to do that.

697
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,770
And then when I come back, I think I'm
going to jump right back on the wagon.

698
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,930
I'm going to try that.

699
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,260
That's what I'm going to try to do because
I'm eating well and I'm keeping the

700
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:43,170
weight off. And uh, who's kidding who?

701
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,260
I became a dad real late in
life and I'd like to be around,

702
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,030
so I got to shut down the
party a little bit. Right.

703
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,210
That's another great thing about
having a kid. If I didn't have a kid,

704
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:59,040
I probably would Ford have shaved
a good 15 years off my life. Uh Oh.

705
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,530
But what a fun time I would
have. All right, let's read some,

706
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,440
let's read some of the,
um,

707
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,060
yeah,

708
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,710
some of them use some of the, uh, music.
Oh, hippie music. That's why sit music.

709
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:12,740
Some of the questions here for this week,
by the way, did anybody see the, uh,

710
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,200
Andre the giant speaking of
civics says the Andre the giant,

711
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,940
uh, documentary. You gotta check it out.

712
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,320
Yeah.

713
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,010
You got to check that out.
My favorite part was, um,

714
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,050
yeah,

715
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,370
I guess in the locker room,

716
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:33,510
the only thing they in a locker
room were wrestlers and uh,

717
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,370
and the referees. No one else was
allowed in there. And he would,

718
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,770
and Andre would always be
in there playing cards.

719
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,500
And what I loved was when they actually
had footage of somebody walking in there

720
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:51,470
with the camera and Andre the giant
standing up just going for God.

721
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,860
God Damn big foot.
That's when he had the fro.

722
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,560
Uh, he stood up and the person
just ran out with the camera.

723
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:05,220
That was my favorite fucking part.
Seeing a giant angry.

724
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,760
Usually that's a gentle giant,
but actually seeing him fucking upset.

725
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:14,580
Uh, sorry. All right guys.

726
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,980
Sorry about that. I'm supposed
to fucking live and up your weak.

727
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,160
Not Make you want to put your head down
to your desk. All right. Hippie music.

728
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:24,240
Blind spot followup.
Not original writer,

729
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,470
a Billy red tits.

730
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,490
Saw Your First Cincinnati show
with two friends last Saturday.

731
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:32,250
You absolutely killed prime burr.

732
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,990
This is why you're the greatest living
comedian. Ah, wow. Isn't that nice?

733
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,740
And he said, okay, let me take, let me
take your dick out of my mouth. Why?

734
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:43,600
Why did guys always feel like,
you know,

735
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,610
they get all fucking homophobic
out if they compliment another man,

736
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:52,140
they always have to say, hey
man, Yay. That's a nice shirt.
No Homo. It's just like,

737
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:54,060
well dude,
I've known you for 20 years.

738
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:58,380
I would think if you would have fucking
made a move at this point, you know,

739
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,020
you could just say nice shirt.
Um,

740
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,830
as per the most recent
Monday morning podcast,

741
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,240
I'm writing to seek to second
John Fishermen of fish.

742
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:13,410
As a drummer, you need to pay attention
to. You asked for start. All right,

743
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:16,760
this is it. I'm going to fucking get
into fish. You asked for started albums.

744
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,330
I submit a live release.

745
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:23,331
You should start with live double album
alive one or a studio circuit in 1993.

746
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:28,960
Rift rift is my favorite album.
It's a concept album. Oh, I right.

747
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,230
You know what I'm doing right now.
I'm fucking,

748
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,180
I'm going to download it right now so
I don't forget. All right, here we go.

749
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,370
I tuned stork.
I'm old.

750
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:43,170
I know you guys all use a cooler
fucking downloading site. All right.

751
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:48,120
Fish with a p. H. R. I. F.
T. Let's see if I can get it.

752
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:52,380
Where is it? Where is
it? Rifts. Nine 99 Bam.

753
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,750
Clicked.
Why

754
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,450
downloading? All right. There we go.

755
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,750
I took your advice. All
right, the picture of nectars.

756
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:09,070
Another good one would be
my second favorite covers
of all genres and covers all

757
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:12,890
genres including jazz, country,
Calypso, rock and roll. In Neo,

758
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:17,440
Psychedelia man. Uh,
according to Wikipedia,

759
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:20,530
I can't listen to psychedelic music
because this is a small part in me that

760
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,560
really wants to try mushrooms. And when
I get, when I listen to that music,

761
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:24,430
I always think like,

762
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:29,431
how much more intense would this be if
I felt like I could hold my in my hand a

763
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:31,960
name for neck too,
you know,

764
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,400
but I'll never do psychedelics because
you can't have to be home when you do it.

765
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,550
But now I got a kid so I can't,
I can't be tripping with a kid.

766
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,411
Can't do that.

767
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:45,880
That's when social services comes by and
takes you fucking kid named for nectars

768
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:47,620
bar in Burlington,
Vermont.

769
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,520
That's what the album is named after where
they were the house band starting off

770
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:55,840
their careers. Anyway, love your shit
and site to hear your thoughts on John.

771
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:59,650
Fishermen fish drumming to me,

772
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:02,080
they belong in music history books,

773
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:07,081
but we'd love to get Billy rowdy
red's take on it signed from Kentucky.

774
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,290
All right, cool. Oh, I love, I already
loved the title of this one here.

775
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,970
Why I need an Ar 15 all right.
All you Hollywood liberals.

776
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:16,960
Listen Up.

777
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,920
I asked people in the middle of the
country or just outside of Los Angeles,

778
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:26,020
which a lot of people in La specifically
Hollywood consider in the middle of

779
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:28,120
fucking nowhere,
right?

780
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,630
Until they have a movie premiere
and then they go down there.

781
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:34,240
We love you from Bakersfield.
Okay.

782
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,010
Why I need an Ar 15 I just listened to
you talk about not knowing why anyone

783
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:43,300
would need an ar 15 I did say that in
an insulting way. You country. Fuck.

784
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,570
All right. I'm just saying,
you know what I mean?

785
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:50,530
If like you know for home
defense is just funny to me.

786
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:55,531
It's just like how much of an asshole
are you that you need an ar 15 for home

787
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:57,910
defense that basically on it,

788
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:02,800
you're such a cunt that on any given
night that fucking hit squad from at the

789
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:07,801
end of Scarface is going to come over
your fucking fence that you need to mow

790
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:12,880
them down. You need to basically, you
know the fucking Bazooka. Anyways.

791
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:17,881
The reason I need an ar 15 is because I
have a small flock of sheep and I live

792
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:22,540
in coyote country. Coyotes, you live
in Phoenix. Coyote won't really,

793
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,150
coyotes won't really harm
an animal as big as a cow,

794
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,800
but she per goats are fair game to them.
When coyote is attack and packs,

795
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,010
they tend to attack in groups
of seven to 12 individuals.

796
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:38,200
Jesus Christ, the fuck to you
live. We have coyotes out here.

797
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,150
They've usually impacts the twos even
though I am less cause they're all in some

798
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:48,040
Hollywood diet. Most of them die of
Anorexia so that she just packs of twos.

799
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,520
Even though I am a fairly good shot at
trying to hit a moving target without

800
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:55,090
hitting my sheep means that
I might miss several times.

801
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:01,470
I need the magazine capacity of the Ar
15 or a similar gun because I only have

802
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:06,430
four milking use.
So you said you use,

803
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,870
what is a ute? Ewee s
ah, Jesus fucking Christ.

804
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,900
I mean this is an easy one,
but I'm not a farmer man.

805
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,010
Use pro none.
Ch Pronunciation.

806
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:24,790
What a show pronunciation. Here we go. All
right, here we go. It's how you say it.

807
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,040
Come

808
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,873
on.

809
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,450
Ew.
Ew.

810
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,543
Ew.

811
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,810
Did he need to do it three times?
How fucking dumb I am.

812
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:45,380
I you.
How do you say you?

813
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:51,630
You? Oh, you all right. You,

814
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,623
you

815
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:55,340
okay?

816
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,490
You all right? He did a subtle
different read on the second one.

817
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,740
Ew.
Ew.

818
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,270
Oh God. What's happening now?
Sounds like I'm hungry. Oh,

819
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:11,290
50 word mistakes.
Hello and welcome back.

820
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:16,380
In this lesson I will show you 50 words
that you are probably pronouncing you

821
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,430
correctly right now. And I'll also
teach you how to say them correctly.

822
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:26,620
Oh, I thought you would just
say how to say I'm wrong
yet. How do you say it? Well,

823
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,070
we say pronounce
pronounced and pronouncing,

824
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,630
but pronunciation.
There's no known in this world.

825
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:38,260
It's pronunciate.
Nobody says pronounciation.

826
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,130
You fucking click big content
cat.

827
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,580
There's no og in there.
It's cat.

828
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,300
All right. Why? I needed a or 15 okay,

829
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:54,040
so these coyotes come down in
packs of seven to 12 oh my God.

830
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:57,100
And his use use.

831
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,950
Okay.

832
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,870
You are fucking running
around gay. I mean,

833
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,580
what a fucking exciting morning.

834
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,950
Jesus Christ.
That's like the ultimate video game.

835
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,830
So then you fucking
blow these things away.

836
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,480
And then what do you
feed them to the pigs?

837
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,983
Yeah,

838
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,530
that is it.
You know,

839
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,510
if you all these fucking assholes
crossfit running down the fucking street,

840
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,620
like they're doing something.

841
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,380
This guy is inside watching deputy dog,
you know,

842
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,440
[inaudible] bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

843
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,110
do. Right. And all of a sudden he
hears one of his use going, hey,

844
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,340
come on over there.
Right?

845
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:45,230
And then he's got to come out there
with this fucking machine gun get.

846
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:49,490
So can you show, get some,
I'll tell you this right now.

847
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,210
If I knew, if I could fucking rent
a helicopter big enough and I go,

848
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,690
we could open a door and you could
fucking shoot him from up there.

849
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:59,930
I would fly you around your own property,
sir,

850
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,210
while you did this with your Fuckin ar 15.
Um,

851
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:09,290
anyways,
I need a magazine capacity of a,

852
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:13,340
of the Ar 15 or similar gun because
I only have four milking use,

853
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,940
use,
use,

854
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,720
and I produced Pheta and Parmesan cheese.
What a good shit.

855
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,430
I love both of those cheeses.

856
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:26,720
Thank you for producing that so I
can eat it if I lose a single. Ew,

857
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,900
ew.
Ew.

858
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,520
That represents a significant percentage
of my income for the year. My Shit.

859
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,660
That's,
you know.

860
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,750
Okay.

861
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,280
All these Hollywood liberals,
I swear to God,

862
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:42,270
if you stole their fucking Yoga Mat or
threatened to cut off the fucking man bun,

863
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,670
I bet every one of them
get a fucking ar 15. Uh,

864
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,920
but they put pink bullets in it.
Uh,

865
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,210
my sheepdog can hold the
coyotes off for a little while,

866
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,260
but not forever. That's a fucking,
that dog's got heart, Huh?

867
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,600
Holding off 12 fucking coyotes.

868
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,940
That's like when Magic
Johnson played every position.

869
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:10,910
Other farmers in more Western states
need the Ar 15 to protect from mountain

870
00:54:10,911 --> 00:54:15,530
lions or wolves. So when someone
said no one needs an ar 15,

871
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,390
I guess they think that I'm nobody.

872
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,390
Ah,

873
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,010
you're a somebody.
You make the cheese.

874
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,770
Why did you have to go that route?

875
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:28,620
You proved your point and now you're
trying to make everybody feel bad for you.

876
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:34,170
Oh, he wrote, I am somebody. This is
hilarious. This is like self help.

877
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,100
I guess they think that I'm nobody.

878
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:41,160
I am somebody and I have a
legitimate need for an ar 15. Oh,

879
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:44,850
let's clap round of applause.
That was just textbook.

880
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,130
How was he supposed to do?
Let those use get killed

881
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,560
and then little kids can't put parmesan
cheese on their fucking Rigatoni.

882
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,050
God bless you sir.
God bless you.

883
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,200
Your ar 15 and the
wonderful cheese you make,

884
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,140
what do you do with all the dead coyotes?

885
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,603
Huh?

886
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,950
Man, this guy's the man that's fucking
living out there. I made the first one,

887
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:15,640
the first one. Yelped when you fucking
shot it, I would feel like an asshole.

888
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,320
However though I would know good and
God damn well that if I didn't make the

889
00:55:20,321 --> 00:55:22,740
cheese then I would be living outside.
Next thing you know,

890
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,950
those pack of seven to 12
would be coming at me. Right?

891
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,430
I'm going to take a fucking bite out of
my flat fucking freckled pasty behind.

892
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,580
Can't have that. Good for you, sir.

893
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,390
I'm glad they've that did a weapon so you
can keep making the cheese and you can

894
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:42,100
afford to keep, you know, paying the bank
or cunts. God bless you. I'm convinced.

895
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,840
All right girl. That's a great fucking
argument. That argument is nowhere.

896
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,710
You know what it is, is smart people
never take surveys. They never get on TV.

897
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,860
So all you get disease more on or school.

898
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,950
Well, one of the government
were over sudden not to be
nice to me and I needed to

899
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,800
fight them off.
We're therapists sixteens and their tanks.

900
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,440
I made it for home
protection. Uh, why I, okay.

901
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,760
Girl at bar used my phone
to Venmo herself, $300.

902
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:13,700
Now I don't know what Venmo is,
but uh,

903
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,400
this guy basically explains it
dear Billy Bass on the wall.

904
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,313
Um,

905
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,750
the other night I was at this bar with a
few buddies and we started talking to a

906
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:25,070
group,
this group of girls,

907
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,760
I was hitting on this one girl and we
talked for a little more than an hour.

908
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:32,090
Her friends then said they were
leaving and so before she left,

909
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:36,050
I asked if I could ever number.
She said yes and she asks him,

910
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:40,420
I phoned a porter to put in
or number or so I thought, oh,

911
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,300
well she's putting in her number.

912
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:46,060
I wasn't really paying attention
and started talking to my buddy.

913
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:48,940
Next thing I know she's handing
back the phone and saying goodbye.

914
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,160
I told her I'll text her later this
week and try and set something up.

915
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,040
Well, the next day I went to look
for a number and I couldn't find it.

916
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,600
I searched and searched,

917
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:01,500
but the number was not in my
phone as a little disappointed.

918
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,440
But stuff like that happens all the time.
See, this is why this guy gets late.

919
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:09,670
He shakes it off. That's why when he
fuck are you gonna do take another swing,

920
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:14,440
right? A few days later, I
went to Venmo, a coworker,

921
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:18,730
money for lunch and it might
trans in my recent transactions,

922
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:23,620
I see a $300 payment made
to that girl from the bar.

923
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,950
Well, now you get your current
contact info. Uh, Hey lady,

924
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:29,790
this is what's going to happen.

925
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,790
Either you're going to fuck me or I'm
going to get my $300 back. By the way,

926
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:35,400
you're paying for dinner.
Uh, with my money.

927
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,430
That bitch took my phone and Venmo herself
300 bucks while pretending to give me

928
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,090
her phone number.

929
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:43,920
Okay?

930
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,510
I gotta be honest with you if,
if,

931
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:49,710
if that was her plan the entire night

932
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,770
and she was nice enough to make you
then ask for her phone number. I mean,

933
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:59,460
that's fucking amazing. It's
disgusting. But it's amazing. He said,

934
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:02,730
I of course was furious and immediately
thought of reporting her to the police

935
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:04,470
and to the people who work at Venmo.

936
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:08,340
But I thought nothing will get resolved
because how can I prove I didn't send

937
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:12,180
her the money
and I easily tell your story.

938
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,793
Right?

939
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:21,160
Um, you got to do Sabbath. He said, Hey, I
think you've got to do something. Anyways.

940
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:23,920
He goes also, I kind of respect the
move. It's a piece of shit move,

941
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:27,200
but pretty clever. It is
pretty God damn clever. Uh,

942
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,890
what would you do in this situation?
Uh,

943
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,900
I probably just eat the 300 bucks.
Take it as a life lesson.

944
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,700
I never liked go after people. I just
don't, I don't do it. I'm just like, wow,

945
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,490
you know, I learned a fucking
lesson. I won't do that again.

946
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,710
He said I could try
and get the money back.

947
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:47,230
But do you think the effort and
the hassle outweighs the reward?

948
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,900
I think he should do it
because it's actually a crime.

949
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,450
She stole money from you and uh,
you know,

950
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:58,563
I dunno.

951
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,290
Or You just let her keep doing it and
then one day she gets caught and she

952
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:06,460
fucking goes to jail because she find me
not going to stop at this. I would say,

953
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:06,731
you know,

954
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:11,731
something considering this whole fucking
new movement of just trashing guys all

955
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:15,730
the time and always making women
out to be the victim. It'd be nice,

956
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:17,620
a little publicity out there that,
you know,

957
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:22,260
women have the ability to also
be pieces of shit. Uh, so yeah,

958
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:24,840
let's even it out a little
bit. I would go after, fuck it,

959
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,840
I said $300 isn't gonna make or break me,

960
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:32,190
but I do need to stand up for guys who
wouldn't be able to pay their rent if a

961
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:36,070
girl did it to them. Right. Any advice
helps and go fuck yourself. Yeah,

962
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,910
I'd go after, at the very least, you know,

963
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:40,980
even if you don't get your
money back just to fucking,

964
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,220
it's good that you got that information
out there. So there you go fellas.

965
00:59:44,221 --> 00:59:48,150
When somebody says, I'll put
my number in your phone. Um,

966
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,250
but you don't want to say don't do that,
cause then they might be a,

967
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,300
and that can affect and give it to
you. Well, you know, Chaffey second.

968
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,170
Um, I would just, I would use this
guy's story. I always just say, well,

969
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,420
the last time I did this,
uh,

970
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,110
the woman took my phone and Venmo
herself $300 out of my account,

971
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,510
so I'm just a little paranoid.

972
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:14,610
So what we me give you their
number of the time. Yeah, they do.

973
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,693
Okay,

974
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,480
you're going to get me my number. He or
am I just going to go home and jerk off?

975
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,890
What's your, you know, whatever. I
don't know. You guys figure it out.

976
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:29,690
I'm not in this world anymore. All right.
I go to bed at like nine 30 every night.

977
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:33,260
Now. Roommate smokes weed. Hi Bill.

978
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:37,910
I really liked your podcast and really
enjoyed your show in the Taf theater last

979
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,330
Saturday. Jesus am, I said good shows and
Cincy. That's twice in the three letters.

980
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,990
First Time I see, I see a saw, a
live show and it was fantastic.

981
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:49,880
I have a problem now I'm in college and
my roommate and I live on campus and

982
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:52,520
that doesn't sound like a
problem. It sounds like it's
fucking time of your life.

983
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:57,290
We have our own bedroom and we, oh,

984
01:00:57,291 --> 01:01:01,550
we have our own bedrooms and we don't
talk very often. I'm okay with that.

985
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:04,220
The problem is he might smoke
weed sometimes in the apartment.

986
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:06,890
He mentioned he smokes weed.
The first day we moved in.

987
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,530
I never smoke weed and I don't
know what it smells like,

988
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,080
but the smells came out of his,

989
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,940
but the smells that came out
of his room is not a cigarette.

990
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,700
I'm a hundred percent sure.
Yeah Buddy. That's weed. Uh,

991
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:19,680
the semester is almost over. Should
I bring it up with them? Nah,

992
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,480
I just get a new roommate. You said
it kind of bothered me with the smell.

993
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:27,230
We only talked once when we moved in.
I don't know what to do.

994
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:30,350
It's against the rule on campus.
Should I talk to the Ra?

995
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:32,330
Abso-Fucking-Lutely not

996
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:34,030
okay.

997
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,860
Not Dude.
Don't talk to the Ra.

998
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:40,060
Ra is one letter short of rat and that's
what the fuck you would be. Don't do.

999
01:01:40,061 --> 01:01:40,894
Don't rat them out.

1000
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:45,400
Really liked your comedy and I think I'm
the only Asian dude that went to your

1001
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,190
show. Thank you. And
Go fuck yourself. What?

1002
01:01:47,191 --> 01:01:49,900
Thank you for showing up and bring
some of your Asian friends with me.

1003
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,690
I mean with you to see my show.

1004
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:01,430
Unless you're the only Asian in
Cincinnati. I have no idea. I don't,

1005
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:05,330
I don't know what's goes on.
I don't do a census. Uh, no,

1006
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:09,320
I wouldn't rat him out. If you're really
concerned about the Ra, I would just say,

1007
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:11,660
hey buddy,
I don't give a shit that you smoke weed.

1008
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,700
Actually I do care that you smoke weed,

1009
01:02:14,701 --> 01:02:17,160
but I'm not a rat so I'm not
gonna say anything to the Ra,

1010
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,960
but it is illegal and I'm concerned
that how much I can smell it.

1011
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,770
The IRA is going to smell it and then I'm
going to get in trouble too. All right.

1012
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:28,710
Can you do a better job of blowing
it out the window or stick?

1013
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:33,000
It's thicker towel underneath
the door. All right. That's it.

1014
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:37,310
I swear to God I won't talk to you again.
Um,

1015
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,050
and that sucks man.
You guys don't even talk to each other.

1016
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,590
So the first day you came there
and you in and you were just like,

1017
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:46,500
I don't smoke weed and this guy is just
like, well I'm fucking done with you.

1018
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:51,030
Everybody thinks pot smokers a cool, I
don't know. This guy sounds like a con.

1019
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,130
A neighbor drove through my fence.
Hey Billy,

1020
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:59,490
belligerent,
the title sums up this email.

1021
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,680
But I feel like I'm in
a bit of a situation.

1022
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,660
I recently moved back into my childhood
home after being away for about four

1023
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:10,110
years. Unfortunately my dad
passed away. Sorry to hear that.

1024
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,980
But he left me the house that
he paid off in full. Nice.

1025
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,280
How the hell did he do that?
Usually the uh,

1026
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,790
they hit you with so many penalties and
fees that you have to put the house back

1027
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:23,690
into play.
Uh,

1028
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,410
he said the house itself is in
disrepair. Oh, there you go.

1029
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,050
Leaky roof, bad septic lines, et cetera.

1030
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,890
So I already have a lot to take
care of in the coming months.

1031
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,280
Yesterday my neighbor and childhood
friend got shit faced and drove his new

1032
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,880
truck through my fence and go,

1033
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,660
this is some fucking redneck shit.

1034
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:50,930
And got into and into the giant
oak tree in my front yard,

1035
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,890
the fences wire. So it
was salvaged. Salvageable.

1036
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,360
I need to go to that pronunciation
videos. South salvage, salvageable,

1037
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:06,260
salvageable, salvageable,
salvageable. There it is. But I,

1038
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,620
I,
but I was still pissed.

1039
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,250
My other neighbor has security
footage of the whole event. Dude,

1040
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,740
it's everybody's filming everybody now.

1041
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:19,250
Can you get away with anything including
the hilarious mobile when the guy,

1042
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,210
when he tried to pull it back,

1043
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:26,670
I guess the fence and fell on
his ass against all my neighbors.

1044
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:29,220
That advice,
I didn't end up pressing charges.

1045
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,380
Although my brother who lives with
me as well did file a police report,

1046
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,300
which is now on the drunk neighbors
record. Uh, my question is,

1047
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:43,920
did I do the right thing by not pressing
charges in sending him to jail? Well,

1048
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,800
how would you send him to jail?
I mean by the time you got the footage,

1049
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,110
he would be sober and he
could just say, ah, you know,

1050
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:54,720
I was looking down at my phone and my
baggage and I took my hand off the wheel.

1051
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,880
Uh,

1052
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,450
I more or less cut ties with this
guy because he's a volatile person as

1053
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:04,410
evidenced by this whole situation.
He has two young children,

1054
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:08,010
one in three I think recently lost
a job and has a lot to deal with.

1055
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,260
So I didn't want to fuck
them over even more.

1056
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:14,690
And he did actually fix my fence
when he sobered up. However, I,

1057
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:18,480
I don't think this will be the last
time something like this happens.

1058
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,750
Should I have sent his ass to
jail or did I do the right thing?

1059
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,860
I mean I wouldn't have said anything.

1060
01:05:22,861 --> 01:05:26,700
The fact that it got up the next day
and he tried to fucking fix the fence.

1061
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,013
MMM.

1062
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,240
I would talk to about it.
Say, hey listen man, you know,

1063
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,760
I don't want to get into your business
or anything like that, but uh,

1064
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,380
I love getting shit faced too. But if
there's any way you could Uber next time,

1065
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,230
uh, you know, cause if I was
walking up the driveway, you know,

1066
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:52,410
you would have run over me, you know, I
don't mind getting hammered or whatever.

1067
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:56,190
But that level of hammered and then
to drive is a little fucking crazy.

1068
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,580
Uh, how's everything going
with the job hunting?

1069
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:03,240
Ask them a couple of Nice fucking
questions and say, listen,

1070
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:05,280
I really appreciate that.
The next day you woke up,

1071
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:08,280
he did the right thing and
you fix the fence. All right.

1072
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,383
Now

1073
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,190
that's what I would say to him.

1074
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:13,620
Yeah.

1075
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,500
Okay. And then on the other
hand, I think the fence issue,

1076
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:22,050
you need to look no further than the
story of the three little pigs. All right.

1077
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:24,900
The Wolf went to the first house,
little pig,

1078
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:28,470
little pig let me in and the pig goes,
yeah,

1079
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:31,470
I don't feel comfortable with
that dude. And he said, all right,

1080
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:35,010
well then I'm just going to blow this
piece of Shit fucking house over.

1081
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:36,420
And that's exactly what he did.

1082
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,550
But he's a little light
headed and the pig gets away.

1083
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:41,430
He runs over to the fucking, his
other brother's house, you know,

1084
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,230
who actually went to college, you know,
but just got a degree in philosophy.

1085
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,040
So all he could afford was a house
made out of sticks. The wolf shows up.

1086
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:53,510
He's like, hey, he little fatty,

1087
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,570
open this door where little pig, little
pig let me in. And then the pig goes,

1088
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:04,860
yeah man. You know my other brother,
you know who took shop class,

1089
01:07:04,861 --> 01:07:07,740
she just blew his fucking house down.
It took shop class,

1090
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:10,350
but for somehow he lives in a
fucking house made out of, Hey,

1091
01:07:10,351 --> 01:07:13,280
I'm not fucking doing this site. Blows
that one down. And then they go to,

1092
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:14,310
as you know,

1093
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,750
the guy who majored in finance and
stole a bunch of fucking money,

1094
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:21,810
he's got a brick house.
He's got a brick,

1095
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,920
a ban him fairly.

1096
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:30,330
He's might've fat fucking over old people.
You need to,

1097
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:34,910
you need to put up a brick wall.
Oh Man. That would piss him off.

1098
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:40,970
Somebody did that and then the next day
you put up a fucking brick wall and if

1099
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:43,390
be gives you shit,
just put your hands out like why

1100
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,730
you drove through the other one.
You,

1101
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,690
you're going to fucking run me over
one night or hit this poor tree.

1102
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,880
What about the tree?
The tree can't Cilia.

1103
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:57,630
It's a victim of fucking drinking and
driving. He can't take you to court.

1104
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,470
It can file a complaint, but it can't
get there. It's, it's stuck in the ground

1105
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,780
and you got a little brick wall
between the two of you. Hey Buddy,

1106
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:12,280
if you weren't such a fucking drunk,
you know, I wouldn't have to do this.

1107
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,640
Um, other than that,
what are you going to do?

1108
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,130
I would have my head on a swivel though
when I got into my fucking driveway.

1109
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,680
MMM.

1110
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:27,150
This is the deal. I would just tell
the guy, just say, listen man, I'm not,

1111
01:08:27,151 --> 01:08:28,710
I don't want,
I don't want to call the cops.

1112
01:08:28,711 --> 01:08:33,150
I don't want to do when he shit like
that. All right. But if it happens again,

1113
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:37,980
I'm going to have to because you're
going to kill somebody. All right.

1114
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,100
I don't, please don't put me in that
position. That's what I would say.

1115
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,690
And then I would build a brick wall,

1116
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,470
although I think I would deal with my
septic tank first. But you know what?

1117
01:08:46,471 --> 01:08:49,630
You can't take a shit if you're
dead. This is dino it. I'm gonna,

1118
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,420
I'm gonna make you
put the priorities up there.

1119
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,950
You're going to roll the dice that this
fucking crazy mother fucker and his

1120
01:08:56,951 --> 01:09:00,680
trunks can trucks going to come over
there and drop the fucking wire fence.

1121
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:04,190
I think you need an ar 15 to shoot out
his fucking tires as he comes towards

1122
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:07,250
your oak tree. Why don't you
talk to the fucking cheese? Fine.

1123
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,753
MMM.

1124
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,490
How cool is that? That guy, he
owns a farm and he makes cheese.

1125
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,750
You know what I mean?
So rare.

1126
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:20,530
Do you meet somebody that actually
has a job now that it's like, wow,

1127
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,760
we really need that.

1128
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:26,740
We need that guy that we need to make an
another fucking app that can have some

1129
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:31,210
horts steal $300 from you. Oh, it's so
easy and convenient than some of the,

1130
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:34,990
you don't even know. Can just
send them fucking money. Hey,

1131
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:39,490
once you have her number from
the transaction, I'd call her up.

1132
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:44,290
Give me my 300 bucks back. You fucking
thieving horror before I call the cops.

1133
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:48,670
I get my 300 bucks back and then I
would call the cops. There you go.

1134
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,640
That's what I would do with her at the
fence thing. Ah, am I right with that?

1135
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:56,290
But I would tell them not to do it again.
All right.
