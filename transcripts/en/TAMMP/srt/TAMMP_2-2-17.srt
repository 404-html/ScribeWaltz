1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,910
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:07,480
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,550
Just checking in on you. Just checking
in on you. How's your week going,

4
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:20,780
how you survive and how you survive in
the first couple of weeks here of fucking

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,300
the new America.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,450
I wasted 90 minutes last night texting
with somebody on some big stupid fucking

7
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:33,970
political argument. I can't handle it
anymore. I can't handle people that,

8
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:38,300
you know, the thing I really
don't like the most about,

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,280
uh,
I dunno,

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,500
I hate people who say that I'm an
independent. I'm not this party. I'm not,

11
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,570
I'm an independent.
Do you know in California,

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,590
evidently according to the three minutes
of research that I did that if you

13
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,424
register you,

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,260
that's like you are actually registering
to the American independent party,

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,610
which is actually more conservative
than Republicans evidently.

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,990
Which is something I don't
understand about politics.
I just don't understand why

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,750
no means yes, yes means
no. Why? If there's a bill,

18
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:16,500
let's have safe drinking water
for children. All in favor. Yes.

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,740
And then like attached to
that is other shit like, Hey,

20
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:24,390
they can indefinitely detain
American citizens without a trial.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,340
They'll tack that on to that. So then
when somebody else votes against it,

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,360
clean water for kids because of
that shit that's tacked onto it.

23
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:37,230
Then when they go to run, they go, this
guy doesn't want clean water for kids.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,800
Can't a fucking and fucking give up.
I give up,

25
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,670
I poked my head out for a second
and I'm um, and that's it. Oh,

26
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,750
I'm putting my head back in the sand.
I'm going back to watching sports.

27
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:56,130
So Billy fuck head is going right
back where he belongs. You know,

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,540
Celtics finally beat the
raptors. Huge win it, goddammit.

29
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,120
Those capitals of Washington
or God damn it, they're good.

30
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,480
They fucking beat the broads. You
know, Marsha with another two goals,

31
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,140
racking it up. Uh, we actually Bruins
won three in a row. It was good.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,230
It was like the strongest part of
our seasons so far. And um, anyway,

33
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:16,530
so I've been getting back
out there doing stand up.

34
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,320
Now that I've settled in being a
dad and all that type of stuff.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,330
This is really like the
pre season of being a dead,

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,600
you know when your kid can't
move really without you.

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,240
It's once they start crawling,
that's like game.

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,850
That's the first game of the season.
But like early on right now,

39
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:33,660
I'm like in August trying to get the
roster down to the fucking whatever it is,

40
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,470
44 man roster or whatever
the hell I need because um,

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,400
I guess you can think this parenting thing
is pretty easy during the first three

42
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,910
months. You know, even though you're
not really fucking sleeping or anything,

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,980
just getting up and shit changing diapers.

44
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:51,981
But it's still not as bad as all these
pussy say this such fucking pussies dude,

45
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:57,120
you have no idea. Shut the fuck up.
We used to live in caves. You asshole.

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,260
You have no idea. You can't handle the
truth. Do you know I never saw that movie.

47
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,780
A few good men.
It just seemed too actory to me.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,240
Everybody was real tense fucking faces,
you know,

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,750
delivering dialogue in
their military dress.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,180
Did I ever tell you how much I can't
stand movies about fucking trials?

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,250
I was actually in what,
I didn't realize that,

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,060
but that one was different
because I was at it.

53
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,230
I just can't fucking watch
him after a while later.

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,560
Tell the jury,

55
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,160
put yourself in the place of the
defendant. Um, they're always like super,

56
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,180
super fucking dramatic.

57
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,640
Have you ever sat in on a real
trial you've ever been in one?

58
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,810
I actually sat in one,
uh,

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,780
buddy my became a lawyer and I came down
and I watched him try a case and it's,

60
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,660
it's not like obviously the way
they do it on TV or in movies,

61
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,410
but what was unbelievably compelling was
somebody's freedom was on the fucking

62
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,410
line. And that was what was riveting,
not what the fuck people were saying.

63
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:07,110
What they were saying was very like, you
know, I'd like to submit a exhibit a,

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,540
it's a,

65
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,150
the a the Chandeliers Hannah and
you just say the goals and um,

66
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,250
I actually watched somebody,
I don't know,

67
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,190
I think they got pulled over and there
was drugs in the car and there was some

68
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,290
sort of gun involved in shit.
And I was just sitting there.

69
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,650
I just couldn't get over the fact
looking at the defendant going like this.

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,560
That's not an actor.
That's like a real fucking person

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,630
as her is that if he did it,
that fucking guy's a lunatic.

72
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,280
He's driving around with drugs, he's got
a gun in the car. What the fuck is he?

73
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,930
This guy's a real life maniac,
or what if he's fucking innocent?

74
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,780
There was all of that shit and
then I was sort of looking around.

75
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,150
There was like nobody really there.
And I looked over in the corner,

76
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,960
there was this old lady sitting there
like knitting, sort of looking up,

77
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,450
listening, and she was like, no, no, no.
What the fuck? She was knitting, you know,

78
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,650
old lady,
she's just knitting.

79
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,210
So at the end I talked to my buddy and I
was just like, wow, man. That was like,

80
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,420
is it, I kind of feel guilty, but that was
like really entertaining. He goes, yeah,

81
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:02,200
you know, it's, it's real
shit. I said, you know,

82
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:06,040
I wouldn't be surprised if
like, do you have like, um,

83
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,550
court groupies to people just come down
and sit in on these trials just for the

84
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,770
entertainment value of it? And he goes,
yeah, that's what that old lady was doing.

85
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,740
A lot old people do it, you know,
during the day, you know, they,

86
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,470
they don't have air conditioning
or something. They come in,

87
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,020
they sit down and they just
listened to the trials. It's free.

88
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,970
You can go down and do it. And
um, there was something, uh,

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,860
I don't know, cause it's all, they're
old people you can't get too upset about.

90
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:34,810
But there was something kind
of gross about it. I mean,

91
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,240
I came down to watch my buddy.
I was proud of him and everything.

92
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,740
But then after a while,

93
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,310
how interesting it was and
how much I got into it,

94
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:46,080
I actually had this level of
guilt of like, you know, this,

95
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,970
this shouldn't be like a, I shouldn't
use this for entertainment purposes,

96
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:53,830
but I gotta tell you it was a fucking
great time sitting in on a trial.

97
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:58,190
If it's a good one, you know
there's drugs is a gun. I mean,

98
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,440
I want to see anybody get hurt,
but when they pull you over,

99
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,920
hey took a swing at the cop of,
that's a good, that's a good one.

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,410
That's a good episode to go
down, you know, so there you go.

101
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,230
That's real law and order
as opposed to a bullpup OPO,

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,130
right. Watching that shit. You can
actually go down the street for free.

103
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,760
You can be a cable. Can you get on,
you know, during the fucking cable,

104
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,960
if you have the, if you have the time, we
got the bay, if you got the fucking time,

105
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,930
you can just go down to court
and that can be your basic cable.

106
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,540
And just see last this week now,
no I didn't. But uh, you know,

107
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,760
did you see that fucking guy who uh,

108
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,600
went to jail for 10 years for vehicular
homicide or whatever the fuck Arama

109
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,250
whatever the fuck he go to jail for.
What do you go to jail for? Anyways?

110
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,740
So I've just been up to my
neck and all the baby, uh,

111
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,910
issues are probably changed like 9 million
diapers. And it was fucking Hilarious,

112
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:58,140
I found yesterday, right? My
wife's Nia just needed, she
just needed an hour sleep,

113
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,590
right? And women in the beginning,
and they're fucking doing everything.

114
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,140
All you have to do is change the diapers,

115
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,960
make an attempt to burp them or whatever,

116
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,570
but they got to just keep feeding
the kid breastfeeding, right?

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,830
So you start to feel like, you know,
guilty, like I'm not doing shit.

118
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:15,900
So I was just determined like,

119
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:20,130
I'm going to have this kid for like the
next hour, give her a great hour sleep.

120
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:23,940
And I was able to, hour and
15 minutes before the kid
was finally just like, look,

121
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:27,750
I need something. I need what
you don't have. All right,

122
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,830
I need to go downstairs. I need
a solo cup. And he did, you know,

123
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,020
I need a little a keg party here.
Right?

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,510
So I was just walking around with her
and I was singing all these songs and

125
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:45,390
everything. And then I actually,
for whatever fucking reason,

126
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:48,300
I started singing the Canadian
national anthem and it worked.

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,850
Yeah.

128
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,030
And I always forget, I always,
oh, Canada home and native land,

129
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,330
this barrier Drew Bay

130
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,270
we love and all I saw Mama,
man, there's probably washer
here, blah, blah blah, blah,

131
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,960
blah,
blah about eve harp,

132
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:06,630
harp harp who from far and
wide or card at RP at. Huh.

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
And he and the best part of our
God keep the Lad Gloria fee.

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,193
Right?

135
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,230
Fucking walking around
from room to room upstairs.

136
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,970
I sang the Canadian national anthem for
like a fucking half hour straight and

137
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:29,971
you're so fucking focused on keeping
your kid sleeping that the insanity of

138
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:30,431
that,

139
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:34,300
it doesn't hit you until afterwards
when you give you your baby back to your

140
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:38,440
wife and then you go upstairs to make
a sandwich and you're still singing the

141
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:40,270
song.
And if you can't stop doing it,

142
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,080
you know what's the name of
that movie with that guy?

143
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,673
Yeah,

144
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,800
that guy. A midnight express.
The guy traveling abroad
gets busted with the drugs.

145
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,920
Remember those fucking
lunatics that we're all in the,

146
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,110
and it would just sort of
marching in the same direction.

147
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,750
And he started walking in the other
direction that like freaked him out,

148
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:01,860
but they would just like these fucking,

149
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:06,390
the people just completely
lost his sanity. That's
what it felt like. You know,

150
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,840
we not just singing the national anthem
for a half hour straight is a fucking

151
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,800
insane thing to do.

152
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,900
Forget about it if it's not even your
country's national anthem. I mean,

153
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:20,020
I literally felt like a trader even
though that they're an ally of ours.

154
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,410
And I just feel like, you know, maybe
Donald Trump's going to call me.

155
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,960
They didn't give me a heated fucking
conversation, but what I just did,

156
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,190
maybe I'm going to get
deported. Um, anyway,

157
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm not gonna get into that Shit fucking
90 minutes of my fucking life. Like,

158
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,190
it's so dumb and I know it's like I'm
literally going to make this person it

159
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,043
admit,

160
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,410
okay

161
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,860
or agree with me or anything, or I'm going
to step his way in. Agreed. It's just,

162
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:46,070
it's fucking pointless.
Um,

163
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,100
it actually affected my set last night.

164
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,070
Just spending 90 minutes in that fucking
never ending circle of Horse Shit.

165
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,250
And uh,
I gotta stop doing that.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,340
I almost needed to come
home and meditate again.

167
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:04,370
I'm really getting into that shit. Just
clearing my head, not flipping out.

168
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,710
I think I flipped it.
I flipped out yesterday.

169
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,330
What fucking pissed me off yesterday.
I can't even remember. But I'm,

170
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:16,260
I'm getting, I'm getting way better
at it, you know. But anyways, um,

171
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,770
I want to thank uh, Conan O'brien,
Jimmy Kimmel, uh, Bill Simmons,

172
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,910
uh, everybody that Joe Rogan
podcast, Joe Rogan experience,

173
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:27,640
everybody that helped me promote
my special, my special outright.

174
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,940
Now it's doing great.
People are really enjoying it.

175
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:34,660
Thank you so much for watching it. Please,
uh, let other people know about it.

176
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,010
I am now, um, vigorously
trying to write my new hour,

177
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,990
um, and have some sort of life
outside of being a dad. Uh,

178
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,080
cause I don't want to bore you guys with
an hour long fucking thing about Islam.

179
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,290
Dad,
the same clown fucking floating around.

180
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,520
I'm not going to do that to you. All
right. Um, I already got some good shit.

181
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,880
I already got some shit that is good that
I'm going to be bring it towards you.

182
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:03,190
So, uh, I guess Obama, before he left,

183
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,500
he signed a, uh, Christmas bill
making alternative media illegal.

184
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,680
Okay.

185
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,760
This bill will criminalize criminalize
fake news propaganda on the web.

186
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,780
A key piece of legislation meant to
crack down on free speech and independent

187
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,280
media in Layman's terms,

188
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,690
the ACC will allow the government to
crack down with impunity against any media

189
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:29,110
outlet it deems is propaganda.
Uh,

190
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,980
the next piece of legislation will provide
substantial amounts of money to fund

191
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:37,960
counter propaganda to make sure the
government's approved stories drown out

192
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:42,400
alternative media and journalists
who questioned the status quo.

193
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,570
There you go. Isn't that great?
There's your hope everybody.

194
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,730
Oh,
what a cunt.

195
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,140
That's why I don't like Democrats that
they at least Republicans, you know, they,

196
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:01,950
they, they come out as cuts, you
know, there a cunt. You know,

197
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:06,000
they don't care about you. These fucking
assholes have the nerve to, well,

198
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:08,530
I guess the Republican's
sell it to the fucking dope.

199
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,690
So in the middle of nowhere,

200
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:10,530
okay,

201
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,090
we're going to make it great again.

202
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,470
All these people that think
it's going to be great again,

203
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:23,280
you're still going to fucking have your
face pressed up against a Walmart window

204
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:26,190
the day after thanksgiving.
You know,

205
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,750
the fact that you as an American have to
consider that fucking option is how as

206
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,660
hard as you fucking work is,
is ridiculous.

207
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,590
There's nothing that's dead is the thing
that nothing makes me more sad. Well,

208
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,960
I guess something else does,
but I can't think of it right now.

209
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,670
But that is a very sad moment every year
in America when you see people putting

210
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,730
their,
literally their own wellbeing at risk,

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
trying to find a fucking DVR recorder
for $3 before the next person is

212
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:56,480
[inaudible]. That's just a sad
fucking thing. Should be done.

213
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,630
People should have enough money to go
into a store like a fucking human being

214
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,470
and buy something that they don't need,
shouldn't they?

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,340
Speaking of which,
I got rid of some more shit.

216
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,890
MMM.

217
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,600
Uh,
I'm really fucking enjoying this stuff.

218
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:19,840
Just getting rid of all of the shit I
have to do what I gotta do it before my

219
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,870
kid starts walking or crawling.
You know what I mean?

220
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,260
Or maybe they make some sort of a little
playpen thing that you can put them in

221
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,860
right. Where they feel like they
have free reign but they don't,

222
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,263
you know what I mean?

223
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,450
Okay.

224
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,840
It's a very fucking governmental thing.
Make them feel like they're free,

225
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,100
but they're not.
How can I do that?

226
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:41,660
How can I apply the same things that
governments apply to my own child?

227
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,210
I got to figure out how to do that. Um,
and then they're moving around. Yeah.

228
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,380
You got to worry about what the,
what are they going to do and get again,

229
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,630
a childproof everything.

230
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,210
There's gotta be gates and
it's gotta be shitting outlets.

231
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,020
I'll tell you,
man,

232
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,220
that's a weird thing about
living with the baby.

233
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,350
It's just like you're living
with this thing that just,

234
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:03,620
it doesn't know anything but
you can't get upset by it,

235
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,150
you know?
Yeah.

236
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,500
Like we all have that friend
that's like a fucking moron.

237
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,740
And you could just be like, you can
just, if you can walk away from,

238
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,540
cause the end of the
day, you know, they can,

239
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,700
they can still go out and make
themselves a bowl of cereal.

240
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,550
Yeah.

241
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,140
Oh Jesus. But what are you talking about?
Oh, you know, I'm not getting any sleep.

242
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,900
What do you want from me? I don't
know what to say, you know, but

243
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,640
I'm actually kind of site,
we're not my,

244
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:28,940
my big thing is I just want her to be
able to start moving around so we could

245
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:32,920
start playing catch. All right. And uh,

246
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,330
if she doesn't want to play catch,
it's not going to be an option.

247
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,740
I won't have it. Oh, I will
make her hate the game of catch.

248
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,270
That's something that you got to
avoid, I guess as a parent. Right?

249
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,400
Like you have such hopes that
they're going to like what you like,

250
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,790
that you could actually make them
not only not like what you like,

251
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,960
but fucking hated and then hate you and
not call you unless it's on the fucking

252
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:03,080
holidays.
So hopefully she'll enjoy it.

253
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,600
I'll just sort of leave like,
you know,

254
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,370
okay.

255
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,160
I Dunno what baseball laying around.
Maybe she'll get into it,

256
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,990
throw it through fucking window. My
wife will get mad, but I won't care.

257
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,520
I look at that. I'm going
to be our, um, anyways.

258
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,640
All right, plowing ahead here.
Fuck. Was I going to talk about, um,

259
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm trying to avoid politics and
fucking baby talk, but I mean,

260
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,290
I mean that's kind of my fucking life at
this point, right? How did this happen?

261
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,620
Um, where is it here?
Where's the time? Yeah.

262
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,250
What's going on in the
world? I have no idea. Oh,

263
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:42,520
I actually tried to look up some Google
news to see what's going on in the world.

264
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,510
Evidently Trump had a very
short phone call with Australia.

265
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,960
How the fuck do you get into a
fight with Australia is beyond me.

266
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,370
If this is even true, I have no fucking
idea. And then McCain called up and said,

267
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,020
hey man, like don't listen to him. We
still like you guys. This is very quick.

268
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,930
Uh, there's some guy who looks like a, um,

269
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,460
he looks, I don't know what he looks
like. He looks like a fucking magician.

270
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,480
He was going to speak at UC
Berkeley. Yeah. Annapolis,

271
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:15,320
I guess he's a big Donald Trump supporter
and he goes to UC Berkeley and all my

272
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:18,710
God, was there a protest? This guy's
a whore. Like he didn't know that.

273
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,490
What's going to happen?
Jesus fucking Christ. Um,

274
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,540
and then, uh, Beyonce
put out a really weird,

275
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,780
creepy picture saying
that she's having twins.

276
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,790
I actually looked at the picture and
kind of burst out laughing. I don't know.

277
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,420
It's some people you get so famous. Why
can't you just say you're having twins?

278
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,130
Well, why do you even have to
announce it? You know what I mean?

279
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,320
We're announcing to the world.
Um,

280
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,270
I mean, I guess I brought it
up. I don't know. I kind of did.

281
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,070
We should've done a photo shoot. What
is the hidden message? It'd be odd.

282
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,710
SES photo shoot.

283
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,590
Pregnancy photo.
There's a hidden message

284
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,040
she's wearing like a veil.
I mean,

285
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,040
I just don't under still kind
of a food as a photo shoot.

286
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,670
Why am I looking at this? Why? Um,

287
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,550
anyways.
All right.

288
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,970
So all Billy dead body's got to
hit the fucking treadmill today.

289
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:26,680
I got to start eating well. And, um, I
don't know what to think as far as like,

290
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,640
what you can eat, what you can't eat, you
know, people say avoid saturated fats.

291
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:32,800
And then I go on the Rogan
podcast and he goes, Nah man,

292
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:36,010
that was all bullshit that was put
out there by the sugar companies.

293
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,570
And I guess I could sit down and read
it, but I just don't. Uh, I don't,

294
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:44,590
I don't have the time, so I just
decided, well, you know what? Fuck it.

295
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,020
I'll have a stake in a lab
but with have a little,

296
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,850
a little garden salad and then I'll
be all right. And you know what,

297
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,820
I woke up this morning and I didn't
die of a heart attack, so there you go.

298
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,930
So I guess he's right.

299
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,410
So many try to avoid sugars as much as I
can and try to eat some Goddamn steaks.

300
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,090
The fuck is a button. Yeah. Sorry.

301
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:11,470
Every once in a while this I fuck
up with my recorder and I don't,

302
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:15,700
um, I don't record it on the right speed
and then it takes like nine years to

303
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:18,250
fucking upload anyways. Oh Hey, you
know what's going on? The super bowl,

304
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,520
it's the super bowl this weekend.
A little bread and circus for everybody.

305
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,430
The super bowl yet that,
that,

306
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:28,431
that way they could you do to do patriots
going for their unprecedented fifth

307
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,190
fucking oh Tom Brady going for
his fifth fucking ring. Actually,

308
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:37,900
we're also going for our fifth super
bowl title against the Falcons who are a

309
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:41,380
major problem. Like I said,
I'm going on the record.

310
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,770
I think it's going to be a classic if
you can get the falcons with four more

311
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:48,790
points. I liked that and
I also liked the under 59.

312
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,210
I like the fucking, because
everybody else was like, June,

313
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:57,100
it's going to be a fucking shoe kid.
You know, they start looking at those,

314
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:57,910
fuck this state.

315
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,060
I love looking at the stats of what
they did during the regular season.

316
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,190
It's like this isn't the regular season.

317
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,660
This is completely fucking different.
You know,

318
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,680
this guy throws her 500 fucking yards a
game against 90% of teams that aren't in

319
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:18,100
the fucking playoffs anymore. You've
got to adjust it all down. You know,

320
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,520
you gotta go negative,
negative, whatever statue. See,

321
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:25,000
you have to adjust it down because
each week you're going to play a better

322
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:28,810
fucking team, you know,
within, you know, the theory,

323
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,780
right? The theory says that. So,
um, I have no vibe whatsoever,

324
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,090
um, when it comes to this game, because
you know, according to the regular season,

325
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,860
the falcons do not have a good defense.

326
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:46,660
But according to what I've seen
in the playoffs against Seattle,

327
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,410
they have pass get dirty birds
up there in Washington, right?

328
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,540
And against the Green Bay packers,

329
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,310
whatever the fucking a packer is
loading trucks, whatever the hell it is,

330
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,730
putting cheese, right? Putting
cheese in your fucking caboose,

331
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:03,820
whatever it is they do
up there, you know, um,

332
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,300
the defense looks solid there.
And um,

333
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,850
I guess I was sitting there saying
the falcons have a great running back

334
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:13,060
everyday only. They have two running
backs that can get the fucking job done.

335
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,830
So I think this is going to be a,

336
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:17,530
and then the fact that
Matt Ryan also is mobile,

337
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,330
which means if he shut everything down,

338
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,440
that fucking red cunt can still do that
diagonal quarterback run where you run

339
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:28,240
right to the first down marker and
you're sitting at home as a fan gone. Ah,

340
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,050
right. And it keeps the drive
going after yet another third down.

341
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,850
I expect a lot of that and I think
it's going to come down to the wire.

342
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:39,040
That is my prediction.
It's going to go right down to the wire.

343
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,260
I hope the patriots come out on top.

344
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:45,790
And I predict myself a lot of times
during the game watching Matt Ryan run for

345
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,800
five or six yards as ice cream.
The fucking,

346
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,920
it's gonna drive me up the wall.

347
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,290
I fucking hate mobile quarterbacks
unless they're on my team,

348
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,340
which we've never had.

349
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,880
Okay.

350
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,640
Since Steve Brogan, see,
Rogan was considered mobile,

351
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,820
you know that naked bootleg he
did on Monday night football.

352
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:08,530
That was the highlight
of scrambling in the, uh,

353
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,230
60 years of fucking 50 years.

354
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,240
56 years of New England Patriot,
Boston Patriot fucking football.

355
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,220
That was it in like 1976 we had a,

356
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,970
we had a 50 yard naked bootleg on Monday
night football. And other than that,

357
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,100
it has just been, you know, drew Bledsoe.
I mean you could literally drew Bledsoe,

358
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:35,120
you could literally zoom in office chair
down the street fast and then that guy

359
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:38,600
could fucking run, you know, one of
those classic staples, piece of shit,

360
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,960
plastic fucking wheels.
Even with the pebbles on the street,

361
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,030
if you could fucking push that thing,

362
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,630
40 yards facet that drew could
run it. I'm telling you. And uh,

363
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,250
Brady is not fucking
mobile. So, um, you know,

364
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,700
you know what is great about not
being a mobile quarterback is you,

365
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,470
you really have to know how to throw them.

366
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,600
Yeah.

367
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,650
Cause I find what the Boval quarterbacks
then they, if they can really run,

368
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,250
they're never quite as good at throwing
the fucking ball. So what happens is,

369
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:10,620
is as they get older,

370
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,510
they get exposed when they have to kind
of stay in the pocket and just be like a

371
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:19,300
pocket passer. That's, that's, that's my
theory. That's completely not research.

372
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:23,520
So I think it's going to be a
real close one. And um, you know,

373
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:27,030
don't listen to all the fucking
analysts and then at the Patriots lose,

374
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,460
they're going to act like it was
this giant fucking upset, you know,

375
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,600
cause that's what ESPN does.
You know what I mean?

376
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:37,520
They fucking totally overhype it one way.
And then in the other way, then the, uh,

377
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,590
then they go,
where are we fair to the Falcons of Lana.

378
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,390
And they completely turned rich.
Eisen was another show that I did.

379
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,380

You know about Lyft Rye, it's the
APP that gets you right in minutes,

403
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:33,120
man on demand 24 seven for
less than the cost of a cab.

404
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,700
Please include all of the following
points during your read. Well,

405
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:40,320
if you write it, I'll read
it. If you tried Lyft, you
know what I mean? With Lyft,

406
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:43,830
you just download the APP
request to driver and they
show up in three and a half

407
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:45,690
minutes on average.
That's really fast.

408
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard,

409
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,360
including criminal and
DMV background checks.

410
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,620
You'll know you'll get around
quickly and safely, unlike that other

411
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,050
APP,
that other one

412
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,210
that rhymes with mover. Well you can
do, you can fucking, you can walk up.

413
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,050
You can fucking walk into that office
with a God damn bloody ax and they'd be

414
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:15,550
like, do you got a car?
Yeah, I got a van, man.

415
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,180
All right, you're hired. Lyft
drivers are rated after every ride,

416
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:20,560
so only the best stick around.

417
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,440
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car was some creepy dude.

418
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:27,070
With Lyft, you can tip in the APP, which
obviously leads to happier drivers.

419
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,110
I mean, 910 Lyft rides getting a
perfect five. They're ready, boom, boom.

420
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,740
It's just a better all around experience.
Bigger isn't always better, Huh?

421
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,450
A tell that to a size queen lift
isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

422
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,820
but it's the fastest growing
and highest rated one.

423
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,940
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift.

424
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,180

driving. You never have to bum a ride.

425
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,680
He never have to worry about parking.

426
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,850
A lot of people are actually getting
rid of their cars and relying on Lyft to

427
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:58,600
get around and you know what?
Evidently I don't blame them.

428
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,640
Yeah.

429
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,650
Why would you say that? I don't feel,
I don't feel that. If you want to do I,

430
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,140
that's amazing. If you can do that shit,
but you know there's no more road trips,

431
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,610
you know, going out to the

439

I just came up with the great
serial killer fucking movie idea.

440
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,323
All right,

441
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,100
this

442
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,490
is, this is how the guy gets his
victims. He just goes out to a bar.

443
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:50,700
He has a drink. He calls one
of those fucking, you know,

444
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,150
lifts or Uber's right. He just has
him drive it back to the house.

445
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,580
They pull up to the house.
He just bonks him over the fucking head,

446
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,830
brings him into his house. So whores
and then he has keeps the cars right.

447
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,200
He read,
doesn't gas monkey style.

448
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,740
He files down the engine number and all
that way. Puts a new engine in it. The,

449
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,630
the, the, the vin number and then
he takes some demeanor, right?

450
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,680
The auction.

451
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,680
He auctions off all the cars at these
dead Uber drivers and Lyft drivers maybe

452
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:22,771
not make him,

453
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:26,860
I don't think that they
would be interested in a
fucking Toyota Cressida um,

454
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,900
whatever he goes to, he goes
down to Clearwater, Florida.

455
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,530
There was some shitty cells up down there.
He makes his fucking money.

456
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:38,580
He takes that money. He uses it to
pay off his creepy fucking house.

457
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,620
Right. And uh, I dunno where he
goes from there. I don't know.

458
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,930
Maybe they did that on, what was
it? What was the name of that movie?

459
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,540
Not that movie. Um, Dexter,

460
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,830
they probably did that on Dexter
at some point. I mean, that,

461
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:55,560
that's show started off.
It was interesting.

462
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,710
Then after a while I just kind of left
it and then when I came back he wanted to

463
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,800
bang his sister and they were both all
right with it yet. Not all right with it,

464
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,930
you know? And I was just like, wow,

465
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,560
that is the definition of writing
yourself into a corner. All right. Oh,

466
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,760
look who's back. Everybody. Bodo too.

467
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,270
Mandy's me.
Andy.

468
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,920
He's riding around in
Uber. But dude, dude, dude

469
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
beyond ease me,
Andy,

470
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,290
something, something, some goober. Ah,

471
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,680
your balls won't stick to the guy's
fucking chair. You drive around,

472
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:27,770
you don't care. You might be a
serial killer, but who gives a fuck?

473
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:32,330
Your eyeballs feel nice and soft. Oh
yeah. I don't think this is my house.

474
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,710
Is that a lead pipe? All right. Mandy's.

475
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,440
Everybody picture a world where putting
on a new pair of underwear isn't just

476
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:42,770
fresh. You're stepping into a better
day. Think about it. Underwear,

477
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,990
it's the first thing you put on
in the last thing you take off.

478
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:46,160
Unless you Matthew mcconaughey,

479
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,090
why would you settle for anything less
than the best feeling underwear on the

480
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:53,630
planet? Please include the
following points during your read.

481
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,000

482
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,630

I have friends at me undies.

call these people who claim to be.

485
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:11,060
My friends at [inaudible] sent me a
few pairs a while back and now I can't

486
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:13,160
imagine wearing anything else.
Of course I can.

487
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,740
I am right now I'm wearing cotton
once. Okay. You have no idea.

488
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,560
The length of the size of my
imagination beyond DC. All right.

489
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,560
And maybe if we actually were friends,
you wouldn't make claims like that.

490
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,780
It really makes each day that much better.

fucking killed your Uber driver, right?

503
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,090
They would be able to look at their phone
when they need to figure out where it

504
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:17,200
was the last call they made.

505
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,700

513
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,690
Uh Oh Geez. Is there, we
got two more. I can't,

514
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:53,050
I can't subject you guys listen to me
read out loud this fucking long. Can I,

515
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,410
let's talk about some, let's keep fleshing
out this fucking movie. All right,

516
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:58,660
so then the cops show up,
you know,

517
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:02,440
and God knows I'll probably be
be playing the sidekick, right?

518
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,600
I got that role on lock.
You know,

519
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:11,260
I'd fucking show up and it
just be like, hey, yeah.

520
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:15,010
You mind if we asked you a
couple of questions? You know, a,

521
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,530
I noticed you have like a,
a,

522
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,920
you have like 15 late model cars out here.

523
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:27,450
What is it about a boring sedans that you,

524
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,740
an SUV is that you find so exciting,
you a car collector. You know,

525
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,030
the guy gradually invites me and then
he fucking hits me on the head and next

526
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:39,300
thing you know I'm down in that hole
with that fucking chick, you know,

527
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,630
was probably the same size as me.
So we got to play rock, paper,

528
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:45,630
scissors to figure out who's going
to stand on who's fucking shoulders.

529
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,423
You know what I mean?

530
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,800
That was such a great move when she got
the dog to come down there and she was

531
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:54,320
just like,
I will fucking snap this thinks neck.

532
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,340
Who was the actress that played in? She
was fine. I remember when I saw that,

533
00:31:58,341 --> 00:31:59,930
I'm like that that woman is a star.

534
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,580
I thought she was fucking amazing in
that movie. Everybody talked about,

535
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,930
um, what's her face there
from taxi, you know,

536
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,020
and of course they talked about the other
guy who played the guy with the blue

537
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:15,710
dress like he had, he drove
an ice cream truck, you know,

538
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:19,700
and he had the guys live with, with
the fava beans, Sir Anthony Hopkins.

539
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,270
What is it about English people that
they think it's an honor to get knighted?

540
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,830
You know, I for the life of me. Why
the fuck do you show up to that shit?

541
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,190
What are the perks to being part of this
round table that never goes to battle?

542
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,410
Did they give you a fucking suit of armor?
You know,

543
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,590
I don't fucking, I don't understand
any of that shit a well bill,

544
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:47,360
when maybe he'll read up on
it. Well, you know what? Fuck
you. I'm gonna. Here we go.

545
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,490
Here we go. Let's see. Um,

546
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,910
what would you do?

547
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:57,200
What does it mean to be knighted?

548
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:58,970
Okay,

549
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,920
what are the parks?
These are the brakes.

550
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:08,810
Here we go. What perks of being
knighted by the Queen. Ah, here we go.

551
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,340
Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh,

552
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:14,780
this is just regular people talking.

553
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,760
So this would be even dumber
than the shit that I say,

554
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,030
as I observed in a response to a very
similar question on this subject.

555
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,930
I have read comments from people with
knighthoods suggesting that the biggest

556
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,200
advantage tends to be the
ability to get a table.

557
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,530
At a smart restaurant more easily and
usually to be offered a better table.

558
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,010
Okay.

559
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,750
That's it.
Other than that,

560
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:40,130
my only brush with the system is that the
husband of someone I used to work with

561
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:43,580
was knighted a few years ago
for his work in fiber optics.

562
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,060
Um, Jesus Christ, they let anybody in.

563
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,860
You wouldn't be able to read this on your
mobile phone without him and his team.

564
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,540
He is now Sir David and pain. He
remains a pleasant, modest man.

565
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,330
And I don't think his life has
been greatly changed by the title,

566
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,110
though his wife probably
quite likes being lady pain,

567
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,640
Laney, but both he and his wife
still need to work for a living.

568
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,440
So that's, that's what you
get, I guess you get a better
table at a restaurant. Uh,

569
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,520
I guess it still commands a certain
amount of respect in some circles,

570
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,270
but is increasingly less influential.
Well, what did it use to me?

571
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:21,670
Okay.

572
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,940
You know what it used to me, they used
to mean you could bang the kings fucking

573
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,580
right. You know, you
just take off your pants,

574
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,580
part of your suit of armor and he just
banging away, but he's, he just clanging.

575
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,030
You know,
you still got this shit on on top.

576
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,570
It sounds like a bunch of toasters
being beaten to death, you know?

577
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:41,141
But you know what?

578
00:34:41,141 --> 00:34:45,130
I bet that that was an aphrodisiac back
in the day for those ladies with Dick

579
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,680
Chastity Belt, any sort of sound of
metal, they were so fucking repressed.

580
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,580
Is that true bill? I don't
fucking know. All right. Dollar
Shave club everybody. Ah,

581
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,120
Jesus. Urine animal. You need to shave
your back. You fucking all right.

582
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:00,970
Dollar Shave Club. Dollar Shave
Club always gives you a close,

583
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:04,150
smooth shave and you can't beat
the convenience of the price.

584
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,670
You don't have to choose between settling
for a cheap bag of disposables or

585
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:14,530
paying out the nose for a razor
with laser pointed at 17 blades.

586
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,130
It's awful. It's total fucking overkill.
You never needed more than two.

587
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,070
Two blades was the shit.
Once they went three or more,

588
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,780
you couldn't get that
shit underneath the nose.

589
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:25,510
And I got a cute little
button nose. Oh yes, I do.

590
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,020
The dollar shave club broke onto
the scene with the smarter choice.

591
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:31,090
Before Dollar Shave Club,
there was no middle ground.

592
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,330
It was either save money and get
a painful shave from a disposable,

593
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,760
like the ones that give
away for free at the gym,

594
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,140
which felt like shaving with a piece of
glass or you paid through the fuck knows

595
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,150
you paid a fortune for the latest shave
breakthrough you didn't need like a chin

596
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:51,870
detector or 17 more blades. Not
God. I got the hiccups. Now,

597
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,800
dollar Shave Club is the best of both
worlds. You ever seen a baby with hiccups?

598
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:59,910
It's fucking adorable. Uh, you get the
premium, the best premium shape, quality,

599
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:04,050

shave at an affordable price.

last read and it's a nice quick one.

610
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,530

Do Not Watch any pregame or post game.

646
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,950
Do what I do. Have some friends over.
Get the real golden taped the game.

647
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,440
Shut your phones off.
They'll look at a computer.

648
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,260
Let the gang get 90 minutes
out in front of you.

649
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,640
Then sit down and fast forward through
all the commercials to halftime.

650
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:02,580
Show all of the bullshit you'll catch
up with the rest of the world around.

651
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,820
Fucking, uh, I dunno, late third
quarter, early fourth quarter.

652
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,000
Then you can turn your fucking phone
on and you can read all your, uh,

653
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:13,030
your friends go on all day, dude, dude,

654
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,040
I called it and then see
how fucking wrong they are.

655
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,920
You can read it and you know,
rather than having to deal with them,

656
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:18,460
you probably should.

657
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,860
I mean personally I keep my phone off
for the whole game cause I don't want to

658
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,750
be distracted. It's the most
important game of the year. And uh,

659
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,270
we will see what happens.

660
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,040
We will know the next time you hear the
soothing sounds of my freckled voice.

661
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,510
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.

662
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:00,923
Hey

663
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,380
silver, I don't know what the fuck
is going on with this g cast name.

664
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,620
This is the second time
I've baffled for 50 minutes.

665
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,080
I've done a hundred minutes
of podcasts this fucking week.

666
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,940
And every time I do along, I don't know.
I don't know if I'm talking too long.

667
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,290
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

668
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,340
But the only thing it seems
to be publishing is these
little snippets here when

669
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:26,750
I'm fucking pissed and it didn't
fucking work. So if you know,

670
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:31,220
what am I page? Usually I do one of these
every fucking weekend. It works. Alright,

671
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,390
there's other ones. Listen to those
ones. I don't know what's going on. I,

672
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,900
I don't know.
I don't fucking know what a God damn week.

673
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,840
Hey, what's going on? It's still, and
this is the Monday morning podcast,

674
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:39,440
I hope. And um, I don't
know what to do here.

675
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,700
Should I just keep babbling
because it seems that up.

676
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,710
I just go, you know, test
one, two, three cunt,

677
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:52,850
and then I hang up.
It doesn't have a fucking problem with,

678
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,250
uh, with, with just posting a short one.

679
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,720
But then when I babbled for like an hour,
at least this was last week.

680
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,960
I'm judging this entire
thing on last week.

681
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:07,640
So I want to take a leap of faith here
and I'm just going to do this God damn

682
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:12,641
podcast hoping that it's going
to save itself with that.

683
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,220
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird.

684
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:19,370
It's the Monday morning
podcast for the week of, uh,

685
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,230
what the hell was it
February 1st February 2nd?

686
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,770
Is that what it is? I
don't know. Um, yeah.

687
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,760
What'd you guys think of the Superbowl?
Did you like it?

688
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,430
Did you think it was amazing?
You know, it was like,

689
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:36,740
it was like that movie stepbrothers.

690
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,520
I don't know if you saw it like
stepbrothers, the first fucking half hour,

691
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,170
40 minutes you're watching it going,

692
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,990
this might be the worst
fucking movie I've ever seen.

693
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,130
And then all of a sudden it just
became hilarious. And I was like, wow,

694
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,960
I think I got to own this on DVD.

695
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,890
That's what I felt like the
super bowl was like, you know,

696
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,450
first fucking, I dunno what,
three and a half quarters,

697
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,660
uh, whatever. Congratulations to
the Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Steelers,

698
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,300
you sons of bitches,
the right back fucking out there.

699
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,310
Six championships. You guys rose
up from the ashes. You know,

700
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,050
you won your four in the 70s,

701
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,600
and then we didn't hear shit from you for
what, almost 20, 25 years or some shit.

702
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,730
And now you're right back out there.

703
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,110
They by the cowboys and 40 niners and
somehow you got three more championships

704
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:29,360
in the Patriots.
And I got to admit that bugs me.

705
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,750
I was pulling for the
cardinals just for the simple,

706
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,170
a simple fact that I didn't
want to be three behind you,

707
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:38,840
but you got to admit
you guys fucking won it.

708
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,760
I didn't think Ben Roethlisberger
had that in them. And uh,

709
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,120
Jesus Christ, why am I breaking down
the game? Like I'm on fucking ESPN.

710
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:51,020
Nobody gives a shit bill.
No one gives a fuck. Um,

711
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,600
so anyways,
last week I tried to do a podcast and uh,

712
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,280
I gotta admit I'm a little burned out
on these fucking things. You know,

713
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:00,860
last week it just really
took a lot out of me.

714
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,350
I'm not saying I don't enjoy doing them,

715
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:08,351
but I did two 50 minute fucking podcasts
and I went to hit save and the fucking

716
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:14,360
computer voice is just like, uh,
we having technical difficulties,

717
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,320
goodbye. And we just hang up just
like that. There wasn't even,

718
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,650
there wasn't even a, I'm sorry. You know,
if you have a problem, maybe you could,

719
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:25,670
you could, you know, dial
this number. It was just like,

720
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:29,210
we're having technical difficulties,
goodbye. And the way she says goodbye.

721
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,700
It was like, go fuck yourself, you know,

722
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,000
to 50 minute podcasts.

723
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:39,120
Do you know how my fucking left
ear was red for like three days?

724
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,750
Talking on the phone that fucking
long and I had nothing to show for it.

725
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,550
You know, my 14 listeners just,
just hanging in the balance,

726
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,340
waiting to hear the results
of the contest of who could,

727
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:56,340
can come up with an original.
I've got my fucking prostate tickled joke,

728
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,000
you know,
with a bill burr.

729
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,480
Why do I do this DVD hanging in
the balance and what do I get?

730
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,340
What do I get? I get some shitty
ass fucking computer voice goodbye.

731
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,610
Um,
who is that computer voice anyways?

732
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,360
You know what I mean?
I hope it's in an abusive relationship,

733
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,500
you know, and that's not even
advocating violence against women.

734
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:27,501
I'm advocating violence against that
female can computer fucking voice needs to

735
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:30,420
be slapped around by a God damn.
What is it an android?

736
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,400
Is that what happens nowadays?
You know,

737
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:36,360
this is what happened to you the other
day. Um, I went to the Superbowl party,

738
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,160
went to a Superbowl party and uh,
everything was going great. And, um,

739
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:45,570
I was feeling like the party was
enjoying me and my presence and a,

740
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:50,550
I don't know how it happened. Somehow
I just became that fucking guy again.

741
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,980
The Guy who was ruining the party,

742
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,800
somehow somebody brought up Bob
Dylan and I was just like, you know,

743
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,760
I've tried so hard to listen
to that guy, but I, I,

744
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,040
I kinda think he sucks, you know, I
can't understand what he's saying.

745
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,940
And even when I've looked at
his lyrics, like, you know,

746
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,970
I don't think that that deep
at a time they are changing,

747
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,710
you know, I don't mind, I don't
mind that tangled up in blue.

748
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:25,200
That's an all on its
own. He May, he would do.

749
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,830
And the hobbit even open a,

750
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,520
how would they even Alberta who
tangled up in blue, you know,

751
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,760
by doing a hacky fuck it,
I really am doing really well.

752
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:39,420
The hackiest impressions out
there other than Jim from taxi,

753
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:43,440
I'm doing a fucking bad Bob Dylan.
So I just said, you know, you know,

754
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:46,440
this is what I really didn't have an
opinion one way or the other about Bob

755
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,490
Dylan.
I kind of thought he was okay.

756
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,390
But I always read Rolling Stone
magazine Cause uh, you know,

757
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,300
I'm always going to airports and
it comes out every couple of weeks,

758
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:56,430
whatever the fuck it
does. So I always, uh,

759
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,290
I always pick it up and you know,
the,

760
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,650
the upper level management
of rolling stone, I mean,

761
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:09,000
I guess that from the 60s and in their
world, Bob Dylan can do no wrong.

762
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,470
And you know,

763
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,650
I dunno the guys on like his 85th album
and t still getting rave reviews and

764
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,310
rolling stones.

765
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,340
Just one of Bob's greatest
fucking work since his seventies,

766
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,660
eighth album. You know what I mean? I
don't know. Maybe I'm just a Douche.

767
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,540
So it started with that and
then Bruce Springsteen was the,

768
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,910
the halftime show and I just,

769
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:37,530
that's another guy I just look at and I,

770
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:40,870
I don't know what everybody's
so going crazy about,

771
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,250
you know, I'm just singing about
factories in New Jersey. I don't get it.

772
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Him sliding on his knees into the camera
and doing that stupid yoga pose on that

773
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:58,501
strip pole when he started out and
doing the poison with the fucking guitar

774
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:01,630
around your back. I just, I don't get it.

775
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,780
And I at that point,

776
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:09,430
well only couple of beers in and
after saying that Bob Dylan Song,

777
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,380
I then said Bruce Springsteen sucked,

778
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:20,530
which then moved on to people getting
uh, you know, in a funny way, upset.

779
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,420
And next thing you know, I had three
people semi yelling at me going, well,

780
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:29,080
you know, you know, who would you have?
Who would you have for the halftime show?

781
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:33,040
Huh? Who would you have? And I couldn't
come up with anybody. So I just said,

782
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:36,400
you know what I'd have, I'd have a fucking
marching band the way they used to,

783
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:39,380
when only sports fans watch the
fucking show. And they worked,

784
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:42,400
they just showed you a football game and
they weren't trying to sell me the next

785
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:46,420
fucking Brittany Spears album.
How about that one? You know,

786
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,310
back in the day and those
racist white guys would, would,

787
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:53,620
would show up to the games
wearing a fucking short sleeve,

788
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:58,621
Michael Douglas falling down white button
up shirt with the black tie and those

789
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:03,190
Malcolm x, Vince Lombardi glasses
and a crew cut. All right.

790
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,540
That's the football I remember.

791
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,610
So then they started calling
me grant Grand Torino like
I was Clint Eastwood. Um,

792
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:14,320
has anybody seen that movie by the way?
You know, I don't know. I don't know.

793
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,880
I don't know if I want to watch Clint
for fucking an hour and a half going,

794
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,070
you know, get off my lawn. Hey,

795
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,260
you person of another race gate at a here.

796
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,420
That's a really weird movie. When you
think of the concept, like, you know,

797
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,470
what is the Grand Torino represent?
Like back when things were better,

798
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,330
when people had pride and there was more
racism or at least overt racism in this

799
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:43,210
country. Is that what the
message was? Well, I dunno, Bill,

800
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:46,240
why don't you go see the fucking
movie before you rip it apart? Well,

801
00:49:46,241 --> 00:49:50,410
speaking of that, um, we do
a lot of, um, Jesus Christ.

802
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:53,830
I hope that this fucking
thing is recording right now
because I really feel like

803
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:58,000
a, this is going to be a decent podcast
here cause I've got a nice segue speaking

804
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:01,780
of a, of movie reviews, you know,

805
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,720
a lot of you guys have sent me move your
views about stuffs you liked and then

806
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:08,020
you've trashed movies that,
um,

807
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,490
that you haven't liked.
And I got to tell you something.

808
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,200
Somebody took the piss out of that.
I've never with a fuck is it?

809
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,830
Oh, you're such, oh, here
we go. I got it right here.

810
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:26,850
Somebody fucking did a review of Slumdog
millionaire and you have to like sort

811
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:32,141
of enjoy a movie and then you meet
somebody and they so rip it to shreds so

812
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:37,760
convincingly that you start thinking,
hey, maybe it did suck. You know,

813
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,400
I saw a, I saw Slumdog millionaire. I
took my girlfriend there with her mom.

814
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:47,240
She was in town and they loved it. Yeah.
You know, it's a chick flick or whatever.

815
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,520
But, uh, I walked away from it
thinking like a, you know, wow,

816
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:55,520
I should've been more of a romantic,
you know,

817
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:58,400
instead of the fucking asshole that I am.
That's what I got out of the movie.

818
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:02,120
But I thought, well, you know, I thought
it was a decent movie, but here's this.

819
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,950
But now that this dude fucking trashed it,

820
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:08,510
I don't know if I could ever watch it
again. Here is this guys. Okay. Overrated.

821
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:12,770
Slumdog millionaire. All right, buckle
up for this one. All right, here we go.

822
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,600
This is his review.
Imagine a Sally Struthers sponsor,

823
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:22,400
a child add meets faces of
death meets Forrest Gump.

824
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,970
Let me read that a little more
clearer. I apologize. In the worst,

825
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,770
imagine a Sally Struthers sponsors a
child add meets faces of death meets

826
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:35,600
Forrest Gump. The first 90 minutes,
first 90 minutes of of is a kid.

827
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,920
Kit's covered in shit,

828
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:41,780
sleeping on garbage blend in some child
prostitution in a guy running around

829
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:46,550
looking like the cover art on rage
against the machines. First record,

830
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,320
we see the kids mom get beat to death. Not
once, but at least three fucking times.

831
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:56,740
The movie is like transformers or any
other bombastic chase scene blow up flick.

832
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,190
But instead of Bruce Willis
fucking up cars, kids get abused,

833
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,710
abused to shock and awe.
The audience.

834
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,980
It also has more cliches
and a cop buddy flick,

835
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,860
the Indian guy works at
a call center in Mumbai,

836
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,870
Mumbai for cell phones and says shit like,
well,

837
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,140
we'll just live on love.
Am I butchering this?

838
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,420
And to top it off, fate and luck
make the Indian guy rich and happy.

839
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,150
Is that what they want us
to believe in these days?

840
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,230
Just let things happen to us
and we'll get by really the,

841
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:35,231
that overhype Turd got 10 Oscar
nominations that Godfather got 11 because

842
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,870
Slumdog millionaire has
poor people in India.

843
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,970
No one has the balls to stand up and
say it's just a glorified B movie.

844
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:48,530
The academy thinks they need to teach
the American public a lesson just like

845
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:50,900
they did with crash
and Brokeback mountain.

846
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,700
This snuff flick is not a meaningful
comment on the human condition either.

847
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,740
It's just another marketing con job.
And as,

848
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:03,741
as much so as Michael Bolton and as
much substance as a John Grisham novel,

849
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,990
Jesus Christ.

850
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:10,610
I think it's that last
paragraph that got me.

851
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,770
Um,
I got to agree with you on that.

852
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:15,260
The academy thinks they need
to teach America lesson.

853
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,610
I don't think that they need that.

854
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:20,510
I think the academy doesn't really hang
out with anybody other than the academy.

855
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,660
So whenever they see
a movie about tragedy,

856
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,060
about a group of people they
don't really know anything about,

857
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,930
they automatically say it's brilliant
because I'm gonna tell you something right

858
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:31,830
now.
I agree with you.

859
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:36,660
Crash sucked and will be fucking sucked.

860
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:41,280
It wasn't groundbreaking. There
was nothing going on. It was hacky.

861
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,590
It was, it was, the whole thing
was fucking stupid. And, uh,

862
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,650
when I saw Oprah going on TV going, oh
my God, this is such an important movie,

863
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,680
it's like, no, it is an Oprah.
It's not an important movie. Okay.

864
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,740
You don't know what the fuck you talking
about and you don't read all those

865
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:59,250
books that you recommend every
week. Okay? There's no fucking way.

866
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:01,950
You have time to have
your own fucking TV show,

867
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:07,070
your own fucking magazine and a weird
relationship with a cocker Spaniel and

868
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,080
read a 400 page fucking novel every week.
All right,

869
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:14,910
so you've got no credibility with me.
Okay. And that movie Brokeback mountain,

870
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,470
that was two gay guys fucking in a tent.
You know, it's basically a chick flick.

871
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,300
It's like, uh, I dunno. Grizzly
Adams meets Harvey milk.

872
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,890
No, that's not good. We
need something gay in there.

873
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,600
It's like the ice capades
meets, uh, a fistful of dollars

874
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,910
that gets shoved up your
host. Thank you. Um, no,

875
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:42,450
I gotta you know something I think, yeah.
Slum dog millionaire. I, it's actually,

876
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:43,410
I think it's a really good movie.

877
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,770
I actually should have done the whole
spoiler alert then cause I realized

878
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,450
halfway through that review,

879
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,680
he wasn't necessarily reviewing it as
he was just sort of telling you what

880
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:56,190
happens. Um, I should've
just read the last paragraph.

881
00:54:56,191 --> 00:55:00,390
So I apologize to any, uh, chicks out
there who wanted to go see that movie.

882
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:04,500
It's definitely a good movie. Um,
you should go see it. How about that?

883
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,770
Does that make you feel better? Um,
but anyways, well, I don't know.

884
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,770
What do you guys think about this?
You know, that's another thing.

885
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:12,160
If you knew my podcast,
um,

886
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:15,750
I realized that I'm a fucking moron if
you haven't figured that out for yourself

887
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:20,480
yet. So I asked questions
like I asked, um,

888
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,220
I was kind of curious,
being an angry guy.

889
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:27,540
I had a question about
Asian culture where, um,

890
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,110
you know, I just don't see the
anger, you know what I mean? Like,

891
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:38,430
uh, I went, um, they got this
fucking skating rink out in Burbank,

892
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,190
some of the worst ice I've
ever skated on my life.

893
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:45,210
And I was talking a couple of weeks ago
how I was skating over there and it was

894
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:47,550
in the middle of the day,
cause I hate going to the fucking gym.

895
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:52,080
So I figured I'll just start skating
around Lego FHEG in the middle of the day.

896
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,590
There was no way for me to say I went ice
skating by myself in the middle of the

897
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:03,310
day and just not feel like the biggest
pansy ever. But I did it. Okay. Goddammit.

898
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,650
And I came home and I jerked off to some
heterosexual porn just to make sure I

899
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:09,630
was still okay. But anyways, um,

900
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:11,580
so I'm sitting there and skate
and skating around there,

901
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:13,710
skating around and just know that thing,

902
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:17,370
letting the momentum take me
where it wants to go. And, uh,

903
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:23,270
there was this group of Asian kids
there and the fucking two of them kept

904
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:28,840
falling down on the ice really fucking
hard and they never seem to get upset.

905
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:32,470
They always laughed and I was
just like, you know, really,

906
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,420
I can see the first couple of times you
feel silly that some girls there you

907
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,580
with Elap,
but at some point you gotta be like,

908
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:44,200
you got to start to realize that it's
killing your opportunity to get to hook up

909
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,110
and then don't you start getting mad.
But they never did.

910
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,630
So I asked the question
where is the anger?

911
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,740
So somebody wrote in and said,
Bill, I'm Japanese American,

912
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,781
but uh,

913
00:56:55,781 --> 00:57:00,670
I and I have witnessed my fair share
of East Asian enigmas I think I have an

914
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,190
explanation for the ice
skating ass busting,

915
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:06,850
unyielding Asian persistence
for not phenomenon. Yeah.

916
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:10,510
Cause the dude just kept getting
up. He'd laugh, he get up,

917
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,000
he wouldn't even dust the
snow off the back of his head.

918
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:17,650
He just just kept going and he
was happy as hell. Was fascinated,

919
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,240
fascinated with that level of,
I dunno, denial or happiness.

920
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:26,290
But I want to have that look on my face
at some point in my life and I'm 40 my

921
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:30,040
life's half over. So anyway,
she goes, uh, as you know,

922
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:34,810
Asian people, especially men are
robots. I actually, I didn't know that.

923
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,670
Um,

924
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:41,440
they aren't programmed to show frustration
or anger after many failed attempts.

925
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:46,390
This is in large part why they can defy
the laws of physics in the fields of

926
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:51,220
gymnastics and can do martial arts
in the air and the lung rooftops.

927
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,410
All right, she's breaking my balls
here. Let me finish this. Ah, however,

928
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,570
even though they generally are void of
most emotions, especially in public,

929
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,690
Asians are weak to the layer of booze.

930
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:08,190
They get rosy cheek wasted
and nothing can sell either.

931
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,790
Alcohol induced getting this,

932
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,210
not even repeated ice to ask impact.

933
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,600
So my suspicion is that you witnessed
just that the mechanical persistence of

934
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:23,620
uncoordinated robots,
Aka Drunk Asians on ice.

935
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,080
You know, that would be a great, you know,

936
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,920
there'll be a great shelf
drunk Asians on ice that would,

937
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,870
that speaking of the Icecapades,

938
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,240
whoever thought that that
would come back around again.

939
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,590
Fucking drunk Asians on ice would
put the ice capades out of business,

940
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,550
kind of lazy UFC hurting wrestling
at this point. You know what I mean?

941
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:47,590
That would be the fucking UFC of ice.
Capades drunk Asians on ice.

942
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,810
Um, all right, so many ways you guys
want to get into the contest here.

943
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,150
I want to try to keep this
podcast a little bit shorter.

944
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,830
I'm already up to 17 minutes here.

945
00:58:56,831 --> 00:59:01,480
I'm gonna try to keep it right around the
half hour mark because I'm afraid that,

946
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:05,380
you know, I'm using up too much
digital time here. So anyways,

947
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,000
as a most of you guys
know, um, I said I was 40,

948
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:15,001
so I got the physical and then I had
to get the old prostate fucking exam.

949
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,140
And, uh, I was, uh, I was
upset by it, you know,

950
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,870
because unlike heath ledger,
I wasn't in a tent.

951
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:28,880
I'm somebody who wasn't whispering sweet
nothings to me. And it was, it was very,

952
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:33,830
it was very fucking disturbing and a,
I wanted to talk about it on stage,

953
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:36,020
but so many comedians,
any comic,

954
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,410
you know who's had that
procedure done to them,

955
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:43,880
fucking has gone on stage and
talked about it. So I'm just like,

956
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,070
there's no way for me to talk about it.

957
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:51,970
Every joke has hackey so I asked my 14
listener fucking podcast audience if they

958
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:55,350
could come up with an a,

959
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,180
if they could come up with an
original prostate exam fucking joke,

960
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:04,820
they, um, I would do it on stage and
they would, they would win a fucking DVD.

961
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:08,150
So here are the finalists and you guys
are going to vote on these so I can keep

962
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,980
the whole interaction of this tremendous
podcasts going. All right, here is a,

963
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,380
here's number one,
entry number one,

964
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:21,070
trying to a given a range on an
original spin on the prostate exam.

965
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,090
Please forgive my reading out loud
because I really noticed on this one,

966
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:29,390
I'm just not getting any better at it.
And you know what's happens too,

967
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:30,980
is the second I start fucking it up,

968
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:35,030
I start panicking in my head just like
when I was in fourth grade and then I try

969
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:38,540
to rush to the end of
it. And uh, you know,

970
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,970
it just brings back bad memories.

971
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,780
I remember one time I read out loud in
the fourth grade and I got so fucking

972
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:48,170
nervous and I kept screwing up everything
that I just started reading faster and

973
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:52,500
faster. And when it was, you
know, cause I basically, I,

974
01:00:52,501 --> 01:00:54,620
I figured out that everyone,

975
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,880
everyone was reading two paragraphs out
loud and I fucked up halfway through the

976
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:03,110
first sentence. So then I just [inaudible]
off to the next, the rest of it,

977
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:09,200
you know, thinking I got out of it
and at the end of it the teacher said,

978
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,670
I didn't understand one word. He said,
did anybody else understand them?

979
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,060
You know, I know. And
then nobody said anything.

980
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,970
And then she made me
fucking reread it again.

981
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,640
And by then my mouth was completely
dry, you know, and it was a,

982
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,280
I know it still affects me not like a
prostate exam, but it still affects me.

983
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,950
So let's get on with the content
there. All right. Prostate,

984
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,020
prostate joke number one.
Now I got admit,

985
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,230
I thought you guys were just
going to write quick little jokes,

986
01:01:36,231 --> 01:01:40,280
but people were writing
colonists chunks on this shit.

987
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:44,750
So a fucking, I'm going to have to relive
my fourth grade nightmare here. Okay,

988
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,040
joke number one. All right. Keep
score at home so he can, you can,

989
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:53,090
you can vote for which one you
like. Here's number one, Bill.

990
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:55,400
You addressing the audience.
Okay,

991
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,850
well thank you for the direction and
didn't think I'd be turned around

992
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:02,030
addressing the curtain or a
fucking you in the green room.

993
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:06,320
Just talking to yourself.
All right, so everyone, um,

994
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:10,110
I went and got violated by my doctor
today. You've heard this story,

995
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,610
a horror story before
I got a prostate exam.

996
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,210
You've probably also heard the joke about
who the hell would ever want to grow

997
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:19,980
up and do shit like that on a daily basis?
Well,

998
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:23,790
what I want to know is what kind of a
person goes to school to learn how to

999
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:28,620
teach other people, more people, how
to do that shit on a daily basis.

1000
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,080
What kind of fucking sadistic teacher?

1001
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,710
What kind of say it as teachers,
other people,

1002
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,040
the proper way to shove a
finger up someone else's ass.

1003
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,780
They'd have to be a sadist.

1004
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,220
I could imagine the prep professor
in the science practice lab with the,

1005
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,210
the other dummies going, hey
Bobby, you being a little too soft.

1006
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:52,230
You really need to shove
it up there. Good. And dig
around for that prostate. No,

1007
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:54,930
no, no, no, no. Step aside, I'll
show you the proper technique.

1008
01:02:55,590 --> 01:03:00,420
Wait til they either screen or whimper
like a little kid. Then there's more,

1009
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,650
I love this. This is more direction for
me. Walk to the other area of the stage.

1010
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:10,050
The person really went all out. Uh, okay.

1011
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:12,800
So evidently I walked to the other
side of the stage and evidently there's

1012
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,560
another patient over there. At which
point I say, how are we doing over here,

1013
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:21,510
George? You need to remember the lube
or you're going to get sued. Uh, oh,

1014
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:24,540
I get it. The doctor wasn't using
any lube. Okay. Jesus Christ.

1015
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,400
You're not wearing any gloves either.
George,

1016
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,690
we've got to stop letting these
legacy students in fucking morons.

1017
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,600
Uh, you could get a slip, serious blister
or shit on your finger or something.

1018
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,900
Jesus Christ. Dude, you really
getting disgusting though. All right.

1019
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:42,480
Here's the final bit. Now
class, most importantly,

1020
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:46,860
you need to develop your emotionless.
You're emotionless. Face skills.

1021
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,230
I'm serious.
You want an a in this class?

1022
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,060
You better have a stone cold face after
you violate all the dummies. No laughing.

1023
01:03:54,061 --> 01:03:58,370
When they scream for mercy. I'm
serious. They have speakers with audios.

1024
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,860
What? I'm serious. They have
speakers with audio screams,

1025
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,710
custom fitted by me.
I'm serious. All right.

1026
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,420
I don't get what the fuck that last
line means, but you know, there you go.

1027
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:14,410
That's halfway decent. Do the whole doctor
thing, I guess. I Dunno, right? Number.

1028
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:19,200
This is number two of the
colonists chunks and I apologize.

1029
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,110
All right, that's joke number
one. Now with my skills,

1030
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:25,980
I'm obviously only reading these ones,
so please keep score at home. All right?

1031
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:30,900
You get to do a little American
idol thing here. All right. Uh,

1032
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:33,150
all right, well the fuck are we. Ah, Bill,

1033
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:36,120
I completely agree with you that there's
no real ground to break on the prostate

1034
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:40,830
exam exam jokes, but want you,
but once you say free DVD,

1035
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:45,300
my brain's shorts circus.
So below is my best attempt.

1036
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:49,590
All right. My wife and I had been
together for 15 years. In that time,

1037
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:51,090
I've gone to the doctor once,

1038
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:56,130
she's probably gone 50 times that
John Wayne Act comes at a price.

1039
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:00,540
There are procedures, there are procedures
for every one inch of a woman's body.

1040
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,850
I lifts breast lifts,
Tummy Tucks,

1041
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,050
someone with eight years of educations
that one of the finest schools on earth,

1042
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,320
Spanish time figuring out how to inject
blowfish toxins into women's faces.

1043
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:15,600
So they'd look younger
and it doesn't stop there.

1044
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:20,470
Look at this using classic standup
jargon and it doesn't stop there. People,

1045
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,940
what's the mammographic machine cost?
You know what cost a lot.

1046
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:29,920
And what does it do? It crushes tits.
A cat scan machine cost a lot too,

1047
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,030
but it can be used for anything. It's
a cat scan. Might be a little noisy,

1048
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:37,180
a little scary if you have claustrophobia,
but it doesn't injure you.

1049
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,750
A mammogram takes one of the most
sensitive parts of the human anatomy,

1050
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:45,910
anatomy and it presses it until it
hurts. That's it. $1 million please.

1051
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:51,010
But guys, gotta be tough. No doctor
visits unless something's falling off.

1052
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:55,000
So what fantastic piece of
Jetson technology that we get,

1053
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:00,400
we get some MIT created. Do we get
some MIT created imaging machine?

1054
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:03,010
No. Uh, doctors index finger,

1055
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:07,000
the same finger that he uses to
get the intention of a bad waiter.

1056
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,570
That's the detective
equipment plus a rubber glove.

1057
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,520
I grew up in the seventies and eighties.

1058
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:14,710
I don't always remember
rubber gloves to you.

1059
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,970
Back in the 60s when you'd see
a doctor smoking on TV shows.

1060
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,680
Did they have gloves or do they just
have a bar of lava soap over on the side?

1061
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:27,610
Think like a mechanic. Sorry,
I didn't shake your hand, ted.

1062
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,860
Now doc rarely. That's okay. So those,

1063
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,890
his prostate exam one, by the way,
I don't have anybody, you know,

1064
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,980
you guys sent me your addresses,
but I saved all your emails. So, um,

1065
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:44,620
next week when I announced the winner,
um, I do have your original email.

1066
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:48,400
So any you fucking dirt bags out there
who can try to pretend to be these people.

1067
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:52,750
I have all the original emails, so if you
win, please send me your address. Okay,

1068
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:57,160
here's a couple more. Uh, well
I see this is number three.

1069
01:06:57,490 --> 01:07:02,320
That last one was number two and the
previous one was number one. Okay.

1070
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:06,530
You guys, you guys all caught up. All
right, number three. Um, all right bill.

1071
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,530
I see you got your ass
tickled the other day.

1072
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,690
I don't know if anyone's
ever done this angle,

1073
01:07:10,691 --> 01:07:14,800
but you ever thought about one of
those ass tickling doctors being gay?

1074
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,740
Not saying that he
enjoyed tickling your ass,

1075
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,650
but more like the same way
if you're dating agendas,

1076
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,990
your friends think stuff like,
ah man,

1077
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:26,710
she must really know how to do some
freaky shit cause she's so flexible.

1078
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:31,420
A gay guy would be like, hey, I'm dating
one of those. Ask tickling doctors.

1079
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,120
And then as other gay
friends would be like, wow,

1080
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:38,530
he must really know his way around an
asshole. I Dunno, that kind of sucked,

1081
01:07:38,531 --> 01:07:43,330
but give me a DVD. You know what, dude?
I don't think that did kind of suck.

1082
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:47,120
I'm going to be a little Simon
here and say, ah, that, you know,

1083
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:50,920
that wasn't that bad. That was actually,
you know what? That was pretty original.

1084
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,270
Yeah. Why am I met? You guys fucking
decide I'm the goddamn comedian here.

1085
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:58,420
You know what? Fuck you guys
right now. That one's in the lead.

1086
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:00,190
So you guys put your pens down.

1087
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,320
I just really killed a couple
of people's dreams there.

1088
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:07,350
People sitting in their cubicles, you
know, people actually tell me that some,

1089
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:11,380
some people out there that actually
listened to these podcasts to get through

1090
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:13,930
airplane flights because I
make them so fucking long,

1091
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,490
which means now there's possibly somebody
sitting on an airplane listening to

1092
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:22,700
the podcast, which I think
is really cool. And, uh,

1093
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,310
you know, I feel bad for you that
you're on a plane and uh, you know,

1094
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,670
how ugly is the person sitting
next to you? By the way,

1095
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,460
that's one thing that always annoys
me about when I get on a flight is,

1096
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,620
I don't know if this
ever happens you guys,

1097
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:40,970
but there's somebody good looking
ever sit next to you. You know, when,

1098
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:44,540
when to fucking hot chicks fly across
the country because it's never on my

1099
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,870
flight. Or when they in
shape guys, you know,

1100
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,790
how can horrific looking people and I'd
say I'm helping anything. But you know,

1101
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,010
if you're on a plane right now,

1102
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,600
just pretend like you're turning around
to see if the bathroom's available and

1103
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:04,350
just look at the people. Do it. I'll
wait. Good. Turn around. Look at him.

1104
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:08,660
Look at him. Look at the, look at that
fat headed Jack. Big Fred Flintstone.

1105
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,630
Look at fucking idiot
sleeping with his mouth open.

1106
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,650
It's just horrific. You know what
it is? It's the private jets.

1107
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,530
All good looking people flying.
Those little fucking private jets

1108
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:23,420
just left all the ugly people in coach,
you know,

1109
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,990
which is what I'm flying by the way.
I'm not trying to put myself above people.

1110
01:09:26,991 --> 01:09:29,840
Bill, can you get back to the
contest? Fine. I will. All right.

1111
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:32,060
Entry number for bill.

1112
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:36,020
You know the classic family dinner scene
where everyone is asking each other

1113
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:38,450
things like how was work today?
Well,

1114
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:41,450
there's really no fucking way you can
ask your dad or husband to give you a

1115
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:45,530
legitimate response to that question
if they're approch tologist because in

1116
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:49,670
reality he's been finger
and dudes all day and a,

1117
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:53,070
you're trying to finish a potato salad.
You know what?

1118
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:55,370
That was a funny line and I butchered it.
God dammit.

1119
01:09:56,990 --> 01:10:00,380
There's no way to legitimately ask a
proctologist that because he's been

1120
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:03,080
figuring dudes all day and you're
trying to finish a potato south.

1121
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:04,820
That my friend is a funny fucking line.

1122
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,630
So all his answers have to
revolve around parking spots,

1123
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,920
routes to work or maybe a
receptionist birthday cake. Also,

1124
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:15,410
how scared of the other dudes
faces in the waiting room.

1125
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,820
And that's to be similar to
the look soldiers gave each
other before stoning the

1126
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,710
storming the beaches of
Normandy. Dude, you know what?
That's actually really true.

1127
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:28,460
I couldn't look at anybody when I was in
there, and especially when I walked out,

1128
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:32,570
when I walked out, I looked at the
floor, remember that? Remember that?

1129
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:33,920
And the pope of Greenwich Village

1130
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,870
and then you tell her she can't
say goodnight to nobody that way.

1131
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:43,250
She got to look at the floor
when she walks out, Charlie.
That's what I was doing.

1132
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:49,190
I looked out, I walked out looking
at the fucking floor. You know?

1133
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:49,911
They know it's funny,

1134
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:53,180
as the guys in the waiting
room technically could
have given me shit because

1135
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,010
they still have the option of running out,

1136
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,510
which is exactly what the fuck they
should've done. They should've ran out.

1137
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:03,760
Just fucking hazed me all the way back
to the fucking elevator, Angie like that,

1138
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:08,090
Angie like that. Your little
fucking Douche. All right. Um,

1139
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,110
I think I got one more here.
You know what?

1140
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,410
You guys can decide on these
fucking things. I'm not doing that.

1141
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:18,390
That was Joe was number four. That was
joke number four. Pick up your pen.

1142
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:23,250
That was number four. All right, here's
number five and this is this one.

1143
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,230
This guy is actually,
you know what?

1144
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:27,810
Those are the four you can choose from
and this guy here is going to win an

1145
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:32,250
honorary DVD cause he didn't email me.
I was actually in Houston,

1146
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:34,710
Texas and this fucking guy,

1147
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:39,810
I was doing radio on location in some bar,

1148
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,550
one of those fucking sports bars and
people are drinking beers and eating

1149
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:48,030
chicken wings if fucking
10 in the morning. And I'm,

1150
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,480
and I'm doing radio in there
and as I come walking out,

1151
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:56,070
I don't know how this guy knew I was
coming out, but he timed it perfectly.

1152
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,350
First of all, he knew where the fuck
I was. I came walking out in this car,

1153
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:05,320
just pulls right up like
the FBI in good fellas,

1154
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,280
you know, just pulls right up. He's like,

1155
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:12,630
hey bill bar and I've got a little freaked
out. I'm like, Hey, what's going on?

1156
01:12:12,631 --> 01:12:17,070
He goes, hey, I got an I got an entry
for the prostate exam joke dude.

1157
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:20,400
I'm in a parking lot in the middle of
fucking Houston outside some fucking dive

1158
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:23,730
bar at 10 in the morning.
I'm not thinking about the podcast,

1159
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,630
I'm thinking about going to Denny's
and this fucking guy pulls right up and

1160
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:31,380
hands me two fucking
complete sheets of paper.

1161
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:38,130
Prostate exam material is the heading.
I felt like I was cheating on a test.

1162
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:42,090
You know this guy came back with all the
answers so I can only read half of this

1163
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,880
cause I'm already at a half hour and I
want to make sure this thing gets posted.

1164
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:49,920
So is the other one. Here's say
this is the honorary one. Uh, Bill,

1165
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:52,830
I'm not sure how I'll be
able to cope with the day.

1166
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:56,850
I have a prostate exam as it draws nearer.

1167
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,140
Of course I realize that I'm eight
years away, but it freaks me out now.

1168
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,760
Freaks me out now cause I'm going to be
a fucking mess when the time comes to

1169
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:12,030
can I be a worst fucking out loud reader?
Whatever it is,

1170
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,550
you never have to worry about
me being behind a podium.

1171
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:18,390
Let me start this over again and
fucking relax here. It's all right Phil.

1172
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,500
There's two pages of stuff. You only
have to read a half of it. Half of it.

1173
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,710
You only have to read half of
it. Look at me. I'm flustered.

1174
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:30,170
Bernoulli flustered on my own
podcast. All right, here we go, Bill.

1175
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,750
I'm not sure how it be
able to cope with the day.

1176
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,980
I have a prostate exam as it draws near.
Of course,

1177
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:41,220
I realize that's about eight years away,

1178
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,870
but if it freaks me out now, I'm going
to be a fucking mess when the time comes.

1179
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:51,200
This all spawns from my homophobia and
lack of confidence in my own manhood.

1180
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,860
Gotta love honesty in any joke.
I mean, what if I liked the ship?

1181
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,650
I'll have to get divorced again.

1182
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:03,240
My kids will have to ask why and
I'll have to tell my son, well,

1183
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,300
I left your mom because
I liked the doctors.

1184
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:10,650
Giant sausage fingers poking around
in my asshole and you know what?

1185
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,310
It's just not fair to your mother.

1186
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:20,770
Then I'll have to go into why it's
much worse to have enjoyed it during a

1187
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:25,771
medical exam and the ethics involved
as opposed to just be an effect.

1188
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:31,890
You know who I blame society and my God
damn older brother and it's not why you

1189
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:37,111
think he made me watch the hand that
rocks the cradle when I was 15 before I

1190
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:42,670
fully understood how sick that lady's
doctor was for slipping is rubber gloves

1191
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:47,350
off before her exam and he fingered
the shit out of her Jesus Christ.

1192
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:50,380
What kind of movie is that?
You know what I like about this guy?

1193
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:54,790
He's really not soft peddling this joke.
He's really using brutal language here.

1194
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,730
Anyways, getting back to the
movie, at first I was like,

1195
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,090
why the fuck did they arrest that guy?
That was really fucking smooth.

1196
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:06,160
Keep in mind I was 15 and thought anyway
at all to get my hands face or cock in

1197
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,570
on or near a real pussy was
completely acceptable. Think about it.

1198
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:14,440
When you're a kid,
societal rules and judgments don't apply.

1199
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,870
If you see a kid shit,
you want it.

1200
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,150
You just beat the shit out
of them and you take it,

1201
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,940
you go to detention and Google
and who gives a shit? Right?

1202
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,780
Of course I came to realize that those
types of things are fucked up and you

1203
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:28,810
don't do that kind of shit.
But to get back to the subject,

1204
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,540
when it came time to
learn about prostate exam,

1205
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,980
my screwed up fucking head immediately
thought of that movie and I thought to

1206
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:39,790
myself, fuck, what if I'm the guy who
is unlucky enough to get some sick,

1207
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:40,241
perverted,

1208
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:45,241
twisted doctor that wants to slip off
his rubber glove and get as rock off

1209
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:48,280
Brock's off with his gay finger in my ass.

1210
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:52,690
Not only will I have to process being
taken advantage of and violated,

1211
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,960
I'm gonna have to reframe from beating
the shit out of the guy to avoid

1212
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:56,860
prosecution.

1213
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:00,220
And then I'm going to have to investigate
the guy and find out who else he

1214
01:16:00,221 --> 01:16:01,054
violated,

1215
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:04,920
make a case against him and then go to
group therapy with a bunch of others.

1216
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:07,210
Poor schmucks that got
fingered. All right, dude,

1217
01:16:07,211 --> 01:16:08,920
I can not read the rest of his men.

1218
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:12,490
This is like fucking the
original count of Monte Cristo.

1219
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:17,530
It's like 700 pages long.
All right there on the entries.

1220
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,220
You tell me who had the best
one on of those first four,

1221
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:23,770
this guy's going to get the honorary
mentioned cause he, you know,

1222
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:29,260
that was actually really original
cause uh, I guess, you know,

1223
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,890
I don't know. He fucking, they just,
all right, you want to hear my 2 cents?

1224
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:38,020
I like this guy's angle.
The last guy I had just read because,

1225
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,850
uh, I don't know. He made it really
personal and honest and even though,

1226
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,870
you know, it was kind of homophobic, he
called himself out for being homophobic,

1227
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,860
you know, and, uh, to me, honest with you,

1228
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,110
I remember being a kid to
thinking like, you know, I,

1229
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:56,200
I'd love to be a gynecologist.
You know, just being a kid,

1230
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:58,390
you're a fucking pervert,
but you know what it is.

1231
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:03,010
You forget that 80 year old women
also go to the gynecologist, you know,

1232
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,060
so it's not a fun job.
So even if you were a gay guy,

1233
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:10,010
you're just because you're a gay guy
doesn't mean you're like all gay guys.

1234
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,680
You know what I'm saying?
What happens today?

1235
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:15,080
Lou Grant comes walking in there
and you've got to check. Yes.

1236
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:17,690
It's just really getting gross giving
you or something. You know, I learned,

1237
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:20,990
this is why I don't do
sexual material on stage.

1238
01:17:20,991 --> 01:17:22,730
I don't know if you guys have
ever noticed that about me,

1239
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:24,950
but I stay away from it
because I don't find,

1240
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:29,180
I don't know if it's the Catholic guilt,
I just always feel crude, you know,

1241
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:33,020
which is a funny realization that actually
make on this podcast after I had been

1242
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:36,980
talking about prostate exams for
the last fucking two. So anyways,

1243
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,040
um, I dunno, I think it's a
toss up between that last guy.

1244
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,960
And I also like the guys who said,

1245
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:49,640
what if the guy that that angle where
you know the gay guys going, Oh yeah,

1246
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:53,630
I'm dating a a proctologist and then
the other gay guy friends are looking at

1247
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,650
him like he's lucky. Like wow, he must
really know his way around an asshole.

1248
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,800
That is such a fucking
valid point because he does.

1249
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,190
And I would think that gay guys
would think that shit the same way.

1250
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:08,060
If someone was dating a gymnast,
I'd be like, Jesus Christ,

1251
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:12,740
you must be inventing sexual
positions, you know, so whatever,

1252
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,610
whatever you guys send me in the ones
that you like, you gotta tell me why.

1253
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:22,280
And uh, next week, uh, I'll do the big
giveaway. So everybody is that I read,

1254
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:26,220
please send me Your fucking address and
uh, no one, me being a liberal, fuck,

1255
01:18:26,221 --> 01:18:30,470
I'll probably send you all DVDs because
I don't want anybody to feel left out.

1256
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,210
Okay. So there you go. So how far
are we in here? We're at 37 minutes.

1257
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,410
Then once again, this is really long.
Let me get to, uh, you know what,

1258
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:42,200
I'm not going to get to the questions
this week just for the simple fact that

1259
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,980
I'm afraid to step that knock on
a law that they're not going to,

1260
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,210
you know, post this one.
So before I get Outta here,

1261
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:52,460
I want to thank everybody I
didn't get a chance to last week.

1262
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:56,570
I really want to thank everybody who
came up to see me and, uh, Houston,

1263
01:18:56,571 --> 01:19:00,260
Texas last week or two weeks ago,
uh,

1264
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:04,130
I couldn't believe the amount of people
that showed out showed up as we sold out

1265
01:19:04,131 --> 01:19:07,070
a couple of shows and um,

1266
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,520
they got a new club owner out there who
just really knows what the hell he's

1267
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:14,840
doing. And I'm definitely
going to be back. And uh,

1268
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,760
I'd like to thank Nicole for showing up.

1269
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:22,660
Part of my fan club always
coming out to my gigs and a,

1270
01:19:22,851 --> 01:19:26,690
and that's it. And this week
I'm up in Boston. I got a,

1271
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,780
I got the Wilbur theater on February 6th,

1272
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:33,590
and then I got chickopee,
Massachusetts.

1273
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,470
And if you live out in
western Massachusetts,

1274
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,120
if you don't want to drive
all the way to Boston,

1275
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:41,750
I'm going to be chickopee Massachusetts.
One of my favorite gigs.

1276
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,620
I actually back in the day, I used to
open up the David Allen Greer there,

1277
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:49,250
Bobby Collins,
all these big shots and now I'm there.

1278
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,880
So I feel like a big shot. And plus
it's a Chinese fucking restaurant,

1279
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:56,660
you know what I mean? How great is that?
I helped them. When you have stage lights,

1280
01:19:56,870 --> 01:20:01,820
I hope my face is just lit up by the
flames of the Pu Pu platter, you know,

1281
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:06,440
and I can tell fucking ghost stories. So
those are my, that's my gig this weekend.

1282
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,190
My next gigs I have, I have coming
up. I got a wife, guys in Ogden,

1283
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:13,620
Utah on February 20th,

1284
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:17,460
and then I'm taking a little bit of break
is going to be performing mostly out

1285
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:20,660
here in the La area until uh,

1286
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,590
March 26th to the 28th. I will be at, uh,

1287
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:29,670
the house of comedy in East
St Louis, Missouri. So please
come out to see my show.

1288
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,160
Thanks everybody for
listening to the podcast.

1289
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:37,850
I really hope you guys get to hear this
one because I'm sick of fucking talking

1290
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:41,910
and not having anybody here at all,
right? That's it. God bless you.

1291
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:46,820
Congratulations to the Pittsburgh
Steelers. And how about those Bruins, Huh?

1292
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:51,660
Beat the Canadians again. Can you
believe it? Can you fucking believe that?

1293
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:52,460
All right.

1294
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,560
That's it. Everybody have a
good week. I'll talk to you.

1295
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:36,883
Yeah.

1296
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
[inaudible].
