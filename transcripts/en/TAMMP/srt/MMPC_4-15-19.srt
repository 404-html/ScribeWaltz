1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,470
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:05,700
It's bill burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday, April 15th.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,990
Ouch. 2019. How you guys doing today?

4
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:14,030
On this fucking tax day? Ah. Oh,

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,030
Uncle Sam's knocking at your
door. Uncle Sam. He's a whore.

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:21,390
He's taken all your fucking
money unless you didn't do shit.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,190
And then he gives you some, I didn't
do anything this year. Uncle Sam. Oh,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,190
they're there. Here's some money for
you. Pay Uncle Sam. I work my balls off.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,520
I'll take that.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,360
Um, anyways, I hope today fine.

11
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:47,680
She wanted the fun side of tax day. I
hope it does. I hope it does. You know,

12
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,950
it's funny as I actually found
a fucking w nine or whatever,

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,170
you have to go give to my accountant.
It's the 15th, and he's going to be like,

14
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:58,900
well where the fuck was this?
Went back and I was asking,

15
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:03,340
where are you parking derby
fucking nines where, man, my,

16
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:07,260
my lawyer is a, he's a
southern character. Um,

17
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,010
my lawyer, my accountant. How are
you guys? How are you this morning?

18
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:13,470
I'm actually,
I'm mute.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,520
You see how I didn't even wait to see
how you're doing because I don't care how

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,460
it's all about me on this podcast.
It's why I don't have guests. Um,

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,330
oh,
freckles is fucking white out.

22
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,503
MMM.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,260
This is the thing about
being a fucking redhead.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,280
Even when the red party you had is gone,
right?

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,193
MMM.

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,030
There's only so much sun that someone
like myself can take on during a 48 hour

27
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,530
period.
Uh,

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,390
really only an eight hour period or I am
going to be in series fucking problems

29
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:52,130
here and I'm old freckle,
spent the entire weekend out in the sun

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,460
on Saturday. I went to Long Beach
and I went down there and I,

31
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:02,900
I watched uh, the Long Beach, uh, GP,

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,280
the Grand Prix down there,

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,910
whatever the hell they call is fucking
amazing because not only was there a

34
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:08,840
couple of races,

35
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:13,841
there was also like people out there
trying to qualify for the Indy 500 or

36
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,000
something.
I didn't get that part.

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,100
Well maybe they will get like
qualifying to try and qualify.

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,450
I don't know how the fuck it works,

39
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:27,920
but it was kind of reminded me
of like a mini Lamont where, uh,

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,780
you got all these different classes of
cars that were out there racing. Um,

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,210
and uh, it was so fucking cool
and I got to go down and you know,

42
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,570
go in the whole pit area would have
the fuck they call it the paddock.

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,723
Um,

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,390
and they had BMWs and
Porsche's and Corvettes and
then they had more indie indie

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,970
car racing style cars.

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,780
And I got hooked up by a good buddy
of mine and he got this one pass,

47
00:02:56,481 --> 00:03:01,150
it said to take a hot lap, which really
sounds, but you get no fucking race car.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,380
And the guy tears around the track at
about 120, a hundred, 230 miles an hour.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,460
Now I had already done
something like that. Um,

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,060
at the, uh, the Indy 500, that time when,
when for with for all things, comedy,

51
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,200
comedy,
comedy.

52
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,910
I interviewed Danica Patrick right before
her last race and she took me around

53
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,130
in a Camaro.
So I already did that.

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,250
And my lovely wife was the one who kind
of put together the whole long beach

55
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,940
thing. So, and I knew that
she was bored shitless,

56
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,800
so I was like, um, can you,

57
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,800
can my wife go instead of me? And
the guy was like, yeah, I mean,

58
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:46,390
if that's what you want, it's like, yeah,
man, I've already done this. I, you know,

59
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:50,650
I gotta, I gotta keep her
adrenaline going here. And, uh,

60
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,890
she ended up jumping in this car
and she gets some fucking Porsche,

61
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:58,300
which I guess was worth like fucking
300 grand and this guy tool around the

62
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,030
track, she did a little Instagram
thing about it, but, um,

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,940
that put a big smile on her
face and got to go. And again,

64
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,350
I don't know who she drove with, but, uh,
she thought he was dead. That was his job.

65
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,580
That that's what the fuck he did.

66
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:13,000
And it turned out he was like some like
legendary racecar driver who would want

67
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,000
a ton of racist or something.
Um,

68
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,760
but anyways,
uh,

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,300
we end up having a great
fucking time and a dude that I,

70
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,630
I've been meaning to go to that,
that is a killer fucking event.

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,500
The crowd is like crazy intuitive.

72
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,790
And on the first lap of the
first race that I saw, um,

73
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,830
there was a, there was an accident when
you just heard the cry go, ah, you know,

74
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,220
freaking out cause they fucking, we'll
watch it and up on the TV. And, uh,

75
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:44,290
there's a couple of hotels down there too,

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,430
for those of you who don't want to sit
in the sun like me that have balconies

77
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,780
that overlooked the race track.
So it's like basically, you know,

78
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,160
you get high enough up a floor,

79
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,000
it's like you're hovering in a fucking
helicopter just watching the whole

80
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,730
frigging race and then he can have
the TV on in your living room,

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,593
you know what I mean?

82
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,110
And then he could burn some call and
do a couple other things to fuck up the

83
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:09,400
atmosphere just for your own fucking
personal enjoyment. It was tremendous.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,700
I had a moment there where I was almost
going to get to meet Bobby Rail. Um,

85
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,790
who is far as I know is I think the
first guy who ever won a NASCAR event and

86
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:24,760
then won the Indy 500.
Um, that's quite a leap.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,220
I don't that you didn't see
a lot back then. You know,

88
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,710
Dale Buche good old boys back in the day.
Hell,

89
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:34,300
they would just run some car they had
Shannon had fucking weekend before.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,580
It was much more like that. I caught
the tail end, you know, when bought it.

91
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:44,440
Baker Cale Yarborough Harry Gant, you
know, here and gaining a scold Bain,

92
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,630
it, your Buick, regal, whatever.

93
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,970
The fuck it when this is when the fucking
car is still looked like something

94
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,970
you'd drive down the street.
I caught the tail end of that.

95
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,100
Darrell Waltrip, Bobby
Bonia. No, I'm sorry.

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
That's a baseball players

97
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,640
and um, well the fuck
else was out there. Oh,

98
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,670
Bill Elliot,
the Bill Burr is fucking star car drivers.

99
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,273
You know.

100
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,840
[inaudible] he said, I looked like
Ron Howard. It's like, no, I didn't.

101
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:14,920
I used to look like I used to look
like Bill Elliot Aka Dollar Bill.

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,673
MMM.

103
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Which was never my neck.

104
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
Okay.

105
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,260
Um, what the fuck am I talking about? I'm
wiped out. Sorry. And then Sunday, um,

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,860
when all this unbelievable sports
shit was happening when tiger woods

107
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,480
one the mat,

108
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,420
oh my God,
that was a scary moment.

109
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,340
All of a sudden my mixer wasn't
working and I was like, Holy Shit.

110
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,380
I believe I just said, oh no. I'm
like, now what the fuck am I gonna do?

111
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,470
How am I ever going to go out and buy
another $60 fucking two channel mixer?

112
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,180
It's $99.
It gets has center.

113
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,633
MMM.

114
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,330
Turns out it's just the
outlet in my house. All right.

115
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,830
Okay.

116
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,180
I love it. I love buying an old house with
character. It's got a lot of character,

117
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,843
you know.

118
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,970
See that guy over there. He
doesn't work at all. He's got,

119
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:29,330
he's got a lot of character. Um,
he doesn't have a fucking job.

120
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:33,890
That guy has a lot of character.
It's weird how like the way human beings,

121
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,740
you're not judged having a lot of
character if you don't have a fucking job.

122
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,760
But you know, if a house
doesn't work at all, it's,

123
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,790
that's how it's described
getting a lot of character.

124
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,100
It's going to Kuwait
personality. Um, anyways,

125
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,020
tiger woods won the master.

126
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,260
Ah,

127
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,980
ladies, uh, the ladies all these years,

128
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:56,950
they were hoping that that
motherfucker would never win again.

129
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,480
So there's stupid fucking
theory that, you know, you know,

130
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,280
women always try to take the
credit when, um, when a great

131
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,910
man does something,
whenever a great man achieves something,

132
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:13,530
what do they try to fucking do? They go,
well these teas, white supported them.

133
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,390
So when she fucking leaves him,

134
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,710
when the guy's old and he's limping around
and all that and he can't hit a jump

135
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,560
shot anymore and she goes out
and takes his fucking house,

136
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,540
they always try to say,

137
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,310
well she gave up on her
dreams to follow her. Yeah.

138
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,830
Cause her dreams couldn't
sell out an arena.

139
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,090
Here's one for you ladies.
I don't know why I'm coming at you like,

140
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,250
because it's fun. You know what? It's fun.

141
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,770
You guys are just getting your
fucking asses kicked by all these man.

142
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,180
China's out there right now
sitting there fucking interview.

143
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:49,310
When you specifically white women,
like you have difficult lives,

144
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,900
which is just fucking hilarious to me.

145
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,573
MMM.

146
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,630
But it also is the genius a
woman, you know what I mean? The,

147
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,770
the manipulating powers of
women is to such a high level,

148
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,760
their skill and manipulation is such to
a high level that literally white women

149
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,890
are being interviewed
on television right now.

150
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:09,790
Like there's some sort
of like oppressed people

151
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,133
both.

152
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,430
Um, what is it like to be a white
woman in the United States of America?

153
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:24,200
That has to be so difficult.
You have no idea. Every Jay,

154
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:27,490
when I wake up and I look
at my SUV and I'm like, oh,

155
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,890
it needs to be vacuumed out.
Um,

156
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,900
okay.

157
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,670
Anyways, there's that big fucking
stupid fucking argument about support.

158
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,530
Whenever somebody great specifically a
man does something great and then a woman

159
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:47,500
cleans them out or this credit, you
know, or the guys given a fucking speech,

160
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:50,930
he always has to thank his fucking wife.
You know what I mean? And you know,

161
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,980
all guys, we know what this
is, say her fucking name.

162
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,110
So she's in a good mood on the car ride
home because God knows her emotions come

163
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:03,440
first before anything else
in the fucking relationships.

164
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:05,210
So that's why guys are given a shout out.

165
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,760
But what women do is they
take it at face value,

166
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:11,570
like they actually had
something to fucking deal with
it. You know what I mean?

167
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,960
Ladies, let me ask you this
fucking question. Okay.

168
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,430
Because for all these fucking years,

169
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:19,670
they had this theory that when
tigers personal life fell apart.

170
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:23,750
That's why his golf game fell apart,
which was complete horse shit. All right.

171
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,920
If you read any of those stories,

172
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:27,600
the men definitely had the
ability to compartmentalize it

173
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,563
life.

174
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,310
That wasn't the issue from day
one when he was just a kid.

175
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,340
What do you want his first master
master master, right? When?

176
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,180
When that fucking 1997

177
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,890
all these fucking old white guys who are
going like, this guy is unbelievable.

178
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:49,010
He's gonna fucking do this and that.
But I'll tell you the way he swings,

179
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:53,180
it's such a violent swing. I'm worried
about his back and his knees and all that.

180
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,163
They called it.

181
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,770
Okay.

182
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,020
A lot of them are probably hoping it
was going to happen because they want to

183
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,780
Jack Nicholson or Nicholas,
sorry to still be at the top.

184
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,700
You know who's kidding?

185
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:10,140
Who Golf isn't exactly the most inclusive
fucking sport out there, right? So are,

186
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,560
I don't know, personal, uh,
Cutler and like they said,

187
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:18,030
person of Color Breighton fucking
lick cold sucks this Sun God.

188
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,020
Jack Nicholas.

189
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,520
So they were predicting that his,
his,

190
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,310
his body was going to break
down and give out on him,

191
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,680
which it did right when
his personal life did.

192
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:32,570
So of course everybody gives the Barbie
doll all this fucking credit debts.

193
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:36,090
She was his rock.
She did did that fuck Outta here.

194
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,010
The guy did it on him by himself.
That's it. He did it on his own.

195
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,060
At the end of the fucking day,

196
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:46,820
she's not out there swinging the fucking
yard sticker. Right. You know, in,

197
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,440
for any women who don't like that
shit. Let me ask you this, okay.

198
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,470
When a woman gives birth and a guy
sitting there supporting her are going,

199
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,210
come on, you do it. Okay. Okay. Who?

200
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,970
Who deserves the lion's share of the
credit when the baby gets delivered.

201
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,580
Furthermore, who gets the lion's share
of the crest? The woman still does.

202
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,031
You know what I mean?

203
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:08,520
But you can better believe if we were
pushing a kid out of our ass there and the

204
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:11,660
woman was chairing this
on, you know, God knows,

205
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,250
God knows the court system would be like,
well, he had al, she played a major role.

206
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,023
Okay,

207
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,600
I'll come fans for the patriots,

208
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:26,950
haven't gotten their own super bowl
rings for supporting the Patriots through

209
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,660
this incredible super bowl run

210
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,540
with my ring.
I supported you Tom Brady.

211
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,600
So anyway,
I'm just,

212
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm really talking to go small
segment of fucking women out there,

213
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,350
but it's fun to fucking trash them.
Um,

214
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,060
I missed the whole fucking thing.
I didn't see any of it.

215
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,280
And I was at,

216
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,150
I was at Fort Irwin out in the Moh
Javi desert there in the Mojave desert

217
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,580
watching the army plays some war games.

218
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,850
Don't ask me how the fuck this
whole thing came together. I did,

219
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:05,851
if I did a show at an American
Legion is a comic there.

220
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,530
John Sites who,

221
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,610
who is a veteran himself and you just
go down there and you're smoking cigars

222
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:16,030
with veterans and they asked you
shit and you just keep saying yes.

223
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:20,380
And next thing you know as a
bald, redheaded mail, you were,

224
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,590
you were out in the middle
of the fucking Mojave desert,

225
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,170
no piss this being out there

226
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,090
fucking in the middle of the guide where
we actually, we got up at like five 30.

227
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:34,910
Well you had to be there at five 30
in the morning. It was pretty cool.

228
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,160
We flew like a Vietnam era. Uh, Huey,

229
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,360
like the apocalypse now on, you know,
Charlie doesn't like to surf, you know,

230
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:47,720
we flew that thing up out there.
Uh,

231
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,910
I got to sit in a Black
Hawk and an Apache,

232
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:54,911
talked to all these pilots and then
I watched a fucking war game and um,

233
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:56,961
eight,
eight,

234
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,650
the fucking military meal that they have
out there that you cut it open with a

235
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:04,040
knife and there's some fucking
psycho thing that you, I don't know,

236
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,250
you kind of rub it together and then
you stick the Chili in and it heats up.

237
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:11,000
I got to tell you, it was pretty
fucking good. All right. Granted,

238
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:11,750
I wouldn't want to eat that.

239
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,130
Every God damn day for two fucking
years in the middle of God knows where.

240
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:19,970
I wouldn't want to do that. But
you know, for one day it was funny.

241
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm so Hollywood, they were like,
you know what's funny is this,

242
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:25,010
this meal here is actually 5,000 calories
because these guys had just fucking

243
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:29,360
sitting out there. These brave men and
women are sitting out there, right?

244
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,580
They pretend days, they're
out there. So then, you know,

245
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:35,360
they're burning all these calories
and shit. And I'm immediately,

246
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:37,550
I'm so Hollywood,
like 5,000 calories,

247
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,890
I have an acting gig coming up
and I can only eat about 1875.

248
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:46,370
That's my target.
But I ate the whole fucking thing.

249
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,260
I didn't want to disrespect anybody.
So anyways,

250
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
watch these whole fucking war games.
And it was, it was fascinating.

251
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,971
They like play,

252
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:57,971
it's almost like laser tag and they get
like these blinking lights on like tanks

253
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:01,610
and shit like that. And, uh, if
you get hit and it blinks twice,

254
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:05,150
it's considered not a direct
hit, but you're, you're, I
don't know, sort of wounded.

255
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,050
And if it blinks four times, that means
you're dead. You're out of the game,

256
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,290
you'll hold tank shuts down, you're
not able to communicate with anybody.

257
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,210
Cause you know,
they were radically you fucking dead.

258
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,470
And I just watched how the a black horse,

259
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,950
the home team they drew in,

260
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,860
the other two was basically an
away game for the other people.

261
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,600
And uh, I kind of at the end of
the day learned a lot of shit.

262
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,940
I don't know a lot of shit,
but I learned a lot of shit.

263
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,970
Like how that terrain is fondant

264
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,810
and it's basically you
move through the valleys,

265
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,550
you're not going to try to go up and
over. Certainly with all that, you know,

266
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,330
equipment, which isn't something that
I ever really even thought about.

267
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,540
So you just Kinda know, all
right, where can they come from?

268
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,250
And then they just basically draw them in.
You know,

269
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,580
it's, it's like, Hey,
look at this over here.

270
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,200
And they go after that and then they get,

271
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,570
I don't know what the proper terminology,
they get flanked.

272
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,990
I don't know what the fuck it
is. They, they hit him from
the other side like, Hey,

273
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:06,860
look at my left hand.

274
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,770
And then they punch him with the right
was essentially what they kept doing.

275
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:13,310
And it was working. It kept drawing
people in like you'd see them,

276
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,900
they'd spot their position,

277
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,550
the other team would get excited and they
would just fucking come flying in guns

278
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,010
a blazing and then they
would just get broadsided.

279
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,910
And by the time they figured out where
the fire was coming from, it was over.

280
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,130
If they were fucked,
um,

281
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,280
I got to go in an old tank and I shot a,
uh,

282
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,240
whether you know that gun on
top of the Turret Terrick I,

283
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,620
whenever the fuck it is,
that little thing.

284
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,060
And you know what I realized in that
moment, I could give a shit about guns.

285
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,180
I am all about aviation. I was
hanging on every word of those pilots,

286
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,940
asking them how, you know,
the whole thing worked.

287
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,650
Why the tail rotor was that
much higher than the main road.

288
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,810
I could've talked about that all day long,
but fucking sitting there,

289
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,730
my ears a shot. I don't want
to see, you know, it was like

290
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,220
doing that,
you know,

291
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,250
something every fucking redneck
would get half a woody to go do.

292
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,260
And I was up there, I felt guilty. I
was just up to like cheese. It's Christ.

293
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:16,340
How many bullets are left.
My ears are ringing. FOC.

294
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,830
Um, I was more fascinated with how you
change the fucking, if, if one of the,

295
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,260
uh,
the tracks comes off the tank,

296
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,760
how you change the fucking thing and
what a bitch it is to change and how long

297
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,250
it takes and how fucking
pissed off everybody gets.

298
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:38,980
I was more fascinated with
that. Um, although they'll,

299
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,170
the fucking weaponry on the, uh, the
Apache was pretty cool. You know,

300
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:45,180
that thing that thing's on the
side where it's just like they,

301
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,770
it's like a circle thing and like
they just kind of all his comes out.

302
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,540
And one of the pilots was saying,
yeah,

303
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,820
those things are about as
accurate as a bottle rocket.

304
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:58,821
So it's really like this big skill to
try and to initially try to get some sort

305
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:03,590
of accuracy with those things.
But anyways, we spent like, um,

306
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,250
okay

307
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,530
God, we get out there at like
seven something in the morning.

308
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:08,900
Yeah.

309
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,950
And uh,

310
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,990
I took pictures with a lot of the
troops out there and as you notice,

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
it's fucking hilarious.
I kept it real.

312
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:18,410
I came out there and
dress like a civilian.

313
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,980
I wasn't going to go to the army
navy store like a friend of mine did,

314
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:25,100
but he was a veteran and buy
some fucking camouflage pants.

315
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,130
I walked out ahead like
this mccoley vans on.

316
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,190
I didn't realize we were going out
in the middle of the desert. I,

317
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:38,360
this is fucking windbreaker that
my wife bought me for Christmas.

318
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:42,770
I've only worn it like five times. I don't
know how I'm going to get it clean. Um,

319
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,110
but I want to thank everybody out there.
Fort Irwin.

320
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm definitely going to come back and do
a show if I can figure out where to do

321
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:51,920
one. I didn't see where they had any
sort of a theater or a stage or anything,

322
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,730
but I definitely, I was talking
to John Sites that I go do it,

323
00:18:55,731 --> 00:19:00,050
we gotta come back out and do a
show and these people are great. Um,

324
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,160
okay.

325
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,910
They treated us awesome.
And uh, I dunno, that was,

326
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,100
that was quite a goddamn experience.

327
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,650
Like if I was gonna miss the
Masters and see tiger when,

328
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,350
cause I know I can watch that on online,
I'll be able to find it.

329
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,820
But I heard it was the
most exciting masters since
Nicholas Nicholas and 86. But,

330
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,800
um, I don't know. It was amazing.

331
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,900
And what was Keller was every fucking

332
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,123
mmm

333
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,490
army guy, a woman that even
remotely knew who I was, said,

334
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,230
hey, I love Apis for family. Not one
of them said anything about my standup,

335
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:37,580
which was so fucking cool.

336
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,330
So I'm kind of feeling like after three
seasons episodes, episode, family,

337
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:45,000
it's finally breaking throat. Um, anyway,

338
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,600
so thank you to everybody out
there. Fort Irwin, I want to come

339
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,290
back out and do a show.
All right.

340
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,940
Not In the middle of the fucking desert.

341
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,680
I need a stage and an air
condition bunker. You give
me that and I'll, I'll be,

342
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:59,990
I'll be back out there. Other
than that, I'm, maybe I'll, I'll,

343
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,280
I'll go out there in the winter time.

344
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,210
I'll do a nighttime show when all
them creepy critters come out.

345
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,520
I guess there's some turtle out there too.
That's like in danger.

346
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,340
Okay.

347
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,450
So if they come upon it,

348
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:14,600
they supposed to let people know and
then they come out and they remove it and

349
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:18,650
they stick it somewhere else. And uh, the
big joke is the reason why is in danger,

350
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,990
just because if you come up
and you try and pick it up,

351
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,670
it's defense mechanism is it empties
all the fluids out of itself,

352
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,980
bodily fluids, and then it like, it dies
of dehydration immediately. It's like,

353
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:35,620
well, I mean, if that's
your, if your defense is to
essentially kill yourself, um,

354
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,850
I don't know how long you can be around.
I would,

355
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,940
I wouldn't assume that that
would be something you could
do. All right. Anyways,

356
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,820
um, congratulations to tiger woods. I,

357
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,220
when I got off you,
when I came back to, uh,

358
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,620
yeah,

359
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,790
you know, the helicopter, we were going to
fly back. I turned my phone back on and,

360
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,160
uh,
you know,

361
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,500
I got all these messages from Versium
Bartolik and all these guys flipping out

362
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:03,730
about tiger. I was like, oh my God,
you gotta be kidding me. And, uh,

363
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,790
so I immediately looked up tiger woods
and I saw that picture of him when he's

364
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,770
sunk, the sank the puck, the
pot sink, the Putt. And, um,

365
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,440
I can't remember the last time
I was at happy for an athlete.

366
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,900
CanNot fucking remember. So fucking
great. And now he's got like, what,

367
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:24,901
15 or 16 and Jack has 18 if he had 43,

368
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,190
puts it all back together.
I mean,

369
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,510
Jack One one in 86,
he was 46 years old,

370
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:39,400
so he can definitely do it. But
I thought, I remember seeing him,

371
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,350
I watched the beginning of
the masters and I saw him.

372
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:45,280
He looked like he was in
really good shape. Um,

373
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,580
uh, that's just, I mean,
how great is that for golf?

374
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:53,030
I can't imagine what the fucking ratings
were and any amount of jackasses who

375
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,290
are now going to go take up the game.

376
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:58,940
That guy has been the greatest thing
for golf, you know, of the last,

377
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:03,800
you know, quarter century. Like he's
basically had the sport on his back.

378
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,920
Um, so it's so great to
see that guy come back. Uh,

379
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,860
congratulations tiger woods
and congratulations to
yard Boston Bruins tying up

380
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:18,080
to series. They may pull a
first the Boston Bruins out day.

381
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,240
It's a tale of two different gates.

382
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,160
This is my takeaway from both games.
I would say in game one,

383
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:30,161
the Bruins got lulled into the maple
leaf's game up and down the end to end

384
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,610
fucking defenseman getting caught up ice,
whatever the fuck they were doing.

385
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,950
We let up,
like I felt like six breakaways.

386
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,060
They'd a break away gold and then they
scored on a penalty shot. It's just like,

387
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:45,110
what the fuck is, this isn't how
we play. And then in gained two,

388
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:49,790
I thought the maple leafs got drawn
into the Bruins, a physical play.

389
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,330
And, you know, I thought on both games,

390
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:57,331
both like the Bruins lost their composure
in the first game and I thought the

391
00:22:57,381 --> 00:23:01,610
leads kind of lost their composure
in the second game is far as like not

392
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:04,080
sticking to their game plan
and getting drawn into,

393
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,850
it's like watching a boxing match and a
boxer gets drawn into the center of the

394
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,800
ring for a broth,
you know,

395
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,440
cause the other guy kind of gets
them into that macho fucking mode.

396
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,650
So game three I would assume is tonight.
Like I said,

397
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:20,270
I was kind of off the grid this
weekend. And um, by the way,

398
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:23,510
I'm going to look it up right now.
What the fuck is happening down in Tampa?

399
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,140
That is the only fucking time after
game two when Columbus beat, uh,

400
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,150
beat the lightning as the only time
I've ever seen was it total rally.

401
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:40,350
That's the only time I've seen
that guy smile like that. Like he,

402
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,710
he looked elated.
Oh my God,

403
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,610
they fucking lost again.

404
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

405
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,800
I mean,
it's fucking over.

406
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,160
I was just gonna say Columbus has to win
game three because you can't wake the

407
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,420
sleeping giant. That is the Tampa
Bay lightning. Good fucking Lord.

408
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:09,430
I got to watch she NHL network.
What is,

409
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,790
what are the Columbus blue jackets doing
that the Bruins couldn't fucking do

410
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,940
play off shock. Columbus wins
again. Goes up three nothing.

411
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,950
Okay, here's some quotes. Everyone's
got to step up. Everyone's got a place,

412
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:34,380
solid solid game and we've got
to make it a little bit harder.

413
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,600
That was Tyler Johnson.

414
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,210
Okay.

415
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,640
I Dunno who that is. I don't know
who anybody is. I got a kid now.

416
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:42,920
I don't know who fucking plays
for who. All right. Game three.

417
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,860
Steven Stamkos now I believe
he's still playing with Tampa.

418
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,630
Uh, he said they have no power.
Plays in a game is pretty surprising.

419
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,480
The after earn those and I thought
we played well in the third,

420
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:58,890
but it's no constellation right now with
the position we're in sorta complaining,

421
00:24:58,891 --> 00:24:59,730
but not really.

422
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,620
Our focus has to be coming out
and playing with that same pace,

423
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:08,580
the same execution, that same desperation
right from the start play one period.

424
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:11,520
At a time said Ryan McMahon. I don't know
who the fuck any of these people are.

425
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,643
MMM.

426
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,100
Somebody asked a question, when was the
last time Tampa went to Stanley clap? Why?

427
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,780
That would be 2004

428
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,330
okay.

429
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,480
That would be 2004 um,

430
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,380
Jesus Christ,
you know,

431
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,450
I went to a game out there in Columbus
and I was very impressed with their fans

432
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:36,210
and that was early on. They were all
in, they were injured the fucking game.

433
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:41,150
So congratulations to them. Tampa Bay
lightning fans. Fuck, I've been there.

434
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,120
God knows I,
I've been there.

435
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:47,630
I've been there as a fan where you fucking
kick the shit and left my first year

436
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,980
of watching the Boston Bruins,

437
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,500
like really letting all my
first year I went to a game.

438
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,873
Okay.

439
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,730
Was that 83 season?

440
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,040
Okay.

441
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,360
80 was it 83 84 we won the
president's trophy or something.

442
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,070
We had Pete Peters and he was like the
best goalie in the league and all of that.

443
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,830
And the first round was
best three out of five.

444
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:13,831
And the Canadians came in and they were
like fourth place in the Adams Division

445
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,470
and we drew them and those fucking
assholes came in and swept us like they

446
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:20,490
always did back then.
And uh,

447
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,770
the first game that was the first
Boston Bruins game I ever went to,

448
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,563
mmm.

449
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,400
I was taking French and the French kids
had come over and they took him to a

450
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:35,320
game and you had to buy the
tickets through. Our French
teacher was pretty cool.

451
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,900
And we all went down to
the old Boston Garden.

452
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,560
And I remember we went in there and we
were sitting with the French kids and it

453
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:46,530
took me about eight seconds to realize
that those fucking assholes started

454
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:49,050
rooting for the Canadians because,
uh,

455
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,620
they are started hearing all that blue
block, a rouge and all that fucking,

456
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:55,710
which is so fucking ridiculous because
the French don't even respect the fucking

457
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:59,400
French Canadians. They don't consider them
real French. They consider him farmers.

458
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,440
Um, but I got to hand it to those French
kids. They will fucking wave in these,

459
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,120
these Montreal Canadian flags right in
the faces of these drunk fucking Bruins

460
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:10,800
fans in the upper deck.

461
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,420
But I think because they were French and
they just want an American jerk offs,

462
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:16,800
they somehow got away with it.

463
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,800
But I remember my French
treats her teacher looking
over at me like making this

464
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:24,300
face like, did these fucking
kids know what they're doing?

465
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:29,100
This is getting pretty
intense. Um, oh my God.

466
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:32,490
Would that been hilarious if a brawl
broke out and the next day we went to

467
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,240
fucking French class?
You know,

468
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,280
it'd be hilarious is nothing would
happen as far as like back then where now

469
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:42,870
that would be like a national news story.

470
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,590
Like what was that
French teacher thinking?

471
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,790
Bringing these poor immigrants
down to that hostile environment.

472
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,850
Look at this cell phone footage
that wouldn't have happened.

473
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,180
Do you realize I grew up in an era where
something like that could have happened

474
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,410
and know the people in this section would
not even have known the backstory of

475
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:03,730
what went down. They would have thought
it was just a bunch of fucking cons.

476
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:06,510
Who came down from Montreal
and got their asses kicked.

477
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,960
They wouldn't realize now that
was like teenagers from France.

478
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,890
Um, anyway, uh,

479
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,900
so game three, I imagine it's tonight
a huge fucking game. Huge game.

480
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,960
We got to take control of
the goddamn series. Uh,

481
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,590
Toronto is such a good team and I was
not believing in their goaltender there

482
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:31,320
then Anderson guy.
And um,

483
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,280
basically I watched one game and he
mishandled the puck twice. So I was like,

484
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,180
I know about hockey, but he's been playing
great. Certainly in that first game,

485
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,080
that first game we had,

486
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:43,100
like I felt like we had 20 more shots
than leased it and they still came into

487
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,730
one. So leaps have a really good
team and I really liked the least,

488
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,730
you know what I mean? Um, always have. Um,

489
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,240
so like I said, if we don't beat
the least in this series, uh,

490
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,250
that they're going to be the team
that I'm going to be rooting for. Um,

491
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,470
although Columbus, I
mean, that's a fun story.

492
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,680
Now if they'd be Tampa
Cheese is Christ and I've,

493
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,040
I haven't seen a second of that series.
I'm missing the whole frigging thing.

494
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,850
I'm running around like a
lunatic. Why? Why is that?

495
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:16,851
Cause we got the last episode of
F is for family for season four.

496
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,670
We're writing it this week.
Uh,

497
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,290
but what happens at this time of the
season is as you're writing the episode,

498
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,780
you're also getting the first animatics,
which is the first rough drawings.

499
00:29:25,781 --> 00:29:28,800
And then you have to go back and punch
that stuff up and look at the edits.

500
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,750
So it starts to become like a, rather
than one giant wave writing the script,

501
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:38,160
it starts becoming a series of
waves hitting the beach. And uh, oh,

502
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:40,080
freckles gets busy here. But, uh,

503
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,190
I definitely to tune in to
watch that game for, um,

504
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,340
that Columbus series and uh,

505
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,870
and of course I'm going to be watching my
Bruins tonight. All right. What else? Oh,

506
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,820
big announcement. This is something
I've been trying to do for awhile. Um,

507
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,530
I have a charity show coming up, um, on,

508
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,110
uh, August 1st at the Wilbur
Boston, Massachusetts.

509
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,640
Yours truly is going to be there with
a bunch of other, uh, Boston comics.

510
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,340
It's for the, uh, the
Travis Roy Foundation.

511
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,580
It's laughing with your buddies
for the Travis Roy Foundation.

512
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,810
Travis Roy of course,

513
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,210
was a great hockey player for the
Boston Bruins and unfortunately, um,

514
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,310
and you know, he broke his neck and
got paralyzed plane for the team.

515
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,170
And um, I remember where I
was when I saw that story.

516
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:38,950
That story really affected
everybody living in Boston.

517
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,410
And um,
I was,

518
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,790
I've been trying to get involved with
their charity for a long time and it's

519
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:50,730
finally going to happen. And um, this
is basically, yeah, the, the, you know,

520
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:52,930
this the most important show I'm
doing one of the year, man, this is a,

521
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:56,500
this is a huge thing to be able to,
uh,

522
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,400
do something for the Travis Roy Foundation
has been able to email back and forth

523
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:04,840
with him. He's a great dude,
obviously, uh, with a great heart,

524
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:08,170
super positive and he's doing such great
things for people who are in a similar

525
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:13,030
situation as him. It's going to be
August 1st at, uh, at the Wilbur theater.

526
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,140
The venue,
presale is Wednesday and Thursday.

527
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,900

Uh,

528
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,930
www.thewilburwilbur.com/artist/bill
burr bill dashboard,

529
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,210
another backslash Jesus Christ. Why don't
we just fucking tweet the Goddamn link?

530
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:35,890
I think that that's where we are.
What we're going to do.

531
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,600
I can't wait to do that show. Um, oh,

532
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,370
freckles is going to have a fun summer.

533
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:46,640
I got a a got an acting gig and uh,

534
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,280
that shoots back on the east coast.
Um,

535
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,830
some of you saw my general
hospital trailer to,

536
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,330
well that's a first soap opera
actually released a trailer.

537
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:03,331
But I like to think I did such a good
job on general hospital that they want to

538
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:08,290
hide my, my three episode arc.
It's actually just one episode. Um,

I met him the other night
at the comedy store.

546
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,660
He talks about his experience growing
up in a culture that didn't worship

547
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:38,830
American comedy,

548
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,620
to being right in the middle of it as
a comedy store employee and standup

00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:05,720

557
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,100
MMM. If he can find a way to listen
to it because I'm not sure, you know,

558
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:22,010
I know they black out the fucking
internet over there. From what I've heard,

559
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,270
as far as the American propaganda done,
told me, I don't know if it's true or not.

560
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,471
Um,
all right,

561
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:32,471
let's read some of some of the
advertising here for the week.

562
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,850
Uh, for him, I ask you,

563
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,740
do you want a bald spot to pop up
on your hairline? But, oh, sorry.

564
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,040
Do you want a bald spot?
The pop up or your hairline to recede?

565
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,170
Hey or do you want to do
something about it first?

566
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,070
Why did guys turned a weird solutions?

567
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,310
Because they don't want to go bald or
do nothing because they dealt with it.

568
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:03,970
They accepted it. That's how I
dealt with balding. I fucking,

569
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,210
I acted like that fucking
turtle out in the Mojave desert.

570
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,530
I just fucking rolled over
and died. Um, anyways,

571
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:15,940
when they can turn to
medicine and science, this
really is like a thing, like,

572
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:18,490
I guess you don't have to go bald anymore.
It's funny.

573
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:21,530
The other guy I was working with was
also bald and we were talking about, um,

574
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,580
he was going to you getting those old
age spots on top of your head. I said,

575
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:29,030
no fucking way, dude, I do not have
my bald head in the sun whatsoever.

576
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,200
And he goes, yeah, man, it sucks. And then
we just started laughing. I go, you know,

577
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:35,630
it's fucking crazy with all
these stem cell research,

578
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:38,780
they can literally grow a fucking ear
and a god Damn Petri dish and they can't

579
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:42,990
come up with, um, a solution to balding.

580
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,320
And, uh, and we were both laughing
about it. I go, yeah, but you know,

581
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,101
it's fucking funny.

582
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:51,070
Once she shaved her head like I
don't think I would want to go back.

583
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,150
There is something great. If you shave
your head, you're always ready to go.

584
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,850
Oh, you got to do is throw on a shirt with
the F that's fucking iron and you look

585
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,590
like, I don't know, you had a spot. Um,

586
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,190
this is probably not shift to
be saying in a solution for bar.

587
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,300
Don't end up like me talking to another
bald guy in a parking lot after being in

588
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:11,200
a desert all day,

589
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:15,660
acting like you like looking like a
fucking poor man's Yule Brenner. Okay.

590
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,220
Anyways, no more war. No more. Anyways,

591
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,140

male ego back together. Okay?

attention. What the fuck, Morty,

597
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:44,370
you need no more awkward in person doctor
visits or long form pharmacy lines.

598
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,281
Oh,
that's the worst.

599
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:50,430
I went to a couple of those when I was
considering trying to do something about

600
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,300
my situation.

601
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,080

oh,

651
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,530
all right. What else did I want to talk
about? Was there anything else? Uh,

652
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,900
Lewis Hamilton, once again, finally had
his first right, great start of the year.

653
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,930
Blew right by foul Terry Botox who had
the pull position and that was pretty

654
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:23,774
much it.

655
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,800
And I had been watching racing f one race
in long enough to know that will Lewis

656
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,450
Hamilton gets to first in that first
turn, the fucking race is over, it's over.

657
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,980
And I also know that if he's in second
or third place and there's only 10 laps

658
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:40,940
to go and he has no chance of winning the
race, he's going to start complaining.

659
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,260
I don't understand why other people
aren't helping me out here. Um,

660
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,410
I was really hoping Botox was
going to win that because, uh,

661
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,600
I didn't realize the
first year when I watched,

662
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,763
mmm,

663
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,320
what a great fucking year that was.

664
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,720
To Watch two drivers on the same team
compete for it and not help each other and

665
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:06,780
smash into each other. What the fuck
was that guy's name? The guy retired.

666
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,930
I can't remember his name.
Anyway,

667
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,700
plowing ahead.
I did not see the moto GP race.

668
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:19,380
I have a lot of shit to get caught up on
it because I was out in the desert. Um,

669
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,370
I was being such a fucking
asshole when I was out there too.

670
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,330
Like they were explaining
all this military stuff to
me and I was just standing

671
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:31,420
there in my fucking vans and my, my, uh,

672
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,220
Pete Carroll Khakis and they would explain
all this military shit and then when

673
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:40,880
they would just be like, do you have
any questions? And I was just like, um,

674
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,110
kit, I bet the stars at night
are incredible out here.

675
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,110
Can you see the stars a lot better
than you came without the thing in the

676
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,930
fucking those the guy when special
forces and he totally rolled with it.

677
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:53,730
He was like, absolutely, it makes
you question your existence.

678
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,120
We're just a speck of dust.

679
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,343
Um,

680
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,980
yeah, there was a lot of
ball break it out there.

681
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,550
And it reminded me of back in the day
when I used to work in a warehouse and all

682
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:09,580
we did was just give each other shit
all day was the most fun fucking thing.

683
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:09,690
Yeah.

684
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,110
Ever. And uh, at some point,

685
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,790
because one of the guys on special
forces was also had a kid around my age.

686
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,670
We both started going off on that show,
fancy Nancy

687
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,000
and uh,

688
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,980
and what an asshole she is. And how we
both, uh, watching her going like this,

689
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:32,080
I don't want my daughter
watching this shit.

690
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,670
Okay.

691
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,300
And we watch

692
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,470
it.
Oh cause she's fancy.

693
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:39,670
She's totally into like status and who
were friends aren't having tree forts and

694
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:43,750
not letting people in and is trying
to fill up her life with like fucking

695
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,800
clothes and shit.

696
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:49,060
Like that's going to fill up our
passion and we would just trashing it,

697
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,010
laughing our asses off.

698
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:55,820
And at some point we said that the working
title of that for the working title

699
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:59,820
of it was actually Conti Kathy, but they
couldn't get it on the air or something.

700
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:00,410
Like I forget.

701
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,990
But we just fucking sitting there in the
middle of this desert just laughing our

702
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:04,700
balls off about this fucking cartoon.

703
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,990
And then all of a sudden this
war games thinks started and um,

704
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,120
I don't know. I want to thank everybody
once again, it was out there, man.

705
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:16,320
That was a hell of an experience that
I will definitely not forget. Um,

706
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,493
okay.

707
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,780
So anyway, let's see. Let's read some
of the questions here for this week.

708
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,550
All right.
Uh,

709
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,070
okay. So I sent out a tweet
as a joke saying, you know,

710
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:30,540
I wish somebody from England,

711
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:31,940
okay.

712
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,610
Could explain to me the
different leagues in soccer.

713
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,880
And I was doing that as a joke because
last week when I fucking thought that Man

714
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,590
City had launched a league game
and that what's his face is,

715
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:49,070
you know, it's so fucking stupid.
It's not a fucking league game,

716
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:52,910
but they still add the points or don't
have the points. I don't fucking get it.

717
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,210
It's so fucking ridiculous.
Like this is just a friendly,

718
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,700
the middle of the season. Let's just
play a fucking game for the fuck of it.

719
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,990
And then there's the
champion's league anyway,

720
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:08,090
so I have all these fucking English
cunts put down their fish and chips for a

721
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:08,811
fucking minute.

722
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:13,550
Right then waddled they're bloated upper
bodies with these skinny fucking legs

723
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:16,700
over to their computer and just started.
It was hilarious.

724
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:19,430
They were fucking live at, at me. Um,

725
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,900
and so I was just sort
of being a dick going,

726
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,400
I wish somebody would explain it to me.

727
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:28,580
So may if I could see if I could get him
to start writing and capital letters.

728
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,620
But what ended up happening was because
I wrote it nicely rather than being a

729
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,800
dick here, sorry, still going
fucking sand in my throat. Um,

730
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,470
yeah.

731
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,470
Uh, they actually sent me a bunch of
emails to try to explain it to me.

732
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:46,520
So now I can't break that balls anymore.
So all right. So here's the deal.

733
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,520
This is basically explaining
all the different league.

734
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:54,230
Soccer has has a playoff,
but it's called the champion's league.

735
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,390
The top four premier league teams at
the end of the season make the playoffs.

736
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:02,660
Just like the divisions in American
sports. See, I didn't know this.

737
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,330
I'm the team with the most points in
the premier league basically wins the

738
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:09,560
president's trophy.

739
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,850
The biggest difference is that the
playoffs happen at the same time as the

740
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:14,870
regular season.

741
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,240
I see like that I needed
more explanation there.

742
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:24,150
So that basically means that
this season is a play. All right,

743
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:28,650
so the Tottenham win over man
city happened in the playoffs.

744
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,190
What?
Liverpool is currently

745
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,940
in the playoffs and there are no
tie games. If you get a chance,

746
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,900
watch the Champions League.
It's really awesome to watch.

747
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,110
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Yeah, no, see I would watch that.

748
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,980
Now why didn't somebody just
tell me that from the beginning,

749
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,180
but the Champions League is also,
it's not just the top four teams.

750
00:44:50,181 --> 00:44:52,970
I thought there was something
like with like Switzerland,

751
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,850
I dunno,

752
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm just going to keep asking questions
to like get it because now that seems,

753
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:02,740
that seems exciting to me as
opposed to just, you know what,

754
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,810
we met twice during the regular
season and I lost both fucking gains,

755
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:08,600
but I still have more points to you.
So I win the premier league. I don't,

756
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
I don't know. Anyways, um,

757
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,240
this is Biden,
dear Billy night night shades.

758
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,650
I'm not offended by your take on Biden
cause I don't really get offended and I'm

759
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:24,920
not outraged by, by Biden. Okay,

760
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:28,430
so now you know immediately this
person's going to fucking be offended.

761
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,980
My opinion, however, is
different than yours,

762
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,010
which despite what they tell us
on the new, the news is, okay.

763
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,303
All right.

764
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,910
I would take another look at the video
of him groping side Boob in shit.

765
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,560
If that was a guy I work with,
I'd have the same opinion.

766
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,810
And it happens when the guy is next
to a podium, not on the dance floor,

767
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:59,190
sending signals. Some of the
girls are young. It's just weird.

768
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:01,800
And I'm not even saying
he's got bad intentions.

769
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:06,690
You just can't touch strangers that long.
Ha Ha. And I totally understand the,

770
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,120
it was from a different time thing,

771
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:14,390
but my dad never rubbed up on people and
he served in Korea in drove a cutlass,

772
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,600
love you and love the podcast. Oh, here's
the thing about the Joe Biden thing.

773
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,460
I didn't even see that. I saw like half
a cliff before I went out on Conan.

774
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,730
They go, you want to talk about
that? A Gal fucking talk about it.

775
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,090
I don't pay attention to shit.

776
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,240
I'm just so fucking sick of everybody
having their fucking career ended on,

777
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,890
on, on our fucking, you know,

778
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,050
a two minute tripping
penalty and everybody else
sitting there fucking acting

779
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:45,600
like they're good people.
As I've said from day one,

780
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,290
if everybody's fucking text
messages were made public,

781
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,660
could anybody go to work next Monday?

782
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,060
Nobody.
Nobody could.

783
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:59,200
So everybody's got to stop fucking lick
this fucking witch hunt that like you

784
00:46:59,201 --> 00:47:01,000
know for your own fucking instance.
The thing too,

785
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,800
the amount of people that are going to
watch Biden's dream of becoming president

786
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,700
get destroyed just for the
entertainment purpose of it.

787
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,260
That's all they want to do.
And there's another thing too,

788
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:17,680
is because there's so many different
ways to just sit down and watch shit,

789
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:20,740
there's so much shit to fucking watch.
There's so much weight,

790
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,270
so many ways to watch shit.

791
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,250
That one ratings grabbing his
fucking stirring up controversy.

792
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,440
Jesus Christ.
Do you remember the fucking family feud?

793
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,110
Richard Dawson was like tongue kissing
every fucking chick on the God damn

794
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:40,890
fucking thing.
There was no fucking problem.

795
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,720
He hosted few bap bap, bap, bap,
bap, bap, bap, bap, bap. Right?

796
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:46,554
It was fine.

797
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,023
Yeah.

798
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,370
Everybody fucking sitting there getting
uncomfortable. It didn't happen to you.

799
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,780
Nothing happened to you.
This isn't your fucking story.

800
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:02,140
If the woman's uncomfortable,
she should say something.

801
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,100
Jesus fucking Christ.

802
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:08,300
Tell your mother that shit where
it's just like so and so said this,

803
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,490
but did they really need that?

804
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,570
Should Peyton manning be upset while
he's obviously not upset? Espn,

805
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,600
I remember that one from back
in the day. I don't know. I'm,

806
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:23,930
I'm one of these fucking people there.
It's just like if the,

807
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,600
that's between the
fucking people involved.

808
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:30,350
I don't know what they're
fucking relationship is and
neither do you for all you

809
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:32,720
know,
he was maybe the side boot check.

810
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:36,620
He's fucking banging and afterwards
she's just like, dude, what the fuck?

811
00:48:36,621 --> 00:48:38,810
Don't grab my Ted on fucking TV.

812
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,790
They're going to know we're fucking
bang and there's a possible scenario.

813
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,360
Look at me with no evidence.
I can do it too.

814
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,293
MMM.

815
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,410
Yeah. I'm not an, I'm not
in the fucking business.

816
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:57,280
A fucking making up shit and trying to
fucking get people in trouble. Am I?

817
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,410
Maybe I am as a comedian.
I don't know.

818
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:02,830
I just feel like I'm fucking
joking around and like this,

819
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:06,430
this fucking thing where you just shove
a microscope up. Everybody's asked.

820
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:09,100
They're all human.
They're all fucking flawed.

821
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,750
I remember back in the day
when I worked in a warehouse,

822
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:16,890
there was this fucking manager guy,
he was too fucking touch you. Faley

823
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,940
and you know what?
We all fucking dealt with it.

824
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:24,630
It was fucking hilarious when he'd get
you and everybody else would just be

825
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:29,010
laughing at you. But nowadays that
guy would lose his fucking job.

826
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,710
He'd have to be a registered
fucking sex offender.

827
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,770
I remember I used to fucking try
and make sure I was like, you know,

828
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,920
you had to have your head on a
swivel when that guy fucking came in.

829
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,760
Big fucking doughboy looking dude.
Right?

830
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,640
So I was at the vending machine and I was,

831
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:50,980
uh, I was, I, I've told this story before,

832
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:55,300
I was trying to figure what the fuck I
was trying to buy some fucking food or

833
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:59,170
whatever and uh, as you do at a vending
machine. And he came walking in, he goes,

834
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,370
oh, hey bill, how you doing it? As he
was walking by me from left to right,

835
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,870
he slapped

836
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:11,330
his hand on my left shoulder and then
dragged it across my entire back as,

837
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,240
as he was walking past.

838
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:19,170
And then squeezed my
right fucking shoulder.

839
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:20,520
Like it was a perky teddy.

840
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,550
I think he was squeezing
the Sharmane and I was like,

841
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,273
ah.

842
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,720
I mean it took like a decade and a
half to fucking shake that thing off.

843
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:38,170
Now it should. That guy
had been doing that. No.

844
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,570
Okay.

845
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:44,570
Do I think I need to report him and he
should fucking then lose his job and then

846
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:49,050
this is on him for the rest of his
fucking life. Now. He's just weird.

847
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,750
He's a weird guy. Okay. He
didn't fucking dental me,

848
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,420
drug me and throw me in a van.
He fucking, he fucking, yeah.

849
00:50:58,421 --> 00:51:00,050
I don't know how he got
a little too friendly.

850
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,470
Yeah,

851
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:03,630
he gave me the Heebie.
Jeebies okay.

852
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,610
I don't think giving somebody the Heebie
jeebies should fuck it. End Your career.

853
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,370
I think you ought to be able to sit
down with them and be like, listen,

854
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,090
could you do me a favor?
Can you just say hello?

855
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,740
Okay.

856
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,420
Ninth grader, he was, sorry.
Granted he was my boss

857
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,510
then I was younger and I didn't know
how to fucking say that, but I mean,

858
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:29,570
you know what? If fucking Jesus
Christ every fucking thing.

859
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,360
Everything is just the biggest thing.

860
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,593
Okay.

861
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,551
Oh,
you know what I did?

862
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:38,660
I went back into the
warehouse and I fucking told
everybody and I got such a big

863
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:41,990
laugh telling the story. It was
almost worth the debt. He did it.

864
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,440
The fact that it was worth it. I
don't get, I didn't give a shit.

865
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,320
Okay.

866
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,780
I didn't feel fucking triggered
and all of that fucking crap.

867
00:51:49,781 --> 00:51:52,540
Every fucking thing I know.
But I gotta tell you something right now.

868
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:55,810
Anybody fought in Korea and drove a
fucking olds cutlass is our right with me.

869
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:00,910
Um, all right. White
people challenging, uh,

870
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,833
racism.

871
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,030
Hey Mr. Billy Baldwin and I liked it.
That's a new one.

872
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,200
Play on the Baldwin thing. Oh,
what people done that before,

873
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:14,040
but that's in a different,
different way, right? Anyways, uh,

874
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,610
I'm a fellow mass hole that used to work
in the athletics department at East.

875
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:20,290
Don't call me a math hall.
It's,

876
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:23,470
you're shaming an entire state
and I feel like every state,

877
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,050
bring something to the table.

878
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,150
Speaking of which Fort Irwin I learned
when I was there. The square mileage,

879
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,280
square mileage, the
square miles of that, um,

880
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:40,360
training facility. That base is
bigger than the state of Rhode Island.

881
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:44,260
How crazy is that? Um, anyways, the class,

882
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,080
where the fuck am I?

883
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:48,363
Yeah,

884
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,510
I am a fellow mass hall.

885
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:52,870
They used to work in the
athletics department at a
small college in one of those

886
00:52:52,871 --> 00:52:54,550
rich suburbs of Boston.

887
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,463
Okay.

888
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,050
They ain't all registered there,
buddy.

889
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:03,330
I wanted to hear your opinion on a
professional development class that I was

890
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:04,560
forced to go to.

891
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,453
Uh,

892
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:14,140
the class was titled White People
Challenging Racism to middle aged women.

893
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:16,130
Ran The class.

894
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:20,570
One white lady that had to mention
that she had a black husband.

895
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:24,940
Every other sentence
and the,

896
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:25,991
and the other,

897
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:30,870
a black lady who referenced the book
that she wrote every other sentence.

898
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,310
Oh my God, this is like a sketch. I
wish I was there. Long story short.

899
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,680
Okay.

900
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,240
The class was about how the only people
that can be racist in America are white

901
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:45,680
people because they hold the
power over every minority. Uh,

902
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,910
they're big fanapt. You see
road, their big. Finally,

903
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,140
they're big finale.
Uh,

904
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:58,220
was showing a video from the 90s of a
high school science teacher showing kids

905
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,510
that all people share the
same DNA and we're one race,

906
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,730
which I mentioned.
Yeah.

907
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,630
They taught me that in middle school
social studies and science class.

908
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:10,010
I thought everyone knew this.

909
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,710
The black professor also came over to
me and my coworker after we had finished

910
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:20,180
reviewing and said, you two look
like you don't want to be here.

911
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:21,883
Okay.

912
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,870
My coworker and I looked at each other
and explain how we had finished the work

913
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:27,980
she just assigned,

914
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:32,981
which was to point out how the video
she showed us was racist overall.

915
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:37,420
It was a very uncomfortable experience
and I was just wondering how you would

916
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:41,270
have responded in this training.
Sorry for the long email.

917
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:46,210
Love your stuff and hope you and your
family are well from a fellow mass hall.

918
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:51,290
All right. Okay. A lot of stuff here.

919
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,110
All right.

920
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,630
The wording of that is so stupid

921
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,940
to say that white people are the only
ones that they have the ability to be

922
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,780
racist is because they
hold the power over other.

923
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,810
Every other minority is such a stupid
fucking way of conveying that thought to a

924
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,330
group of people that you want to
be receptive of that information.

925
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,040
That's immediately going to put every
white person on the defensive and be like,

926
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:20,880
what the fuck?

927
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,590
And then start sending fucking email
questions to some shitheads podcast who

928
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:29,250
sits in his basement and talks to himself.
Um,

929
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,250
I would have worded that differently.

930
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I would have said that the reason why
white people being racist is the worst is

931
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:42,320
because they hold, they do hold the
power over every other minority.

932
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:46,740
So the effect of them being racist,
um,

933
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,890
is so much more painful.
All right.

934
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:57,580
And if I was in that class,
what I would have said I would,

935
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,420
I would've said is what you want.
You're saying,

936
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:02,210
and I'm not saying this is with all white
people because not every white person

937
00:56:02,211 --> 00:56:03,920
is in a position of power,

938
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,110
but overall all the powerful positions,
you know,

939
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,340
99.9% of them sees to be held by
white people. What I would have,

940
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,400
what I would say and what I
have said to people, you know,

941
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:21,170
when they try to come out with that
white guys are evil shit. It's like,

942
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,520
no they're not.
They're not.

943
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:27,521
Inherently what you're seeing with white
people is human beings with unchecked

944
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:32,100
power. The result of that, okay,

945
00:56:32,101 --> 00:56:36,390
so what you would then see is if
another group where to get that power,

946
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:40,380
they would behave in the exact same way.

947
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,620
And what I would say
is the me too movement.

948
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,600
Okay?

949
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,600
If you look at how these powerless women
then handled the power of being able to

950
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:53,580
destroy,
you know,

951
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:58,581
first of all get get people who did
something wrong all and then how quickly

952
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:03,020
that spun out of fucking
control to just like, um,

953
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,780
I was in a toxic relationship,
which who the fuck hasn't been

954
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,690
okay?

955
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,630
Who the fuck can't look on back on
their dating history gonna be like,

956
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:15,950
Jesus Christ, I should have got out of
that relationship fucking two dates in.

957
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:17,580
Okay.

958
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,610
And then we would have avoided all of
that fucking drama of screaming and

959
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,630
yelling show,
but that me too.

960
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:25,410
Shit went from like these fucking horrible
guys that were taking their dicks out

961
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:27,060
and doing all this fucking horrible shit.

962
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,123
MMM.

963
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,960
To then just like he yelled
at me, you know, and, and,

964
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,660
and you just saw how bad that whole
fucking thing has spun out of control.

965
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,160
I thought, uh, how, uh, I don't want
to fucking stir up the name here again.

966
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,280
How a certain fucking group prevented a
certain fucking performer from doing a

967
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:52,510
dream Gig this year. I thought that their
unchecked power that they went from,

968
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:57,430
despite the fact that they became,
uh, an entity to protect victims,

969
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,270
they actually became the bullying that
point where this person had already

970
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:05,500
fucking apologize.
So there needs to be more of that.

971
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:06,870
Okay.

972
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:11,370
Because the ultimate goal is to get white
people to understand the position of

973
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:15,030
somebody who isn't white. So when
you come at people that way, that's,

974
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,000
that's how it's done on the
Internet in a more crass way,

975
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:20,850
which I've always said is when
somebody is presenting an opinion,

976
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:25,170
there'll be like a hey fuck head, maybe if
you fucking blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

977
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:28,230
They start with hey fuck,
like who's listening after that?

978
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,743
MMM.

979
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,033
So,

980
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,870
and it's weird cause I unders cause I
though it's one of the first huge fights I

981
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:41,740
got in with Patrice O'neil when he said
it was impossible for black people to be

982
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:45,010
ready. I was like, what the, what the
fuck are you talking about? And uh,

983
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:48,010
and then I later found out he was quoting
like spike Lee and it wasn't even his

984
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:51,690
quote.
Um,

985
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:53,550
yeah,

986
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:57,720
but that whole, that whole thing where
that woman came over to me and if she,

987
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:01,280
if she came home and said, you two look
like you don't want to be here, uh,

988
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,720
you got to go right back
at a person like that.

989
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,960
You two look like you don't want
to be here. And I would be like,

990
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,840
and I would just look at it. I
go, what? What is that based on?

991
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,370
And I would throw it right back at her.

992
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,300
So now you're coming over
here judging me and my vibe.

993
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:19,070
Okay.

994
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,970
And your comment over here with like
this aggressive thing. What this,

995
00:59:21,971 --> 00:59:23,050
this veiled sort of,

996
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:26,710
I'm going to report you cause you weren't
sitting here with the big smile on

997
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:28,810
your face.
What do you want me to do now?

998
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:32,080
Be Reversed Louie Armstrong
while I listen to this shit.

999
00:59:32,081 --> 00:59:35,520
Is that what I'm supposed to fucking do?
You told me to do this and I did.

1000
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,670
This is the thing like,

1001
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:41,050
but you're not allowed to say that in
that it's like well you kind of came the

1002
00:59:41,051 --> 00:59:45,040
whole fucking way you entered
this was not the way that,

1003
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:48,910
that's just not the fucking way to do it.
You know?

1004
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,220
And then if somebody is up
there while they're doing that,

1005
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:55,720
also trying to sell books,
the whole thing is fucking hilarious.

1006
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,480
You two look like you don't
want to be here. Oh I'm sorry.

1007
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:04,740
I was thinking about where the nearest
Barnes and noble was so I could go out

1008
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:05,574
and buy your book.

1009
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:09,400
Yeah.

1010
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,260
Do you have any sort of guilt that you're
trying to make money off of this? Um,

1011
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:18,400
yeah. So here's the thing I see, I
see both sides of that. Like, like

1012
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:25,090
white people challenging racism.
That's a weird title for what happened.

1013
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,033
MMM.

1014
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,840
I thought that that was going to be like,
you know,

1015
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:32,610
when white people do that thing,
when somebody,

1016
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,680
a black person talks about racism and
they go like slavery was like 180 years

1017
01:00:38,671 --> 01:00:41,880
ago. Fagging get over it.
Like they do that shit.

1018
01:00:41,881 --> 01:00:45,940
Like I've thought that that's what
this email was going to be about. Um,

1019
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,660
which obviously is
astoundingly ignorant and uh,

1020
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,460
it didn't affect so many people's lives.

1021
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:55,020
That would be actually funny on
some fucking level. Um, yeah,

1022
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:56,910
so that's my take on that.
So if anybody does that,

1023
01:00:56,911 --> 01:01:00,900
like the big thing about when you're
presenting an opinion and God knows I

1024
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:02,670
learned this by doing
it the wrong way for,

1025
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:07,730
for fucking 40 of my 50 years is you
have to enter your point in a way that

1026
01:01:09,061 --> 01:01:13,440
keeps the other people's deflector
shields down so they can hear what you're

1027
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:13,951
saying.

1028
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:17,610
And then also feel that you're not saying
that they are the thing that you're

1029
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:18,444
talking about.

1030
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,323
MMM.

1031
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:26,380
That would be my suggestion.
And um, when you're doing that,

1032
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,253
you know,

1033
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:28,390
yeah,

1034
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,750
I dunno. I that fucking lady,
they're just sitting there

1035
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,090
sitting that going, cause
I got a black husband. Um,

1036
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:41,110
I've written a black Dick,
so I feel like I should be here.

1037
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:42,940
Um,

1038
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:47,940
we need a white person that's halfway
into the black world here to maybe help

1039
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:52,660
the white people that are fully in the
white world to bridge the gap between

1040
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:58,260
themselves and then this African
American woman here who's going to try to

1041
01:01:58,451 --> 01:02:02,410
inform them while selling
books. Um, all right.

1042
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:06,790
Titanic theory. All right. Hey,
bill a, they are Billy false flag.

1043
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,790
Uh, do you know the theory
behind the titanic sinking? Uh,

1044
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:13,481
in short,

1045
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:18,481
JP Morgan owned the titanic and the
Olympic completely identical ships.

1046
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:24,130
Olympic was damaged in port before it
could be insured according to a shipyard

1047
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:28,790
captain. At the time Morgan had
all the identification changed.

1048
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,290
So it said titanic on the, now we, we can

1049
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,030
Olympic get the fuck outta here.

1050
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,010
Morgan was supposed to be on the
ship but fell ill at the last minute.

1051
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,500
Important side note,

1052
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:51,130
this was all while Morgan was fighting
for a central banking system so he can

1053
01:02:51,411 --> 01:02:53,780
manipulate us markets even more.

1054
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:58,910
Also the voyage on the voyage where two
billionaires who opposed the federal

1055
01:02:58,911 --> 01:03:01,700
system and stood in Morgan's way.

1056
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:06,620
There's a lot of good info on this one.
Billy would love to hear your thoughts.

1057
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:07,820
I love to read about it.

1058
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,760
What you're basically doing here
is you're presenting motive,

1059
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:19,400
all right? Where he would definitely
have a motive if all of that is true,

1060
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:22,850
but how do you prove the old switcheroo,

1061
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,010
which is what a lot of

1062
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:31,690
conspiracy theory starts off with in a
reminds me of this great Robert Klein

1063
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:35,360
joke. When he was making fun of those
people at late night, they would tell you,

1064
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:40,340
uh, how to get rich and he would
start it off. He goes, okay,

1065
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,090
you have no money. So you buy a house and
then you take the equity in the house.

1066
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:48,470
She don't own in like, it all starts off
with this giant leap of bullshit. Like,

1067
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:51,920
wait a minute, I don't have any
money. How do I buy a house?

1068
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:56,330
Um, how do you PR, how do you prove to me

1069
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,270
the Olympic was damaged in port

1070
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,290
before it could be insured?

1071
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,370
I mean,
how bad was it damaged

1072
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:19,800
though? I don't believe
this. I don't believe it.

1073
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,100
I, yeah, I, I simply don't believe that.

1074
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,700
So what had already had holes in it
and then they just sent it out. I know.

1075
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:33,250
I don't believe that.
Um,

1076
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:40,230
and also I think the people, the way
the exam of the boat when they found it,

1077
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,150
I didn't everything kind
of fall in place. I, yeah,

1078
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,700
I don't believe that the old me would've
believed that damn bed and we meet from

1079
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:52,440
10 years ago would've believed that.
Um, but I'll, I'll look it up. That's,

1080
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,900
that's fascinating shit. That
makes for a great, I'll take it.

1081
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:57,270
Makes for a great fucking movie.
All right.

1082
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,170
High School's Sweetie reached
out to me. Oh Jesus. Dear bill,

1083
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:04,020
longtime listener of the podcast,
seen all your specials.

1084
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:07,350
Look forward to season Pfoa
of FC for F is for family.

1085
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,070
I am 22 and I've been listening to
the podcast for the last five years.

1086
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,930
Tremendous. Uh, the other day
I literally put myself in, in,

1087
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,590
I put you in my shoes.

1088
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,010
Like all of a sudden if you were 50 in
your high school sweetheart reached out

1089
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:20,970
to you.
How weird that would be.

1090
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:25,260
Cause both of you would be married or
divorced and would be crazy. Um, anyways,

1091
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:30,000
I am 22 and I've been listening to
the podcast for the last five years.

1092
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,930
The other day,
my high school sweet.

1093
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:36,940
He texted me out of the blue explaining
that I was on her mind and she couldn't

1094
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:40,890
hold back or feelings of curiosity.
So she texted me. Well that was smart.

1095
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,580
It's what she should though. You're young.
This is all, this is all above board? No,

1096
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,830
no biting, no Biden.
Um, they'll side book.

1097
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:50,130
I now live in a different city,

1098
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:55,190
have a new girlfriend and my ex and
I haven't spoken in over a year.

1099
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,130
Okay.

1100
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,900
Oh,
so you only broke up with her a year ago?

1101
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:03,410
I thought you haven't talked to her
since high school. Oh, okay. In the past.

1102
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:06,500
She has reached out to me when she's
having difficulties in her current

1103
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:08,420
relationship and in my opinion,

1104
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:11,840
would text me to test the waters to see
if I was ready to get back together with

1105
01:06:11,841 --> 01:06:14,900
her. And of course, things would
always escalate to the bedroom.

1106
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:19,130
Her texts went on to say that the next
time I was in town we should get together

1107
01:06:19,131 --> 01:06:23,840
for coffee or something
and quote, catch up. Uh,

1108
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,890
I was skeptical, but played
along and agreed. What?

1109
01:06:27,891 --> 01:06:31,700
You have a new girlfriend here, man, I
don't know about this, but you're young.

1110
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,660
This is what you do. I was skeptical
what played along and agreed.

1111
01:06:35,661 --> 01:06:40,661
She then went on to say that she has the
cutest puppy and I just have to meet.

1112
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:46,100
All right now she's drawn you into her
house or apartment and I was even more

1113
01:06:46,101 --> 01:06:47,990
skeptical of her true intentions.

1114
01:06:47,991 --> 01:06:51,650
Jesus career acting like the white
guy in every fucking the horror movie.

1115
01:06:51,651 --> 01:06:53,840
When I was growing up,
I need to investigate.

1116
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:57,710
I asked her if she still lived
with her current boyfriend.

1117
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,250
Okay.

1118
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,340
And she said, no, it's complicated.

1119
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:03,180
Okay,

1120
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,900
so bill,

1121
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:08,460
would I just be dumb to actually meet up
with her and chat with the thought that

1122
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:13,140
maybe she actually wants to catch up or
should I just stay away reaching out to

1123
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:15,930
you because you've always been
great with advice or relationship,

1124
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:20,040
which wish you and your family
all the best. All right,

1125
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,580
let me get to the top of this thing here.

1126
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,260
Um, I now live in a different city
and have a new girlfriend. All right.

1127
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:31,050
You have a girlfriend, dude, so you
should know you should not be doing this.

1128
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:34,890
Would you be cool if your new girlfriend
was fucking catching up with her old

1129
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:38,910
boyfriend who got a new goldfish and
wanted her to come by his apartment to

1130
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:40,680
check it out?
You know what she wants to do?

1131
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,810
I know my listeners know and you know,

1132
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,190
your deck is taking you over there,
buddy. You don't seem like you,

1133
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:51,840
you didn't mention one time that you
still have feelings for this woman at all.

1134
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,960
Okay.

1135
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,850
I think it's some fucking throwback
pussy that you're going to. Uh,

1136
01:07:57,851 --> 01:07:59,500
it's not fair to your new girlfriend.

1137
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:03,670
You shouldn't fucking do it unless you
still have feelings for this woman.

1138
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,430
At which point you should not be in
a relationship with this other new

1139
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:08,020
girlfriend.
He should figure that out.

1140
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:12,490
But all is forgiven because you're
only 22 years old, you know,

1141
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:16,530
and you have a dick.
So these are tough years as a guy.

1142
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,590
You don't know what the fuck that though.
So no, I would not go. I, I would,

1143
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,173
you know,

1144
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,620
if I could go back and
talk to the 22 year old me,

1145
01:08:25,621 --> 01:08:30,090
I would say don't do shit
like this. Um, especially now.

1146
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:31,640
Okay,

1147
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,031
okay,

1148
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:36,680
well you have social media and all that
and there's nothing preventing her after

1149
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:38,930
you hook up with her, which
you know, you're gonna do.

1150
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:43,320
There's nothing preventing her from
fucking, you know, when she finds a,

1151
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:45,920
she know you have a girlfriend,
she probably doesn't.

1152
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,550
And if she finds out there's the,
you know, you're going to get caught,

1153
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:54,210
the whole fucking thing's going to
blow up and you face, you know, Eh,

1154
01:08:54,211 --> 01:08:57,080
then that's going to be yet. So I
would not do it. I wouldn't do it.

1155
01:08:57,081 --> 01:09:01,440
It's not fair to the girlfriend that
you have, but, um, I dunno, you,

1156
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:04,430
the weird thing about all of this is I
don't think you're in to either one of

1157
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:09,380
these women. I think you should be
single because you have a new girlfriend.

1158
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:12,420
You didn't say that. I love, that's
fucking awesome and blah blah blah, blah.

1159
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:15,710
He didn't say that. And then he didn't
say that. You still love your ex.

1160
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:17,550
Um,

1161
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:19,670
okay.

1162
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:22,490
I think you're trying to fuck both
these checks is what I'm thinking.

1163
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,570
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't do it.

1164
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:29,750
And I would also try to assess how you
feel about your new girlfriend before you

1165
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:33,430
waste her time and break her
heart. You might want to be
single. He's one. I'm, I'm,

1166
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:37,120
I'm leaning towards that. I don't have
enough information here, but that's,

1167
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:41,780
I didn't see any sort of, uh, you know,

1168
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,210
my high school sweetheart.
I felt like I could be with her.

1169
01:09:46,211 --> 01:09:49,050
I thought this was the one,
I never heard that and I never heard that,

1170
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:49,611
but the new one,

1171
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:51,700
so I'm just going to keep saying
the same thing over and over again.

1172
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:56,380
So good luck with dad situation, sir. Um,

1173
01:09:56,381 --> 01:10:01,220
it's tricky one. All right. That's
the podcast, everybody. I'm,

1174
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:05,140
I'm going to watch the Moto GP and get
caught up and supports some sports and

1175
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:09,040
try to catch the, uh, tiger woods masters
to at least some fucking highlights,

1176
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:13,330
something of it. Uh, once again, Travis
roid tickets, foundation tickets,

1177
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:15,070
go on sale.
Uh,

1178
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:19,660
