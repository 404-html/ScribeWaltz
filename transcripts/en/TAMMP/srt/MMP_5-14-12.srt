1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Okay.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, what's going on? It's bill birds.
The Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,510
May 14th, 2012, um,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,800
re I am sole role re I got
the house all to myself.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,190
Nia is out of town, comes back tomorrow
and uh, my dogs out getting a tune up.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,630
So I'm sitting in my house all by myself,
all by my lonesome.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,050
I'd like to sit here and tell you that
the reason why I'm sitting here by myself

8
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,320
cause I told the bitches in my
life to get the fuck out. Right?

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,090
Like some pimp shit. And now I'm just
sitting here in some giant leather chair,

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,640
the head of an animal above me in my
study with a bunch of books around me that

11
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:46,050
I never read some creepy
toy from my childhood. Um,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,360
no,
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,840
There's nobody here and I'm slowly
losing my mind. I'm eating like shit.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,140
Um, had waffles like three
days in a row, you know,

15
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,420
cause I don't know how to make them
just for one. I don't have the recipe.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,990
Usually make them for two people. And then
there's a couple of extra. So you know,

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
I just made the fucking batch because
the recipe I have says one egg,

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,400
so you know, if I cut it in half when we
put half a fucking egg in there, okay.

19
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,234
I don't know how to do that.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,470
So I'm making all the waffles
and I'm using all this and uh,

21
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,110
I'm fucking, I'm out of whack.
I'm full of sugar and doe.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,530
I went to the grocery store,
I'm like a single man.

23
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,590
I went to grocery store and they, you
know, rather than buy something to cook,

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,540
I go and I buy like, you know, parts
of a chicken that we're already cooked.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,160
God knows when,
you know,

26
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,710
somebody hit it with a truck and then
they throw it on a fucking grill.

27
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,600
So for the first time in my life,
second time actually I actually had,

28
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,150
for lunch I had chicken and Waffles,

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,790
a staple in the African American community
and I have never understood that dish.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,600
I love waffles. I love
chicken, but not together.

31
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,310
To me that was toothpaste
and orange juice. Both great
ideas. Just not together.

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,630
Right. And I had it and I got to
tell you, I still don't get it.

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,250
I don't get it. It's, it's like a,

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,380
it's like the sun and the moon at the same
time. It's just, it just freaks me out,

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,830
you know, is it breakfast or are or
have we gotten on with their day?

36
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:23,730
Should I be in my fucking
pajamas or should I be telling
you about my dad? Just,

37
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,850
you know, I dunno. I'm
losing my fucking mind.

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,770
I'm losing my mind. And then
tomorrow I leave, I leave to go do,

39
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:36,330
I'm doing an episode of um, Oh,
what the fuck is this show called?

40
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,360
That's embarrassing.
I don't even know what the show's called.

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,970
What's that one with that?

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,950
Did the check from a party of five
is on and she gives the hand jobs,

43
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,490
but she's, she's a good
person. What's it called?

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,460
Uh,
the fucking the,

45
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,810
yeah,

46
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,930
the hand job whisperer.
What the fuck's her name?

47
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:02,770
I'm doing that show during that show this
week I'm on the hand job whisperer and

48
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,110
I play one of the clients and uh,

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,990
she's going to rub one out. So, you know,

50
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:13,991
it was a long talk I had to have with
Nia in order to be duty to do this

51
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,300
episode.
But she understands that it's just art.

52
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,150
Jennifer Love Hewitt's she plays the,
uh,

53
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,840
the hand hand job just with the heart of
gold. You know, it's a wonderful show.

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,170
She gives people hand jobs at the end of,

55
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,650
of Masu sing them and then
gives advice to their upset.

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,573
Um,

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,700
yeah.

58
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,260
What would you call the person they're
dating wives and girlfriends come in like,

59
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,500
how could you jerk off my husband?
And then she goes like,

60
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:49,330
she doesn't love you. He doesn't love you
anymore. That's why he's coming to me.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,330
And then some how they pour their heart
out to her because she's such a good,

62
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:57,860
she's such a good fucking person that
she can jerk off their boyfriends and

63
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,620
husbands and these people on the
show don't have a problem with it.

64
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,860
And from the second I saw that show,
I was just like, you know what,

65
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,810
I have to be a part of it.
And, um, so this week, Oh yeah,

66
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,470
I'm going to be taping an episode
of, uh, the hand job whisper.

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,780
I think Jennifer Love Hewitson and I might
have the wrong fucking show. You know,

68
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:21,010
it's funny on my cable box, not the
cable box, whatever the fuck you call it,

69
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,110
the to the screen when you
go through the guide, um,

70
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,530
right above the versus network,
you know,

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,750
scrolling up trying to find a game and
you go three channels up and then it goes

72
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:35,750
to the porno channel and a,
you know.

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,020
Okay.

74
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,610
It's the weirdest thing ever. You just
see a soccer game, a baseball game,

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,730
a basketball game, and then it'll
be like fist fuck part's fun.

76
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,570
And I don't think that was by accident
because if you watch enough sports,

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,260
they got the basically for guys,
they got two things.

78
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:02,690
They don't want to go bald and
they want to fuck something.

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,060
And uh, I can remember, I guess
it's true on both those both counts.

80
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:11,210
Wouldn't you say there?
Huh? Speaking of lonely,

81
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,310
I was just watching television by myself,

82
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:16,130
speaking to it as if it was
another live human being.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,800
And I saw this commercial for this, this,
this new website called farmers only.

84
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:24,950
Dot Com.
This is not a commercial people.

85
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,200
This is actually an observation. Um,
it was basically showing, uh, you know,

86
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:31,730
some,
a couple of ranchers,

87
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:36,440
a couple of farm girls and they just walk
in the fields by themselves, you know,

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,100
playing with their face finger,
playing with each other. You know,

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,330
you do that when you were a little kid,

90
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,230
you'd do that little thing where you
put your thumb and index finger together

91
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,860
and both hands.
He didn't kind of do the little,

92
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,980
almost like there's an
invisible tiny screw, you know,

93
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,560
there's some poor woman walking through
like these, uh, a bunch of corn, you know,

94
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:58,100
and the cows are all concerned to the
point they're actually English to one one

95
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,070
another. You know, about
each of them going,

96
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,420
how the hell are they
going to meet each other?

97
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,770
And then all of a sudden this Waylon
horror comes over the top and just start

98
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:10,850
singing, yell, never be
lonely. Add Pharma zone,

99
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,140
led.com.

100
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,480
So it's basically their Facebook and
you should go and look at it on Youtube.

101
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,920
That's what you should do. You shouldn't
work, you know, where do you work?

102
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,400
What are you doing?
Is it your dream or somebody else's?

103
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,770
You just a cog in the wheel,
you know,

104
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,480
are they really gonna notice if you
stop working, everybody else is working.

105
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,590
Why don't you just fucking,
you know,

106
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,830
Tour de France just sort of draft behind
a couple people's today. You know,

107
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,830
they could fucking Monday off.
So anyways,

108
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:43,660
check out this video and you know,

109
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:46,480
what's the funniest thing about it is
the comments underneath it as the amount

110
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:50,800
of people who shit on, you know, just
immediately thinking how dumb people are.

111
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,150
It's like these people grow our
fucking food. Do you understand that?

112
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,950
I'm sure they don't know where
the rave is. You know? Well,

113
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:03,220
who the most popular bands are or how
to get from fucking Brooklyn over to

114
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,060
Staten Island, right? They
don't know how to do that shit.

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,040
They don't know how to put on
a fucking shiny shirt, right?

116
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,820
And go jump on the subway and go down
to Wall Street and make sure old people

117
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,660
eat dog food for the rest
of their fucking lives. Yet.

118
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,160
They don't know how to do that, you know,
they know how to do, they had to make,

119
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,740
then I'll make corn, right.
Or planets or it grows.

120
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,790
They don't make it. God makes it, and
he makes that fertile fucking country.

121
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,150
You know, it's gotta be really
hard to catch herpes out there.

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,590
You know what I mean? I mean, in
much spread, really fucking slowly.

123
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,910
Jesus Christ. I mean you, you must
fucking rub them at least two loads out.

124
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,110
By the time we get to our house,

125
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:51,050
just sitting there driving and
driving fucking Tornado, man.

126
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,680
You pull over rob another one
out and by then you'll add it.

127
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,740
You know what the fuck I'm going
over there. Foreign Waste Shit.

128
00:07:56,741 --> 00:08:00,520
I got more teeth in her. That's a deal
breaker. Look, now I'm making fun of him.

129
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,580
I like, or that they're called the flyover
states and no reason to go there. Yeah,

130
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:10,280
no reason to check it on the food supply.
Uh,

131
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,410
like you're gonna. That'd be good shit
in the fucking, freak him out with,

132
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,830
just show up with like a clipboard.
Fuck.

133
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,500
Are you doing sit at boy or they
actually, you know, something,

134
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,520
they make themselves kind of separatist
cause at the end of, is that even a word?

135
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,720
Um, they actually say this
city folks don't understand.

136
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,070
What don't we understand?
Loneliness. Is that what it is?

137
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:36,670
Come to New York and be alone
with everybody. You never
heard that. You fucking,

138
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,680
you know what? Fuck them. God
Damn farmers. Jesus Christ. What?

139
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:44,320
You don't have your cousin's phone
number. Is that what? You're sick of?

140
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:45,190
Fucking your sisters.

141
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,040
So now you gotta get your own Facebook
and see the jokes that just too easy here.

142
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,780
People,
you know,

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,600
sick of fucking a pig.
I want some farm animals.

144
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,810
That'd be great if I just had space.

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,190
Yeah.

146
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,490
How many goats would you need to
fucking drink enough? You know,

147
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:10,960
make your own milk. A couple of
chickens. You got your own eggs, right?

148
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,760
So you've got dead bullshitting.
And I'm Malcolm,

149
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,480
which I know I'm not going to do.
I couldn't do it without laughing.

150
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,250
And then I'd fucking creep out the goat.

151
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,651
Oh Jesus.

152
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,780
I need some people in my life and I
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

153
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:27,740
And you know, last week I made an
ass of myself as always as always.

154
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:31,700
And I was talking about the,
uh, the sewage and the drain

155
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,680
and Oh, by the way, you
know something, I'm,

156
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm sitting here watching the fucking
La kings and the Phoenix coyotes playing

157
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:45,510
each other. All right? It's in Phoenix
and they're having a white out.

158
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,170
Everybody's wearing the same t shirt.
But you don't,

159
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,820
you just realize that
the second you do that,

160
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:54,430
you're just showing the fact that
you have a shitty fucking franchise.

161
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,430
Oh my account this week.
Um,

162
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,090
I hate that this all go whoa.
Where are the same shirt?

163
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,980
It'll be a white out
that'll intimidate them.

164
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,150
They're going to be afraid of the crowd.
I will tell you this, what was amazing,

165
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,860
cause I'm watching this fucking game and
the crowd in Phoenix is Channing bete,

166
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,830
la La beat La,

167
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,680
the iconic chair from the Boston Garden.

168
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,540
It's actually spread all the way
west and jumps sports, you know,

169
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,450
so I had to immediately text Paul Versey
and let them know that because you know,

170
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
he's so fucking a namerd with the food
court known as Madison Square Garden

171
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,650
Talk. I was talking to somebody the other
day, we were trying to think of like,

172
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,970
when we think of Madison Square Garden,
what did we think of,

173
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,433
you know,

174
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,470
boxing?

175
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,270
Okay,

176
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,520
Leonard Scanner.
Do you just stick a rock shows?

177
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,780
Nobody thinks about the Knicks or the
fucking rangers other than Nixon Rangers

178
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,210
fans.
It's just another fucking,

179
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,540
that's another one to add to
that list of overrated nicknames.

180
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,800
The world's most famous arena.
You can throw that right in with Lynn.

181
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:09,840
Sanity Sanchez. Wait, got it.
Bill. You hate New York. All right.

182
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:12,750
I've made my fucking
point. Um, anyways, so,

183
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:17,130
which last week this guy tried to tell
me that I should just piss in the shower

184
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,720
because hey, it all goes down. Save
fucking brain anyway. Fuck. Do you care?

185
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,130
What do I care? I don't want it
urine in my toes. I also fucking,

186
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:29,340
I'm concerned with the fact that
someone else has to use the shower.

187
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,580
How bout that? You know? So, um,

188
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,450
but I was also thinking that they
went down to different drains.

189
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,970
I would think that they would try
and keep that separately separate.

190
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,760
And everybody was like,
everybody writes me, you know,

191
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:45,810
whenever I say something wrong, everybody
do, you know, it's always like, hey shit.

192
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,303
Right.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,580
So everybody told me that it actually
goes down the same drain and that the

194
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:55,150
reason why you can't smell the shit
is because they have vents, you know,

195
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,300
which I still no fucking understand,
you know?

196
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,310
Yeah.

197
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,480
Then why don't ice smell shit outside my
house? Where does the, where does the,

198
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,530
the air that was surrounding the Shit,
where does that go?

199
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,310
You know?

200
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,580
And please by all means talk to me like
I'm the biggest fucking moron ever.

201
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,630
Cause I gotta tell you,

202
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:19,410
I only got like 20 emails about it
and I know how many listeners I have.

203
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:24,100
So there's a lot of people right now
gone. Really? I didn't realize that. Um,

204
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,880
but still, let me read
this bill. He says, Bill,

205
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,910
about your questioning on
a sewage handling from your
May 7th podcast on whether

206
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:36,420
toilet water is handled in the
same system as your shower water.

207
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,330
The answer is it depends.
Oh, wait a minute.

208
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,840
I think this guy knows what he's talking
about because he didn't start it off

209
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,020
with, hey shit. Fuck I'm,

210
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,620
he says sewage water that
has no human waste in it. Uh,

211
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:53,580
this would be considered shower water,
water for dishwater and sinks, et Cetera.

212
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,070
Thank you for explaining where I don't
shit and Piss, um, is called gray water.

213
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,210
What? Uh, what that does contain
human waste is called Blackwater.

214
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,240
All right? Uh, in most
modern urban sewage system,

215
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:15,620
gray water and black water are treated
and moved within the same system.

216
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,560
Rouse say yet another reason to
live on a farm at Pharma Zone,

217
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:25,250
it.com
that's going to be embarrassing.

218
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,380
You and your fucking
neighbor are going to join.

219
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,390
You'll be the only ones on the site.
I thought you wanted to fuck me.

220
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,510
I just was too long of a walk.
You know what I'm saying?

221
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,370
Just bless this tornado season. You never
know what's going to happen. Um, and sue,

222
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,330
it's just anyways,

223
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,610
in sewage systems that aren't as
complex or our more remote gray water is

224
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,110
treated in one system,

225
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,820
blackwater is put into another and
usually come composited oh, wait a minute,

226
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,360
let me, okay, so it's not
as complex. Meaning what?

227
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:59,930
You can't move those all down the same
pipe and somehow separate them again.

228
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,440
You know, sometimes you said stick
with simplicity. I think on this one.

229
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,460
I don't think that motherhood stuff that
goes into my hair and on my body should

230
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:11,250
ever have touched somebody
else's shit personally.

231
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,460
I don't care how much you treat it.
It's fucking gross.

232
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,500
I got to run for office

233
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,260
and if elected by what? Keep the
gray water away from the blackwater.

234
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,850
Okay.

235
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,720
Bring it back to the old system where
you sit in an outhouse and you never wash

236
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:32,330
your hair with shit.
Um,

237
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,790
ask not why there's Piss in my hand,
but why this shit and the dre.

238
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,920
Um,

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,850
the reason why you do not get sewer
smells in your house is through the use of

240
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,950
an s curve in the toilet

241
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,340
sink and shower drain pipe. If you take
the letter s and turn it on its side,

242
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,820
that's what shaped the drain pipe
makes you, you know, I deserve,

243
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,000
I deserve to be talked to like a child.

244
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,070
Is that what it looks like on its side?
Alright,

245
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,350
take the letter o and turn it on
its side. You still with me? Uh,

246
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,180
when you drain water through this shape,

247
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,920
some water is always left behind
inside the ass. Wonderful.

248
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,980
This forms a seal or blocked through
which sewage gases can't get through.

249
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:26,150
Oh, that's brilliant. They
should have those on like
subways, you know what I mean?

250
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,920
Just to have it.
Just have it missing in between people.

251
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,013
Okay.

252
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,590
Early sewage systems didn't employ this
shape and it was indeed the case that

253
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:42,910
sewer gases could enter the
home as far as recycling.

254
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:46,630
Isn't it amazing how simple that was to
fix though? As far as recycled water,

255
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,590
sewage that is taken from your home
and sent to treatment plans is usually

256
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:53,770
released back into nature
after it is cleaned.

257
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,750
Mother Nature does the last of the
cleaning process with microbes, et cetera.

258
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah.

259
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,820
Uh, you know what, that's one of
those things that's like a hot dog.

260
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,210
You know what I mean? You just don't
know. You don't want to know what's in it.

261
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,230
That's fucking gross yet.
Brilliant. I find that,

262
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,760
I find I'm finding all of this shit.

263
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,220
What did I just say that
three times it might,

264
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,710
I find I'm finding all of this shit.
You guys think I'm a fucking moron.

265
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:17,821
You don't what it is.

266
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:21,170
I have the balls to bring up the
shit that I don't understand. Yeah.

267
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:25,950
Bill every week and it spans the entire
spectrum of humanity. Go fuck yourselves.

268
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,443
Um,

269
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,840
I actually began disassembling that
carburetor I took apart the primary fuel

270
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,070
ball, took out the floater and all
that. It doesn't have fucking hard.

271
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,980
I knew it wasn't,
I know it wasn't.

272
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,990
And venting and venting,
the carborated,

273
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,070
the carburetor that that is the genius.
Okay.

274
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,180
Take a one apart. I mean that's
not, that's no big fucking deal.

275
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,340
And I imagine once you take it apart,
oh you can put it back together again.

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,090
Right. And after a while, I imagine
you can figure out out, fuck it works.

277
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:06,950
It doesn't seem that complex to make,

278
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,090
um, I'm fucking idiot. No, I'm
doing the whole thing. I got the,

279
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:16,260
I got the whole chemical right. I bought
myself little. Uh, no I didn't. I'm lying.

280
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,010
I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy this a Turkey
thing that you know to put it in little,

281
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:20,131
uh,

282
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:23,280
you know what your roasted Turkey and you
put that on the side with the solution

283
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,860
to clean off all the parts. And I'm
going to build that mother. Fuck.

284
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:29,790
I should take a before and after picture
with a look and then I'll give you guys

285
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,241
a nice go.

286
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:34,470
Fuck yourself underneath it for all you
people who trashed me cause I didn't

287
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,040
realize that, you know, it's the same
pipe that the shit and piss goes down.

288
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,510
Why would I know that I'm not a plumber?
You know,

289
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,690
why can't you guys show the
kind of empathy for others
that I do on this podcast

290
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:50,690
every week?
Um,

291
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,070
would you guys like to learn about an
element? That's my nighttime reading.

292
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,580
I'm really freaking me out.
She,

293
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,280
she can't tell if I'm going crazy or if
I'm starting. I'm trying to build a bomb.

294
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,890
Hold on one sec.
All right.

295
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,300
We hear it. The bill burr podcast,
the Monday morning podcast.

296
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,030
I'm going to try and make you guys either
smarter or bring it down to my level

297
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:21,380
of stupidity.
So considering I can like,

298
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,000
I know like everybody's name and number
from every football team in the 70s for

299
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:29,450
the most part.
Wilbert Montgomery 31

300
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,920
Fred Biletnikoff. What the fuck number
was he? That was before my time.

301
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Doug Flutie was 22 Roger Starbuck
was 12 Frank Tarkenton was 10

302
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,510
yeah.

303
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,740
Craig Morton was seventh Dan Pastor
Rainey was seven. Burt Jones was seven.

304
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll do all the quarterbacks.
Terry Bradshaw was 12

305
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,970
Brian Sipe the fuck was he was he 17

306
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,980
okay.

307
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,580
All right. All I'm saying is if I can,
if I can fucking memorize that shit,

308
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,290
I can't memorize the periodic chart.

309
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,790
This is yet another thing that [inaudible]
pseudo intelligent thing. You know,

310
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,990
if you can just memorize this shit and
then you go to a cocktail party like we

311
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:17,130
all do, right? It doesn't everybody on
one of those Roger Moore Tuxedos like me.

312
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,730
And every once in a while
you just go out to a, uh,

313
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,460
you ought to a cocktail party
with other social lights.

314
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,810
Um, you know this, this
is a good thing to know.

315
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,540
If you memorize the periodic chart,
just out of nowhere this,

316
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,450
it's like anytime you say something dumb,
you can just go. Hydrogen is the first,

317
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:39,960
uh, is element number one
on the periodic chart.

318
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,610
I'm going to memorize this shit and I'm
going to fucking try and understand it.

319
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,870
It's a, and then I can't even say what
I'm going to do with this knowledge.

320
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,360
What'd you guys do if you gradually,

321
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,680
we're listening to me learning all this
shit and then I accidentally blew myself

322
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:03,590
up my garage.
How compelling would this podcast be?

323
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,580
You'd listen to the first four and
a half years, uh, who's kept no,

324
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,820
the first four and three quarter
years listening to how dumb I was.

325
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:10,510
And then you just,

326
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,270
you're going to hear that crucial podcasts
where I said that I'm going to buy a

327
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:15,970
book on this shit. You know, by the way,

328
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:19,690
has anybody seen the on spike
that fucking thousand ways to die?

329
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,540
Okay.

330
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,400
You guys seen that shorter fucking
creepy ass show that is despite the awful

331
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,290
jokes that they have on top of it,

332
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,190
they just show all these different ways
that people have figured out how to die.

333
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,150
And uh, they just sort of trash
people and say how stupid they are.

334
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,740
And they, um, they fucking just,

335
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,420
these,

336
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,860
they don't try to like tone
down that somebody was dead.

337
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,420
It's weird cause they're
making these really bad jokes.

338
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,550
And by bad I don't mean insensitive. By
bad, I mean not funny over the top of it.

339
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,720
And, but then when they show the person
dead, it's really fucking creepy.

340
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,630
They showed these two girls who
kept filming each other on Youtube,

341
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:06,610
doing practical jokes, wearing silly
mass and scaring each other. So, uh,

342
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:10,210
one of the girls brothers, uh,
was a mechanic or something.

343
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,540
So they got that air bag thing and
they stuck it underneath this cushion.

344
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,070
I sound like an old lady right now.

345
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,980
Tell him to death story and
they didn't know it was there,

346
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,450
so she sticks it there.

347
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:22,570
She tries to get a roommate to sit on
and she's tugging on her roommate pulls

348
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:25,840
away the girl who put it there,
lands on it,

349
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,430
it shoots are up in the air over the
banister and she fucking breaks her neck

350
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:33,430
and dies and they go
through the whole thing,

351
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,400
the graphics of her breaking your neck
and then they just show are there with

352
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:39,850
their head all twisted up.
It's creepy.

353
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,540
A really creepy fucking show.
Um,

354
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,900
and then they have bad jokes over
the top of it. Maybe the bad,

355
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,490
maybe the bad jokes or on purpose.

356
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,780
Why don't I shit on another show and
just burn every fucking bridge I can out

357
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:57,340
here. Um, hey. You know what?
It's time for a God damn. Uh,

358
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,570
it's time for some advertising. Here we
go. Let's do it. We do it every week.

359

But if you don't and you
were thinking like, you know,

364
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:23,620
I wish there was a way it can handle all
this business within my own apartment,

365
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,310
within my own house,
within my own cardboard box,

366
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:29,050
as a homeless person that I live in.

367
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,650
But for some reason to have some
sort of Internet connection, I'm,

379
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,590
All right. Where the hell am I?
Back to the damn. You know what?

380
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:25,670
I finally figured out
how to use this computer.

381
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,590
I didn't realize when
I bought this computer,

382
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:29,390
I then had to download everything else.

383
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,550
I thought with the amount
of money that I spent on it,

384
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:34,010
they would've given me some sort of
program that I could have written it,

385
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,240
but I can't. I gotta go download that.
You know, there's another 20 bucks.

386
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:40,220
Let's siphon that out
of his fucking wallet.

387
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,263
You know,

388
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,050
I, I'm going to say I even
say it, I'm just going

389
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,030
to see, you know, come see my act. I have
a nice day. Have a nice all new chunk.

390
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,070
Come see my act. Don't see me. Just come
by and go see my act. A car repair bill.

391
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,080
You're right.
Fixing your car is a good feeling.

392
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,740
I had trouble with the passenger
side window for months.

393
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,850
If finally went out on me a couple of
Fridays ago and it was stuck all the way

394
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:09,320
down in the door with the forecast
showing three days of rain. Anyway,

395
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:13,580
I ordered the part, took my door
apart. Tools everywhere, dirty hands,

396
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:16,550
had some music going,
feeling like a man baby.

397
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,630
I had just found out a couple hours
before my wife and I are having a boy.

398
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:24,530
Congratulations though.
That's awesome. Uh, he goes,

399
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,000
I didn't really know what I was doing,

400
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:30,740
but I did a youtube search
replacing Nissan power window motor.

401
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,580
Boom. It was there and it, and
it took me through it. Yeah.

402
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,330
That's all I've been doing.
That's how I fixed my blender.

403
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,440
Youtube is the shit.
The fucking Internet is to shit.

404
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:47,030
People spend so much time writing
racial stuff and jerking off to porn.

405
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,150
You could just, you could go on youtube
and you could teach yourself anything.

406
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:52,400
You can learn how to play guitar.
You can learn to play drums,

407
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:56,640
you can learn how to fix a fucking
carburetor. Anything you want to do. Um,

408
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,980
all I can tell you is stay
away from expert village. I'm,

409
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,170
their videos are short.
They're not informative,

410
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,200
they suck and they are like this fucking
plague because once you get into their

411
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:14,570
expert village, ah, fucking
vortex, you can't get out of it.

412
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:17,330
You've got to like literally shut your
whole fucking computer down and start

413
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:21,050
over again. Um, okay.

414
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,400
I don't know. I'm 100% for that. I fucked
up the Mirror on the side of my car and

415
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,280
mmm.
MMM.

416
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,630
I just have to have enough time in my
schedule to just pop that thing off.

417
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,450
I've watched a guy do it. It's
simple. There's two screws,

418
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,430
then you pop the thing off.
Then there's two more.

419
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,620
The unplugged the fucking thing.
Pull it out.

420
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,830
You stick the next one plugged
the thing that Jesus was,

421
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:54,600
I can't even fucking explain it.
Whatever. I don't fucking, oh,

422
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:58,090
hang on a second.
Sorry.

423
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:02,990
I had to adjust my fucking white there.
Um, yeah, I've actually a citizen,

424
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,430
he has been out of town. She doesn't
even know I've gone out and I've,

425
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:10,320
I've fucking blown like, I think
300 bucks on tools, you know,

426
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,710
all over the map. Some shit for cars, some
shit for fixing stuff around the house.

427
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,110
And um, you know, it's funny,

428
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:20,680
she just looks at me and smiles at me
like she thinks it's cute and it's really

429
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,030
fucking annoying me.

430
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,910
It's just motivating me to
want to fix something. Like,

431
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:31,660
you know, I fixed the fucking blender and
I didn't get any credit. She just like,

432
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:36,340
yeah, you know? Yeah, it's cool.
Well, I, I said what I said, I said,

433
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,900
I said I was happy for you. I was, you
know, like, no, it doesn't remember.

434
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,271
It's like you,

435
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:44,130
you wanted to throw the fucking thing
out there was to cost me a couple hundred

436
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,470
bucks to fix it for seven bucks.
Right. Anything, you know,

437
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,540
you know what it's like to go on stage
and have a great set and then you come

438
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:54,810
home and your bomb in your own house.
That's my life people.

439
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:00,270
That is my fucking life. Um, somebody
sent me a douchey thing on Twitter,

440
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:04,890
giving me shit about something
that I said, you know, and I,

441
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,760
I really got to learn to stop taking the
bait. I didn't write the person back.

442
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,520
I don't even know if I can even
fucking talk about this. They would,

443
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:15,570
they were calling me out on something,
which technically they were right.

444
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,910
Hey, you said this year, act and now
you're a promoting that. You know,

445
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,120
it's a typical fucking
thing where it's like,

446
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:26,910
this person isn't offended
by anything I fucking say,

447
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,200
but then all of a sudden it comes
around them. They're fucking world.

448
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:35,070
And now they're offended and sitting
there giving me shit saying I'm a piece of

449
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:39,450
shit when I know God damn well you're on
fucking youtube watching all my fucking

450
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:43,350
videos for free watching all these
other comedians videos for free,

451
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:47,970
putting other people out of work.
So go fuck yourself. All right.

452
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,030
See that that was all in code.
That's for the person who wrote me.

453
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:55,020
Go Fuck Yourself. You fucking
cunt. Why don't you pay for music?

454
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,140
Why don't you pay for something?
All right? You'd like uni.

455
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:01,800
You're not putting people out of work.
Go fuck yourself podcasts for free.

456
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,870
It's still for free.
Okay,

457
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,770
so why don't you go skip down the street
and fucking tweet to somebody who gives

458
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:12,300
a fuck. There we go. Whew. Got
that out of my fucking system.

459
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,560
Do you know, understand? You know
what's the worst thing about me?

460
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,620
Aside from my general
contempt for humanity,

461
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,250
is I have a complete fucking inability

462
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,170
to not insult and curse people
when I feel that I've been wronged.

463
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,490
You know? So then I've, I've said
this in my act, even when I'm right,

464
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:35,870
I become wrong.
You know,

465
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,630
buddy of mine piss me off and
fucking talk to him for three weeks.

466
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,800
Finally calls me up. He's like, hey bro,
have talked to you. Was everything cool?

467
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,720
He knows everything's not cool. He knows
he was a cunt all right now. And I said,

468
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:52,120
no, everything's cool though. I've just
been busy, but by blah blah, blah, blah.

469
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:52,540
Right.

470
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,370
Because I don't have the
fucking ability at this point.

471
00:28:57,371 --> 00:29:01,720
I don't have the ability to, to,
to be like, you know, listen,

472
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,730
I just want to say that the other day
I felt that there was a few things that

473
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:11,080
were said they had, I, I,
I didn't appreciate and um,

474
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,620
I'm not sure if you meant him in that
way, but I just, I just can't do that.

475
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,300
Jim called me a couple of weeks.
Yes.

476
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,990
Cause you're a cunt because of the fucking
shit you said the other day and you

477
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:27,220
know what you were doing it don't
even fucking go fuck yourself.

478
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,320
That's how it goes down,
you know? Ah, yeah. Oh.

479
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,061
Gives a shit.
You know?

480
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:39,061
You know where I really fucking
can't stand is that fucking guy.

481
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,040
He does those Ford commercials,
that creepy fucking guy
with that. You know what?

482
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,100
You know what makes him so creepy? Fucking
pleasant. He's got this pleasant tone.

483
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,220
I think he used to do the dirty jobs
thing. I don't know if he still does it.

484
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,070
He wears that fucking
hat with no logo on it.

485
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,310
So you can't describe what he
really looked like. You know,

486
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:59,710
after he gets done feeling
up your fucking daughter,

487
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,810
he's always hanging out with
people younger than him. You know,

488
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,860
he's a guy walking down the street and
uh, yeah they make, my girlfriend says it,

489
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:11,400
look, it makes my butt look better. And
then this fucking girl is like, Hey,

490
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:15,750
nice ass. And he's like, that's not
my girlfriend. That fucking guy.

491
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,870
I don't trust people like that.
That guy with his pleasant,

492
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,860
that whole pleasant,
just even Keel,

493
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:28,080
just sitting there with
his hands in his pockets.

494
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:32,760
Just fucking 100% flat line
nonthreatening. That guy,

495
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:37,740
I swear to God will pour nuclear waste
into the water supply for a corner office.

496
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,300
I'm not saying him literally,
but that just people like whatever,

497
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,050
whatever that fucking images. I don't
trust pleasant people. Is that my,

498
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,830
is that my issue? I
ain't know, I just don't,

499
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:54,570
I don't trust people like
all this Tibetan monks,

500
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,350
you know was the last time you saw in
them losing their shit cause they got a

501
00:30:58,351 --> 00:31:01,860
parking ticket standing there and they're
orange robe yelling at some overweight

502
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:06,480
woman before she gets back on her
fucking goddamn moped. You know,

503
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,360
I don't trust them. You don't what it
is. I like people to pray in public.

504
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:14,900
I don't like, they sit around a lot or
you know, or are doing that shit right.

505
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,100
It's funny. I bet they fucking steel
flat screens, all those Tibetan monks.

506
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,500
It's why the way those long,
it's where they were drapes.

507
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,490
Just stealing all this swag out of
your fucking house is one of them.

508
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:34,690
Sits there just calmly smiling at you.
You don't swell. They all dress the same.

509
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,430
Just like the drug dealers on the wire,

510
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,970
those Tibetan monks at the same
fucking thing. You can't describe them.

511
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,030
They all just start running.
It's like a school of fish.

512
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,620
You can't figure out what the
fuck's going on. You know,

513
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,250
cause I fuck that ended up
trash and monks, oh whatever.

514
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:54,990
If this is all just self hatred.
I got it. W when is this anchor?

515
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:57,090
We're going to go away. I'm a, I'm
already past the halfway point.

516
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,420
I've already played at least
10 holes in my life. I had to,

517
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:02,610
if I'm going to be 44 years old,
times two is 88

518
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,110
88 Eric Lindros. Hey, wait a minute.
Let's see what element that is.

519
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,500
Let's see.
What all 88 is you guys interested?

520
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,970
Is there an (888) 018-0980 eight radium,

521
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,770
radium. Evidently it's a, it's
what makes your watches glow.

522
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,830
Radium was the titanium of the early
19 hundreds it was the brilliant,

523
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:28,311
shiny,

524
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:33,311
powerful element everyone
wanted to associate their
products with and sell it to

525
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:37,760
whites only. They never
have that part in, you know,

526
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,880
they always keep that
racist part like separate.

527
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,070
Do you have any of you guys ever noticed
that shit and like whenever they talk

528
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:47,630
about the good old days about
baseball, you know, boy, Oh boy,

529
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:51,760
go see Mickey Mann all yet that Bennett
in an order that take me out to the ball

530
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,110
game. Well, whenever they show
the Jackie Robinson storage,

531
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,590
just the Jackie Robinson story and
it's just about race, they never do.

532
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:01,880
They never tell both those stories
at the same time. Boy, Oh boy,

533
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:06,881
when I saw Duke Snider by meets up peanuts
and cracker jacks and they keep all

534
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:08,990
of that ugliness out away from the game,

535
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,120
then they tell the racist part separately.
You know,

536
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,970
when these fucking people with the
Goddamn periodical book it, there's,

537
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:18,210
there's no difference.
Um,

538
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,170
radium was the titanium of
the early 19 hundreds. Uh,

539
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,600
the Klan used to shoe
their horses with it.

540
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,070
I'm just going to fill in the shift
of these. They leave out of it. Uh,

541
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,430
just as many titanium products
today contained no actual titanium.

542
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,680
Um, many radium products of a
century goes such as radium,

543
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:42,280
furniture, Polish and radium.
Toothpaste contained no radium.

544
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,890
Interesting. I wonder if the knobs
of, of Jp Morgan, that piece of shits,

545
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:52,670
fucking walking sticks had
any radium and them, you know,

546
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,650
as he pushed Woodrow Wilson into office.
Why isn't that in here? You know,

547
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,440
fuck this book. I am going to
memorize it though. All right.

548
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,820
You know what,
like I said,

549
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:04,670
I'm doing the hand job whisper this week
and the next week I'm going to be at

550
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:09,200
fly out in Burbank,
California, the 25th and 26th.

551
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,220
Okay.

552
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,020
And if for some reason you ever wanted
to see Ralph malf put together an hour of

553
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:19,220
comedy, but he never did stand
up. I am a wonderful substitute.

554
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,300
I will be out there.

555
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:24,890
I'm going to be at the mall
people on May 25th and 26th,

556
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,110
uh,
doing my jokes or some semblance of them.

557
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,900
I'm actually having a really good time
putting together this hour because, uh,

558
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,950
I don't know. I don't know where
it's going to come from because

559
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,980
usually I just talk about my life.
And as you can tell,

560
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:45,690
talking about fixing carburetors
is not exactly a mainstream topic.

561
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:46,920
You know,

562
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,340
can't put together an extra five minutes

Advertising requests. Hey Bill,

619
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,520
you've been asking your listeners, Whoa,
what the fuck just happened? Facetime.

620
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,500
All of a sudden I'm looking
myself doing this podcast.

621
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,150
It's computer freaks me out.
Advertising quest. Bill,

622
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,280
you've been asking your listeners for
advertisement and discounts. Suggestion.

623
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,920
How about a Snapple?
Kiwi?

624
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:45,820
Strawberry Snapple is my
all time favorite drink.

625
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,550
It's this serious.

626
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,910
You want me to advertise Snapple
cause you like Kiwi. Strawberry.

627
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,560
How much are they? You need a break
on that. It's my all time favorite.

628
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:00,900
If I could find a way to get your
listeners a discount on that,

629
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,600
you would be even more awesome than

kiwi strawberry Snapple.

00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,863
MMM.

632
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,800
You know what, Dude, I'm
going to go out on a limb.

633
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:17,720
I don't think that's ever going to happen.
You know I don't drink Snapple.

634
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,790
I don't even know what it is.
What is it?

635
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,730
Is it supposed to be like juice?

636
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,130
Yeah,

637
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,840

a real, you go to a real juice. How snow?

638
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah. One of those places where
fucking hippies hanging around.

639
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,310
You want real juice?
She got to go to hippies or go to farmers,

640
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,893
you know,

641
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,240
other than that, I mean, isn't
it like made out of like corn

642
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,090
and black matter and gray matter Assam?
Shit.

643
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,560
It's all like fucking sugar,
isn't it? Snapple? I have no idea

644
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,060
dude. I'm not advertising
Kiwi. Strawberry Snapple.

645
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,970
Yeah. That's something
that I would, I wouldn't,

646
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,180
I wouldn't even have drank that and the
seventh grade to some about Kiwi just

647
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:07,840
doesn't sound good. Strawberry,
Snapple, maybe blueberry.

648
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:12,140
I'd be a Debbie Downer with that.
Kiwi strawberry. I don't know.

649
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,750
Isn't that like the, the uh,
what is that big cartoon movie?

650
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,330
Everybody's going to see that it
has like every superhero in it.

651
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,350
Is that any good by the way? Because
I'm going on the road again. I might,

652
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,460
I might want to go see a couple
of movies cause anybody, uh,

653
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,100

654
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,613
Uh,

655

658
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,320

659
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:51,490
I should have been a teacher.

Yeah, out the door. Three. Right.

665
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,240
Only only to do is just have a bunch of
pens in your front pocket and everybody

666
00:41:18,241 --> 00:41:20,700
thinks you're working.
Once you teach it,

667
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:24,720
the first year you got it down and
he'd just keep coming in there. Right.

668
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,600
Nine to three, no extra help, but

671
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,190
start banging the fucking hot
math teacher or some shit.

672
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,540
I just want to share it that she
had some fucking little shit car,

673
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,130
little one bedroom apartment, just
fucking grown food out on the balcony.

674
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,470
Be that guy,

675
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:53,690

don't know for like three weeks.

676
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,403
Okay.

677
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,930
Did you hear about them by
the time they found him?

678
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:05,000
His parakeet eight half his face.

679
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,063
MMM.

680
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,870
That'd be a sad existence when it,

681
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,720
okay.

682
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,490
Well wouldn't it? I don't know
what to tell you. You know what I,

683
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,130
every time I do this podcast,

684
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:20,310
I sit over here and I look at
my guitar and my Wah Wah pedal.

685
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:23,880
I'm trying to get the balls to
fucking play something for you guys.

686
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:26,880
But the thing is is I need to
get warmed up just to suck.

687
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,930
Forget about just being straight up awful.
Um,

688
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,350
but I'm telling you I'm growing
by leaps and bounds in that thing.

689
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:38,550
There's somebody having a Wah Wah pedal
that's like a makes you actually sound

690
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:40,290
like, you know what the
fuck you doing. You know,

691
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,340
I was going to watch one of those uh,

692
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,690
Hall of fame rock and Roll Hall of fame
thing cause they had like guns and roses

693
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,450
and a couple of the bands that I liked
in it and it was like fucking three hours

694
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:51,510
long. And at that point it's just
like, dude, go fuck yourself.

695
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,983
You know,

696
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,700
I don't want to watch it for fucking
nine hours actually put it on.

697
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,930
And I think it was that Guy
Donovan who sang that song. Yeah.

698
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:07,710
Blow the way Dan below the ocean there.

699
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:11,250
Well to be z Libby when fucking uh,

700
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,390
Joe Peci fucking killed Billy
batts that song that they play.

701
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,350
So they liked the inducted this guide
Donovan and he was talking about this

702
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:24,100
poetic bullshit, but I couldn't
understand what the fuck you, we,

703
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:24,934
I just turned it on.

704
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,340
I hope he doesn't have something wrong
with them mentally cause then I'll look

705
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:31,450
like a Douche.
I thought it was Brian May um,

706
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,590
have any of my thoughts over the last
20 minutes even been like even remotely

707
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:42,260
connected. Um, all right,
advice. You know what it is,

708
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:44,580
is I also have the stress
if I have to learn my lines,

709
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,890
so the hand job whisperer and uh,
I got to get on that shit too. Um,

710
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,340
all right, advice. Conscious
three of her best friend.

711
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,990
Hey Bill, big fan of yours from Canada
and listened to the podcast every week.

712
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:03,110
That's awesome. All right. I bought with
my girlfriend for over four years now.

713
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,480
Dumper, uh, we own a house together,

714
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:09,140
Jesus and have the usual
relationship ups and downs.

715
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:12,920
I'd like your advice and how
she talks about me to this lady.

716
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:14,330
She calls her best friend.

717
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,100
The friend talks relentless shit about
how terrible I am and how would she be so

718
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:21,290
much happier with one of her guy friends.

719
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,100
What
I just got lost.

720
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,760
The friend talks relentless shit.

721
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:35,250
What your girlfriend about how terrible
you are and how she'd be much happier

722
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,710
with one of her guy friends.
Oh,

723
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,780
she's trying to fix her up
with one of her friends.

724
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:44,400
Even going so far as to invite them both
to the same party, knowing full well,

725
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,940
I won't be there. I've approached
my lady about it and she says,

726
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:53,410
I'm being paranoid. I've seen messages
exchanged between the two ladies,

727
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,120
so I know I'm not crazy.

728
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,590
My question is how do I tell her that
are best that our friend is a miserable,

729
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:02,910
lonely cunt and to get her to
stay out of our relationship,

730
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,360
love the podcast, keep up the great
work and go fuck yourself. Um,

731
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,030
dude, I dunno about that whole
thing. Like why do you want it?

732
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:20,400
Why do you want to at this point
get this girl out of your,

733
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,590
like the, the, the,

734
00:45:21,591 --> 00:45:26,330
the other girl trying to like hook
your girl up with guys you know,

735
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:29,780
to meet instead of use is your
secondary problem at this point.

736
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Your first problem is that you
saw evidence of that and the,

737
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,870
the woman you're with lied and said it
isn't happening and tried to say that

738
00:45:38,871 --> 00:45:41,970
you're being paranoid.
MMM.

739
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,350
I Dunno. I, I don't, I don't,
I don't know what to tell Ya.

740
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,210
If I was in that
situation and I saw those,

741
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,460
I, I would've, I don't know. I would've
taken the phone and be like, well yeah,

742
00:45:57,461 --> 00:46:01,450
what the fuck is this? Once again, of
course cursing, stop yelling at me. Stop

743
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,460
acting like you're not, you're
being a fucking cunt. All right.

744
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:09,640
Do you not want to be in this? Let's
sell this fucking house. We'll end it.

745
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:16,490
I don't understand why every time we
try and talk about south fuck you.

746
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:22,280
That's how I'd handle it. Right? Why is
she doing that Shit behind your back?

747
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,630
Do you? This is what she's doing, dude.

748
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:26,690
I think she might be out there
trying to fucking, you know,

749
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,640
treat it like monkey bars.

750
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:32,310
What she's going to swing right out
of your relationship into another one.

751
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:33,540
Why else would she be doing that?

752
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,610
You've seen the messages
exchanged between the two ladies,

753
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:42,390
so you know you're not quite, did you
say that to her? I'm not being paranoid.

754
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,320
I read your phone, right? And
then you come off like you're a,

755
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,760
that's a weird thing when you start doing
some Jed Ger Hoover Shit on the person

756
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:54,540
you're with and you feel like a piece
of Shit snooper then when you actually

757
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:58,710
find the evidence, there's no way
to bring up the evidence without,

758
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:00,930
without them being like,
why is snooping,

759
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,440
okay.

760
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,960
You know, women can be
like, I just had a feeling.

761
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,040
Yeah,

762
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,210
maybe guys can say that too.

763
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,990
I had a feeling I had a feeling
that something weird was going on.

764
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,700
You were acting weird and my gut told
me to check your phone. And I did.

765
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,030
And I found exactly what I was failing.
All right.

766
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,020
Why are you mad at me for snooping?
I was right. You know what?

767
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:30,460
I'd have to get a fucking search warrant.
This isn't a show. Go Fuck Yourself.

768
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,640
I was right. See, that's what I do.
And then it's, it's just, you know,

769
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,790
becomes about me cursing. Um, all right,

770
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:39,820
well let's say for whatever reason
you want to stay with this girl.

771
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,910
So your question is, how do I tell
her that a friend is a miserable,

772
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,120
lonely cunt and to get her to
stay out of the relationship?

773
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,183
MMM,

774
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,130
that's a tough one because
it's her friend. You know what?

775
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:56,970
You have to do

776
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,560
everything l all the way that
I talk don't talk that way.

777
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,850
But you got to do is you have to go
out and you have to buy a sweater.

778
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,650
Just ride with me on this one.
All right.

779
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,200
You got to buy a sweater and maybe like
some penny loafers and some dockers.

780
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,670
You put the whole thing together,
part your hair on this side,

781
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,970
like Mr. Rogers and then you just sit
down at the kitchen table with your hands

782
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:25,630
folded in front of you.

783
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Like somebody trying to be the teacher's
pet and you just wait for her to come

784
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:30,334
home.

785
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,800
Okay.

786
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,420
It's going to totally catch her off guard,

787
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,200
but you're going to be dressed so
I'm pleasantly like that. Duchenne,

788
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,020
all those commercials that she's
not going to feel threatened.

789
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:47,530
She's just going to be a little creeped
out and just be like, how do you, what?

790
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:52,060
What? Why you sitting here by yourself
dress like Mr. Rogers. Just be like, ah,

791
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:56,070
I just did something we need to talk
about. And you just sit her down, ed.

792
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,230
You just tell her that,
you know.

793
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,490
See, I don't know how to do it
without getting mad and cursing.

794
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,513
MMM.

795
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,740
I just don't understand why you're
hanging out with this person.

796
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,310
She keeps trying to get it in
the middle of our relationship.

797
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,090
I don't have any friends who are doing
that and I feel like you're choosing your

798
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:18,924
friendship.

799
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,440
I feel like your friendship with her was
more important than your relationship

800
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:23,274
with me.

801
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,150
Okay.

802
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,940
All right, and if that's the case, then
we need to sell the house at night.

803
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:28,720
I'll say that next. I don't know
what the fuck to tell you, dude.

804
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,300
I don't want to tell you dude,
because I wouldn't do this.

805
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:38,000
I mean you, you said, how do I tell her?
Tell her that a friend is a miserable,

806
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,340
lonely cutting to get stay out of the
relationship. That's what I would say.

807
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,223
You know?

808
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,100
Listen, your friend is a
miserable, lonely, can't all right.

809
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,560
I'm sick of her button
into our relationship.

810
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,580
Then every night she'd go out and be
like, oh, you're hanging out with them.

811
00:49:55,581 --> 00:49:57,340
Miserable lonely content.
I want to say,

812
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,580
can you hang out with that and miserable
chick? Tell her I said, what's up?

813
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:05,420
How many bad things is she going to
say about me tonight? I don't know,

814
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:08,810
Dude. I Dunno. That's fucked.
That whole thing is fucked up.

815
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,070
I don't know if you can't do that.
You know what I would do if I was you,

816
00:50:13,071 --> 00:50:15,890
I'd start finding some good
looking women to hang out with.

817
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,343
You know,

818
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,020
just in case she's getting
ready to jump ship,

819
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:25,380
you'll have something nice to
land on too, right? I Dunno.

820
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,490
Do Women even listened to this podcast
anymore? I can't remember the last time.

821
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:33,350
One road in. I'm just such an off putting
Douche. I'm overrated. A overrated,

822
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:35,580
underrated for this week. A overrated, uh,

823
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:39,590
getting into a four car pile up in
Boston while listening to the podcast.

824
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,390
Uh, see at Hampton beach. Get outta
here. You got into a four car pile up.

825
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,970
He said, go fuck yourself. You
don't, you didn't even save.

826
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:53,250
It was over eight overrated.
It is overrated.

827
00:50:55,870 --> 00:51:00,790
Well, I said the listen to it in your
cubicle. I'm sorry dude. What happened?

828
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,830
What happened to your car?
Four car pile up.

829
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,110
You're going to blame my podcast for that

830
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,810
shit. Anyways, that's a podcast

8,000 video games delivered right to your
house or to your apartment or write to

848
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:17,260

don't think you can. All right. So,

849

851
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,280

852
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,840
and I'm hitting a lot of cities
that I, I, I don't think either.

853
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,430
I haven't been to in a while
or I've never been to, uh,

854
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,350
in the history of me running
my yap in history. This is the,

855
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,240
I got San Jose coming

00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,520
Then June 29th,

gonna lie to you. It's not the Gig.

862
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,520
I hate that fucking drive it.
Drive is the worst.

863
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,350
I don't give a shit what
time you drive out there.

864
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:18,940
It's nine hours of fucking
traffic. No traffic. You know,

865
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,810
I could get out there in 45
minutes with traffic. You know,

866
00:53:22,811 --> 00:53:24,670
it's going to be like three hours at a,

884
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:44,730
I'm not going to all the football
teams. I haven't seen, um,

885
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:49,350
this year while whilst building my new

got a couple of a down home once,

887
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,780
Orlando, Jacksonville and uh, Charlotte,

888
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:02,780
North Carolina nine Oh people Orlando
with you think you hit because Shaq lives

889
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:07,740
there as does tiger woods,
you know, I dunno. I,

890
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,870
you know what,
I don't know what I think about.

891
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,080
I don't know anything about Orlando,
Florida. What do you guys do there?

892
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,143
You got that,

893
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,770
the fucking old ass a Disney world.

894
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:19,604
Is that what it is?

895
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,120
The Epcot Center there was actually
built when Rubik's cube was still

896
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:28,580
fascinating. Is that still
good down there? Disneyworld?

897
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,270
I haven't been there since. I was
like, well last time I was there, um,

898
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,860
last time I was there,

899
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,570
the fucking Epcot center look like the
death star in one of those when they were

900
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,420
just building it and one of those star
wars movies that those nerds like to

901
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:45,310
watch.
You know,

902
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,460
I really can tell you guys how
much I fucking hate star wars.

903
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:55,220
Hate Star was so much that I only like
empire strikes back because he almost

904
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:59,900
kills Han Solo and he chops
his hand off. Right. Um,

905
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,860
no, wait, that was Luke Skywalker, right?

906
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,030
All the nerds just freaked out. How
could you confuse them? Um, yeah,

907
00:56:11,031 --> 00:56:15,860
it just wasn't into it. And I also
thought Chewbacca was fucking useless.

908
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,710
Meet Shabaka was basically big foot.
They just gave it a different name.

909
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,360
Typical Hollywood movie, you know,
steal an idea, give it a different name,

910
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:28,510
and then stand there being like,
what, what? I don't owe you any money.

911
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,860
You know that Chewbacca like fought the
$6 billion man like six years earlier on

912
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:39,940
television. Booty. People
saw him with his bionic eye.

913
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,603
Right.

914
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,080
And they find each other and then a few
years later he's at ease and space. No,

915
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:51,920
wait, that would, the big foot
was Andre the giant. Yeah.

916
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:55,910
And all they did was fill in his
face and then he had Chewbacca.

917
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,120
I just didn't fucking get,
I don't understand Chewbacca,

918
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,870
the fucking,
uh,

919
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,820
it's like an orangutan or something
rang a Tan, I would say. Rang a Tang,

920
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:14,360
like the drink rang a Tan. That's what it
was. Right. Why are you shooting a gun?

921
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,560
Did Hand Solo go run up to Darth Vader
and try to bite his neck like a fucking

922
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:27,790
tiger? I didn't get it. I didn't
like, I didn't like Chewbacca.

923
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,580
I didn't like how he sat up.
Right. You know what I mean?

924
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,330
I didn't like that whole,
I didn't,

925
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,480
I just didn't like it and
I hated the fucking robots,

926
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,473
you know?

927
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,730
I thought c three Po was just a rip
off of that dude from lost in space.

928
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:48,590
The Gay guy running around.
Um,

929
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,150
how the fuck did that guy ever
end up on a space trip? I mean,

930
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,050
he just didn't have the, he just didn't
have the, she didn't have the, the, uh,

931
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,463
I dunno,

932
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:02,620
what's the word I'm looking for?

933
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:04,750
He just didn't have the
chemical makeup to do with like,

934
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:07,690
the guy was like absolutely
scared of his own fucking shadow.

935
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,500
Why in God's name would he get on a space
ship and travel through space when he

936
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:16,460
has stayed home, you know? Well, Shit,
Bill, you don't understand how planes fly.

937
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:20,640
Get you get you get on every
fucking week, don't you? Um,

938
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,460
the hell was I talking about?
Let's try to work our way back here.

939
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:31,200
$6 million man fucking bigfoot Sasquatch.
Oh,

940
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:34,110
Epcot sell the fucking Disneyland.
I mean,

941
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,900
it's got to look like the God damn
projects at this point, doesn't it?

942
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:42,590
Did they keep it up? Did
they work on it? Um, I mean,

943
00:58:42,591 --> 00:58:44,270
what can they really
offer you at this point?

944
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,930
Did they make the rides bigger for all
the fatties people weren't nearly as fat

945
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:49,490
the last time I went there
when I went down there,

946
00:58:49,491 --> 00:58:53,540
the big thing to do is when you went to
Florida was you got one of those Mesh

947
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:57,110
shirts that had the number
on it and it said Florida 78,

948
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:02,660
79 or [inaudible] 80. That
was like a big deal. And um,

949
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,200
he pulled you tube socks up to your knees.

950
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:10,870
You had little Larry Bird shorts on and
you will probably wearing Adidas dragons

951
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:14,620
or a either Nike Cortez or the, the, the,

952
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:18,490
the nylon ones.
The blue ones with the yellow stripe

953
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:24,980
or swoosh. I think that was about it. And
then the broke kids weren't Tom mccants,

954
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,200
you know, and socks said the of the
elastic thing was fucked up, up top.

955
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,900
And that was it. That's the last
time I went. Oh No, wait. I,

956
00:59:34,901 --> 00:59:39,150
I went there about a year ago, two
years ago. I don't fucking know.

957
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,770
Florida's a weird state,
you know, they got all that,

958
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,960
all that money down there in Miami.
And other than that,

959
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:49,680
you got a bunch of people live in with
mosquitoes trying to act like they got

960
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:52,740
money. You know, even the
mansions down there in Florida,

961
00:59:52,741 --> 00:59:54,810
they all look like the fucking
cheesecake factory, don't they?

962
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,700
He likes some like Americanized
version of like a Mexican restaurant.

963
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,030
And they have like those manmade,
like fake lagoons.

964
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,760
They put people out there
and like every other day,

965
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:08,970
like somebody gets murdered
or a hurricane hits the house.

966
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:12,620
It's just a horrible fucking state. And
I'm going to be performing there on, uh,

967
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:17,580
September.
Oh Shit.

968
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:20,400
You know what I got into,
I got into the fucking NBA playoffs.

969
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,700
I finally got into it and um,
I'm loving it.

970
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,080
I'll back into basketball. I got no
choice to Bruins were knocked out,

971
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,970
but I got to tell you, I fucking hate
to, I hate the officiating. Okay.

972
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,610
The officiating is the fucking worst.
She can't even like bump into anybody.

973
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:40,500
You can't go near anybody if there's
any sort of touching of human beings,

974
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:44,870
those fucking jerk offs blow
the whistle and they just stick,

975
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:48,900
kill the drama. Just let them play the
fucking game. You know, it's the worst.

976
01:00:48,901 --> 01:00:53,901
Yesterday was I was watching the
Lakers playing Denver and uh,

977
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,320
Pau Gasol, the worst thing that
ever happened was Paul was,

978
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,590
Saul got called out for being soft. They
called them the tin man after the will,

979
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,330
they lost to the Celtics in the finals.

980
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:08,080
So now he's like trying
to be this hard ass guy.

981
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:13,090
So anytime, like he'll, like he's trying
to tip the ball, he tips it up again,

982
01:01:13,091 --> 01:01:16,720
tips it up again. Then it finally goes
in. Then he tries to do the Kevin Garnett,

983
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,740
you know, primal scream.
He's like, ah, right.

984
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,010
And he tries to act like
he's just fucking bad ass,

985
01:01:24,011 --> 01:01:28,870
but anytime he gets called for a foul,
you see the real him.

986
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,220
He'll tip it in, it'll dunk,
go do all this stuff and
standing there going around,

987
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:39,110
punching this chest, and then like
the second they call a file on me,

988
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,953
he's just like,

989
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:47,580
just say what his fucking mouth hanging
open and just shaking his head head.

990
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,290
You know, he just seems like you'd have
a really like soft handshake, you know?

991
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,630
It's probably good at playing the
piano. I'm just not buying it. Um,

992
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:00,090
what do you guys stick to next round?
We'll at me talking basketball.

993
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,720
I don't know shit about it.
I still only know four Celtics.

994
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:08,740
I know the big four. That's it. I
don't know anybody else I ever watched.

995
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:13,060
I haven't watched one fucking game this
year. Um, I went to one basketball game,

996
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:17,570
went to the Lakers, Oklahoma
game. When Metta world peace, um,

997
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:22,050
throw an elbow and I love how
everybody judged him about deck.

998
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:26,390
Oh well he's name is metta world peace,
but he fucking elbow Sabine the head.

999
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:31,290
Dad's dot. Two peaceful as it,
right. Well, what about God?

1000
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,590
You know he's supposed to
be, you know, the, the,

1001
01:02:34,591 --> 01:02:38,580
the king of peace and all I hear is how
he's mad at me and his son's going to

1002
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:42,210
come down here and murder a bunch of
people throwing lightening bolts on the

1003
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:46,470
back of some fucking seven edit horse.
You know,

1004
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,610
what would you do if, if Metta world
peace was the second coming of Christ?

1005
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:54,080
Wouldn't that be fucking awesome?

1006
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,510
I would love to go to some area and
meeting after that if they just proved it

1007
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,840
without a fucking doubt that
that was the son of God.

1008
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,913
Yeah.

1009
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,950
Do you know how much I pray for shit
like that or like for the toughest guy in

1010
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:15,670
the NFL did just come out of the closet
and say he's gay and then continuing to

1011
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:19,390
kick the shit out of people. Those are
the kinds of things that I want to see,

1012
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:23,590
you know, at this point. I mean, what
the fuck else you gotta do it right?

1013
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,830
They got cars that are going to start
parking themselves. Do you see that?

1014
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:31,270
The ditsy broad they had in the car,
that Ford focus commercial with that dose,

1015
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:36,150
with the hat, with no
label on it, you know, um,

1016
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:40,240
she's just saying like, oh my God,
that car's like parking itself.

1017
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,080
What was that movie with that
stupid little robot? The cartoon

1018
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:49,780
and it had people in the future and there
was so fat that they couldn't fucking

1019
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:52,550
move.
They just sort of sloshed around,

1020
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,970
didn't they like remote
control wheel barrels?

1021
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,020
You remember that there was a little
robot that looked like a blender and of

1022
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:04,000
course it had some sort of relationship
with like a fucking, I dunno,

1023
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,730
nail gun. I don't, I
don't remember movies.

1024
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,110
There's gotta be a love
story that's gotta be hard.

1025
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:13,450
I don't know what the fucking movie was.
You know what it was?

1026
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:17,830
It was called iPod Wally.
Wasn't there some Wally in there?

1027
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:19,510
Yeah,

1028
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,830
I dunno.
Whatever.

1029
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:23,710
But they said everyone was gonna be so
fat and the fucking future that they,

1030
01:04:23,711 --> 01:04:24,730
that we stopped,

1031
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:29,080
we didn't have legs anymore and all these
people got fucking offended and here

1032
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:31,330
they are. They're making all this shit.
You don't even have to think anymore.

1033
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,020
Does that even make sense? Do
you do have to thank, don't Ya.

1034
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:39,980
Yeah.

1035
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:40,371
You know,
I,

1036
01:04:40,371 --> 01:04:43,910
this is one of these podcasts I should
have ended 10 minutes ago because every,

1037
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:44,930
you know what I sound right now,

1038
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:47,780
I sound like somebody who says they
didn't commit the murder and I'd keep

1039
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:51,890
hanging around talking just
further con convicting myself.

1040
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:53,120
I keep saying I'm not dumb

1041
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:59,690
and I just keep doing things just to say
otherwise. Um, all right. Here's the deal.

1042
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,060
I'm doing the, uh, the hand job whisper
this week and then I'm, I'm performing it.

1043
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:09,740
Flappers that's my, may I
get jealous, um, in June.

1044
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:13,910
Then I'm doing some other stuff and just
come on out and see me and a w eight.

1045
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,230
Let me send me some,
uh,

1046
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,820
some movies that I should go see that
I'll then and spliced together with other

1047
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:23,590
movies. You guys can laugh at me. Uh,
that's it. Uh, hey, keep going to,

1048
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:25,570
why amazon.com through my website.

1049
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,040
Go to [inaudible] dot com click on the
podcast page and click on the banner for

1050
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:33,790
Amazon. If you want to go buy
something, if you do buy something,

1051
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:36,280
they'll kick me back a percentage.
It doesn't cost you any more money.

1052
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:40,150
In 10% of that goes to the
wounded warrior project.

1053
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,390
If amazon.com ever gives me any money.

1054
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,733
Okay.

1055
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:53,080
Oh, that's how businesses, um, anyways,
that's a podcast for this week.

1056
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:58,000
Go fuck yourselves. Um, my predictions,

1057
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,600
um, I want to say the kings are
going to beat Phoenix this point.

1058
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:07,320
That games should be over. I want to say
it, but there's just something about a,

1059
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:09,100
okay.

1060
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,910
You know, I don't want to jinx him.
Ellie's never won a Stanley Cup, right?

1061
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:14,680
Neither is Phoenix,
but they haven't been waiting that long.

1062
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:18,340
So I got a roof la and then you got the,
uh,

1063
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:23,770
New York rangers versus the, uh,
the country, New Jersey, Denver,

1064
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,250
Denver,
New Jersey devils and um,

1065
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,920
I dunno, I think the devils are going
to win just because they just play,

1066
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:37,890
play that fucking goddamn defense
and you can't get around it.

1067
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:40,890
Then he got a dumping in and chasing.
I'll up fucking bullshit. Who knows?

1068
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:44,640
That's the podcast for this week. Go fuck
yourselves. I will see you next week.

1069
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,110
God bless, Eh, uh, that's
it. All right. See Ya.
