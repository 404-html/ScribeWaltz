1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,873
Okay.

00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,570
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,300
During black history month,

you still got to shoe Horn
George Washington day and
Lincoln's birthday in there.

You got in May who said, is

22
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:20,680
I've run out somewhere around there.
Those are weird. The dog days of the year.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,850
It's like fucking, you know, uh, flag day.

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,050
Then I always get memorial day and

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,440
Okay.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,790
Memorial Day, Memorial Day is in
May. We recognize all the veterans,

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,040

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,590

30
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:43,424
shit,

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,160
Changing all your fucking VCR tapes over
to fucking DV days and then to a little

32
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:52,850
fucking stick, whatever the fuck
it is you do that day. Right.

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,020
Um,

34
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,420
so everybody can go around and fucking,

35
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,530
trade stories about their uncle that blue
his fucking fingers off cause he never

36
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:06,350
got married. He was trying to impress
his nephews and nieces. Right,

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,473
right.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,130
See you see that right there son?
You see it out right there.

39
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,240
That's why I told you y'all can cheer

40
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,770
Right? I want to hear it. No Mall.
Wait, going over uncle Jimmy's. Okay.

41
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,000
It's over there with loose fucking
women and he's playing with them fire

42
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,834
crackers.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,080
Right? So that's July 4th. Then
August, August is kind of like a month.

44
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,190
It's up for grabs.

45
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,230
Yeah.

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,340
No Jewish holidays. No. Hey,
remember Jesus did this for you.

47
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,450
What do you say they're Muslims? What do
you got? You got something that month.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,660
How bout you? Buddhist Buddhist. Don't
give a shit right there. Like, hey man,

49
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,700
like every day for everybody
and it's just like,

50
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:55,130
as long as we're sitting
around and feeling the breeze,

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,470
that's what I'm trying to be, you
know, I'm trying to be that person.

52
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,370
Today was going to be my 10th
day in a row to a meditate,

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,030
but I didn't,

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,920
I woke up late and I had to take
my lady over to the doctors and um,

55
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,030
and I just, I just got up late, you know,

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,650
I had this fucking weird ass dream
to have this weird dream where I was,

57
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,760
went out my back portrait.

58
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,890
I was watching these helicopters
flying in formation and dive bomb in my

59
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,930
neighborhood. And I was like, what
the fuck are they doing that for?

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,430
And then one of them lost control and I
had this weird view from my house that

61
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:31,520
I've never had before. And it was
just basically the cockpit, you know,

62
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,890
and the engine that part in the
skids, no main rotor, no tail,

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,450
no tail rotor and nothing else.

64
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,810
And for some reason it wasn't tipping
over and falling to the ground,

65
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,110
like a fucking trashcan
or most likely inverting.

66
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,420
It just fucking, it just went
straight and it's sorta landed.

67
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,740
And I ran down there.

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,740
I was in my underwear because you were
always in your underwear and the and your

69
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:56,470
dreams, right? You never have your
pants on. It's so fucking weird.

70
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,140
This is only with mine.
There's always that level of humiliation.

71
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:03,280
No matter what's going on, I
can't find my pants. Right. Um,

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,860
anyway, so the fucking thing lands. So
I run up and then I'm thinking like,

73
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:12,370
wait a minute, do I want to see
the carnage that is in there?

74
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,970
And then all these people showed up with
like cell phone cameras and stuff and I

75
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,690
was standing there in my underwear and
I ran home. That was that. They go,

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,010
there's your dream to interpret
for the week. All right,

77
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,260
cause I'm not going to therapy anymore
because they spend enough fucking money.

78
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,130
You know, with somebody daydreaming
with the goddamn notebook. Right?

79
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,490
And none of them ever looked like that
brought on the Sopranos, let's be honest.

80
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:38,470
Right? Um, yeah. So I started,
I woke up late. All right?

81
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,610
So I need to fucking relax.
Quiet my mind.

82
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,440
Make it more of a still pond.
Whenever a rock falls into the pond,

83
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,950
what happens? The Weiders ripple. Yes,

84
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,930
the water's ripple. And if too
many rocks fall in, what happens?

85
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,340
There starts to be a storm.

86
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,710
And this is what I want you
to pay attention to today
during today's meditation.

87
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,940
Is your brain as a still pond?

88
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,990
Can you hear it?
This screaming,

89
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,020
watery death of 1200 passengers
going under the water of your mind.

90
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,190
Sorry, I lost it. I don't know what the
fuck I was talking about anyways. Um,

91
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,510
I also am apologies. This
weak apology. Number one,

92
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,410
I owe an apology to the
fucking Atlanta Falcons.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I owe an apology to the Houston Texans.

94
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,300
I owe an apology to Meryl Streep.

95
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,280
Evidently going into Twitter
according to one person. All right,

96
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:45,880
let's start with the Seattle
Seahawks, right? You know,

97
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,370
I thought those were going
to be the dirty, filthy,

98
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,880
stinking disease carry and birds
that we're going to win that game.

99
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,170
I said last week and I,
I kind of quote,

100
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,780
you know who got off easy this weekend,

101
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,020
the New England patriots and the Seattle
Seahawks because the cowboys and the

102
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:09,310
packers are gonna beat the fuck out
of each other and the Steelers and the

103
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:11,800
fucking chiefs are gonna beat the
shit out of each other, right?

104
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,310
And then all we got to do is
play the winner as so, man,

105
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:15,970
okay

106
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,930
that these two teams,

107
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:21,700
we're just going to walk to the AFC and
NFC championship game and see if that is

108
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:24,880
a given. Well, let's start
with the Atlanta Falcons.

109
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:28,210
I picked the wrong dirty
birds. Uh, very impressive win.

110
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,830
And um, I know Seattle fans going to
be like, we had some major injuries,

111
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,530
which they did coming into the game
and then they lost another guy.

112
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,150
I understand that. Okay,
I totally understand that.
Seattle fans, you're 100% right.

113
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,880
Christ.

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,630
I can hear you cry in front of here.
Your stadium is so la.

115
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,020
Oh my God. And those Seattle.
See they're so fucking law.

116
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,690
I'm so sick of ESPN fucking
like just ignoring that
entire fact. They just don't,

117
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,970
they know what it is.
You notice they can't,

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,690
they have the ability to separate
themselves from the truth.

119
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,720
That's what I really respect from ESPN
as they could just separate themselves

120
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,880
with truth and just go
for the fucking money.

121
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,660
They don't give a shit about what's
right or none of them give a fuck.

122
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,820
They just say and shit to say shit.

123
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,770
So idiots like me get upset and yell
at their fucking TV and keep watching.

124
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,930
And then what do they do?
They get some more habit Dash
Erie, right? The date, date,

125
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:26,870
you know, they, they get,

126
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,420
they get a bigger fucking whatever
the fuck it is thereafter over there.

127
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,040
And new tie tech.
I don't know.

128
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know what motivates people that
want to sit around in suits talking

129
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,780
about sports. Why do they wear suits? By
the way, can anybody explain that to me?

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,760
Why are they all sitting
there like they're on meet
the press where they taught.

131
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,790
I just, I don't fucking understand
it. You know, and it's contagious.

132
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,440
Okay.

133
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,530
Talking,
standing in a fucking suit.

134
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,970
Talking about a sports
is so fucking contagious.

135
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,580
Ben Roethlisberger.

136
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:57,910
Yeah.

137
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,880
Ben Big Ben.
I ain't wearing no fucking motorcycle.

138
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,620
Showed up dressed,
dare I say dress to the fucking night.

139
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,830
He looked like a million bucks
from the fucking neck doubt.

140
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,260
Okay.

141
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,910
His suit was fucking sharp.

142
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,030
He had a pocket square that tie
the shirt the whole fucking day.

143
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,110
He was killing it. Okay. Oh,

144
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,510
Jay would've got off this a second time
if he wore that fucking Sudi yet on

145
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,210
Sunday. However, from the neck up,
he just looked at him going like,

146
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,650
this guy crushes a 12 pack while eating.
All right. A French fries. I know he does.

147
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,300
Okay. Why you don't, you know what? He
looked like? He looked like a guy. A key,

148
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,670
like a convicted drunk driver
trying to get his license back.

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,950
Now you promise me you're not going to do
this again? Yes, your honor. Absolutely.

150
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:44,770
I, I've seen the error of my ways.
You know, it's still all puffy.

151
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,310
I'm fucking with you. I Love Ben Ben
Roethlisberger, but seeing him in a suit,

152
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,173
you know?

153
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:49,730
Okay.

154
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,680
He was, he was all grown up. I'm
proud of him. Um, so my apologies.

155
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,980
The Atlanta Falcons and I'm not going
to know anybody's fucking names. Okay.

156
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,960
I don't know anybody's names. I know
Julio Jones and I know, uh, um, Sherman,

157
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,000
you know Julio Jones made look,
he made him look, I wouldn't,

158
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,920
I would never say regular
because Sherman is the shit.

159
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:15,600
He made him look a little bit and I've
never seen him do that because that guy

160
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,010
still shuts down his part of
the fucking field. All right.

161
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,880
And he made him look a kind of
a, you know, a guys pretty good.

162
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,460
He's got some pretty good foot work there.

163
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,880
Then also I thought he a
one cab chancellor came up,

164
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:32,610
well he usually just fucking
lays the fucking and lumber.

165
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,440
Julio Jones dropped his shoulder,
absorbed the shit and dare I say,

166
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm not going to say
he put cam on his back,

167
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,310
but it was not an issue that cam hit
him and that really surprised me.

168
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,670
And um, I don't know. I don't
know where the fucking names.

169
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,450
I've say Atlanta is fucking running
back, whatever the fuck his name is. Uh,

170
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,350
the one who doesn't pretend to eat cereal,
whenever he fucking gets a few yards,

171
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,640
that's the cowboys won. He
gets up. You know, you know JC,

172
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,430
you ever seen a guy campaign and harder
to get a Lipton soup add? You know,

173
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
it's that guy who used to be on the giants
and then did the show at that little

174
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,440
cutie pie in the morning.

175
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:12,441
And then for some reason left that show
to be one of 19 with the guy who used to

176
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,330
run fucking, uh, Clinton's campaign.

177
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,630
Is it George Stephanopoulos on
a morning show right now? Like,

178
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,610
that guy's got to be on like,
what the fuck?

179
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,340
Yeah.

180
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,630
What happened? What I, 25 fucking years
ago I was dealing with the Russians.

181
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm fucking sitting here
on pancake Wednesday acting
like I'm excited about this

182
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,350
shits in on his fucking couch. You're
not, the worst parts of those shows are,

183
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:39,280
is the way they decorate the coffee table.
You know,

184
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
I can't imagine trudging in there every
fucking day to do that show. Like,

185
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,410
what fucking monkey suit are they
putting you in today? You know,

186
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,490
girls have to have their Sassy. I'm
a morning person. Outfits, you know,

187
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,420
the guys have to have that. Uh, you
know, I'd show up and uh, you know,

188
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,670
I turned the whole
fucking paycheck over to,

189
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:01,390
you would pull some Angela's ashes
shitty and go to the pub instead.

190
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,300
They got to have that fucking
look. You know what I mean? Um,

191
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,130
why did stray hand lead that
show was that little cutie pie.

192
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:14,020
What the fuck is her name? I saw once
in real life, she's fucking smoking,

193
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,520
smoking hot. Right. And it was just the
two of them. They had a great time, right?

194
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,390
She come out on his shoulder like
a parakeet. He do the monologue,

195
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,350
she'd giggle alarm in there,
the whole fucking thing. It
was just the two of them,

196
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,560
just the two of them
making heats up to vote.

197
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,610
And if for some reason
he leaves that show,

198
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,280
Michael Strahan, arguably one of the
most successful people, you know,

199
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:45,220
people look at Mark Cuban and they
go, Amy, here's a guy, you know,

200
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,640
he didn't have any fucking money.
Start to some internet company.

201
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,800
He makes it silly dollars that
he buys an NBA team. Greg,

202
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,950
he starts go bald, he gets to fucking hair
plugs, he goes to Vegas, sees at a rave.

203
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,230
You don't know where this guy's going.
He's got his own fucking jet.

204
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,030
Everybody thinks this is the guy,

205
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,040
this is the next fucking Bill Gates guy.
He's on shark tank.

206
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,150
Okay.

207
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,450
He's having people coming in who can
barely afford the gas and their lawn mower

208
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,600
and he's listening to their ideas and
then owning them and then taking them and

209
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:16,420
not giving it. You know. You know
what guys like that too, right?

210
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:19,450
I don't know why I'm picking on this
guy. He's just funny to me. Right. Um,

211
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,230
and you know,
I'll go of this.

212
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,230
Everybody thinks he's the next Bill Gates.

213
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:29,950
And meanwhile you got Michael Stray here.
Okay.

214
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,030
Who came up from the hard
streets or somewhere? I don't
know where it came from,

215
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:38,080
but I know he's African American, so I
know his streets weren't soft. Right.

216
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,660
What was the last time you saw an
African American make it and they,

217
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:45,880
and they said they did not
come from hard streets,

218
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,340
that he came from soft streets.
You never see that.

219
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,790
You do not stay or no soft streets
on that side of the fucking fence.

220
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,750
So we came from the heart streets. I'm
aware of where we going to put that guy.

221
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,110
He doesn't seem like a New York guy.
He seems like a Pennsylvania Dude.

222
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,170
I don't know where the fuck kid, the
hard streets of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

223
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,590
Allentown. I don't know where the fuck he
came from. Whatever. He fucking makes it.

224
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,880
Okay. He becomes a
fucking superstar, right?

225
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,120
He deals with Tiki Barber and whatever
the fuck he was trying to do, you know,

226
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:16,900
throwing the ball all over
the carpet retires early.
They get him out of the way.

227
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:20,050
It goes into the super
ball. No, whoa. Back Up.

228
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,180
Fucking gets the sack
record. Right. You know,

229
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,070
and his last one of course was the most
impressive, which bread fives run on.

230
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:34,150
That was the precursor to the but fumble.
It's the exact same body motion,

231
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,120
except he didn't run into a
giant offensive lineman's ass.

232
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,900
He just came in and just sort
of laid down. All right then,

233
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,620
if I remember correctly,
where the fuck did they go?

234
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,600
They went somewhere on the road in one,

235
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,480
then they went into green bay in one
and they wanted to Dallas in one.

236
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:52,990
I might have those two flip flopped
and then they went to the Superbowl,

237
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,980
played the eighth New England patriots
and they fucking kick the shit out of him

238
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,580
on the offensive line. One on the
last fucking play the game. Okay.

239
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,950
And uh, when's the fucking
super bowl? Then you think
that's it? Oh No. And he goes,

240
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,880
oh, he's a broadcast to toe.
He's fucking killing it a bit.

241
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,580
You know a lot of guys done that. How
long did it Terry Bradshaw dead fuck gain.

242
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:16,540
Oj Simpson dead it. Everybody fucking
did it. Right? That's just what you do.

243
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,960
If you can actually fucking talk about
the game and you can put on a God damn

244
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,900
suit, then he does the unprecedent. Okay.

245
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,930
A visionary move than not even
Mark Cuban could come up with.

246
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,560
He decides that, you know what, I am the,

247
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,150
I am the next logical choice to
take over for fucking Regis Philbin.

248
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,720
Right? I'm, I did a whole bit about it.

249
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:40,570
I don't just watch the nigger one
time about all of his accomplishments.

250
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:44,770
I would put, I would put straight hand
right there. Okay. And then he fucking,

251
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,210
what does he do? What does he do? He gets,

252
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,450
everything's going great for whatever
fucking reason he decides to join the

253
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,520
Partridge family on some
other fucking morning show.

254
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,320
It's going to be the same shit.

255
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,610
Yeah.

256
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,210
Standing around watching
somebody cook something, right?

257
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:02,810
Talking about how some fucking person
just had the a hundred and fifth birthday.

258
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,500
Why would you want to be over there
with all of those fucking ass heads?

259
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,960
You know,
all of those different personalities.

260
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:11,570
You know someone's going to be a cunt,
right?

261
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,520
You could have just
stayed at your other show.

262
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,240
Have you ever heard somebody wastes
more time talking about something that

263
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,940
nobody gives a fuck about in your
life? 109. What the hell that was?

264
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,050
That was 10 minutes on Michael Strahan.
Alright. Um, probably like six,

265
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,040
but it felt like 50.

266
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,900
So my apology to the dirty
birds down in Atlanta.

267
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,370
I Apologize for disrespecting your team.
I didn't realize how good you guys were.

268
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:39,740
I wrote you guys off again
at the beginning of the game
when I heard you had the

269
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,910
day, you know, you scored the most
points, but we're the worst in the league,

270
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,030
in the red zone. I'm like,
well, the game's over.

271
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,150
The game's fucking over it.

272
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,300
So you run up a bunch of points
during the regular season against it.

273
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:54,150
90% of the teams that are not
going to make the playoffs.

274
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,640
So that's out the window.
And then meanwhile,

275
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,710
you couldn't stop 100% of these
costs in the red zone right there.

276
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,370
That's a formula for disaster. And
what did they do? They went out,

277
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,170
they beat Seattle so bad.

278
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,310
There wasn't one point during that game,

279
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,460
I think may on the first drive
I saw Pete Carroll one time went

280
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,040
woo.

281
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,170
And that was it. That was it. Oh Man,

282
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,100
I love Pete Carroll. Man. He's
a fucking great coach. You know,

283
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,770
he was fucking pissed when they
lost. Oh, he was fucking pissed.

284
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,570
Can you imagine his family dog?

285
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,060
He seems like he'd have a little one too
of just standing the equivalent in the

286
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:30,894
corner.

287
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,530
Pete walking around with
these ridiculously white
brand new socks walking across

288
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:40,170
this carpeted floor. That's what
he seems like to make it right.

289
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,400
Has on his fucking docker PJ's

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
that dog just gets a little too close.
You know,

291
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:51,820
I don't understand why we didn't shut
up dad defense and fucking thing goes

292
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:56,050
flying into the fireplace. Um, anyways,

293
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,120
he's probably a cat person who knows.
And my apology to the Texas and Houston,

294
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,150
Texas who without Jj fucking

295
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,060
and a rookie quarterback hun with
the New England Patriots for, uh,

296
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,370
for three and a half
fucking quarters. Um, yeah,

297
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,870
I was not impressed with us. I don't
think, uh, any Patriot fan was, uh,

298
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,910
we'll see. We'll see. I hope that's not,

299
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:24,940
I think I'm just hoping our offensive
line had a bad game member just had a bad

300
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,530
fucking game.
If you're going to have a bad game,

301
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,230
you might as well do it against the
team that's missing their best offensive

302
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,410
player and as a brand new
guy, quarterback. So maybe
we got away with one.

303
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,820
I have no fucking idea.

304
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,520
All I know is we're playing Pittsburgh
next week and I have no fucking

305
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:39,190
confidence in that despite
the fact Pittsburgh, you know,

306
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,550
I don't know what they did.
Like they kicked six field goals,

307
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:44,080
which is essentially,
you know,

308
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,933
I don't know

309
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,750
if he just went on field goals.
You might as well have out there on,

310
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,030
on like those figure skates, you know,
dressed up like Yogi bear or some shit.

311
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,800
I was like some ice capades
shits, but they did it. You don't,

312
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,020
they beat Kansas City.
I didn't see one second of the game.

313
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,130
I watched the beginning of the Dallas
Green Bay game and then my wife wanted to

314
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,260
go to the movies. So I took her to
the movies and I'm like, all right,

315
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,260
I'm recording this game. Let's record it.
The fucking Steelers Kansas City game.

316
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,620
I saw hidden fucking figure and
then I came back. Right now.

317
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,190
I'm like, all right, you know, my wife's
taken a bath. Everything's fucking cool.

318
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:21,720
I go to pop on the Green Bay Dallas
game and I didn't fucking recorded.

319
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,873
Let me say it again.

320
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,090
I didn't fucking recorded it was sounds
like an insane half and I'd fucking hats

321
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:36,040
off to that fucking dude Crosby.

322
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,940
I'm telling you right now. That
was some Adam, Vinod Terry Shit.

323
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:43,450
I never even seen Vinod hit that
many 50 yarders in one fucking game.

324
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Forget about hitting one, get an iced
and then he's got to kick it again.

325
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:47,770
The guy kicked like 200 yards.

326
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,820
It feel goals in like four attempts
or some shit like that. Um,

327
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,250
that's the kind of guy that's the kind
of guy right there. He gave me a book,

328
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,860
a little children. That's the kind of
guy when your championship right there,

329
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,370
because all you got to fucking uh,
Aaron Rodgers, all he's got now,

330
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,730
all you've got to do is just get your
clothes and old twinkle toes comes running

331
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:09,490
out with balls the size
of the fucking stadium.

332
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:11,870
It gives them the old right
there, Fred, right there.

333
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,540
Do you realize how much fucking ass he
got after that game? Even in Dallas,

334
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,160
you know those Dallas women with their
fucking botox and the same amount of

335
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,190
makeup as an 80 year old who can't
admit that she's old. You know,

336
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:28,300
they all came running out, right.
Took the hats off, take the boots off.

337
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,990
You know they all drop to the knees and
their designer fucking Jordache jeans.

338
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,490
Yeah,
you ever been to Dallas?

339
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,750
This is this dare so far behind in the
styles you would even think that there's

340
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:38,620
the internet anymore.

341
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,080
They all dress like Dallas is still on TV.
The TV show,

342
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,730
you know bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp.
I'm not saying they brought,

343
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,170
they don't really do that,
but the through line of that is still,

344
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:55,171
there is a lot of Larry Hagman in
that city with a dash of dead JFK.

345
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,090
That is Dallas and there's a lot of
shiny fucking four door pickup trucks.

346
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,810
You know, I don't know who they
are driven by, but you know,

347
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:08,140
I think you've got to get on the outskirts
to get to them are ranchers that got

348
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,350
them longhorns walking and
stomping around in the back.

349
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,150
And my apologies to Meryl Streep.

350
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:17,050
Evidently somebody had a hissy fit on the
fucking Twitter telling me that I am a

351
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:17,980
typical,
what did he say?

352
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:22,981
Post modern Synack or I just
criticized and I offered no solutions,

353
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:27,850
which is hilarious to me. It's
like, okay, so um, in your world,

354
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,490
Meryl Streep and myself,
uh,

355
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,020
should be coming up with problems,
problem solving things you want to say.

356
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,380
I just took Twitter, that guy
back I was, I had just saw,

357
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:41,760
I was a comedian making fun of Shit.
I didn't know it was a postmodern cynic.

358
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,673
Yeah.

359
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,430
Some people that the level of credit
that they give people don't even watch.

360
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:50,200
The news is just fucking beyond me.

361
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,610
I had to go to summer school every year
of high school except sophomore year

362
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,690
because my teacher hooked me up with a
d minus and my senior year I just didn't

363
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,050
give a fuck and didn't go, you know, what
are you gonna do? I'm done. It's over.

364
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,660
I'm a loser. All right. I am on my, I'm
on my way out. Whole base to wash dishes.

365
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:11,440
Thank you very much. All right. So, um,

366
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,580
I know way too much football. How bout
some hockey? Just one quick mention.

367
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,313
Alright.

368
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,820
Did anybody see Adam equates fight
when they fucking against Nashville?

369
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,270
Jesus Christ. Geez, that's crazy.

370
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:27,770
I don't know the name
of the guy who fought,

371
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,410
but that guy's got fucking
balls bigger than my giant head.

372
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:33,950
Anybody's got the balls to drop the
gloves. I'm not shitting on the guy.

373
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,840
I just add a McQuaig that fucking guy
can fight. Um, he was like, well guys,

374
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:42,200
what Gash? What Goshen? And the guy
ducked down and he fucking did it.

375
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,220
I thought it was an uppercut.
Then when I'm watching a slow motion,

376
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,630
I think it might've been a hook. I
Dunno. It just reminded me any very,

377
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:54,800
very junior way of when Clark Gillies
fucking broke that guy's face.

378
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
He was pounding this guy so bad,

379
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:59,450
the guy just ducked down
and write as he ducked down,

380
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,770
Gillies just went uppercut and his fist
was big enough to cover the guy's whole

381
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,150
face. And it was like, it's like,

382
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:08,480
it was like he punched a glass
coffee table and this guy just went,

383
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,290
he like straight down like when
they pull a building, you know.

384
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,740
Um, and the first time I noticed
that that guy could fight was, uh,

385
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,840
he beat the fuck out
of a raw Ralphie Torres

386
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,390
when he was playing with
the Phoenix coyotes.

387
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:29,180
I'll have links to those
fights, but that's, that's our,

388
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,070
I guess he is our enforced now.

389
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,450
And what's great is he's a
fucking unbelievable defensemen
too. So, uh, that's it.

390
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,790
Celtics. What are we doing?
We're doing, we always do.

391
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,860
We beat the pretenders and we can't beat
the contenders. That's our deal. Ed.

392
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,760
A enough sports. All right, let me, uh,

393
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,590
should I read a little bit
of advertising for you?

394
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,610
But everything and I can say you have
to apologize to Meryl Streep. You know,

395
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:53,510
cause I guess I preach also on my podcast,

396
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,030
which is the same as hijacking
and award show, right?

397
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,620
Did Meryl Streep one say, Hey, I'm
a fucking moron. What do I know?

398
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:08,060
I don't think she did. All
right. Oh, Billy street. Okay,

399
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,350
here we go. Let's read a little, oh
Jesus. Here we go. Matt. Up, up, up.

400
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,370
Biondi is beyond Ds.

401
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,350
Where in fucking Trump will do

402
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,400
[inaudible]

403
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,350
she wanted to take a dump, but they'll
fuck it. Worries you. Ball will be soft.

404
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,340
They don't care that she got
a lot of shit in the back.

405
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,070
It has a trap door that you open up
like old long underwear. Well Jay,

406
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:34,780
Jay's all right. The Valentine's
Day gift. Oh, this Valentine's Day.

407
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:38,710
Give a gift that they can
unwrap again and again.

408
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,730
Matching underwear from me undies.
No, Jesus. Who the fuck wants,

409
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,810
alright, Valentine's is
near and it's time. It's a,

410
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,040
it's a goat and it's go time.
Sorry for thoughtful gift hunting.

411
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,490
Any words that have a dash in it and
like they're together. Like it's a team.

412
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,590
I'm like a rookie quarterback.
I can't, I, you know,

413
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:59,480
I just look at my number one receiver.

414
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,450
I can't check down to the next
guy and I just stumbled over it.

415
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,690
It's go time anywhere. Any, I guess you
put a dash there cause they'd be like,

416
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:11,520
it's go time. It's go time for
thoughtful gift hunting me undies.

417
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,180
Has you covered with limited edition
also a dash matching pairs of undies for

418
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:19,870
you and yours has Valentine's Day.
Got You stumped.

419
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,870
Now it doesn't, I don't, I don't,

420
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:27,850
I don't give into the crazy emotion of
it much like everybody trying to get me

421
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:30,700
freaked out that I'm having a
kid any minute now. All right.

422
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:34,240
Forget the cliches and give
a gift that looks great.

423
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,180
Feels great and will make everyone happy.
Me undies.

424
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,450
Fancy dinners and

led for if you're matching underwear,

469
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,190
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say the gayest of gay couple.

470
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,530
I don't even know that you
guys would even do that.

471
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,690
Would you even be that festive?

472
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,560
Are Gay people festive or is that just
a stereotype that Hollywood is spoon

473
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:51,980
feeding to America and that's what
needs to stop dollar shave club?

474
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Everybody Dollar Shave Club always gives
you a close to shave and you can't beat

475
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:00,380
the convenience of the price.
You don't have to choose between.

476
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:04,340
Suddenly for a cheap bag is shitty
disposable or ratios are paying out the

477
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:08,270
fucking nose for a razor with the laser
pointer and 17 blades, it's awful.

478
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,990
Then dollar shave club broke onto
the scene with the smarter choice.

479
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,880
Before Dollar Shave Club,
there was no middle ground.

480
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,970
It was either shave a with
your fucking girlfriends,

481
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,580
thinks she did her legs with,
cut up your fucking face.

482
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:23,780
So he spend a zillion dollars. Um, there
you get those free ones at the gym,

483
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:27,980
which felt like shaving with a piece
of glass there or pay a fortune for the

484
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:29,420
latest. Okay, I'm just skipping around.

485
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:31,280
The copy of Dollar Shave Club
is the best of both worlds.

486
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:35,090
You get the premium shape quality
after disposable shape price, right?

487
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,970
It's like buying a
Cadillac for five bucks.

488
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,580
If you haven't tried dollar shave
club yet, you're missing out.

affordable price. If you
haven't figured that out yet,

490
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:45,440

on the market right now.

492
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,940
They're giving away a one month trial
of any of their razors for only a dollar

493

494
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:56,420
it's just a few bucks a month
and see that like a drug dealer.

495
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,310
If they gave you a little taste
of the crack, then you're hooked.

500
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,340

take a fucking break here. All right.

501
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,320
Um, okay. What do I want to
talk about here? Oh, you know,

502
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:26,180
I was watching the, uh, speaking
of Cadillacs. Oh, Elvis Presley.

503
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,560
Um, I was watching the
Meekum autumn, autumn.

504
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,070
I don't wait.
I'm trying to open his fucking blind.

505
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,090
Jesus Christ. Come on for fuck sakes. How
hard is this have to be? There you go.

506
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,580
Shed a little light on the,
I was watching when those Mika,

507
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,810
okay. Automobile auctions.
And uh, I got to tell you,

508
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:49,460
I'm fucking over the muscle cars.

509
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,770
I love muscle cars like any
other red blood American in a,

510
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,910
and a red blood and blood in American.
I like those fucking cars,

511
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:02,960
but every fucking what's the same thing?
We got some mopar power coming up.

512
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:06,860
Of course she dope. Oh,
really? Does it have a Hammy?

513
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,360
Is that as Shelby? It's the
same. And what it basically is,

514
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,390
is that it's the same
fucking like 20 muscle cars.

515
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,070
What are you going to have?
What are you going to have?

516
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,490
You know what you're going to have,
you're going to have a Shelby Mustang.

517
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,230
You're going to have the tribe
powered fucking corvette, right?

518
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,420
You're going to have the fuck
and you're gonna have a GTO. Ah,

519
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:35,400
you got to have a fucking a,

520
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:39,180
all that Mopar fucking Hemi shit that I
never got into. I was never a Chrysler,

521
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:42,300
dodge guy. Plymouth guy on
there like the Barracuda, right?

522
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,550
They're going to have
a fucking a challenger.

523
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,890
Are they going to have a charger
or they're gonna have a super B.

524
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,440
They're going to have the fucking,

525
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:52,560
whatever that Zee 28 was that
they only made fucking 10 of them.

526
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:53,371
They're going to have one of those.

527
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:57,440
It's the same fucking cars over
and over again. And meanwhile,

528
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,180
here's my question, why the fuck
are all the trucks? You know,

529
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,620
where the fuck are all the trucks?

530
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:11,300
Kasia only a truck will come across
trucks. The coolest shit and words,

531
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:14,440
all those great old man gangster cars.
You know,

532
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,410
like the fucking,
my favorite one of all time,

533
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,960
the 1967 Cadillac.
Eldorado yeah,

534
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,500
that fucking car.
It just go fuck yourself.

535
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,000
I love that fucking car. That's the
kind of car, you know what I mean?

536
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,430
That you drive when you read the post
divorce or you were smart enough never to

537
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:38,530
get married.
Okay.

538
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,490
And you're successful and you're just
fucking driving around and you got,

539
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,130
you got you got,
you got a stable a bitches and you know,

540
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:48,400
they don't give a fuck about you. You
don't give a fuck about them. Yeah.

541
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,690
They pay girlfriends. That's the
fucking car you have. You know,

542
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,213
and this is a thing.

543
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,540
And rather than secretly being lonely
and empty inside your actually fulfilled

544
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,680
because you own that car,

545
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,430
you are the closest thing to the
most interesting man in the world.

546
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,840
You know that stay thirsty. My friends,
you ever seen a woman in his life?

547
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,490
You see women,
Wim men in his fucking life.

548
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,810
You know what I mean?

549
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,670
You'd never see him at a fucking dance
recital with his fucking rug rats.

550
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,510
Um, anyways, I fucking love that car.

551
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,260
I the most gangster fucking car.
And then I also like to 65, uh,

552
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,990
uh, Jesus Christ with the clamshell
fucking open the headlights,

553
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,770
that Buick Riviera. Okay. And, um,

554
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,170
at some point it might be my next car.

555
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,950
I drive the Jag into the ground.
By the way, I sold my Prius today,

556
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,070
add that fucker for nine years, man. Um,
it was great. I never did that before.

557
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,750
Never sold it to just a person.
I always traded them in.

558
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,320
And this time I actually
sold it to a person. Got The
title, did the whole thing,

559
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:59,350
felt like Richard Rawlings, you know,
what does he say when he fits him?

560
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,740
Get shoved somebody. Right. So it
was a Prius and I didn't build it.

561
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,990
Other than that, I was just
like him. Speaking of which,

562
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:09,200
the debut of gas monkey garage is tonight.

563
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,230
And rumor has it that the bearded wander
Aaron is leaving the fucking show,

564
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,730
which is, uh, you know,

565
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,890
that's like Eddie van Halen leave at
Van Halen or David Lee Roth leaving.

566
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,900
I mean it's, it's, it's, I am,
you know, there's a lot of,
I'm interested to see what,

567
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,743
what they do

568
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,810
okay

569
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,840
with this one.
I how you're going to a

570
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,100
yeah.

571
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,730
How are you going to make up for that guy?
Jesus Christ. Uh, but I'll be tuning in.

572
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,490
I'll be tuning in because that's,
that's, I've all the shows out there.

573
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,630
That's the best one out there.

574
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:45,410
And there's so many shows that rip that
fucking show off and try to capture that

575
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:48,950
formula. That's the best one out there.
And I love the shit that they built.

576
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,700
Speaking of trucks last season,
they were saying, you know what,

577
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:55,460
we're all truck guys who are all
truck guys and I'm yelling at the TV.

578
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:57,200
Well then fucking makes it more trucks.

579
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,450
Okay.

580
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,520
I remember that they
made that one for Casey.

581
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,720
They can count on one hand they made
the one for KC. They made that uh,

582
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,250
they made the Chevy,

583
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,230
especially if you get those ones that
had the two tone Tate to tone taint Jesus

584
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,110
Christ to tone two tone paint.

585
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,440
I don't know if I can finish this idea
to tone tank. You know what that is?

586
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:23,670
That's your tank is the normal,

587
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:27,360
your normal flesh color and somebody
tries to kick you in the balls from behind

588
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:30,030
and they miss and you get a black
and blue mark on party a taint.

589
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,620
Then what you have is a two tone,
tane. All right, two toned paint.

590
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,160
Um, they, and they did last
year. What did they do?

591
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:43,161
They did a like a 1948 or 49 Chevrolet.

592
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,280
Uh, and they just went all out
with the fucking thing. And uh,

593
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,250
okay.

594
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,030
It was, it was absolutely fucking,
it was, it was, it was just amazing.

595
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,700
It's amazing what they do in that show.
And I wish I had those skills. Um,

596
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,080
who knows?
Someday maybe someday I'll fucking

597
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,550
have the time to find a fucking 67,
uh,

598
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,130
Cadillac Eldorado dragged that fucker
out of somebody's backyard and have

599
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:13,250
somebody like that build the thing for me.
I'm one of those guys too.

600
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:16,640
I would drive it. I saw one on, uh, I
hate people. Get those fucking cars.

601
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:20,000
I don't drive them. I got one for you
if you want to look this up right now.

602
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,130
All right.
Look up 1965 Cadillac El Dorado.

603
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,320
$45,000.

604
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,440
Yeah.

605
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,520
This fucking guy,

606
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,760
he's got the best look at one I
think I've ever seen has like the,

607
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,610
somebody did a whole body off restoration
on it as like fucking 33 miles. Uh,

608
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,000
he got it when it had like seven miles
on it and then now he's selling it with

609
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,730
33 and it's just like,
why would you,

610
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,620
I would drive that fucking
thing to 200,000 miles.

611
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,390
Unbelievable fucking car.
Um,

612
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,520
but the only part, I will warn
you when you watched that video,

613
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:59,600
when he starts caressing
the leather inside the car,

614
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:02,630
it gets a little creepy. I had to
fast forward through it. He was like,

615
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:07,370
look at that. That's fine.
Italian leather. Oh yeah.

616
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,130
He didn't get that bad,
but it got pretty bad.

617
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,980
But this fucking guy has got
a bunch of them. Uh, s uh,

618
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,700
supersport motors.com.
Um,

619
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,280
at least he did as of I guess two
years ago, two and a half years ago.

620
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,370
Whenever you put this fucking video.
Uh, but if I was going to buy one,

621
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:28,230
I would buy one off of this guy.
Holy fucking shit. I said, all right.

622
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,750
He's got some beautiful cars,
beautiful Cadillacs. Um, anyways,

623
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,020
let's plow ahead here. I
think maybe it's time to, um,

624
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,663
okay,

625
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,100
maybe it's time to do a little like, oh,
Trump gets sworn in this week, you know,

626
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,980
he gets fucking sworn in and, uh, I
would feel so much better about that guy.

627
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,490
You know, it's, it's not the racist people
that he's putting in there, you know,

628
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,370
is unsettling. Is that is,
I mean, everybody's fucking
racist, you know? Well,

629
00:36:56,371 --> 00:37:00,090
that's not true. There's different
degrees of it, but everybody has it.

630
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,460
Even people who are victims of it,
they have it.

631
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,670
You look at another group of people,
everybody's done that.

632
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:08,850
You look at a group of people, you think
something like, oh, it's like this.

633
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,880
And then you go over there.
Oh, it's actually like that.
Wow. Why did I think that?

634
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:15,480
And it all was in your fucking head.
You know, I got to do a bit about this.

635
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:17,940
I was driving down the street the
other day by went to Duke, right.

636
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,060
Driving down the street and I
see this group of young kids,

637
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,730
they school just let out. Right?
This is not a good sign right here.

638
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,020
I'm driving by a school right when the
school got out and I'm caressing my

639
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:33,010
leather. No, I, I'm driving
down the street and these
kids are all outside like a,

640
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,670
it's right around the corner from where
I'm playing drums. Here's my alibi.

641
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,730
I swear to God was playing
drums around the corner and um,

642
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,760
it's one of those stores that
sells like, uh, you know,

643
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:44,700
all the fucking snacks and shit that you
eat afterwards and you get all fucking

644
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:45,031
wired.

645
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:49,470
So I'm driving by there and usually I
get fucking annoyed because the kids are

646
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:52,530
fucking walking across the street. Then
I look at both ways and all that shit.

647
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:56,040
And then I, it takes me forever to
make a fucking left or right hand turn.

648
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,950
Or this day they were all up on the
sidewalk and I saw this movement.

649
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,330
I kind of glanced over

650
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,113
and

651
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,180
none of the kids who were
white and I saw this action.

652
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:08,780
I thought I was watching somebody
getting the shit kicked out of them,

653
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,100
potentially getting beaten into a gang.

654
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,800
That's what my brain told me.
I was watching when I looked closer,

655
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,840
there was like seven kids standing around,

656
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:21,080
one kid looking at a fucking smart phone
and then some other kids just sort of

657
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:21,914
fucking,
you know,

658
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,430
doing whatever running around in
the background and I was sticking.

659
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:26,720
Why the fuck did I just think that?

660
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,763
You know,

661
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,430
so before you fucking call all these
assholes, all these racist assholes,

662
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:37,180
you know, you gotta get that shit
out of your head. I was thinking,

663
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,810
why the fuck did I think that part of
that is from the shit that I see on TV,

664
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,790
right? I think your brain just goes,
it, it, once it gets stuffed down,

665
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,890
like how to make cereal, it just gets
it down. Like, okay, just grab this,

666
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:54,560
fucking put this in here, and then you've
got fucking cereal. You know, it, it,

667
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,270
it connects to one, I want
vision to this, this, this,

668
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,050
and it's like a mode of like survival,
which works.

669
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,480
But in that instant that didn't work,
did it?

670
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,100
I went from that to a couple of
fucking ice cube videos, whatever,

671
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,940
gangsta rap videos or my head shit
that I saw in the news. Right?

672
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,430
I can't say there was fear.
There was no fear.

673
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,070
I was just driving down the street and
I looked and that's what I thought,

674
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,040
you know, but I kind of do
that all the time. You know,

675
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,830
I'd read a Kid's book to my
unborn daughter last night, right?

676
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,750
It's supposed to make them smarter.
Right?

677
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,640
And I was reading this kid's book and
halfway through the book I realized I

678
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:35,500
didn't, I'd had no fucking idea what it
was about. So maybe I'm just a moron.

679
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,200
I have no idea. But seeing how,
what a flood fucking person, I am a,

680
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:45,160
I can't judge, uh, I can only judge people
so fucking harshly, right? Honestly,

681
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,830
I mean, I can trash it. Fucking Meryl
Streep. I can go off on a Donald Trump,

682
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:50,500
but at the end of the day,
I'm a fucking lunatic, right?

683
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,530
I read a kid's book and I couldn't
figure out what it's about.

684
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:56,320
It's about this fucking caterpillar. All
right. And they were like on day one,

685
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,070
it ate an apple on day two with
a two pairs on day three, eight,

686
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,970
eight fucking three plumps right?
So right there I'm like, all right,

687
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:07,630
this is like reverse Christmas story.
Rather than go in like seven swans,

688
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:11,290
a swimming six skis or lane,
it fucking starts with the fucking tree,

689
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,290
the partridge in a pear tree.
Now it's moving up.

690
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,950
And it seems to me like it's about
eating healthy and food and counting.

691
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,140
And then it gets up to like
12 or something. And then,

692
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:28,950
and the thing just completely abandoned
its fruit diet. And he'd said it had a,

693
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,820
uh, a fucking couple slices of pizza
and ice cream and all this shit,

694
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:37,090
and then a big stomachache.
So then I was like, all right,

695
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:41,070
this is about childhood obesity. And, um,

696
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,100
I actually lied that it never dawned on
me that it was about counting in Nios.

697
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,600
I finished the book,

698
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,850
the thing turned into a butterfly
and I said, I said the end.

699
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,760
And I looked at me and I said, I have no
idea what that fucking book was about.

700
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:56,470
She laughed. She goes,
it's about counting. I go,

701
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,330
it's not about not eating
junk food because it ate all
that fruit and everything

702
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:03,940
was fine. And then it,
all that other shit.

703
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,640
And then it got sick and she
was like crying laughing at me.

704
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,090
I don't know what that
has to do with Trump,

705
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,850
but I really wish that idiot
would get off of fucking Twitter.

706
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,460
That he's a fucking mess. He said about
Chinese time to take the gloves off.

707
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,643
He,
he,

708
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,830
he's doing that George Bush thing where
you talk about other countries like

709
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:28,060
you're trying to psych somebody out
before a bar fight and nothing gets people

710
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,110
more excited.

711
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,280
That gets morons excited
though some tough time. Right.

712
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,420
If fucking idiots,

713
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,580
he's like trashiness at all. Cause it
doing sketches about them. It's just like,

714
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,560
I don't, I don't, I don't, he cannot
be running his Twitter account.

715
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,790
There's no way he's this
fucking sensitive. Um,

716
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,530
or he has the time to do this.
Shouldn't he be addressing,

717
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:59,531
at my worst fear is that he's going to
become president and just deregulate

718
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,840
everything so he can build a golf course
or wherever the fuck he wants to. Like,

719
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:09,120
that's really, that's his idea
of making it great again. I,

720
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:12,470
I hope I'm fucking wrong.
I have no idea. Um,

721
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,670
having said all that,
still as much as he's a nightmare.

722
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,620
Unbelievably unbelievable joy watching
Hillary loose. Oh, I love seeing, yeah,

723
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,940
your bags. Okay. Becky
bags. They're fucking,

724
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,780
yeah. Am I going to say it?
All right, let's, let's,
let's continue on. All right,

725
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,920
let's, uh, them off the
fucking rails here. All right.

726
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,610
42 minutes. And can we or can we
read these last two advertising?

727
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:42,410
They'll do your questions for the
week. Um, all right. Helix. Helix. Hey,

728
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:45,770
by the way, why don't you guys
send those in? Send in your,

729
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,910
I looked at this thought it was this way
and then it was another way, but nobody,

730
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:53,250
you heard me say it so everybody thinks
I'm a great guy. And that goes for non,

731
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,420
he's too, cause I know you're looking
at us or some other group of people,

732
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,900
Koreans or some shit or whatever yet I
know you're thinking something. All right.

733
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,460
Hallux Helix. Alright, you're unique.
And I actually, you know, as much as I'm,

734
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,990
I'm not really joking
around about this shit,

735
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:09,830
but I think that people have to be able
to say that they have those fucking

736
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:14,150
thoughts. I mean this fucking, uh,

737
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,750
progressive left thing where you have
to act like you're just walking around

738
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:22,070
going, I don't see color. I don't
care if you're black, white,

739
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,020
green or purple.
And it's all of those,

740
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:28,570
all of that fucking sing
songs or horse shit. Um,

741
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,590
even those people,
even those people,

742
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,170
like you get them in the wrong
situation and the fear comes up,

743
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:36,590
they're gonna think something fucked
up. They're gonna. Um, all right.

744
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,900
So if you have any of those
stories I want to hear,

745
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,180
I want to hear and then I'll try to,
I'll,

746
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,270
I'll try to guess why you think that way.
Okay.

747
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,450
So I'm guessing with mine it's uh,

748
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,220
the news and all the gangster rap
videos than I used to watch and I'm,

749
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm old. So that was back when you
could actually have a gun in the video.

750
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,470
And then also I think I've watched too
many of those life on the inside prison

751
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,960
things,
you know what I mean?

752
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,360
All of those things where you
just look at it and go and like,

753
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:08,420
I would last 15 seconds in there.

754
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,300
I've watched all those ones about gangs.

755
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,090
I watched the ones about motorcycle gangs.
I,

756
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,330
it's probably my, uh, my intake of,
of, of television and youtube videos.

757
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:25,220
I watched videos of people sucker
punching people. Um, bully fails.

758
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:29,690
I watch a lot of
violence. Yeah, that's it.

759
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:33,060
Maybe that's what it is. All right.
Hallux. He licks your unique.

760
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:33,950
Okay.

761
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,580
You know, walk like anyone else? Talk
loud to anyone else. Shit, whack.

762
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:42,380
Anyone else asleep? Like anyone else? So
why is your mattress one size fits all?

763
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:47,090
Because it truly customized mattress
will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

764
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:48,470
now.

Gatti. Alright. Team relocating.

803
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,050
Dear Billy Brady balls,

804
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,080
my NFL team I rooted for over 20 years
is moving to La Parentheses chargers.

805
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,380
What teams should I route for?
Patriots are out of the question.

806
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,300
Thanks and fuck the Spano his family.
Uh, first of all, my condolences.

807
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,910
I remember,
um,

808
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,900
Jesus almost 25 years ago when
Robert Kraft first bought the team.

809
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,430
Okay.

810
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,530
And, uh, he was threatened at
some point, maybe was in the,

811
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:34,090
in the year 2000 somewhere around then.
He was fucking threatening to, uh,

812
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,410
move the team to Hartford if he didn't
get his own stadium and shit. And, um,

813
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,330
that really is one of the biggest,
you know,

814
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:46,810
fuck overs by all of these
sports leagues that they,

815
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:50,460
they get the cities that we have to
pay for their fucking stadium. Right?

816
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,463
MMM.

817
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,170
That's a time when you need a union.

818
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:58,680
If you could just have a
somehow of a union of all
sports fans, it'd be like, no,

819
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:02,670
you fucking pay for it. He fucking
pay for a new stadium. You can't,

820
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,340
you know what I mean?
I go to the ice cream store.

821
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,980
I have to buy a new fucking store when
they want a new store, they pay for it.

822
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,490
But the money they made off ice cream,
like how much money do you have to make?

823
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:13,290
Do you know when I was
in fucking Indianapolis,

824
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,700
those poor bastards that live out there,
I don't know if this is still the case,

825
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:20,490
but when I went out there,
when they were putting, uh,

826
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,420
that Lucas oil field deal together,
when they were already paying for that,

827
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,740
they still had not paid off the
RCA dome or the Hoosier Dome,

828
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,830
whatever the fuck they called it.

829
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:33,450
They were still paying for that other
one in this fucking can't make them buy

830
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:34,284
another one.

831
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,933
MMM.

832
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,970
Having said that, I, I guess I can't
get mad at the spinal is family.

833
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:43,500
If everybody else is getting a
new stadium and he wasn't able to,

834
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,750
to blackmail San Diego, you know
what good for you. San Diego.

835
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,060
Fuck him.

836
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,970
You want a new stadium once you pack
your bags up and get the fuck outta here.

837
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,970
But you guys also kind of
fucked up the way Cleveland did.

838
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,420
You can't buy one team a stadium and
then tell the other guys to go fuck

839
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:03,280
themselves. That's like in Cleveland
when they, the Jake got built and then,

840
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:04,114
uh,

841
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,410
whenever his fucking name was
the fuck was that guy's name.

842
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,620
Everyone in Cleveland
screaming it right now. Um,

843
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,630
who sounded exactly like a George.

844
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:19,300
See Scott,
exact same voice.

845
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,093
MMM.

846
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,960
Yeah. He wanted to stay home
and you're like, yeah, fuck you.

847
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,330
You can stay in that
absolute fucking shit hole.

848
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:32,660
And then he left say it's not personal,
just business.

849
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,740
Um, why can I keep thinking good?
Dell? I'm a patriots fan. That's all.

850
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,260
I think when I think of a fucking Asshole,
I just think Roger Goodell.

851
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,030
MMM.

852
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,430
Yeah. That's sucks man. So who should
you vote for? You know what I'd do?

853
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,190
I would say fuck the NFL.
If the Patriots ever left,

854
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:48,810
I would just say fuck the NFL.

855
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,730
I would be done with it and I
would just pick a college team, um,

856
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,210
called football is to shit.

857
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:55,763
MMM.

858
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,280
You know, even though the
athletes, college sports are great,

859
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:02,110
but the athletes get fucked over that.
They don't get paid.

860
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,670
The fact that they sell at $100,000
stadium and then fucking idiots. Oh.

861
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,900
And it's always nonathletic
people who say this school,

862
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:11,020
they get a free education.
I'll do, they like,

863
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:15,010
they have time to fucking go to
class. You major in, in football,

864
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,180
there's too much money at stake and all
these and all the nerds that don't like

865
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:23,500
the jocks at the college level. It's like
if it wasn't for that football program,

866
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:28,610
you would be going to science
class in a fucking tent. Um,

867
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,460
100,000 people are not going to show up
to watch you look through a microscope.

868
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,840
Don't ever forget that.
All right,

869
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:36,110
so why don't you fucking put on your
lab coat and go figure out how to make a

870
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:37,940
better football cleat?
Oh Jesus.

871
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:41,300
Bill was no reason to
go that hard was there.

872
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,300
Can't we have respect for all of
the arts? Um, Meryl Streep doesn't,

873
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,680
she doesn't respect mom mixed
martial arts. Hey Merrill,

874
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,660
why don't you tell us what the arts are?

875
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,530
He's uses crisis cause there's
not a symphony behind it.

876
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,140
You never listened to it. Watch NFL
film. That's art. The music they put

877
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,390
behind him. [inaudible] Waianae
wearing that, wearing it, wearing it.

878
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,220
Why that? Why that, why that
brighter? All right. Movie foods,

879
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,500
videos. Uh, hey there.

880
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,080
Billy egg whites saw this
guy's videos on youtube.

881
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:25,290
He makes food from
different famous movies. Oh,

882
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:29,960
that's pretty cool. In this one, he makes
the big Kahuna Burger from pulp fiction,

883
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,160
which is pretty basic, but in others
he does some cool ship shit from chef,

884
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:35,960
one of my favorite movies
of the last few years.

885
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,170
And Acha the cartoon.

886
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,650
I highly recommend
checking a few of them out.

887
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,890
He makes a couple of sandwiches that
would give your grill top some great use

888
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:49,710
too. That's awesome. Thank
you. Look at debt. No question.

889
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,260
Just great information. I guess I never
tell you guys you can also do that.

890
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,570
That's fucking cool as hell.
I will definitely check that out.

891
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,080
I have been cooking up a fucking storm.

892
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,560
Um,
you know,

893
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:05,900
cause we can't really go anywhere every
once in a while and take me out to the

894
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:08,330
movies,
which this weekend,

895
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,360
this past week I saw moonlight and I
saw a hidden figures and I really liked

896
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:18,440
both for differently. Hidden figures,
big Hollywood movie, you know,

897
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:22,550
totally did the job. It was great.
Uh, and then I saw moonlight,

898
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,030
which was also great. And my favorite
part of that fucking movie, No,

899
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:26,740
I'm not ruin it.

900
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:31,740
No spoiler alert other
unless you're into cars was,

901
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,930
which was annoying was this,

902
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:38,420
this one part where this showing the
main character and then not showing his

903
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:42,350
fucking car, but you can tell it's
a nice car. I wanted to see the car.

904
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:45,590
And then they finally
showed him that was a,

905
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,580
I believe it was in [inaudible]
83 to 87 Oldsmobile cutlass.

906
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,240
And those were those great two doors that
they had in the fucking 80. So it was,

907
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:55,850
you know, the, the Oldsmobile cutlass,

908
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:00,110
the fucking Chevy Monte Carlo
in the Blue Buick, regal.

909
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,020
Those fucking cars are the shit.

910
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:05,960
And I know a lot of those southern guys
redoing when they put the big tires on

911
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:09,120
them, I don't like the big tires on
them, but that's another one. Um,

912
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,810
that's sort of the pot. Poor man's
fucking Eldorado. But I love those.

913
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,900
And some of the funniest,
like

914
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,470
guys I knew when I was growing
up had those fucking cars.

915
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:26,471
Just anybody who had a car
like that was a fucking was,

916
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:30,510
it was a good shit as they say
in Massachusetts, you know,

917
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,110
and slash a little bit shady,
probably dealing a little bit of weed,

918
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,570
maybe had a fight last night.
Those are all those guys.

919
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:40,350
They go into a bar and within 10 minutes
they're eyeballing somebody and then

920
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,860
they got to take the chain off
cause they're gonna get dual fight.

921
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,100
Remember that in the 80s, don't take your
fucking chain off with dog and tonight

922
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:53,530
I think the change coming back, I
think it's making a comeback. Um,

923
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,320
anyways, really enjoyed
both of those movies. Uh,
moonlight. I really fucking it.

924
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:01,570
That was, it had classic just
independent movie where it was like a,

925
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,380
it didn't fucking lead you around
to the by the nose. Like in,

926
00:54:05,381 --> 00:54:09,100
here's the next one and here's the
next point is the next plot point.

927
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,540
Um, really good movie. All right. Uh,

928
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:14,470
okay.

929
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,630
Putin,
Russian hacking.

930
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,290
Okay.

931
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,960
All right. This guy's writing about
Russian hacking and he start look,

932
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,823
is that we started?

933
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,493
Yes.

934
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,830
This guy started his fucking,

935
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,570
he just started his fucking a
is his email to me with, look,

936
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,680
he's already wagging his finger
at me. Jesus Christ. Dude, relax.

937
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,240
He says,
look,

938
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,440
international politics between two
countries with enough nous to destroy the

939
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:44,790
earth 10 times over is no laughing matter.
Oh,

940
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,340
am I not supposed to joke about it?

941
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,250
How come you aren't all
over this orange clown.

942
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,070
Okay.

943
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,980
All right. I going to stand with
the ski. Want jokes about it? Sure.

944
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:56,510
Clinton was no prize.

945
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,780
Okay.

946
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,051
Uh,

947
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:03,051
but you're willing to give Putin
and an out now gangster a pass.

948
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,970
Oh, I don't remember him running
for president of the United States.

949
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,833
What are you talking about?

950
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,270
What kind of world is going to
be there for your new child? Oh,

951
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:15,740
shut the fuck up.

952
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,930
I fucking hate when people will get a
new world is going to be there for your

953
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:25,820
kid. This same world that was there when
I was a kid. Progressively getting worse.

954
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,710
Like what? What is your fucking solution?
There's no solution to this shit.

955
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,100
He got 7 billion people.
I'll run in and fucking to what?

956
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:39,120
1 million different directions.
It's a shit show. All right.

957
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:42,690
The second we weren't one
tribe, it was over. It's over.

958
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:48,600
Second Day was two tribes. It was
fucking over whenever we started out.

959
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:53,280
Right. Let's just say that I, I don't,

960
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:56,520
I don't subscribe that there
was a fucking an Adam and eve,

961
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,760
I think there was a pond and there was
a bunch of us that came out of something

962
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,370
quarter did Neil degrasse Tyson.
It was the fucking trees.

963
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,940
Other people say it was the fucking ocean,
whatever the fuck it was.

964
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:09,721
There was a bunch of it.

965
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:13,920
You can't have a man and a woman bagging
and then their kids fucking without

966
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:17,630
having major problems. All right,
well maybe that's why cavemen,

967
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:18,250
it looked like they

968
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,083
did.

969
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,560
I have no idea.

970
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,970
But whenever we all weren't
Sorta cohabitating together,

971
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,040
but you know what happened is
then when it was, we came along,

972
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:33,790
there was no language. It
was just, hello Aled shit.

973
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,430
Of course it was going to be
fucking arguments. Everybody
grunting and groaning,

974
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,430
Ya know, I have no idea. Like
we were fucked. This thing
was fucked from day one.

975
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,563
Okay.

976
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:48,630
And I've gone down the rabbit hole of
trying to fucking give a shit and trying

977
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:50,380
to,
you know,

978
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,170
I don't get people to
listen to my opinion,

979
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:00,590
which probably has 0.1% of
1% of the information that
I need to actually make an

980
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:04,020
even remotely informed opinion.
You know what I mean?

981
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,050
Look at all those guys on TV who
do it for a fucking living from,

982
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:11,250
from Bill Maher. Bill O'reilly.
Okay. Even those guys,

983
00:57:11,251 --> 00:57:16,020
as much as they pay attention are severely
handicapped by the fact that they can

984
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:18,420
not look at talks top secret documents.

985
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,000
Okay.

986
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,230
To kind of connect the dots. All y'all
you can do is watch the fucking news,

987
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:29,770
read newspapers and try to figure out
which one seems to be sort of making sense

988
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:34,150
with what the fuck you're thinking.
That's the best she could do. So. So I,

989
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,130
I don't know what you want from me,
but I'll continue reading this. Um,

990
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,510
this isn't like telling jokes to a few
middle millennials in a strip mall.

991
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:47,170
It's not funny that Trump and his swamp
full of white racist Richmond, uh,

992
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,500
robbing us blind.

993
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,480
Okay.

994
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,060
Uh, I, I agree with that.

995
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,570
But you realize that Hillary Clinton in
2008 after the banks went under a when

996
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:02,870
and gave them a speech and said,
don't worry, I got you guys.

997
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,410
Those aren't those the same rich,
racist white people.

998
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:07,870
Yeah.

999
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:11,480
You know, isn't that the same upper 1%
you know, that you're talking about here?

1000
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,070
Uh, just saying they are. You
know, by the way that the upper 1%,

1001
00:58:16,071 --> 00:58:18,710
no matter who wins, they win.
You understand that, right?

1002
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,240
The job pays 500 grand a year. It
takes 100 billion to get. Okay.

1003
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:25,790
And then they all these cots
favors that got them in office,

1004
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,450
they push it through, they deregulate
stuff, they looks the other way,

1005
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,150
they granted government contracts,
all of that shit.

1006
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:35,150
And then once they're done being
president, you'll watch with Obama,

1007
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,560
he's going to make a fuck load of money
going around. Air Quote, giving speeches,

1008
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,370
200, 300 grand at nights. The exact same
fucking people that put them in office.

1009
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:47,600
That's just them washing their
bribe money. People with blue ties,

1010
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,390
red ties, red panties, blue panties.

1011
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,960
They all fucking do it except for
Jimmy Carter. As far as I can tell,

1012
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:57,020
he stopped being president and started
going around building houses for poor

1013
00:58:57,021 --> 00:59:00,710
people. Everybody else sits around waiting
for their fucking library to be built.

1014
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:04,550
Ah, my soapbox gimme a
golden globe. All right.

1015
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,480
Just saying they are both bad is
really dropping the ball. No, it isn't.

1016
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,790
You have your head in the fucking sand.
That's what it is.

1017
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,190
You just have your head
in the fucking sand. Um,

1018
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,220
I'm from New Jersey and know several small
contractors who were shorted by Trump

1019
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,760
and couldn't afford to sue.
Right.

1020
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,810
And I worked in Atlantic city and he had
a couple of casinos go under and they

1021
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:33,080
got paid dimes on the dollar. I know
how that works. He's a real asshole.

1022
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,740
That doesn't give a shit about the little
guy. He's got the track record. Lk. Okay.

1023
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:40,670
And you're saying Hillary Clinton
gives a shit about the little guy.

1024
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:42,760
Okay.

1025
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,020
Hillary Clinton who only swings by the
little guy whenever she needs votes.

1026
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,130
It spends the rest of the time on
fucking Martha's vineyard in her zillion

1027
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:54,910
dollar fucking house that she can somehow
afford when her husband is only made

1028
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,060
fucking at the most 500 grand a year.

1029
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:00,973
Okay?

1030
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,010
She got paid as a center. What
does that make? 175 grand a year.

1031
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,080
Okay?

1032
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,830
They're making less money than some of
the fucking top comedians in the fucking

1033
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,980
world. Yet there were $200
billion. How do you do that?

1034
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,060
How do you do that legally, sir, tell me.

1035
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:21,000
Tell me how you do that.
Cause you fucking crooked.

1036
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,950
Alright, so there you go. And here's
the thing about Russia spying on us.

1037
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,430
Fucking relax.
We're doing it to them too.

1038
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:30,840
Okay?

1039
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,240
Jesus Christ.
They've shot our planes out of the sky.

1040
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,470
A spine on we spy on each other.
Apps a fucking Luli, okay?

1041
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:43,560
You know, that's, that's what we do.
Every fucking thing that they're doing.

1042
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:47,180
We're doing there fucking with the
elections. We fuck with elections.

1043
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,870
They have fucking with people in power,

1044
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:51,600
putting people in power that
shouldn't be in power. We do that.

1045
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,800
They invade countries. We invade
countries. They think they're right.

1046
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:57,510
We think we're right.
At the end of the day,

1047
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:02,310
there's you and me sitting in fucking
Russia, regular fucking people.

1048
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,630
All right?
That's it.

1049
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,350
It's just the people up top that gets
you all fucking stirred up. You know?

1050
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,440
I'm telling you, they get y'all
fucking steak on. I get ya.

1051
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,440
I don't listen to any of it.
I don't.

1052
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:21,600
I just sit and I drink scotch and I
drank myself into a stupor and I stare at

1053
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:25,410
the wall. You know, ed,
I try to figure out why.

1054
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:29,250
I looked at three nonwhite kids looking
at an iPhone and stuff that someone was

1055
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:32,070
getting beaten into a gang.
When I solve that first,

1056
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:36,240
then I'm going to move on to trying to
solve the world prompts when I fall,

1057
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:40,740
when I solve the problems in the fucking
globe, that is my giant fucking head.

1058
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,600
I'll move on to that. And you, sir,

1059
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,810
if you're really looking for
somebody to solve the world problems,

1060
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:50,100
you should probably look beyond a comedian
doing a podcast where he says cunt

1061
01:01:50,101 --> 01:01:54,210
every other word, and also says
how uninformed he is. Okay.

1062
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,050
So you know, there you go.
Agree to disagree. But you know,

1063
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:03,051
if you want Meryl Streep and fucking all
fucking Billy freckled hands to solve

1064
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:05,190
the world's problems,
I think you were a trouble.

1065
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,200
Anybody can give the lip service.
It'd be like,

1066
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:09,960
I think that's absolutely deplorable.
Up a vote.

1067
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,630
I didn't vote for the fucking guy. Stop
wagging your finger at me. All right.

1068
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:18,020
All right. Plants in the
house. Hey, the ability ficus.

1069
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,500
Uh, I want you to know how I want to know
how you feel about having plants in the

1070
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:27,030
house. Growing up, we always had
plants and CACTI in our house.

1071
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,810
I think they bring a lot of life in
color to a room and it's fun to water and

1072
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:31,644
take care of them.

1073
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,280
I know some people who would never have
any plants saying that they bring dirt

1074
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:38,280
and bugs in the house. I tell them that
it's because they don't take care of,

1075
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:39,114
maintain them.

1076
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,210
You could say the same thing about a dog
saying they shouldn't bring fleas into

1077
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:45,600
the house, but obviously that student
neglecting and taking care of the dog.

1078
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:50,610
So do you have any plants in your home?
Do you have any, any your home now? Oh,

1079
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:51,900
do you like having plants in your home?

1080
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,220
Do you have any home plants
in your home now? Um,

1081
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,000
ps is a total NFL bandwagon fan.
I'm calling Green Bay to win it all.

1082
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,640
Uh, all right. Um, no I don't
like plants in the house.

1083
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,570
Um,

1084
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,520
I had a plant in my house one time a
long time ago when I was a complete loner

1085
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:15,570
and I, my apartment looked like I was
in the witness protection program.

1086
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:21,350
I was seeing this woman and she got me
a plant and immediately I was just like,

1087
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:24,330
Whoa, way, this relationship
is moving too fast.

1088
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,600
And what she was trying to
do was to get me to open up.

1089
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:31,050
And I remember she got
me this plant and uh,

1090
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:35,760
then I had to fucking water it and uh,
I kind of liked it,

1091
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:39,150
but then I'd go on the road and I would
come back and it would be near death,

1092
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,240
just like, you know,
hang it down, you know,

1093
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,280
staring at his fucking toes and then I
would nurse it back to fucking health and

1094
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,200
I would have ended up having anxiety.

1095
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,740
And then one day it finally died and
I felt this just ridiculous failure.

1096
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:59,780
Um, and it was a metaphor
for the whole factor.

1097
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:02,250
You're on the road so much.
He can't sustain relationships.

1098
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:04,230
You can't even keep a plant alive.

1099
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:06,300
How are you going to keep a
relationship or a kid lab? It was,

1100
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,610
it was a horrible fucking
experience. So, um,

1101
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,760
I don't mind having him in my house if
they are like growing like Baisil are

1102
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:15,990
fucking rosemary or some shit.
Some, some I can eat, you know,

1103
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,430
I'm selfish when it comes to plants.

1104
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:18,810
Like we've got a bunch of
plants around the house.

1105
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:20,250
I don't give a fuck about
them. I'm like, yeah,

1106
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:24,180
why don't we dig these up and put in
some fucking avocado trees, some oranges,

1107
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:28,350
you know, something that we can eat slash
throat. Zombie someday. What do you say?

1108
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:34,850
Plus having trees that grow fruit in
your yard is a great way to figure out

1109
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,710
who's your friend and
who isn't your friend.

1110
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,830
Especially during the apocalypse when
people come over your fence and try to

1111
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:41,670
steal your food,

1112
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,660
they'll go to the food like moths to a
light and then you can be on your roof

1113
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:48,540
and you can pick them
off with your fucking a,

1114
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:52,680
with whatever fucking weapon you
have. Right? I'd go with a bone arrow.

1115
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:55,890
It's nice and quiet.
Right to the neck.

1116
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:01,890
It was the one that was the water. I mean
the blood gushing out of their fucking,

1117
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,820
where the fuck, whatever you call it.
The fucking artery there. Alright.

1118
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,920
Plants in the house. I already
read that one. Here's the last one.

1119
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,400
A Billy bitch tits that Jesus,

1120
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:15,150
I'm a lady and I listened
to your podcast religiously.

1121
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,850
I'm 29 years old and I've had roommates
since I moved out of my parent's house

1122
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:21,730
when I was 18. I have a history
of anxiety and depression.

1123
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:25,060
I found that in addition
to taking medicine,

1124
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,110
living with people really
keeps me in check. Uh,

1125
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,450
in two weeks I'm going to be moving into
my own apartment and living by myself

1126
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:35,230
with my dog. Oh, that's fucking
awesome. That's the best.

1127
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:38,830
I loved living alone by the dog too. That
would have been tremendous. Of course,

1128
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:42,160
it would have died like the fucking
plan. Uh, right now I live at two guys.

1129
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:44,230
The three of us are super close,

1130
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,380
but we've lived together for three years
and it's time for us to move out of the

1131
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:49,060
frat house and into our own places.

1132
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:52,510
I'm nervous about living by myself because
I'm scared that I'm going to isolate

1133
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:55,780
myself and fall back into a cycle of
depression. Again. I live in Indy,

1134
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:59,770
so the weather is shit right now, which
doesn't help. In the spring and summer,

1135
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:02,290
I play intermural sports,
football and volleyball.

1136
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,250
I'm very much a guy's girl and I
don't have very many girlfriends.

1137
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:08,350
I don't ever have a ladies' night.

1138
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:12,160
I'd rather sit at a bar with a beer and
watch football or college basketball.

1139
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:17,270
I hate dating. I am straight
though to gay people hate dating.

1140
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:18,050
I don't know.

1141
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:22,820
I would love to get your advice for a
lady like me moving in her own apartment

1142
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:23,990
for the very first time.

1143
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:29,060
What would you suggest I do to stay
social and not sit at home alone watching

1144
01:06:29,061 --> 01:06:34,061
the Indiana Hoosiers and downing cores
light a ps telling me I said hi and best

1145
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,370
of luck to you and neon on
the new your new baby. Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself. Um,

1146
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,640
the boy you're asking a fucking loner.

1147
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,890
I love when I finally didn't have
to have roommates and I lived alone.

1148
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:47,510
I fucking loved it.

1149
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:48,490
Okay.

1150
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:53,460
I loved it. I talked to myself. I talked
to the TV. I had a great fucking time. Um,

1151
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,390
and I guess I was,

1152
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,980
I had a level of depression there
that I wasn't really aware of. Um,

1153
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,630
well don't you get enough sort of
interaction when the springtime you play

1154
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:08,950
intermural sports? Football. Volleyball.
Okay. So it's the wintertime. Um,

1155
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:10,090
I don't know.
You want to go sledding?

1156
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,040
I'm trying to think
what the fuck he can do.

1157
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,400
Is there a adult league snowball
fight thing you can get involved in?

1158
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,830
There's gotta be something that
you could do if you're into sports.

1159
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:20,740
Why don't you just join a fantasy
league with some of your friends?

1160
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,693
MMM.

1161
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,240
But I,
I think what you are is,

1162
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:28,790
I think you're a sweetheart
and your relationship person,

1163
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:32,840
you just afraid to do it. So, uh,

1164
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,280
that's why you like having roommates.
You don't like being alone.

1165
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,880
I'm totally guessing here,
by the way. I don't fucking
know him, but I, I think, uh,

1166
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:46,580
I think it's time to give date and
a try. You know, I would do that.

1167
01:07:46,581 --> 01:07:48,290
Maybe you're afraid of doing that.
I would.

1168
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:53,270
I think this seems like you need to face
a fear and look at this living alone as

1169
01:07:53,271 --> 01:07:57,740
an opportunity thing and that this is
the next logical step to finding the

1170
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:02,630
person you want to be with in
life, if that's what you're
looking for. So I would,

1171
01:08:02,631 --> 01:08:07,460
um, embrace living alone and I'll
fucking awesome that is. And,

1172
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:11,300
uh, decorate your apartment.
Don't do what I did, you know,

1173
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,740
have some color in there and off
that type of shit. Something upbeat

1174
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,700
and uh,
I would become social.

1175
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,210
I would have people over to your place.
You can even, I don't know if you cook,

1176
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:31,730
this is zillion things you could do.
You just have to make the effort. Um,

1177
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,450
I don't know why you don't
have many girlfriends,

1178
01:08:33,451 --> 01:08:35,550
but it sounds like you
do have some girlfriends,

1179
01:08:35,551 --> 01:08:37,290
so you only need a couple of friends.

1180
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:41,340
I would open up to your friends
rather than some psycho on a podcast.

1181
01:08:41,341 --> 01:08:44,430
Not saying this was a bad move, but it's
a nice step. I would open up to them,

1182
01:08:44,431 --> 01:08:45,930
just say, listen, I'm prone to depression.

1183
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:49,200
So I'm worried that when I live alone
that I'm going to become depressed.

1184
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:54,690
You know, if you'd like to
swing by and watch a game with
me, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1185
01:08:54,691 --> 01:08:55,680
blah,
I would do that.

1186
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,460
I would be open and honest and maybe go
talk to somebody about your depression.

1187
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,460
Um, so you don't go down
that fucking rabbit hole,

1188
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:05,190
but it's great that you know that
you're depressed and that you need to do

1189
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:08,070
something about it so that you're way
ahead of the game as opposed to where I

1190
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:11,550
was, where I did know I was
depressed and I fucking, uh,

1191
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,030
yeah.

1192
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:17,020
I don't know. It made a lot of stupid
fucking moves for a long time. All right.

1193
01:09:17,021 --> 01:09:22,000
That's the podcast for this week. Uh,
thank you so much for listening and, uh,

1194
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:25,840
I'll post that video of
that Cadillac. Eldorado it's
fucking beautiful. All right.

1195
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:28,420
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
talk to you on Thursday.
