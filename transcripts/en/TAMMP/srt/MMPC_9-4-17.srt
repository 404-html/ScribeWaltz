1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,300
Hey,
what's going on in bill burn?

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:07,740
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, September 4th,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,060
2017 how's it going? How? Why
you? Happy fucking Labor Day.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,580
Happy Labor Day.
Happy Labor Day.

5
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,660
You don't have to go to
fucking work unless you're
the guy that owns the fucking

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:23,670
business. Stan, you never get to sleep.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,090
[inaudible] you showed a
stuck with your first wife,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,720
but you threw her out and now you got a
fucking 20 something fucking cop and she

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:39,300
wants to spend all your money. All right,
sorry. Anyways. Oh, you know something.

10
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,460
You worked hard all year.
God dammit.

11
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:45,270
It's nice that you got a
fucking a Monday off, isn't it?

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't you wish it was
the way it is in Europe?

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,920
I don't know how they do it over there.

14
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:52,960
You know they all got
fucking health insurance.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,120
They get like 53 weeks off a year.
Then I'd like the,

16
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:00,850
the whole fucking continence shuts down
in August. Everybody just says fuck it.

17
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:05,280
We're not working and
somehow it keeps going.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,650
Is it because their countries is so
small doll? Look at the little country,

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,770
is that what it is
over here is so fucking big.

20
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:19,190
You know, just a mow. Your yard takes
half the God damn summer over here.

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,860
All of us fat fucks.

22
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:25,861
Walnut hill and around a giant pieces
of property Rad and a four wheeler

23
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:31,900
shooting their guns. You fucking
live over there in, in Europe man.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,560
You get, you got nothing. You got a flat,

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,613
you know,

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,840
you and five other guys
fucking addicted to heroin.

27
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,230
When some baby drowns in a toilet or
whatever they're fucking movie was,

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,560
you know you got nothing on.
Maybe.

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,000
Maybe you got a house and
it's got like the fucking,

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,030
it's got that roof that looks like a
bale of hay that someone braided in.

31
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:55,910
It looks like a weave but with like,
hey, I don't know what it is over there,

32
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:59,270
but all I know is they still have castles.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,880
Some of them still have kings
and queens and they, they get,

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,430
they get like August off,
cyst off.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,950
You know when they get free healthcare,

36
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,360
they pay a bunch of fucking taxes.
But I gotta be honest,

37
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,270
you pay a bunch of taxes here too.
I think it's just cause we're bigger.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,870
Got The wide open fucking roads.
I'm going to go with that.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,020
I'm going to go with that and
I'm never gonna read up about it.

40
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,900
And that's what I'm going to say.
If that topics ever brought up like hey,

41
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:24,800
I've come uh,
come,

42
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:29,510
they get all this vacation time and
if a woman has a kid over there raw,

43
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:32,960
she doesn't have to be back to work
on Monday, I'll come that it's,

44
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,500
oh cause they're little tiny countries,
you know, they have little tiny hospitals,

45
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,870
you know, a little tiny teeth that
they don't brush. You know, it's, it's,

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,710
it's Europe. What do
you, anybody, even though

47
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,570
it's where the cars go
better in the corners,

48
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:49,050
they have little tiny
streets and they're gonna,

49
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,940
they're gonna zig zag around some shit.
You know that,

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,270
that's basically what it is.
It's not like America.

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,060
It's a woman gives birth on Friday and
then the eight gene makes sure you're

52
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,040
fucking here on Monday,
pumped dad kit

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,050
out,
do whatever it is you got to do.

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,740
Yeah. Have you gotten to stick
a weed whacker? Other hour,

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,020
fucking reverse blower up down.
Suck the kid out and be back to work.

56
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,150
We'll give you Monday off.
Then you've got to be here on Tuesday.

57
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,290
That's how it works here in America.

58
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,830
Everybody wonders why was so fat has
nothing to do with our poison food.

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,090
We're just stressed.
You know,

60
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,550
if you guys didn't have a whole month
of August off over there in Europe,

61
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:31,110
I'd love to see if you guys actually
had to fucking work over there and worry

62
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:35,130
about, you know, I need a new pancreas.
How am I going to afford that?

63
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,740
Right. Which is easily the cost
of at least three flat screen TVs.

64
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,060
That's the going rate for a pancreas,
if I remember correctly. All right.

65
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,170
If you were dealing with that stress,

66
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:49,480
I'd like to see how many fucking
donuts you'd be. You know, uh,

67
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,320
speaking of which, uh,
Billy, no fun. Billy.

68
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:57,050
No Fun is on his 18th day of not boozing,

69
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,990
18 days, not booze. And I
barely even remember what it
tastes like at this point.

70
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,220
You know, I'm dropping weight. This
is the time of night when it sucks.

71
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,040
Um, you know, in the morning
it's great. I wake up,

72
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:17,150
my stomach's flatter than it
was the day before. I felt good,

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,850
but it's like at night, I
mean, it's Sunday night.

74
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,530
I don't have to go to work on Monday.

75
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,670
I have tomorrow off like all of you
guys while you listen to to it today,

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,190
you know, you can't tell me, you know,

77
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,831
I mean as,

78
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:34,970
as a fucking human being and I have to
go out and get fucking hammered. Right.

79
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,510
I mean, what kind of, I mean,
I, if I don't, I mean, if I
was running the CIA, I'd be,

80
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:45,580
you know, there's this guy in Isis
see some sort of religious fanatic.

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,873
MMM.

82
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,820
Oh, Billy red cakes. Oh, Billy red velvet.

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm staying away from the sugar.

84
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm being an angel of being an angel
because I might have some active work in,

85
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:02,160
um, in October. So a,

86
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:05,100
I gotta make sure I'm down to my
fighting weight of my fighting weight.

87
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:08,790
A buck 72. That's what I need to
be at. Whenever I shoot something,

88
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,150
you know all these fucking actresses
out here and talk about how it's so hard

89
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:15,810
for them is if a guy can
go on and be a bloated fat,

90
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:17,790
fucking not get shit for it.
Okay

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,640
it,
that's not how it works.

92
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,020
They can get to you through social media.

93
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,900
They go right at you and they tell you
that you're a bloated fed fuck what

94
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:30,190
happened to you. You got old,
which a hair go, all of that shit.

95
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,590
You know what I mean? But you know,
you know what it is about people.

96
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,950
They look out their own fucking heads,
all right,

97
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,880
and they look at the world
in a two dimensional way.
They look out their heads,

98
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,380
they observe something and then they put
it their head and they process it with

99
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,370
their previous experience and
then to them that is the truth.

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,230
That is what's going on in the world.

101
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,550
They look at it from their fucking angle
and they don't realize it that it's 360

102
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,384
degrees,

103
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,480
which is why South Park is the greatest
fucking show of all time as far as I'm

104
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,170
concerned, because no matter what problem
they attack, they hit it from all sides.

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,110
The red side, the blue side from
the north, south, east, west.

106
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,390
You know what I'm saying?
You liked that. That was,

107
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:12,110
that was the longest
fucking compliment ever. Ah,

108
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,190
Josh Adam Meyers from
the goddamn comedy jam.

109
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,790
Josh Adam Meyers, Bill Burr. I'm
taping my Monday morning podcast.

110
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,770
You're one of our first caller's.
How are you?

111
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,173
I'm just curious.

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,460
I wasn't aware that that happened.

113
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,860
Was that a big news story
in the world of sports?

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,230
Do people know about it?

115
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,100
Uh, you know, as a, as a fucking lover
of the Celtics, as this Celtics lover,

116
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:44,150
I hated the fucking trade because I loved
Isaiah. He was like a mini big PAPI.

117
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,720
He was on his way. He was going to
have a street named after him. But, uh,

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,660
that it's, it's a business.
Now when this all goes back,

119
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,150
I think to the Miami Heat,

120
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:57,470
all those pylon teams back to the Cobi
Shaq Lakers when whenever it stopped

121
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:02,120
being bird bird, Celtics,
magic Lakers, Isaiah fucking,

122
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,590
uh, the Pistons, Jordan with the bowls
and everybody just jumped around.

123
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,810
Now it's over. I thought you
were gonna ask about the cigar.

124
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,980
I am.
That's what I was saying.

125
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,800
No,
I don't give a shit.

126
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,470
Just ring the doorbell and I'll
stop and I'll finish it later.

127
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,790
All right,
closing a little bit.

128
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,630
Oh, it don't hate, don't ring
the doorbell. My daughter's
sleeping. Just text me.

129
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,980
I'd see. Um, anyways,

130
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,990
the most roundabout compliment ever.

131
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,590
Okay.

132
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,410
For South Park. I had no idea I was
going to say that. So, uh, I am,

133
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,240
as of this morning, I have 179
pounds, six ounces once 79.6.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,830
So I'm trying to lose three weeks or
next week on Friday, I need to be a,

135
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,820
I need to be one 77.

136
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,060
I just had to hit pause. I'm
in the fucking dog house. I
just woke up my daughter.

137
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,800
Oh my God, my wife is fucking
pissed at me. Boy. Boy,

138
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,470
you brother.
All right.

139
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,380
This is the Monday morning podcast and
I'm going to be fucking whisper and for

140
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:06,360
the rest of this goddamn thing,
um, that was, I talked to my, yes.

141
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:11,361
So next week I want to be 177 pounds by
a Friday and then once 74 the next week

142
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,670
and then I'll be one 71 and
then if I get this acting Gig,

143
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll be where I need to be.
Um,

144
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,420
so I was going to take a month off from
boosting, but if I get this acting Gig,

145
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:29,100
then I'm just not going to booze like
right on through to the end of the fucking

146
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:33,480
shoot. And then when
that's over, okay. Uh,

147
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,380
I'm going to get like one of those
Kegger raters and I'm going to fill it up

148
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:38,250
with fucking whiskey

149
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,120
and I'm going to be underneath it
and it's going to be glorious. Um,

150
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,540
I dunno,
I dunno what my fucking problem is.

151
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,080
I should go to a meeting and
just see what that's like.

152
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,030
Okay.

153
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,030
I went to a meeting a long time ago when
I got arrested for drinking and driving

154
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,660
and one of the requirements was you had
to go to a in Aa meeting two of them or

155
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:07,660
something like that.
Um,

156
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,100
all I remember, I was just like,
these guys are fucking drunks.

157
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,910
I mean I drink, I don't,
I don't fucking drink.

158
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,610
These guys had like lunacy stories

159
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,000
talking about like fucking bleeding out
their acids going right to the liquor

160
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,920
store the next day. You know what I
mean? Like not eating food for a Mike.

161
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:34,830
Just crazy,
crazy,

162
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:38,090
crazy fucking stories.
So I just was sitting there go higher.

163
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm just a drunk.
These people got a fucking problem.

164
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,930
I'm telling you right now, if you
ever just want to see, you know,

165
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,980
some of the most fucked up people on
the planet, just go to an AA meeting.

166
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,460
These fucking people, man. You know,

167
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,570
if fingers are like stuck together
from like cigarette smoke,

168
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,210
you know what I mean? They got
like, it just, I mean I can be,

169
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,020
I'm just being an asshole. I have no
idea what a fucking Aa meetings like

170
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,480
Anna Louise, like you get like a, a
little trinket. If you'd do it for awhile,

171
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,110
you know, get six days, you know,

172
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,950
she's Sha Faggin,
you know,

173
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,770
he know addictive people there.
They're fucking day.

174
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,810
They can never stop talking
about themselves. Right.

175
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:23,420
So think it's got to go up there. Oh Mike,
I'm going to get so much shit for this.

176
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:27,320
I don't give a fuck. I think it's about
time. Somebody fucking put a in its place,

177
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,213
right?

178
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,950
Once you grow up in white
knuckle it like the rest of us,

179
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,820
you got to go join a fucking group.

180
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Everybody sits down and fucking
makes an Afghan together. Um,

181
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,310
you know, it's funny that I actually
would love to be part of a group.

182
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay,

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,160
well my golf and up died this past week,
you know?

184
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,820
Yeah.

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,370
And I went with a buddy of mine and he
was like a member of a country club.

186
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:55,590
I'm like, this is fucking cool.
It's really cool. You know,

187
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,830
bunch of guys you could fucking talk shit,
having a great time.

188
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:02,750
All that shit that everybody fucking

189
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,560
gives you a rough time for, you know,
they always make fun of guys hanging out.

190
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,380
Now if they all hang out
together like they did,

191
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:14,630
they asked to be like mocked for
some fucking reason. It's fun.

192
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,680
You just sit around
breaking each other's balls.

193
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,070
Yeah.

194
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,110
That's all it was.
I went there and it was,

195
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:27,090
everybody was fucking cool and everybody
was just busting chops the whole

196
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:27,924
fucking time.

197
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,110
And then you go out and
golf and everybody's just
giving each other shit and

198
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:34,810
you're laughing and you smoking cigars
and you're gambling and shit. It's,

199
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:39,090
it's fun for whatever fucking reason.
I don't know if he, if you do that now,

200
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,410
I dunno for some reason that
that's attacked, you know,

201
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,970
I don't, I don't know what
the, I don't know what it is.

202
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,950
I don't know what the fuck
is you supposed to be doing,

203
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,740
but I can tell you I did enjoy it.
Um, and speaking of enjoying shit,

204
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,850
I know I'm all over the map.

205
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,183
MMM.

206
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,700
I felt I got caught up with
uh, the last, you know,

207
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,210
today's Formula One race and
uh, the previous one, like
a week ago, two weeks ago,

208
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:07,520
I missed it and I have to tell you,

209
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,610
I loved the force India team before I
watched the previous race and now I will

210
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,870
fucking love that team forever.
I will love that fucking team forever.

211
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,370
It at the very least,

212
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,510
Esteban Oh Khan in Sergio Perez,

213
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,780
everybody else was fucking,

214
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,910
was racing to not lose, you
know, didn't want to fuck up.

215
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,630
These fucker guys went in there.
You don't want,

216
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,810
I mean you ever watch a hockey fight and,
and the guys is so good at it.

217
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:45,230
They barely even punch each other.
The best ones is where you just,

218
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,330
you grabbed my shoulder,
I grabbed your shoulder.

219
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,460
We just fucking beat the shit
out of each other. You know,

220
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,380
that's what these guys did. They went
old time hockey with like racing.

221
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,220
They're on the same team.
They slammed into each other twice.

222
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,920
They don't even give a
fuck that it's a teammate.

223
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:06,480
This was like some sort of blood sport
that they were doing and everybody else

224
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,250
is out there like, oh my God,
that's my teammate. I need to,

225
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm really literally making fun of the
other teams for actually doing the smart

226
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,830
thing.
I loved that they did it.

227
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,230
I loved last year when Hamilton
and a fucking a Nicki Minaj,

228
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,450
whatever his fucking name was,
I can remember this fucking name.

229
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,284
What the Hell's guy's name?

230
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:24,990
Okay,

231
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,780
Nikki, I want it now. I'm
taking my toys and going home.

232
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,750
I'm getting married now.

233
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,760
Rosberg right Nico Rosberg that's what
it was when they slammed into each other.

234
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,480
They did that a couple of
times. I liked it. And He,

235
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,690
and I love how these fucking drivers,

236
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,320
there's all of this shit where they
don't like each other. This, you know,

237
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,460
like Sebastian Vettel
doesn't like Lewis Hamilton.

238
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,630
Kimi Raikkonen doesn't
like Valtteri Botox. It's,

239
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,820
it's literally his fucking days
of thunder. It's tremendous.

240
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,560
And a, this past week's
race was great. Uh,

241
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,380
yesterday as far as watching
a plant strong, getting, uh,

242
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,860
18 years old.

243
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,870
These lined up on the front row next to
Louis Hamilton who's just the fucking

244
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,780
greatest driver. He just is. He is.

245
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:16,730
I know Mercedes has the best fucking
cars right now, but you know,

246
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:21,280
give me a fucking break. It's not like
Ferrari's and sort of a slouch, right?

247
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,450
I Dunno. But you could argue that
Daniel Ricardo's just as good.

248
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:28,540
He's just not riding. Driving a car was
good. Maybe that's what the fuck it is.

249
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,231
I don't know what it is,

250
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:33,070
but I really enjoyed yesterday's
race and the previous one. Um,

251
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,930
how do you not love force India
out there with the pink cars?

252
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,630
The few Chicago's
slamming into each other.

253
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,350
It looked like me and my
brother at a fucking carnival.

254
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,030
How you'd be like those two guys are
related. Like you would know. We would,

255
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,980
if we got into bumper cars, we
would know. I didn't give a fuck

256
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,580
about anybody else out there other
than slamming into my own fucking

257
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,040
family member. What was the
point of hitting somebody else?

258
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,180
I couldn't laugh at them in the car
ride home. I'd never see him again. Um,

259
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,900
so anyways, I guess they go to
Singapore next one of these years.

260
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,150
I'm going to line up a standup
date with that race over there. Um,

261
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm going to try and go to a couple
of year cause I'm a fucking lunatic.

262
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,510
So I went to Montreal this year and I'm
also going to the race in, um, Austin,

263
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,890
Texas, um, provided
there's not another, uh,

264
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,010
you know, fucking hurricane like that
one that hit Houston. Jesus Christ.

265
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,280
Um,
anyways,

266
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,960
I actually knew I wanted to show
tweet out something. You guys,

267
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,990
there was actually something we could
send like fucking diapers and that type of

268
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,280
stuff for,
I can't just can't imagine it,

269
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:46,760
but that has babies and everything
he got to take care of. Um,

270
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,780
that seemed like a really cool
thing to do. The very least.

271
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:55,340
At least you can fucking
dope. So, uh, anyways, I'm
behind with my moto GP racing.

272
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,140
I got to get caught up on that. Um,
but I have to be, I'll be honest, this,

273
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:05,141
this race in Italy was one of my favorite
races just because of what was going

274
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:09,840
on in like position four, five and
six fucking lunatic racing. And, uh,

275
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,130
I just wish they could somehow
do something to the cars that,

276
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:17,480
that happened in the first and
second position because once again,

277
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,210
Lewis Hamilton,
you know,

278
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,290
he gets to the first corner first he comes
out in first place and then that's it.

279
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,420
He's in the front of the race
for the rest of the fucking race.

280
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,490
And then that's just it.
It's over.

281
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,450
He's driving in clean air is cars too
fucking fast now you got to hope that the

282
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:37,160
car breaks down or he fucks up,
which isn't going to happen. And um,

283
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,990
but I did enjoy all that other stuff,

284
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:41,930
but a congratulations to Lewis
Hamilton for winning. And another one,

285
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,150
he now is ahead of Sebastian Vettel and
I believe the Mercedes team as a team is

286
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:50,870
ahead of everybody else too. So
they're fucking crushing it. And a,

287
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,400
I think it's going to be
all downhill from here.

288
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:56,060
So I'm hoping the fucking Ferrari team
because they're the closest ones can step

289
00:16:56,061 --> 00:17:00,170
it up and a, I like both those
guys. I like Kimmy, Kimmy raking.

290
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,840
It always seems fucking pissed off.
Getting penalties and shit. Um,

291
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,240
I relate to the angry guy,
so that's why like for Cindy,

292
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,200
if they're going to fucking slam
into each other, it's tremendous.

293
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,330
It's tremendous. You know, it's childish.
It's stupid. I love when that guy,

294
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,600
the former race car fucking champion.
I don't know what his name is,

295
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,040
the commentator. He just goes, oh, da
boys boys. What are you doing Dave?

296
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,590
I've had baby gets all like
fucking parental with them.

297
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,020
I wanted to see,
I watched the qualifying too.

298
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,560
I love when it rains out dude.
Oh,

299
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,950
I forgot the greatest quote I've heard
since I started watching formula racing

300
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,150
after the fucking force India
cars hit for the second time.

301
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,950
I think it was that oak on guy.
He says over his radio, he,

302
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,520
stu is fucking

303
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,260
crew chief or whatever. He
goes, what the fuck? Seriously.

304
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,710
What the fuck? Like flip Amy while
he's going like 180 miles an hour.

305
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,300
He sounds like me when I drive to work
and he's doing like, you know, 180,

306
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:10,050
200 miles an hour and he's done a fucking
flip each other off and they never

307
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,890
flip each. It's, it's, you know, the
European and shit. They give the, hey,

308
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,440
we'll build the blue with the fucking
hand is got to flip somebody off.

309
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,540
You know what I mean?
Or if they're right on their ass,

310
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,350
slam on the breaks like you do on
the highway. Stop fucking tailgating.

311
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,520
I wasn't tailgate. Now is drafting.
All right, enough of this shit.

312
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,650
I know a lot of guys don't
go watch this shit, but um,

313
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,700
alright let's plow ahead here.
I uh,

314
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,490
I was um, did it casino, I
already forget the name of it.

315
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,120
Um, I was in a casino, uh,

316
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,100
right outside of San Diego and a,

317
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:51,940
I did it two years ago and I
flew down in our 44 and today.

318
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, yesterday I flew in a, uh,

319
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,220
I don't even know what the fuck
it was to be honest with you.

320
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,850
Let me see if I can look up
the name of this helicopter.

321
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:06,480
This helicopter is turbine engine,
which is a jet engine. And uh,

322
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,290
it was fucking on the whole
thing was hydraulic. Uh, fuck.

323
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,930
Who gives a fuck with what helicopter was.

324
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,540
So basically I trained
on the [inaudible] yard.

325
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,560
22 is like driving a car that has drum
brake, drum brakes, no power steering.

326
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,580
You know what I mean? And you have to
like fucking control the wipers yourself.

327
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:24,770
You know, like the 1920s,
like Laurel and hardy,

328
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:27,740
he got to like move it side to side.
Um,

329
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,040
which is also why I love that
thing because you're really flying.

330
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,090
If you're holding a hover, your fucking
doing it, then you move up to the hour 44.

331
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:39,050
And this is kind of weird
where it's like the uh,

332
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,120
the collective and the cyclic, uh, both
hydraulic. Okay. That's your, your power.

333
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:46,540
And then I,

334
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,790
you steer the shit you hold with
your hands basically and then you if,

335
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,430
but for whatever reason your foot
pedals are, are, are not hydraulic,

336
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:56,240
they just manual your own pressure.

337
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,540
So you're dealing with
like really finessing it,

338
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,020
barely having to touch it up top and
then your drum breaks down the bottom.

339
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:05,260
It's just,
it's a very odd feeling.

340
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:08,340
And I fly out of Burbank
and there's always a fucking
tailwind when you're going

341
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:12,820
in to set it down. It's so
fucking annoying. Like right
behind you. Full blast.

342
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:15,880
I don't know where it comes from.
Um,

343
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,260
every time. In fact, I saw this
student that was learning over there.

344
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,980
What he would do when he, when he
would go to set it down, he would just,

345
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,430
he would just face the wind and set
it down and then go inside and get the

346
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,510
wheels and then put them on the thing
and then just turn the helicopter around.

347
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,360
Uh, as much as it was funny, I was
like, that's a great fucking idea.

348
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,680
I would rather do that, you know, cause
you're landed next to other helicopters.

349
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,590
I don't want to fuck anybody
else's shit up. Sweating. He was,

350
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:47,260
this thing was like a,
was like a six seater

351
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,750
and a, I got a picture, you know, Dean
del Rey, go look them up on Twitter.

352
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,590
He's teed, tweeted out a picture, I'll
fucking, I'll retweet it. And it's like,

353
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:59,710
the word is, I'm standing in front of
the coolest helicopter I ever flew in.

354
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:03,490
I'm talking when somebody, whoever took
the picture. So I look like a fucking,

355
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,820
I may look like an asshole
anyways. Who's kidding? No. Um,

356
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,770
but it was,

357
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,240
I would say the most
amazing machine I've ever

358
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,770
gotten the chance to operate.
And it was like,

359
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,120
it was like a sports car in the air
with like the, like the tightest,

360
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:27,100
most responsive fucking suspension you
could possibly think of without the rough

361
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,100
ride because you're not on the ground,
you just going through the air.

362
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,180
It didn't feel any turbulence whatsoever.
And um,

363
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,640
I just know when you take off in the
yard 22 when you push the stick forward,

364
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,920
right? I mean, I don't know how
long it is. It's a good eight,

365
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:49,450
nine seconds until you want to get
up to 53 knots. That's the optimal,

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,313
you know,

367
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,720
speed to get out to get the most rate
of climb and it takes you a good,

368
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:58,960
I feels like forever eight, nine
seconds, this fucking thing.

369
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,070
It was like maybe two and a half seconds.

370
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,180
Then it was up to speed.

371
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:07,870
You just pull the stick back
and you fucking shot up in
the air. I've never been,

372
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,710
it was really intimidating, but once I
just sorta w I watched my instructor,

373
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,510
I've two times through the start and start
up and shut down of it and it's like,

374
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:20,980
it's, it's not that bad.
It's just intimidating at
first and, and then you get,

375
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,970
once you know where to look,
which is basically your manifold pressure,

376
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:28,960
your altitude and how fast you're going.
And then I'll see you trim once,

377
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,900
you know where those are, all the
other shit. It's just like, well,

378
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,780
you know a fucking horns going to go
off if there's a problem anywhere else.

379
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:38,110
Right.
Anyways,

380
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:41,860
it was fun as shit and he went
down and we did the GIG and I'm,

381
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,240
I think I'm going to start doing that.
Like I'm,

382
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,040
I'm doing a podcast festival for the
all things comedy network in the end of

383
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,920
October and if I don't get
this acting Gig and I'm in La,

384
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,790
I'm going to fly out in a helicopter.
I got to Vegas Gig,

385
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,550
I'm going to do that one in the
helicopter too. And that way I can get my,

386
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:05,470
keep my hours up, stay current and
a while going out, making money.

387
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,240
So I'm renting the helicopter, but
I'm earning money right. And in,

388
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,420
in a way I get the fly private without
having to blow all this money on a

389
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:17,320
fucking stupid ass jet,
which is stupid, right?

390
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,990
It was fucking private jets is fucking
stupid as hell you're getting in them.

391
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:26,080
You can't even stand up. It's the
dumbest thing ever. You're way better.

392
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You can spend one 90th the money on a
first class fucking ticket and you are in

393
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,810
a year on like a fucking cruise ship.
You can stand,

394
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:36,610
you can stand up when you take a piss.

395
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:40,000
You don't have to bend over
at the fucking neck, you know?

396
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,520
I know they make bigger jets, but
those things are like, you know you,

397
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,920
you're going to fly from Boston to Rhode.

398
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,370
It's going to cost you like a fucking
$300,000. I don't know how people,

399
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,970
I don't know anybody flies private to be
honest with you. I have no fucking idea.

400
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,000
Just go to a mom and pop airport.
Get on jet blue or virgin.

401
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,040
That's the way to do it. You some miles,
bump yourself up to a bigger seat.

402
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,210
You're going to get a pilot
who was psyched. He's making
a ton of fucking money.

403
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,170
You get on those little ones, those
that people and I'm making shit. Right.

404
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,900
I know that's been, that's been
my experience. They're trying to,

405
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,540
they're trying to get a gig flying one
of the bigger ones so they can actually

406
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:22,110
make money instead of flying
some little fucking six seater.

407
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,470
Yeah.

408
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,120
You know what it is?
I'm out of my fucking element.

409
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,320
I don't know what to
think about that shit.

410
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,490
I just have heard about how much it
fucking costs. Uh, all right, let me, uh,

411
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,000
let me read the, um, let
me read the fucking, uh,

412
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,740
advertising here for this week. Uh,
all right. Why don't we got here? Oh,

413
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:41,710
draft kings, everybody gay. Do
you like to gamble on sports?

414
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:44,260
You want to make some fucking money?
These are the guys.

415
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,920
It's not too late to get closer to the
game you love with draft kings one week

416
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:48,940
fantasy football.

417
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,280
This Sunday draft kings is
hosting a $100,000 pick, um,

418
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,060
contest that is totally free to enter.
All right,

419
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,300
pick them is the newest way to pull
play one week. Fantasy football.

420
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,400
Drafting your team is faster than ever.

421
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,340
Draftkings has organized
players into eight tears.

422
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:09,100
All you have to do is select
one player from each tier.

of which, the New England patriots,

434
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,790
the five times Superbowl
defending champions,

435
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,740
um,
the,

436
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,460
the off the often criticized for
absolutely no fucking reason.

437
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,003
You know,

438
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,810
all the time I had another guy bring up
fucking deflate gate. I always tell them,

439
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:18,090
it's like they did not get convicted
of deflating balls. You fucking moron.

440
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Yeah.

441
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,360
That was laughed out of court
for the 90000000th time.

442
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,920
And then the suspension
was, was, was canceled.

443
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,860
Remember that he was supposed to be
suspended and they took it to court and it

444
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:32,290
was laughed out of court. And
the judge said, you're waste.

445
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,960
Why did you waste my fucking time
with this? That's what happened.

446
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
And then you know,
the United States of America,

447
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:41,370
you cannot get tried twice
for the same offense.

448
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
That's a habeas hearsay

449
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,820
something or other, right? You can't be,
you can't be fucking double jeopardy.

450
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:51,390
You can't fucking do that.
So the NFL found a loophole.

451
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,110
They just went back to court and
said, uh, is the NFL Corporation?

452
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,170
And the judge was like,
yes. And then they said,

453
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:02,220
does a corporation had the
right to suspend its employee?
And the judge said yes.

454
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,100
And they said, fine, we're corporation.

455
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,060
Tom Brady is our employee and he is
suspended. And that's what they did.

456
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,620
That's why he got suspended. Not because
they proved anything. You fucking dopes.

457
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,040
And by the way, the guy will cut
the d, the alleged, by the way,

458
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,680
under inflated fucking ball.
By the way,

459
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,190
the cults also allegedly had 200
flaming balls. But who gives a fuck?

460
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:27,760
Then I went and all the championships,
right? The guy caught the ball,

461
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,740
tested positive for steroids
this past season. Ah, nobody
gives a shit. All right.

488

Somebody sat in a writer's

If the robot said Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi

What you might not know is that dollar
shave club also has products to pretty

565
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:02,000
much, uh, for pretty much everything
else you need in the bathroom. Body Wash,

566
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:05,240
shampoo, Hair Gel, lip balm,
everything at the store.

567
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,450
There are too many options and you can't
tell the difference between any of them.

568
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,560
It's overwhelming. You feel like Robin
Williams in Moscow on the Hudson,

569
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:15,890
right when he walks into the grocery
store and he fucking faints and he sticks

570
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:18,990
his head up that girls
dress. You remember that, um,

571
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,940
at the store that too many options.
You can't tell Azalea already said that.

All right.

574
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:29,990
usually can't fucking find them cause
they got a skeleton crew at nine in the

575
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:34,940
morning now. Um, then an implicit
not experts on the products.

Alright, there you go. All right.
Booze lineup. Oh, beautiful.

638
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,540
I was hoping people are going to
send these in. All right. I um,

639
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,160
I talked last week and you know, I get
back into baseball and, uh, Yankees,

640
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:38,590
red sox things heating up again.
We've been meet in the playoffs.

641
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:42,060
It's has to happen. It's
been too fucking long. Um,

642
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,320
I ended up fucking Yankees
took three out of four,

643
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,470
so I broke even all this shit talk and
all of this fucking shit talking and it

644
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,930
just, we ended up just being even, um,

645
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,050
but I was talking about, you
know, just watching baseball.

646
00:38:56,051 --> 00:39:00,970
I did my booze lineup of like whiskeys,
scotches, and bourbons. All right.

647
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,850
I don't just do scotches. Okay.
This isn't like the fucking,

648
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,960
this is an MLB when Babe Ruth
played. All right, this is Emmy.

649
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:12,430
Anybody could show up as long as you
brown now of Tequilas also welcome.

650
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,210
Um, so this would be my lineup.
Uh, I always changed the lineup.

651
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:19,660
I would say this week, uh, Johnny
Walker blue is leading off.

652
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,280
You've got to start with some strong shit,
right?

653
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:26,281
Pappy van Winkle is in
second and then I would put,

654
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,040
uh,
Angel's envy if Third

655
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,500
Mccallum rare casts.
Rare cask is bad and clean up.

656
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,590
All right? Then I'd have Yippy Kai, Yay.

657
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,643
Fifth.

658
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,830
And then once you get to the middle,
Lord,

659
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,320
this is just when I just want to get
fucked up. Right. Those other ones,

660
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:50,070
Angel's envy is also a good one
just to get fucked up on, you know,

661
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,030
it's not that expensive either.
Then you get to the middle of the order,

662
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:56,730
but it's like I'm staying at home and I'm
getting drunk by myself or I'm getting

663
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,220
drunk with a friend of mine that
it appreciates good whiskey,

664
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:02,820
bourbon or whatever. When I get in the
middle, then it's like Yippy Kai. Yay.

665
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,200
Patrones silver. Maybe I put grand
patrol where I put angel's envy.

666
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,400
That's why I got that.
Okay.

667
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:13,401
Grant Tron it fucking the
third spot denigrate yet BKI.

668
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:18,570
Yay. Then I got fucking angel's
envy and then Johnny Walker Black.

669
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,423
Okay.

670
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,400
Those are the next three. So then he got
eight and nine, and that's when you know,

671
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,350
you just have fucking,

672
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,313
yeah,

673
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,850
just people coming over and they just
want to get shit faced and you just got to

674
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,190
go maker's mark of
fucking, uh, Jack Daniels,

675
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,220
you know? And then if you just
have a complete fucking shithead,

676
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,230
do you just give him bread label?
Fucking Johnny Walker. All right,

677
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,020
so here's this person's booze
lineup. All right? He goes,

678
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:49,620
I love your idea about doing a
booze alcohol battling line up.

679
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:54,420
Here's my submission leading off
Kentucky Tavern. I'd never heard of this.

680
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:58,170
This is what I love is going to
give me new shit to try. Dependable,

681
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,330
a little rough around the edges,
but you know,

682
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:02,730
this guy's going to get
on base at a 400 clip,

683
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,090
even if he has to lean into one
every now and then. I loved it.

684
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:09,240
This person broke it all down.
They'd give me a scouting reports too.

685
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:12,930
When you send these in
batting second core needles,

686
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,750
what the fuck is that? Horn. Ito's uh,

687
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,220
can be streaky at times but
still has a little bit of a pop.

688
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,120
If you mix it with grapefruit soda
to Jersey and your second guy,

689
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:28,710
you're already mixing it with something.
All right. Oh Shit. Hang on a second.

690
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:33,530
Speaking of that,
some Josh just asked me if I had soda.

691
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,040
No I don't.
I got to do a voice text here.

692
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,260
Get the Phanta orange
with the Mexican sugar.

693
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,440
There you go. All right. That's
right when I'm fucking not boozing.

694
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,010
I actually drink Phanta orange soda.
It's kind of nice cause it's really sweet.

695
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,320
And then he got the smoke.
You know, it's not redundant.

696
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,950
Remember big night when that lady got the
pasta and then she also ordered mashed

697
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:06,700
potatoes and the guy wouldn't do it
cause it was two starches. You know,

698
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,040
why would you have a cigar and
then drink something really PD.

699
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:13,540
It's like fucking redundant. You want
some, a sweet kind of alcohol? I'm

700
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,570
fucking with you. I'm not actually
I do. Okay. So batting third,

701
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:22,750
this guy has bullet,
this is your franchise player.

702
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:25,030
He makes everyone around
him a little better place.

703
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:26,530
He's going to give you a team friendly,

704
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:30,280
longterm contract that won't
have you paying luxury taxes.

705
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,030
Do this guy's great. You know, we took
a funny idea. Now he's taken it to,

706
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:36,660
we didn't even funnier level.
All I did was just get,

707
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,260
I got to break down each player now.
Alright, batting cleanup, Knob Creek.

708
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,010
He goes, can you tell him a bourbon
drinker? I can never keep them straight.

709
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,000
He goes, bottom line is if there's
any ducks slept on the pond,

710
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,900
this guy is there to deliver it in
the knockout punch. I got to tell you,

711
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:55,690
the way he's describing this lineup,
he's definitely making the playoffs,

712
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,100
if not fucking winning the pennant.

713
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,120
A batting fifth Smirnoff vodka.

714
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,970
Okay.
Definitely nothing to write home about,

715
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,020
but when surrounded with
the right personnel, there's
always potential for magic.

716
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,470
You know what my vodka is? My go to
vodka. I like Belvedere, old Belvedere,

717
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:18,290
I've come here, boy, I liked that better
than grey goose. Grey goose is just like,

718
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,940
that's like soft rock, like
easy listening. You know what
I mean? I like Belvedere.

719
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,470
It's got a little more
of a fucking bite to it.

720
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:29,210
But I don't know much about because either
a batting six, Johnnie Walker black.

721
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,810
Now you might be, uh, now might be a
good time dimension. I'm in my early 30.

722
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:37,820
[inaudible] thank you.
As this guy is a September call up,

723
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,540
you're not quite ready to add them
to your 40 man roster just yet,

724
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,810
but he's for a cup of buddies
up for a cup of coffee.

725
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:47,900
But cause you know he's going to be an
important part of your future. Yeah.

726
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:51,350
Maybe can get on base and steal
second. All right. Batting seventh.

727
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,160
Oh Jesus do this is unforgivable.
If you're in your thirties,

728
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,420
this is unforgivable and I respect you
that you can still drink this Yeager or

729
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:02,960
meister. Wow. Wow.

730
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,580
You often find yourself wondering why
this guy is even still around and yet you

731
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:11,000
feel you can you wait and yet you can,

732
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,620
you feel like you can remember a time
when he was actually pretty good. Yeah.

733
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,600
He's like the fucking, uh, one
of those guys we had just like,

734
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:24,260
you know, like Vince Carter is still
play. That's not fair to Vince Carter.

735
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:28,790
Cause Vince Carter was one of
the greatest fucking, you know,

736
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,040
I think the best dunker
of all fucking time.

737
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,780
High of certainly the highest jumper.
I Apologize,

738
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:37,620
I shouldn't have said Vince Carter was
the first guy thought of ease, like a, uh,

739
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,080
uh,
up.

740
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,490
Do you remember when like GRB was
playing on the Colorado Rockies?

741
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,440
It's like one of those deals. All
right, Captain Morgan batting eighth,

742
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,130
definitely a role player. This,
this, that's like your catcher.

743
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,080
This guy could be a superstar,

744
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:58,110
but he's got a bit of a sweet tooth
and always shows up to spring training,

745
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:01,500
20 pounds overweight, always
the panda still, you know,

746
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:04,950
he's good for a sac fly and
a key situation. Yeah. One
of these guys just has to,

747
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:08,260
you're out there for defense, you know,
he's not hitting for average. Alright.

748
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,090
Batting ninth, wild
Turkey, American honey.

749
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,060
And he writes old geezers.
Uh,

750
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,450
you ask him to lay down a bunt and you
just know he's going to hit into an

751
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:22,350
inning ending double play every
damn time. Uh, by the way, if it's,

752
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,030
if it's a close one,

753
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,860
I'm putting in buffalo trace in place
of Jaeger as a defensive substitution.

754
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:32,430
Do this guy's brilliant. Uh, so
that's my lineup. Thanks for the idea.

755
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:35,100
I enjoyed putting this together.
Even if you don't read it now, Dude,

756
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,420
I love that you broke it all down. All
right, here's another guys line up.

757
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,350
All right. His whiskey lineup,
bullet, Eagle, rare batting,

758
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:47,790
third macallan 12 batting
forth angel's envy,

759
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,820
cask strength.
I never had that.

760
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:53,940
D h a I might fuck up some
of the names of these.

761
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:54,930
Yeah.

762
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,830
Uh, Bell Bell Veni 12 years. Single Malt.

763
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:04,840
Glen Levitt, French Oak. I can't deal
with the florals. I don't like the floors.

764
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:08,470
I like more of the PD thing. Like Glenn
Leberts. I never been able to, uh,

765
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,230
quite handles,
but I respect them.

766
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,970
They are definitely in the
hall of fame of boots. Um,

767
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:24,020
oh fuck. He's going to stop by a Taco. Oh,

768
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,270
Jesus Christ. What is he
talking about? No, fuck.

769
00:46:26,271 --> 00:46:31,050
He's going to start by a taco truck to
get the fucking booze. The Soto. I mean,

770
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,940
hang on, let me hit pause and straighten
this up. All right, I'm back. So anyways,

771
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,260
uh, Glen Levitt, French
oak, six number seven,

772
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:45,250
Willie Pot, still reserve. Never
heard of that one. Number eight,

773
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:49,240
Jefferson's ocean aged at sea.
Jesus.

774
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,760
Sounds like low tide shit to me.
Number nine,

775
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,390
Hudson Bay starting pitcher is blends.

776
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:59,620
I've got to do a starting
pitcher. Middle Reliever, uh,

777
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,310
giving you a row or
reliable couple innings.

778
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:07,960
Maker's 46 closer is
Alijah Craig barrel proof.

779
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,720
Dude, I love everybody going
with the starting pitchers.

780
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,690
Then you got to have your
middle [inaudible]. You had
middle relief. Oh my God,

781
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:18,690
Dude. This is, this is endless.
And then you don't see,

782
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:22,390
you're going to get some real big
time. Booze Hound. Step nine, you know,

783
00:47:22,391 --> 00:47:25,000
positions in the batting lineup
are not going to be enough.

784
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:28,750
They're going to have to go
take enough to like, I dunno,

785
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,470
do like a football team.
11 offensive players.

786
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,020
This isn't fair to people over in Europe.
Go ahead,

787
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:38,800
give me your fucking lineups and use
all the fucking soccer terminology.

788
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:42,760
Maybe I'll learn something. All right
is another nut. Last booze line up here.

789
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,880
Dear Billy, no fun, no fuss, no Muss,

790
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:49,780
no brainer in answer to your request
for our batting lineups of booze.

791
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,220
I'm not much of a drinker anymore,

792
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:55,270
so I'll go the other way and
do my recreational drug lineup.

793
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,650
I love it. I love it. You guys had
taken this idea and run with it.

794
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:02,110
This is tremendous. All right. Number one,

795
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,830
weed number two,
black hash,

796
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,570
preferably from Naipaul.
Number three, magic mushrooms.

797
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,650
Batting cleanup, LSD, preferably purple.

798
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:18,280
Owsley never tried it,
but according to Ken Casey,

799
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,540
it was the best number five
x to see pure and uncut.

800
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,220
Number six have mine. I don't want
it. This number. Seven cocaine,

801
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:30,970
pure and uncut. Cocaine. Pure and
up unconscious should be fucking.

802
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,280
That sounds like a speedster,
man.

803
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:37,390
Get them on base to fucking
steal second and you have LSD.

804
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:41,830
Fucking bring them home with
a single to right. I Dunno.

805
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,200
Running on a full count.
You're not going to catch that guy.

806
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,380
He might score from first. All
right, number eight, peyote.

807
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:51,970
Payoti number nine
Mescalin pure and uncut.

808
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,500
Hey Bill on Thursday, you were talking
about the sound of drums in the 70s.

809
00:48:56,501 --> 00:49:00,610
I watched this recently and thought it
would be informative to you over overhead

810
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:05,140
Mike with a compressor on it. Um, you guys
have to watch this. If you're in, into

811
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,850
any type of music.
I actually watched this thing and it's,

812
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,260
do you know that sound
of a Phil Collins Drums,

813
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:17,290
the famous drum fill from
in the air tonight that Gaga
Goenka going good, don't,

814
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,300
don't, don't. And it was,
you got to watch this video,

815
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:24,770
how they came up with that drum sound was
an accident and then everybody used it

816
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:27,950
and it literally became the sound
of the eighties and now it's back.

817
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,820
I guess Taylor swift used it in
some song called 1989 and all that.

818
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:36,410
But if you just,
if you're into that nerdy audio stuff,

819
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,470
like I find this is how great my
fucking drunk teacher Davey Lich is.

820
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,800
I, I was tuning up my, my drums, you know,

821
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:50,270
I got some back east and it says
old Slingerland kit and it's, uh,

822
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,430
a third, uh, 12, no, a nine by 13, 14,

823
00:49:55,431 --> 00:49:57,470
and an 18. It was 13, 14,

824
00:49:57,471 --> 00:50:01,370
Tom's and then an 18 inch
floor and a 24 inch kick.

825
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,370
And I ended up adding
another s I found, uh, uh,

826
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:09,170
from the same era of 16 inch floor Tom.
And then I added another bass drum,

827
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,540
so I got to 24. So, all right,

828
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,300
this is my first attempt to get to try
to get away from just aping and doing a

829
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:19,160
bad job of everything John Bonham did.

830
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,510
I was getting into Primus and my brothers,

831
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:26,000
they were playing like speed metal and
shit and they were trying to always

832
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:28,580
trying to get me into Metallica,
slayer and all them. And I just,

833
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,000
I just was too much of a fucking idiot
to realize how great that music was.

834
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:36,350
And I could've seen all those bands on
their first tours and I didn't do it. Um,

835
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,120
so anyways,
uh,

836
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,300
I went home and I was
tuning up the bass drum and

837
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,550
I just couldn't get a good fucking sound
and it was this weird like vibrating

838
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:51,240
fucking sound or whatever.

839
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:56,340
And I text my teacher, I said,
yeah, I'm getting this weird,

840
00:50:56,341 --> 00:51:00,060
like a buzzer or a rattle. And he said,
is there a hole in the front head?

841
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:05,100
And I was like, this guy is a
fucking genius, fucking genius.

842
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:07,290
Cause what happened is there
wasn't a hole in the front head,

843
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,670
but where they were, something fell on it
and puncture just the littlest of hole.

844
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,590
I said it was a tiny little,
it goes,

845
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:16,710
that would be enough to fuck it up
cause I couldn't get that boom sound.

846
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,250
And um, so now I'm like
obsessing about it. I gotta get,

847
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,690
I gotta get back east again. I want
to try tuning them up again. And um,

848
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,970
I've now become obsessed
with like different heads.

849
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:32,110
And I used to be so afraid
to try and tune my drums.

850
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:34,450
I'd have somebody else do it and
then I just wouldn't touch him.

851
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,310
And I played him until they sucked again.

852
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:38,880
And then I hope I could find
somebody else rather than,

853
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:40,390
than just biting the
bullet and being like,

854
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:44,020
just take out your drum key and start
fucking with it and ask people who know

855
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:47,560
how to do it to teach you how to do it
and keep fucking doing it. You asshole.

856
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,400
Well, you know, part of it being an
asshole as you don't do shit like that.

857
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,060
All right. Pocalypse hey
there, dilly dilly. Hey there,

858
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:01,160
Billy death bell.
Uh,

859
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:05,570
the Internet keeps talking about the
end of times as if things today are far

860
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:08,450
worse than they've ever been.
I'm only 31 years old,

861
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:12,380
but I seem to remember plenty of
bad weather and shitty presidents.

862
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,950
MMM.

863
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,150
There's this need to make everything
sound worse than it is these days because

864
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:24,380
everyone loves to be the bearer of
bad news and they get a thrill off the

865
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:28,100
excitement that shit may
be going south real quick,

866
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:33,170
I saw a quote by John Mayer on Twitter.
Someone asked him what annoys him?

867
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:37,010
And he says,
spacious argument.

868
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,930
It's everywhere. I can't stand
it. Is that I say that right?

869
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,710
The Fed is eight.

870
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,790
The Federation of Defense
Attorney logic gone mainstream.

871
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,600
Ugh. Well he's obviously a smarter person
than me cause I don't want any of that

872
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:56,760
means spacious argument.
It's everywhere.

873
00:52:56,761 --> 00:53:00,810
I can't stand at the Federation of
Defense Attorney logic gone mainstream.

874
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,340
That right there is why he's a brilliant
guitars because I don't know what the

875
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:08,540
fuck he just did,
but I don't,

876
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,910
I don't know that anybody's ever
put words together like that.

877
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,820
I don't know what that
means. Uh, I totally agree.

878
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:17,060
Everyone thinks they're dropping the mic
and they're just pandering and reaching

879
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:19,700
for low hanging fruit now
that, that I agree with. Yes.

880
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,350
A PS keep the nineties music coming.

881
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:26,310
That Fiona Apple Song that Andrew
used last week reminded of the summer

882
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:30,060
I started jerking off save
the pet store manager from,

883
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,590
from last week. I don't know what that
means. Yeah. Andrew picks the music.

884
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:39,180
I wish I was could claim a that I was
as cool as to know all this shit that he

885
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:43,710
does. He knows a bunch
about music. Um, yeah,

886
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:44,581
there is a lot of that.

887
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,450
There's a lot of gloom and doom and all
that type of shit. But, uh, you know,

888
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,810
it's not all it is. I, you know,

889
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,740
the Great Barrier Reef and all that
type of shit is pretty terrifying. Oh,

890
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:02,190
that shit is pretty fucking
terrifying. And, uh, I mean,

891
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:05,410
I can't even focus on it if you
actually get past all the dope.

892
00:54:05,411 --> 00:54:09,330
So on social media talking about things
and you actually listened to scientists

893
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:14,100
talking about like whatever
their predictions are. Um,

894
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,120
I know that there's, I don't know,
this sounds like a, you know,

895
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,400
I think it's going to be a, I
know, it should be interesting.

896
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,780
We'll see. I hope that wrong.
You know, who the fuck knows?
I don't know. All right.

897
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:30,590
The DNC,
everybody day or Mr. Byrd,

898
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,440
I'm appalled and disgusted
that you had the Addis,

899
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,560
a Udacity to speak poorly
of Debbie Shults Wasserman,

900
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:42,760
a lifelong servant of her
country and the only party, uh,

901
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,440
that has moved this country forward.
I usually enjoy your brand of humor.

902
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:50,340
There's no way this person's series,
I've see,

903
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,300
I have see parts of your comedy specials
and overheard a handful of episodes of

904
00:54:57,031 --> 00:55:00,690
your podcast while in the
proxy of my brother in law.

905
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,840
Uh,
you sir,

906
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,530
have a responsibility to tell the truth
and not just your uninformed opinions on

907
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:08,370
politics.

908
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,140
The deceit that you distribute is
going to aid in the dismantling of this

909
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:17,730
country. Oh God. Oh God.
Give me a fucking break.

910
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,520
You just happened to be walking by
and you heard that he, well, you know,

911
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,190
the whole part of this podcast
is that I am uninformed.

912
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,800
MMM.

913
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,400
And I sent a link that you could watch
on Youtube and listen to that lawyer

914
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:32,234
discussing,

915
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,760
okay.

916
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,430
The things that she did or didn't do.

917
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,000
So I don't know what you fucking problem
is. You know, I talk about politics.

918
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:43,300
The way I talk about sports is someone
who never did it at a professional level.

919
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,810
I, Matt Schiltz Wasserman,
a few years back,

920
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:50,890
and I asked her what we could do every
day to change the nation for the better.

921
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,750
And she eloquently said,

922
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,000
do not let them tell you how to feel.
Oh God.

923
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,070
All right. I'm not reading the
rest of this. This is fucking

924
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:04,460
sincerely a proud Democrat
who will not be discouraged.

925
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:08,180
You know what you sound like.
You sound like someone, you know,

926
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:11,960
when someone comes up to me and says the
Patriots are cheaters and then I say,

927
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:12,980
who's your team?

928
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,150
And then I talk about the shit that
they've done and then they downplay that.

929
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:21,560
Yeah, you are. I gotta be honest
with you is uninformed as I am.

930
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,070
Um, people like you, I can't

931
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:29,070
even talk to because you're so lost in
your blue ties that you can't see that

932
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,650
it's this,
you know what it's like

933
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:39,150
everybody out here in Hollywood loves
to sit there and Trash Fox News and talk

934
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:42,490
about how they're all these bullies and
all that. And I'm going to tell you,

935
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,720
I'm not gonna name any fucking names,
but the amount of performers,

936
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,840
comedians, actresses, and
all this type of shit,

937
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,450
like their level of zero tolerance.
Like there,

938
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,130
they are literally what they're fighting,
they're bullies.

939
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:02,440
They tell people how they're supposed to
think the way they're supposed to think.

940
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:04,690
And they feel that they are 100% right.

941
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,260
They feel that their view of the world
is the way that the world should be.

942
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,170
And anyone who doesn't think
that needs to be attacked,

943
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:15,220
it needs to be dragged on stage and
humiliated needs to have their, their,

944
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:17,920
their ability to earn a living attacked.

945
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,300
It's no difference than when you watched
what Fox News did, did the Dixie chicks,

946
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:26,320
it's the exact same fucking thing,
the exact same level of righteousness,

947
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,240
patting themselves on the back about how
fucking smart they are and how informed

948
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,800
they are,
you know,

949
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:38,170
meanwhile as they fly around and fucking
private jets, give me a fucking break.

950
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,210
Give me a fucking break.
Okay.

951
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,403
You know

952
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,520
the Patriots Cheat your team, Cheech.
The Republican's are pieces of shit.

953
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,560
The Democrats are pieces of shit.

954
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,010
Alright, there you go. There you go.

955
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,200
So it,
other than anything other than that,

956
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:01,000
you're looking at shit through
fucking rose colored glasses. And um,

957
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,270
I think it's,
I think that that is a,

958
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,920
I don't know what to think. I just, I
can't have a conversation with that.

959
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,610
You know what I mean?

960
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,030
It's like if I listen to a red sox fan
back when Derek Jeter was playing and

961
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,840
they just say that he sucks and he's
fucking overrated and blah, blah,

962
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,130
and I would just sit there and be
like that he is, and he's fucking one,

963
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:22,420
one of the greatest players of all time.
I'd love if he was on my team, you know,

964
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:25,870
I hate the Yankees, but I, I'm
not going to hate on greatness.

965
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,010
Okay.

966
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,410
Mariano Rivera is the greatest
fucking closer of all time.

967
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,790
I still fucking hate the Yankees,

968
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:33,460
but I don't hate him to
a level that I can't see.

969
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:40,140
I can't see that. You know
what I mean? I just don't,

970
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,050
I just don't fucking understand it.
I don't understand it.

971
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:45,870
Like you want to talk about spygate and
the Patriots were guilty of cheating to

972
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:49,260
Flight Cape was bullshit.
Spygate was true. However,

973
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,870
they were only guilty of
doing it for one game.

974
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:53,880
And I only clarify that
because everybody thinks, well,

975
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:56,490
they should take away all their titles
because that's what they were doing. No,

976
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,780
that was the first game. It was illegal
and they kept fucking doing it. All right,

977
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:05,010
and they will 100% guilty and they deserve
to be fucking fine because they were

978
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:07,410
cheating then. Yes,
they were that one time.

979
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,800
All the other stuff was bullshit though.
However, if they, cause I'm a wanting to,

980
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,100
flaka came out, I was like,
if they did this shit again,

981
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,850
I'm done with this fucking team.
That's what I said.

982
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:20,950
And then I watched the whole fucking
thing unfold and I was like, oh,

983
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,950
this was just bullshit.

984
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:24,803
So there you go.

985
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,720
Does that sound evenhanded you guys
probably think I'm too much of a patriots

986
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:31,710
fan, but I mean I did it. They spygate
was cheating and they were guilty.

987
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,820
They did it one game.
Raymond Janie fucking ratted them out.

988
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,570
Then that was it. They will fucking
guilty. What are you going to do?

989
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,500
Does that make them worse than anybody
else? No. Bill Walsh fucking cheated.

990
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,210
So there you go.
They should,

991
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:52,050
Democrats and the Republicans say the
Patriots of Democrats. I'm a patriots fan,

992
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:54,630
so I am a democrat. Okay.
But I can see their fucking,

993
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,610
I can see that spygate was fucking
cheating and they were guilty of it.

994
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:04,150
And I could also see that Bill Walsh
fucking did the same thing when he

995
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:08,710
pretended his fucking headsets went up.
It's not that fucking hard.

996
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,420
Um, I don't understand what your
point is that the, Oh my God,

997
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:15,800
this person that used to fuck
you meeting proves, you know,

998
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,290
they see what should we do?
Easy.

999
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,500
Don't let them capital's tell you
how to feel that is such like,

1000
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,330
that is going to be the most vague.

1001
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,650
I'm on my way to my town car
fucking horseshit response ever.

1002
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,950
Hey Bill.
Uh,

1003
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:38,430
what's your secret to being as
successful standup comedian?

1004
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:43,020
Uh, you know, just get out
there and keep doing it, man.

1005
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,450
All right,
girlfriend won't take racist last name.

1006
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,590
All right, dear bills burry. Doughboy
Hey, fuck you man. I'm under one 80. Okay,

1007
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:58,920
go easy. Go easy. You know. All right,

1008
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,170
dear bill's very doughboy.
Uh,

1009
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:05,550
my girlfriend of three years has
made it very clear that if we were,

1010
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:09,420
if I were to propose to her that
she would not take my last name.

1011
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,230
The reason being is that she
feels my last name is racist.

1012
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:17,760
The name is coons, spelled c. O. N. S.

1013
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,650
I told her that I have never encountered
a problem having this last name and she

1014
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:25,590
has nothing to worry about.
Thoughts. Yeah. Here's my thoughts.

1015
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:29,340
I think you're making this
up and if you're not, um,

1016
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:33,030
that woman is too dumb to
Mary and reproduce with.

1017
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,370
All right.

1018
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,120
If you call a black person
a coon that is racist,

1019
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:44,060
if you're last name is coons,
it isn't,

1020
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,890
you know, look, I see. If your last
name was the n word, then yeah. I mean,

1021
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:53,190
maybe you want to, you know, yeah. I mean,

1022
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,660
if it's, I don't know. I mean, if
that's your fucking last thing,

1023
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:58,690
I think that's a believable last name,
isn't it?

1024
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,953
You know what I mean?

1025
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:07,590
I Dunno. Anyways, my roommate is, you
know, I like, I'm trying to think,

1026
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:11,130
I'm trying to think of a fucking racial
group I can do here without getting in

1027
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:12,960
trouble.
Cause I want to really do a fucking,

1028
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,630
I guess I'd have to go against my own,

1029
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,500
my own fucking racist

1030
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,340
or would I do if there's no good ones,

1031
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,670
there is no good ones with white people
cause like it doesn't have an effect on

1032
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:27,504
us.

1033
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:28,650
Okay.

1034
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,540
Yeah. Shit. You know what
I mean? I don't know.

1035
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,180
Maybe in the future of some other group
takes over and then we'll have that.

1036
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:37,880
We'll have our, you know, you
can't call me cracker. Um,

1037
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,210
I love crackers. I love putting cheese
on. My roommate is a fucking Weirdo,

1038
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,390
dear conti. Mcconn fuck. First of all,

1039
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,460
a big fan of the fucking podcast,

1040
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:50,490
the last fucking Netflix special
was phenomenal. So thanks. Okay.

1041
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,470
Now this is one of these
people that thinks,

1042
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,300
because I swear that
now they have to swear.

1043
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:57,090
You don't have to bring yourself
down to my level, sir. Anyways,

1044
01:02:57,091 --> 01:03:01,880
I just fucking moved into college as a
freshman roommate is a hot motherfucker.

1045
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,190
I mean, I'm gay. So right
away I was into him,

1046
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:09,570
but I kept to myself since I had
no way of knowing he was gay too.

1047
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,080
I thought you guys had Gaydar
you couldn't sense it. Um,

1048
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,310
so last week on Friday after
a fucking drunken night out,

1049
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:20,010
we returned to our room.
Oh Geez. Here we go.

1050
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,400
And the fucking guy
offhandedly tells me he's gay.

1051
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,580
Once the conversation started
getting more personal,

1052
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:31,820
then I told them I'm also
gay and this guy says fag,

1053
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,570
I don't think this is real.
After which we proceeded to fuck,

1054
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:39,510
which was fucking amazing.
By the way. I find the term,

1055
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:43,860
I find the fag term and Deering so
fuck all the political correctness,

1056
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:48,820
hysteria by gays and non gaze alike
are,

1057
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,700
I'm just going to read
this. Okay. Anyways,

1058
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:54,690
this is when the shit started to hit
the fan. No Pun intended. Sorry Dude.

1059
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:57,330
You lobbed it over the fucking net.
Um,

1060
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:01,520
once I came he expressed disappointment
at the volume of my comp.

1061
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,330
Does anyone believe this is true? The
fucker literally said, that's it. What?

1062
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:10,140
Are you sick or something?
I felt fucking inadequate sense.

1063
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:13,500
His load was considered
really bigger than mine.

1064
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:19,950
Oh Jesus Christ. So then the next
morning he says he wants to fuck again.

1065
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:24,240
I go along with it like, he's
so hot, I'm not going to refuse.

1066
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:28,260
Halfway through this motherfucker
says, you know, for a tall guy,

1067
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:33,240
you sure have a small Dick. And he
writes like, walk the fuck. Yeah.

1068
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:36,540
Well Dude, you came back for more
abuse here. So I'm all for two, right?

1069
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:40,770
Inadequate Dick size check,
lack of Herculean cum shot check,

1070
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,700
uh,
is insulting the people.

1071
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,620
He fucks part of his style.

1072
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,390
Like I can't figure out why
he still wants to fuck me.

1073
01:04:49,391 --> 01:04:53,100
You have to two colossal fucking insults.
So what the fuck do I do next?

1074
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:54,180
So stop fucking the guy.

1075
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:01,140
Fuck knows. But the next day
we're chugging peers in our room,

1076
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:08,070
you know, other than the gay sex,
this sounds amazing that, sorry,

1077
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,780
I'm looking at this as a straight guy.
Um,

1078
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:17,410
what the fuck am I? Uh, okay,
we're chugging beers. Roman.

1079
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:19,870
He suggests something beyond weird.
Oh God.

1080
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:24,220
He's basically tells me He wants
me to pee in his mouth. You know,

1081
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,280
even if this is fake, this is tremendous.
See Korean if you got to give this up,

1082
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:30,010
okay. Since it turns him,
since it turns a mom, um,

1083
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,760
eight beers deep and I'm a lightweight,
so I'm like fuck it dude.

1084
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:36,850
I swear to God if this is true and you
piss in this guy's mouth and he's like,

1085
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,080
oh awesome. Well that's it.
This motherfucker has a stream,

1086
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:45,040
like a God damn fire hose and
nearly broke my jaw and the process.

1087
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,303
What?

1088
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,080
I don't believe that Jesus Christ.

1089
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:53,790
So I'm completely weirded out
by this colossal cont dude.

1090
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,420
You let them piss in your mouth.

1091
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,510
His only saving grace is that he happens
to be the hottest guy I ever met.

1092
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:03,880
So bill, what the fuck do
I do? Do I change from,

1093
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:09,180
kicked this con to the curb and sleep
I never sleep with again or do I stick

1094
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:14,560
stick in there so that I can
stick it in there. Thanks.

1095
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:16,390
And Go fuck yourself.
You Mcgee Bitch.

1096
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:18,480
Okay.

1097
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,640
I Dunno.
It sounds like you feel bad afterwards.

1098
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:25,150
If I was with a woman and she was doing
this shit to me and she was really hot,

1099
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,870
yeah, I'd probably keep going back, but I
would just get myself mentally prepared.

1100
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,960
You know what you might do?
Just telling me as a weird ass hole.

1101
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,220
Okay.

1102
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,690
You got to get in his head.

1103
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,920
Tell her mama is acids to Harry. He
needs to braid the hair on his ass. Who?

1104
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,180
I don't know what the fuck to tell. I
mean, I know you're outside, you know,

1105
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:49,570
this is still basically human interaction.
So you're talking about feelings here.

1106
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,900
So do you want to get childish
to say something mean to him?

1107
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,570
Okay.

1108
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,340
And uh,
I don't know.

1109
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:59,730
You know what's weird is Josh just showed
up and now I have to smoke a cigar.

1110
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:03,600
I have to read that shit. Yeah, dude,

1111
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:06,150
don't fucking go back. Don't
go back for more. Right.

1112
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:11,000
Or if you're going to go back for
more, um, sorry, I'm texting her. Hey,

1113
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:12,260
hang on.

1114
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:12,810
Yeah.

1115
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:15,800
All right. Uh, yeah, you don't
need to put up with that shit.

1116
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:20,780
Everything's like a pun in this.
Um,

1117
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,750
the weird thing is that
you live with the guy.

1118
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:30,500
It's never good to fuck your roommate.
You know,

1119
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,840
it's debts that's never
going to be a good thing.

1120
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:36,260
But I don't know how it works with
gay guys because you both guys, right?

1121
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,240
So I would think you'd be able to just
be like, yeah, we're just fucking right.

1122
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:44,630
Then we'll watch a game and fucking
drink some beers and I'll fucking piss in

1123
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:46,520
your mouth. Evidently. I
guess that's how it goes down.

1124
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,110
I don't know what the fuck
happens here. So I would just, uh,

1125
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,370
if he sincerely is making you feel bad,
then I would,

1126
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:55,820
I would try to find a better guy.
Um,

1127
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,890
but considering you live with them, you
obviously get, you see consigned Kiki,

1128
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:03,770
you can just blow the guy off. So at some
point he's going to be like, hey man,

1129
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:08,220
you want to fuck? You got to be
like, Nah, I don't be like, why not?

1130
01:08:08,221 --> 01:08:12,770
It'd be okay cause you're a dick. You
say mean shit to me and I don't like it.

1131
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:14,243
All right,

1132
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,650
so why don't you in there and go rub one
out and piss in your own fucking mouth?

1133
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:22,590
You fucking Dosha or you just move up.
All right,

1134
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,730
that's a podcast. Everybody, God
bless each and every one of you.

1135
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,120
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
