1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,280
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,930
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast from Monday. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,930
[inaudible] 11th,
2019 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:14,260
How I yeah. Oh, how you doing?

5
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:18,850
I'm in a great mood despite the fact
that I missed that fucking the first moto

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:22,290
GP race of the, of the year. Uh,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,300
I found out direct TV isn't,

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,090
doesn't have it on fucking
television anymore out here,

9
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:32,530
which was very disappointing
to me. You know, I couldn't
find it. I was scampering.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,790
I woke up in a sweat gold. Wait a minute.
Wait. It says f one stock today. I know.

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:41,260
Thought ducks today. Ha Ha. Going
to miss it. Right? Freaking out.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,550
OCD. Fucking 20 God damn
racist. God forbid you miss one.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,120
So I look up f one that doesn't start
til next week down in Australia.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,010
Okay.
I already have that recorded.

15
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:57,940
That's easy because that got picked
up by ESPN. So I'm like, all right.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,390
Where the fuck's the Moto GP?
I have direct TV. All right.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,240
I'm not trying to talk down to
all you people. That's right.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,760
I can still afford to pay for cable.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,930
That's how fucking hard I am.
Crushing it

20
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,340
out here in these streets. All
you fucking cord cutters, Huh?

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,440
Just backing yourself into a
fucking entertainment corner.

22
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:25,090
Just sitting there with your apps and
your little Netflix fucking subscription.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,590
That's your world, Huh?
What are you going to do?

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,850
Watch every episode of Narcos and then
some stupid documentary to try and

25
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:37,900
impress your friends,
you what you, you need.

26
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:42,520
You need those 700 fucking channels
that they have 300 of which are radio

27
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:47,500
stations.
What are you walking away from?

28
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:51,280
Millennials? What are you afraid
of? They're all proud of it too,

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,710
because when I couldn't
find it on direct TV,

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,910
I went onto the Twitter and very nicely,

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,460
dare I say eloquently, I just put out
to the Twitter sphere. I said, hey,

32
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:08,380
does anybody know what channel the
Moto GP is on? On? On direct TV. Okay.

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,350
And Oh,
oh good.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,200
The cons come out of the woodwork.
Jesus Christ.

35
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,330
You would've thought I put a fucking
piece of cheese down in a bun.

36
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,970
All the fucking little ratchet
that came running out, right?

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,260
Durant's even eat cheese.
Don't they can eat anything.

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,260
You know what I mean? Like if you just
put like a severed finger in a mousetrap,

39
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,060
wouldn't have fucking rat eventually come
up and try and eat the fucking thing.

40
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:37,530
I mean, I don't give a shit.
Right? I like that relative.

41
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:40,740
That always shows up to the event, never
brings anything and just hovers. Right.

42
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:45,350
Hovers around the fucking table. Doesn't
use that fucking spoon, you know,

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
to scoop it out. Easiest. Reach it in with
his fucking myths. That's what rats are,

44
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,310
right? That's a rat. And social
Runkle. Anyways, plowing ahead.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,040
So I put it out there nicely. Okay.
I, I like to feel like, you know,

46
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,440
being a man in my fifties now that I am,
I am refined. I am a man of the world.

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
All right? I drive a four door
sedan. I still pay for cable.

48
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,890
Okay. So I'm, I'm like this close
to buying a pair of loafers.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,660
Do you want to stand it?
Like that?

50
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:20,130
Debt is like how established
I am as an adult.

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,050
So I put it out there nicely. Does anybody
know what channel the MotoGP races on?

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,420
Uh, on direct TV? Oh, these fucking cops
come out of the woodwork at first of all,

53
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:35,080
you know, channels 60 died. Huh? You
get it. Are you going to try that? Huh?

54
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,690
Right. Then they start
doing this. What? Boris?

55
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,580
Then they start speaking in Twitter speak.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,450
I didn't know that direct
TV was still a thing.

57
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,630
Oh wow man. You're like so cool. The way
you, the way you get your entertainment,

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,300
Jesus Christ, you would've thought
I showed up with a fucking, I dunno,

59
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,450
the wrong pair of sneakers on it and I
wouldn't always, like in fifth grade,

60
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,990
the fact that I actually suggested that
I had no idea there was so much shame

61
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,730
and still having direct TV.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,330
I pay like 200 bucks a month for cable.

63
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,930
I swear to God. What do you think?
I went from one fucking, uh,

64
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,490
podcasts a week to two. I got
to pay for my direct TV. I do.

65
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,550
You know, somebody told me one time, he
goes, dude, you pay way too much money.

66
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,320
Just kept me come over
there and I'll yell at him.

67
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,710
I'll cut it in half because all these
fucking people a cord cutting and shit.

68
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:33,490
You can, you know I have all the sports
packages. Oh yeah, I'm talking shit here.

69
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,990
People.
Okay.

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,860
I pay for direct TV.

71
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,930
I am all for sports packages.
All right man.

72
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,570
I miss most of the Games.
Okay.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,290
You want to talk about taking hundreds
of just throwing them into a fire?

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,360
A lightness. A Garth.
That's how I'm rolling. Um,

75
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,220
anyway, so it turns out that
direct TV no longer, um,

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,330
carries moto GP,

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,320
which in my world is the best fucking
racing out there as far as if you want to

78
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:11,490
see excitement. If you want
passing, okay, okay. You, you, you,

79
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:15,510
you fucking NASCAR guys down there.
Huh? With your fucking stale.

80
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,790
That also doubles as a smoker during
the tailgate. You want to get drunk.

81
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:25,470
You stayed on this side if you want
some buffalo, but you get on that side,

82
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:29,400
right?
You guys want to see fucking excitement.

83
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,090
Do you want to see passing and
that type of shit? You want to see,

84
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,170
if you want to see a Rick watch a fucking
guy high side on a motorcycle going

85
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:42,030
like fucking 200 miles an hour,
like once every three racist.

86
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,230
It's just something that would make evil
Knievel be like Jesus fucking Christ.

87
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:50,100
Is that guy still alive? Which point
you said it's called an airbag evil.

88
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,410
You know they watched you a little
jump there at fucking Caesar's.

89
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,340
Who am I tell he evil Knievel
would laugh at that bullshit.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,170
The little light bikes in their
fucking airbags. You know,

91
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,950
he went out there wearing a fucking
pair of leather under roos and gun on a

92
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:08,590
fucking chopper. You can fucking
buy down at the local store

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,820
fucking bike.
Way more than my goddamn head.

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Um,
anyway,

95
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,090
um, you want to watch this motor GP?
So I fucking end ended up going online.

96
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,930
Everybody is like, why don't you watch
it on Reddit for free or whatever.

97
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,580
So I did, I go to moto GP, their
website. I sign up for this season.

98
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,300
Hundred and 39 bucks, right? More
money, more money, just fucking,

99
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:39,120
just flying out the window. Right. So, um,

100
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,770
I signed up for it and
then I'm such an old guy,

101
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,240
I couldn't figure out where to watch it.

102
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,280
And I finally figured it
out after the race was over,

103
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:49,060
you got to click on this like four lines
on the side and one of them says live

104
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,080
and when you click on that,
that's the fucking race.

105
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:54,760
So by the time I figured that out, you
know, it's counting down like fucking,

106
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,900
you know, 9,000 hours until the
next God damn race. So I missed it.

107
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,440
Okay.

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,580
And like all MotoGP races
said that sounded like it
was exciting as hell and it

109
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,730
came right down to the end and uh,

110
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,850
divisio so beat mock mock test like he
did last year by like the length of his

111
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:17,350
bike. And um, I dunno,

112
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,150
I'm hoping if anybody you know,
watches it on MotoGP GP site,

113
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,870
if they replay it, I can't even
find a fucking highlight of it. Um,

114
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,500
but anyways, so all you read
next down there, who like
you stock car racing, just,

115
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,340
it's 20 something lapse.
It'll go by in two seconds.

116
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,630
And I know it's a bunch of foreigners
out there on their little Modo scooters.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,810
Hi. Eight. Nobody named
Kale or Harry or Dale.

118
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,543
You know,

119
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,350
there's a mark that's kind of
an, you know, Andre's divisio.

120
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,810
So Jorge Lorenzo,
close the fucking bar.

121
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,580
I'd like to build a wall around that
fucking race tracks. What the fuck?

122
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:03,500
I'd like to do, jump over
that motherfucker. Um,

123
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,760
so anyways, I might seem a little
like my energy is a little higher,

124
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,350
little more giddy. It's
because, uh, I ain't doing shit.

125
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,630
I got a special in the can man.
And uh,

126
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,580
I'm just,
uh,

127
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I haven't done stand up since I said good
night on the second show and a tonight

128
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:29,590
I'm actually going down to the,
um, to the comedy store that had,

129
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:33,920
it's close to the public. It's just
for comics only and it's the, uh,

130
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:37,650
the memorial for Brody Stevens,
which I think is going to be a,

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,840
I think it's going to be great.
It's going to be sad, but I,

132
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:44,790
I really think it's like, he was
such an uplifting guy and it was so,

133
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:49,160
so much to learn from him that
I am really looking forward to,

134
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,994
uh,

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,890
to going down there and celebrating that
guy's life and the work that he, uh,

136
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,880
that he did down at the comedy store.
One of the legends, one of the legends.

137
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,270
Um, there's a place out
front where they put all the,

138
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,600
all the names of the people that really
built that place and kept it going.

139
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:12,370
I hope they move his name up there.
That's what I'm going to, uh, suggest.

140
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,220
Um, so anyway, um, yeah,

141
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:22,810
all I did, I took my daughter
down to the park, you know,

142
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:27,190
we went on the fucking, all the
rides and all that stuff. Just said,

143
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,700
like the best time hanging out with her.
And um,

144
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,520
I, we've said we'd watched the
Bruins. We watched the Celtics Swat.

145
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,270
I watch the Bruins, I watched three
Bruins games is fucking weekend. Um,

146
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,520
the panthers, Ottawa, which bolt
ended great. And then, uh, Pittsburgh,

147
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,630
I had a feeling they were going to get us.

148
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:51,631
I mean we literally one like
18 or 19 in a row undefeated,

149
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:55,420
you know, we were like, we
were like 1501 four I think.

150
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:59,050
So at some point someone was going
to have to stop us and uh, uh,

151
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:02,890
the penguins always play as tough and as
much as it sucked that the streak ended.

152
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,400
It was our longest point streaks since
I guess the early forties. But um,

153
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,150
I got to tell you some Sidney
Crosby's pass and the second period,

154
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,640
did anybody see that?
Jesus Christ.

155
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,270
Oh yeah. You, that's one of the
things you watch. It's just like,

156
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,320
what do we need robots for? Like that's
like the kind of thing like a robot,

157
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,000
you know,
skating that fast,

158
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
trying to get around the defenseman and
then he has another guy streaking down

159
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,010
on the outside of another diff,

160
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,690
a defenseman and then you've got the
goalie who could poke check the pass away.

161
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:37,040
He put it the only place where it could
fucking be like a top rate fucking pass

162
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,480
to the quarter of the end zone.

163
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,450
Yeah,

164
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,410
right on the tape bag bag in
the back of the fucking nuts.

165
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,220
It was just one of those.
It's one of those things,

166
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,430
even though the other team did it,
you can't even get mad.

167
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,270
You just like Jesus Christ. That was
fucking, it was a thing of beauty. Um,

168
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,100
so,
uh,

169
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,970
I don't have another fucking gig other
than one quick benefit in New York then

170
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm doing on April 2nd garden dreams,

171
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,960
um, at Msg, uh, in the theater
where Eddie Murphy did raw.

172
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,170
I always think about that when I, when
I go down and do a show that, that,

173
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:16,171
that this is where he did that
special and I saw him on that tour,

174
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,170
what used to be called
great words and Mansfield,

175
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:22,390
Massachusetts with the
weather girls opening up. I,

176
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,050
for the life of me cannot find any
record of that date. When it happened.

177
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,480
I think I finally found it.
What do you,

178
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,060
what are you fucking millennial
nerds find that all right.

179
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:35,080
It was like 85 or 1986.

180
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,550
Great Woods had just opened Mansfield,
Massachusetts.

181
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,190
And that summer I saw,

182
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,420
I saw Rodney Dangerfield and
this was post back to school.

183
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,660
He was that movie hit and
he was on this huge tour.

184
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,443
Um,

185
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,110
yeah.

186
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,250
And then,
uh,

187
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:59,930
I saw him and then that a couple of
weeks later I saw Eddie Murphy and I

188
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:03,570
remember that, that really, uh,

189
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,230
was something that stuck with
me. I was like 18 years old. And,

190
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,064
um,

191
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,960
I remember when I went to
see danger fields watching
him and just looking around

192
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:18,760
at the crowd. Um, and it didn't dawn
on me, that was an all white crowd.

193
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,360
Cause I, you know, I'm
white. I was just like,

194
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:22,820
this is what the world looks like to
me at that point in my life. You know,

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,880
living in the s the
safe suburbs of Boston,

196
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:28,730
Massachusetts was just a bunch of white
people. So it didn't really dawn on me.

197
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,980
That was an all white crowd. And I
remember looking around thinking, wow man,

198
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,650
this guy's making everybody laugh.
He's killing. This is amazing. Right?

199
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,400
And then a couple of weeks later I saw
Eddie Murphy and the crowd was mixed.

200
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:42,800
And I remember that stuck with me.
I was like, this guy, but this guy,

201
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,320
this guy's making everybody laugh.
Um, I had lawn seats for that.

202
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:51,080
I had seats for Dangerfield,
so I actually saw him and, uh,

203
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,530
it kills me that I didn't try and
pony up some more money back then,

204
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:00,890
but I didn't have any money to not
sit in the, in, in a fucking field.

205
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,670
I mean,
I didn't really technically see him.

206
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:08,210
I was just watching them on the monitors
and, but he was wearing that purple,

207
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,170
a Mariachi suit that he wore.
Um,

208
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,360
so anyways, uh, fuck am I talking about
here? How the hell did I get onto that?

209
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,423
Uh,

210
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,110
I dunno when I watched the
Celtics versus the Lakers and, uh,

211
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:28,760
at the risk of sounding like an old man,
I fucking hate NBA hoop now.

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
You know, it's just, it's, he says,
fuck up and down the fucking court.

213
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:37,730
Everybody launched in a three.
There's nobody underneath, you know,

214
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:40,610
the other teams on a 10 old Ron
yet just keep launching three's.

215
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,670
There's no feed and the
big man down low anymore.

216
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,310
None of nobody can stand
in the fucking paint. Um,

217
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,080
you know,
I dunno.

218
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,890
I Dunno what the fuck is going on with
the Celtics. I haven't watched too much,

219
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,270
but I watched a bunch of the last couple
of years, and I can tell you this,

220
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:04,230
we had fucking Jae Crowder and Kelly
Olynyk and everybody was fucking listening

221
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:08,220
to Brad Stevens.
We were a tougher team to beat.

222
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,950
We didn't have the level of talent,

223
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:12,780
but we were a tougher team to beat
and this whole fucking new era.

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,430
And you hear the announcers
just like, you know, they,

225
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:22,431
they condone the behavior that people get
so good that they don't have to listen

226
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,680
to the coach anymore.
And I'm not just picking on the Celtics,

227
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:29,040
like that's like a round the
fucking league. And I dunno,

228
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,870
I don't know. You know, he's going to have
to get his touch. His fuck is touches.

229
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,160
They're going out here to win the
fucking game. Drives me quick.

230
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,590
We have this unbelievable chance right now

231
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,750
with the talent talent that we have.

232
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:47,980
We should be able to at the very
least scare the Golden State Warriors.

233
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,140
Um, I know we beat him the day in
regular, but that doesn't mean shit.

234
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,130
It's one game regular season.
Like those guys are the fucking champs.

235
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,700
They're in the middle of a fucking dynasty
and they're going to have an entirely

236
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:05,020
different energy when you meet
them in the finals. All right?

237
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,710
As opposed to fucking one game out of 80
or whatever that you happened to catch

238
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:12,070
him on a fucking Wednesday
night and you beat them. Um,

239
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,730
we have this great opportunity to win
another one while the Lakers are fucking

240
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,480
rebuilding and I love how
everybody's second panic mode,

241
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,320
like Magic Johnson and those guys are
doing exactly what the fuck they said they

242
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:30,700
were going to do it. We brought in
Lebron. Okay. This is a two year plan.

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,050
Like the, the, the fan base is
there is so fucking impatient now,

244
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,720
like a two year plan is taking too long.

245
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,840
So it's literally you bring in fucking
Lebron the first year and then he's going

246
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:47,841
to attract all of this free agent help
and then they're all gonna go out there

247
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,720
and pile on because everyone wants to
be part of the Lakers fucking, you know,

248
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,190
great history and they want to fuck
models and famous women yet all that stuff

249
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:02,980
fucking thing that they
have over the Celtics.

250
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,590
They got the weather and they got the
pussy. We just can't fucking compete.

251
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,140
You know you want to go racist city
to racist city. We're right there. Oh,

252
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,540
we got your eyeball to eyeball.
You want to go championships?

253
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,400
We got two more than they do. Unless
you count that Ba one that they count.

254
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,540
Okay.

255
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,900
But they have the weather and
they have the pussy and that,

256
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,320
that right fucking there.
You know what I mean?

257
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,740
The fuck are you going to do with
that? How do you, how do you beat that?

258
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,640
Okay.

259
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,610
Location, location, location.

260
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,680
How many titles do you
think that the fucking

261
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,450
Lakers would have had if
they stayed in Minneapolis?

262
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,340
Okay.

263
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,830
Okay.
And they had the exact same ownership.

264
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,330
Okay.

265
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,163
I'm asking you,

266
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,500
can they still attract the level
of talent that they attracted

267
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,350
being out there in Hollywood.

268
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,310
Now all of a sudden you're
in the frozen Tundra.

269
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,510
Okay.

270
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,540
Of Minneapolis, Minnesota, right.

271
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,460
You got fucking farm fed checks where
in their overalls coming in from Duluth.

272
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,220
Right. You got some hayseeds making
the trek in from fucking the Dakotas.

273
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,280
I mean, I don't, I, I just
don't see it. I just don't,

274
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,310
I just don't think there's enough pussy
and you don't have the fucking weather,

275
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,910
whether in pussy have,
have,

276
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,380
have caused more goddamn athletes to
make stupid fucking moves to jump out of

277
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:49,580
the NFL and join the fucking
world football league.

278
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,150
Well, money to money whether
and pussy, the TRIFECTA.

279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,920
Um, so I don't know, I'm just hoping
people listen to Brad Stevens.

280
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,220
Just listen to what the fuck this
guy says. Play like a Goddamn team.

281
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,750
Fuck your own stats and just go out there
and get it done and let's fucking win

282
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,660
another one before the lake is a
common cause the Lakers are common.

283
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,720
They're always coming. Okay.
It's almost like a rule.

284
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,490
They can only suck for like five fucking
years before they're going to read.

285
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:22,290
And you know that their whole fucking,
their whole fucking history is, is,

286
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,500
is free agents,
free agents.

287
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:29,310
Three write down to Koby Bryant who
was a fucking, uh, Charlotte Hornet.

288
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,060
But what kills me, you know, look at
that and Antonio Brown like, yeah,

289
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:33,920
you're going to the bills.
Yeah.

290
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:36,390
I'm not playing for them when they
get the fuck out of the league.

291
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,801
Like,

292
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:43,100
I don't understand the bills just made a
move to get one of the top receivers in

293
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,410
the league, but he doesn't
like where the fuck they are.

294
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,770
So he's not going to fucking
go. I mean that, that,

295
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:53,010
I don't know what happened to parody in
the fucking league. I'd like, listen,

296
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm all for it. Like players not
getting fucked over by ownership,

297
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:00,330
but they're at the point now where
they have too much power. You know,

298
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,370
kind of like where the
unions were when I was a kid,

299
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,800
which caused all these
fucking corporations. It'd
be like, all right, well,

300
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:07,170
we're just going to move the
corporation out of this fucking country

301
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,170
and go back to sweatshop labor.
You know, and I'm a I, you know,

302
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,900
I don't mind union unions.
I'm not saying don't have a fucking union,

303
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:19,280
but who's kidding? No kidding. And most
people don't handle power. Well. Right.

304
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,090
And then it became to Grady to conti
too much leaning on the mop and then the

305
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,920
fucking rich guys who were like,
yeah, we're fucking out of here.

306
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,780
I gotta tell you something. All of
what I've just said here. I've, no,

307
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't think I've ever really read on it.
I've just,

308
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,170
this is all me just pasting
together conversations I've
heard throughout my life.

309
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,230
Okay.
Well like I've said before,

310
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:45,030
if you want clear and
accurate information,

311
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,820
you listen to the Joe Rogan podcast.
By the way.

312
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,890
I have to give that guy a shout out.
Right.

313
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,810
As far as like what that
guy has done with his part.

314
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:58,170
Have you been looking at the fucking
guests at that guy's getting,

315
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,033
he's getting like

316
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,820
Elon Musk and the doctor Phil and a David
Lee Roth and then like some scientists

317
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:09,230
that everyone heard of who then blows
my mind about like some sort of like a,

318
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:11,930
I dunno, I know some scientific
shit. I know fucking,

319
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:15,530
I mean I'm too stupid understand it,
but like that guy is

320
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,130
like, I dunno, I dunno what school,
where this podcasting world goes,

321
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:25,300
but like at this point,
if you do,

322
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:27,550
if you're a guest on his show,

323
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,600
you get more heat than if you do like,

324
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,820
like a fucking legendary talk show.
It's honor.

325
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,250
It's unbelievable what
that guy is as has done.

326
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:44,400
I was just thinking the other day, I
forget what the fuck. Yes. Did I see,

327
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,320
I think once a David Lee Roth,
I think it was just the,

328
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,330
the variety of guests.
They, I mean, again,

329
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:57,200
Doctor Phil,
that's fucking huge.

330
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:01,810
I mean that is like a big
mainstream old school guest.

331
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm going to go do the talk show circuit.

332
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,370
I'm going to fucking go do
terrestrial radio and all that.

333
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:11,150
You get that fucking guy. I mean
that, I thought that that was a big,

334
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,740
you know, I don't know. That's a big
moment that's right up there. You know,

335
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,940
when Marin had Obama on,
um,

336
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,870
I think when they look back at like
what are these podcasts come from?

337
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:28,460
But what were some of the
watershed moments like I would say,

338
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,190
okay,

339
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,023
I dunno,

340
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,960
stamps.com starting to advertise and then
it goes Obama on Mark Marin's and then

341
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:44,071
it's Joe Rogan's numbers
and his wide variety of gay,

342
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,530
I mean he had like Elon Musk on his show.

343
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,600
The guy took a hit of a joint
and it affected his stock prices.

344
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,270
That's fucking amazing.
Um, anyways, but meanwhile,

345
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,590
here I sit in my fucking sweatpants
talking to myself, stubborn,

346
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,710
stubborn German Irish guy.
He's just going to do it this way.

347
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,800
I don't want to talk to people,
man. I'm not fucking with you. I,

348
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,790
I if you've noticed when I do interviews,

349
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm a lot of times of too busy thinking
about what the fuck I want to say or

350
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:24,370
somebody says something and I drift
off and that it becomes like that Chris

351
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,740
Farley thing where I'm just fucking
grabbing the side of my pants going, man,

352
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:31,030
when you did this, that was awesome. Um,

353
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,080
all right, so, oh Billy, no booze bag.

354
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,260
Okay.
107 fucking days.

355
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,380
And I went to the gym yesterday
and for the first time,

356
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,390
and I like the three years I did
a dip testing out my shoulders.

357
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,770
Fortunately where I go to the gym,
they have like this, uh, the, the,

358
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:57,450
the dip machine, you can actually remove
the dip bar and adjusted to your height.

359
00:22:57,451 --> 00:23:02,451
So I have it just way down near the
floor where my arms are actually straight

360
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:05,920
when I'm holding onto it.
And then I just sort of, uh,

361
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,760
went up on my toes,
you know,

362
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,970
supporting my weight with my arms and
went up on my toes like Michael Jackson,

363
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,200
you know, and uh, you know,
minus that documentary,

364
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:20,340
whatever the fuck is going on with that.
And I was just slowing myself down.

365
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:22,230
And every day,
every time I felt a little bit stronger.

366
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:25,800
And then yesterday I was
like, oh no, I think I can do
one. I did one filter, right?

367
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,440
And then I kind of did three
in a row and I was just like,

368
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:32,640
why did I just do that?
Because I'm finding what the,
the rotator cuff, it's a,

369
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,500
is it rotator or road? Rotor cuff.
Rotator cuff. Um, rotor cuff.

370
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,520
Jesus Christ. I've had this injury
for three fucking years and I don't,

371
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,330
it's one of the,
you know,

372
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,520
I just had these words that I
don't really know how to say.

373
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:45,960
So I just say fast and

374
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,600
hope people don't notice rotator cuff.
Yeah.

375
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,040
Oh, at first I used to think, is
it rotator cup? A rotator cuff?

376
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,440
I don't know what the fuck it is. Um, if
you're still listening, God bless you.

377
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,180
That's all I can say.
So anyways,

378
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:07,200
I was able to do that and then
they have one of those, uh, those,

379
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,080
those pull up machines that you can,
you know,

380
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,300
be on your knees would like
the weight and all that stuff.

381
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,060
So I did like two or three of those and
now it's fucking hilarious cause I'm

382
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:18,990
kind of filling a weird feeling in my
other shoulder cause I think at this one

383
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:23,010
got worn out because of the other
one. And um, I think I'm finally,

384
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,940
I'm just going to go in and get
an Mri on both of my shoulders,

385
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,800
figuring out what the fuck's going on.
And then I might do a Rogan,

386
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,060
but Rogan's been telling me to do is go
fucking check out this guy that does the

387
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,670
stem cell thing and they just shoot it
in there and all of a sudden you're like

388
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:39,300
a fucking x Matt. I think
I might do that. You know,

389
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,930
I think I deserved that idea.
I didn't get the hair plugs right.

390
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,770
I'm not doing botox. I'm
aging naturally, you know,

391
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,190
I don't think is anything wrong with
rebuilding the engine and my fucking

392
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:55,110
shoulders. Oh Geez. My kids
screaming down. Um, but anyways,

393
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:59,280
I haven't been drinking,
I haven't really been smoking and uh,

394
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,770
I dunno, I'm actually calling a
fucking therapist today to find,

395
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,200
cause I've been saying on my stage of,
and working on my anger,

396
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:10,140
but I've been kind of doing it on my own
and I'm finally going to get some help

397
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:14,910
here. And uh, I've been doing this
joke in my act saying like, you know,

398
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:17,700
if I just didn't have a temper,

399
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,713
like

400
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,900
as far as like, you know, your
wife's always, you know, trying to,

401
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,170
we'll say in a nice way,
tries.

402
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,410
It's always trying to help
you become a better person.

403
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,920
Like I think if I got rid of my temper,
she would be out of suggestions.

404
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,143
Yeah.

405
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,670
Because other than my temper, I
mean, I'm fucking crushing it.

406
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,640
Do you understand that guys? Do
you understand that? I am a man.

407
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,040
Okay.

408
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,230
They can still afford to pay for DIRECTV.

409
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,680
900 channels,
350 of which are radio stations.

410
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,300
I don't even listen to those,

411
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,383
you know,

412
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,560
I'll fucking,

413
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,210
I'll pay for that direct TV subscription
and then I'll order a UFC fight and a

414
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:03,590
sports package. I'll give
a fuck. I'll fuck off.

415
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,540
I'll fucking stare right at $300 bill.

416
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,890
Pay It just like that.

417
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,490
I'm sorry I'm doing this.

418
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,480
I just was so shamed for still paying
for fucking cable and I didn't. I didn't,

419
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,180
I didn't know that yet. I'm going to
fucking doing this shit where I got.

420
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:26,380
Everything's like, I like it all
right there. Oh my fucking TV.

421
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,950
And I watched this on my laptop.
I watched this on my phone.

422
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:34,900
I got this thing on Mike. Mike fucking
pad bill. They're all the same technology.

423
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:36,660
You can watch them anywhere.
I don't want to figure,

424

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,100
You know what I realized
halfway through this,

504
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,410
I need to let somebody know that I'm not
gonna be able to get to with the fuck

505
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:51,490
I'm supposed to be. Anyways,
we plow forward here. Okay.

506
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,330
Creepy Lennon Mannequin.
All right.

507
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,620
A couple of weeks ago,
I was in Liverpool and uh,

508
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,850
I went down to this, this
um, oh it says right here,

509
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,100
Magical Beatles Museum.
Okay. This, I actually,

510
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:10,630
and I was making fun of that fucking John
Lennon statue. If you miss the episode,

511
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,090
you can of literally the,

512
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:16,270
one of the first fucking things you
see and it's like the white suit like,

513
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,980
oh fuck,
is that the white suit?

514
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,560
Why would that be out here in the
open where anybody could just take it?

515
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,750
You Walk Up,
you realize it isn't the white suit.

516
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,320
You realize it doesn't look like
fucking John Lennon and all,

517
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,400
it's got this awful beard like taped
to the things face. I mean it just,

518
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,500
it just looks like a rip off.
I mean they might as well.

519
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,780
I had a fucking two headed goat
standing out there or something,

520
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,590
so I made fun of it. So
anyways, it says high belt.

521
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,500
I work at the Magical Beatles
Museum and parentheses.

522
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,560
I like most of the staff agree with you.

523
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:51,150
The mannequin should be thrown
in the river. Mercy. Mercy. Okay.

524
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,440
The guys from cheap trick found
it weird as well. All right,

525
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:58,800
so that's a major fucking band with I
believe that bands in the rock and roll

526
00:32:58,801 --> 00:33:02,260
hall of fame and they are looking
at it like, dude, what the fuck? Um,

527
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,420
it's unfortunate.

528
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:07,320
You and your pal decided not to come
in as the mannequin certainly does not

529
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:12,321
represent what is inside the museum is
on three floors in is filled with 300 and

530
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:17,571
counting genuine Beatles
artifacts from 1959 to 1970.

531
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,950
See now this is making
me wish I went in there.

532
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,220
You got to get rid of that
fucking mannequin. Uh,

533
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:28,080
these include the metals John Lennon
wore on the sergeant pepper cover. Wow.

534
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,320
George Harrison's future Rama Guitar.
I didn't know what that is.

535
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:34,200
The spotlights from Abbey Road Studios,

536
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,540
Ringo Star's snared rump,

537
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,410
Jesus seeds from Shea Stadium and the
cello from the blue Jay way video,

538
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:47,250
et Cetera, et Cetera, et
cetera. The owner of the museum,

539
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:52,080
also the guy responsible
for the creepy mannequin is

540
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,100
okay.

541
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,000
Rogue Aspinall Lee best.

542
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,330
I didn't, couldn't tell if that was an
affliction or a name. It's a name. Okay.

543
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:09,331
He is the son of Neil Aspinall Beatles
roadie and head of apple records.

544
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:14,710
He's also brother of Pete best original
Beatles Drummer. And as a great guy,

545
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:18,760
next time you were in Liverpool comment
and we'll give you and your pals slash

546
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:22,000
family of free toward all the best.
They'll fuck that dude. I'm going to pay.

547
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,020
I'm gonna pay.
Although I would ask them,

548
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,940
it does peak get upset that he started
a fucking museum to the band that fired

549
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:34,450
him, fired his brother. He's
gotta be kind of weird. Right.

550
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,490
Um, I don't know. I'm sure. I'm sure Pete
best is over it at this point. Right?

551
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,570
I have. Oh, is there any
other, you know, that's another
thing too, you know, on, on,

552
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,460
on Twitter. I'm an old man. I'm still on
Twitter. Right? I'm still on the Twitter.

553
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,490
Some they had this, this hashtag
going around that said, um, um,

554
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:59,410
not popular opinions. And people would
say like, you know, I don't know,

555
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:02,800
pick somebody like a, I don't think
at Dell has a good voice, you know,

556
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:06,910
stupid shit. Like nobody said that
by the way. Um, I'm just happy.

557
00:35:06,911 --> 00:35:11,320
I know how to say her name. I was calling
her Adelai for a long fucking time. Um,

558
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,480
but somebody wrote that the Beatles
are overrated. That's another one.

559
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,380
That's a big one.
When millennials one of appear edgy,

560
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,120
they go, they're overrated.
Oh, are they? Okay. Okay.

561
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,670
Well maybe if you read up on the
history at some fucking point.

562
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,520
Hachi second a phone call.
Hang on a second. All right,

563
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:35,850
here's the thing about that.
I understand if the Beatles,

564
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,300
you're young and the Beatles music
doesn't move you because I mean,

565
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:44,470
it's music from literally 50
fucking years ago at this point.

566
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:45,770
That's the end of their career to,

567
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,360
and then the other stuff is
coming up on 60 years. Okay.

568
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,150
So in defense of you guys,
I understand that, uh,

569
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,830
if you don't like it or it does it, but
they're not overrated. I mean, they just,

570
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,230
they influenced an entire generation

571
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,300
okay.

572
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,980
Of, of bands to get started. They
made the whole fucking thing possible.

573
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,020
And because of them,

574
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,410
you're listening to the music
that you're listening to today.

575
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:16,000
They are an undeniable
part of music history. But,

576
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,020
um, I would never, you know, be
this old guy going like, you know,

577
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,280
if you told me that music sucks, I'm not
going to argue that. That's just like,

578
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,990
I mean,
if I fucking grew up now,

579
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,040
I would like some of their songs
even I remember in the 80s,

580
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,390
like liking them and my teacher being
like, going like, dude, you don't get it.

581
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,010
You don't get how fucking huge it
was when a Beatles album came out.

582
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,110
It's like they'll,
they'll,

583
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,650
they'll fucking world stopped
for younger people then,

584
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:47,500
and you bought it and people do it.
I got to new Beatles album.

585
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,690
Everybody came over and fucking
listen to it. It, I, I mean,

586
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,110
I wasn't even part of that,
so, um, but as far as like, uh,

587
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,240
like first he always suffers.

588
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:59,620
He hates the Beatles and he's just
like yellow submarine, Bill Yellow.

589
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:03,100
So it was like, dude, everybody's got
a bad fucking joke in the rack. C'Mon.

590
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,933
Okay.

591
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,780
Um, anyways, you know, first I, you know,

592
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,750
whatever I, it's, I, I get it. I get
it. It's, it's too much time has passed.

593
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:15,840
I've heard,

594
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,840
I've heard younger comics talk about
some big comics that way and not get like

595
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:26,270
what the big deal is, but what
happens is, is the further,

596
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,660
okay,

597
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,980
like,
let's look at Beethoven.

598
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:33,180
Can you fucking imagine when
that Shit first came out?

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,860
Like it just keep fucking sitting there.

600
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:41,600
You got a goddamn boil the size of my
foot on the side of your fucking head.

601
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,010
You'll fighting off typhoid for yellow
feet, whatever the fuck God damn plague.

602
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,910
And also this guy just shows up with
100 of his friends I yet. Uh, but like,

603
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,740
dude, what the fuck? You know?

604
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,190
And now you're just sitting there eating
a subway sandwich in an elevator and in

605
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:02,420
the background is gone.
But other, the, it just,

606
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,820
it just doesn't have the
same fucking kick impact. Um,

607
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,430
but that doesn't mean the dude's
overrated does it? I don't fucking know.

608
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,203
MMM.

609
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,460
Okay.

610
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,290
Anyways, moving ahead here, or if you look
at you, if you look at what is the salt,

611
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,280
you've watched soul train,

612
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,640
do you watch some of the people
dancing from way fucking back then?

613
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,760
There's a lot of them that I,
compared to today's standards,

614
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,900
I'm not talking about the legendary
dancers, just people on the dance floor.

615
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:35,610
I just, when I watched, cause Nia loves
that show and I'll be just watching,

616
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,880
I just laugh going like,
you know,

617
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:41,881
there's a lot of people on this show
that are dancing at a level that awful

618
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,810
white people dance that today,

619
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:48,370
like the barges keeps getting raised
off of the work. So if you go back,

620
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:53,371
the hardest thing to do when you go
back in history is to block out what has

621
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:58,720
happened since then and try to put
it into historical perspective,

622
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:02,210
which is practically impossible.
Um,

623
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,110
it's like going back and
looking at Johnny Unitas,

624
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:10,140
how he threw for over 40,000 yards in
his career and like the next closest guy

625
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:14,320
had half as much as that. But now I
like the way the rules have changed.

626
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:19,321
Like a fucking Goddamn backup quarterback
will throw for 30,000 in his career.

627
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:25,660
So it doesn't seem like a
big deal. Um, so I dunno,

628
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,920
I'm just defending the beetle sets all
and now I feel bad that I trashed his

629
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:33,130
fucking museum and I judged
it by that goddamn mannequin.

630
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,470
I think the whole purpose,

631
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:38,320
all that was me just realizing
that I'm a bit of a cunt.

632
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,210
He's a bit of a con there.
He is a, he's a bit of a con.

633
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,370
Um, alright. Cheesy cheesing babies,

634
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,190
a dear Billy badge.

635
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:54,790
Have you seen these pussies throwing
cheese onto their kids' faces?

636
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,870
I saw one of them.

637
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,880
It's just the fucking desperation
for people to get views.

638
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,420
Um, on the Internet to the
appointment. Look, I'm a performer. I,

639
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,190
I have a desperation for it.
I get it on some level,

640
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:12,340
but when you start like the amount of
videos I just see of like parents with

641
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:13,750
like their kids,
right?

642
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,990
And they're starting to fall and they
don't do anything and they just film it so

643
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:23,920
they can laugh and they just like
let their kid get hurt is, you know,

644
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,240
the real ones like you can tell it wasn't
set up is cause right as a kid starts

645
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:28,961
to fall like that,

646
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:32,200
you see the fucking phone flies out
of frame and you actually miss the kid

647
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:36,280
falling down. You, she can tell the parent
lunged and tried to save the person.

648
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,580
But um, yeah, I don't get it anyway.

649
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,420
It's like how much the person said,
uh,

650
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,180
how much do you hate yourself that
you'd throw cheese on a baby's face?

651
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,480
Just imagine what type of
memory is sublimely stored
where a baby sees a camera

652
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,820
and then something hit their face.

653
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,500
I'd arrest all these asshole parents
and throw firehose water in the,

654
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,620
at their faces. Um, yeah. I mean,

655
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:07,270
I don't know if it does like
psychological damage to the baby.

656
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:08,770
If you can even fucking remember it.

657
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,530
Like someday it's going to be
in Philly and they're like, hey,

658
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:12,950
you want to get a cheese
steak? It's like, hey,

659
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,680
Jason fucking starts slamming
the sandwich into its face.

660
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,250
Um,
I don't know that it does that.

661
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,730
There is just the thing
where when you are,

662
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,480
you become a parent just sounded
like defenseless and helpless.

663
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:30,740
You kid is um,

664
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,450
look not advocating being a helicopter
parent, I'm not saying that,

665
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,480
but there's just something
about filming it like cause it,

666
00:41:43,031 --> 00:41:43,321
it's,

667
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:48,321
the kid obviously doesn't
enjoy it obviously startles
the kid and the fact that

668
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:54,050
you're putting your own fucking
adult needs ahead of that. I mean I,

669
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:55,020
I all of that,

670
00:41:55,021 --> 00:42:00,021
that whole category is giving your kid a
stupid fucking name like coat hanger or

671
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:04,720
some dumps, Hollywood celebrity
fucking name or, or, or

672
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,230
putting your fucking political agenda
like your kid is going to live your

673
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:11,460
political agenda.

674
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,510
I'm raising my kid gender neutral and
then all of a sudden your kid asks you,

675
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:19,950
your son has to wear a fucking dress
just so you can show off how fucking

676
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:23,700
progressive you are rather than asking
the kid if he just wants a football

677
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:27,150
instead. You know what I mean? Like
you're going to make that decision.

678
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:30,360
I think all of that stuff is,
um,

679
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,060
I dunno what the, I'm not a psychologist.
I just, it's not how I would do it,

680
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,740
you know, I think he should,
if your kid starts to fall,

681
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,670
you should try to catch your kid.
I think if this cheese,

682
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:47,730
you should hand it to your child. If
your kid wants to eat it, they eat it.

683
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,920
If they don't, then you finish it and
gain a few more pounds, like a dead.

684
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,090
Right.
Um,

685
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,680
I dunno. And I, I also,

686
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,250
I also just like if your kid fucks up
and then you put it on the Internet,

687
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:02,340
it's just like, it, it exists
forever and kids are already made.

688
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:07,230
You're literally giving
like, um, ammunition.

689
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,320
Like somebody showed me this video,

690
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,340
this woman or a kid was being a class
clown and dancing at school and she gave

691
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:20,670
him the option. She says, I'm either going
to give you the belt or you can dance.

692
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,060
So the kid is crying cause he's scared
and he's sitting there and doing this

693
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:27,840
half ass like dancing while he's
crying and everybody thinks it's funny.

694
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,640
It's like this fucking
kid has to go to school.

695
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,640
Not to mention you should
have hit a kid with a belt.

696
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:34,500
There's like so many fucking
things that are wrong with it.

697
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,443
MMM.

698
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,940
I Dunno. So yeah, I don't, I don't like,

699
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:46,270
and I think you know, your instincts
that you're that mad that you, you,

700
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,620
I could feel the anger that
you have towards it. Yeah.
Like you shouldn't do that.

701
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,320
I imagine with your level of anger,
like some shit was done to you,

702
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,820
um, as was done to me and I
think he'd go one of two ways.

703
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:02,821
You either repeated slash tried to take
it to the next level or you just go back

704
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:07,630
to like, oh, I remember what that felt
like. I, yeah, I'm not doing that.

705
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,640
Why would I do that? Uh, but you know,
there's a lot of morons that, um,

706
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,780
you know, you don't have to be smart
to know how to fuck. That's the thing.

707
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,200
If they just made it like something
like, uh, like if it was as difficult is,

708
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,930
is getting like a degree in something,
I think the world would be a better place.

709
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,150
But anyway, it can be like
goodbye Dick, stand it up.

710
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:30,000
But I want to just stick it in their diet.

711
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,150
Next scene or you a fucking kid and
you're throwing cheese at it and you're

712
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,984
filming it.

713
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,813
MMM,

714
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,420
I dunno. I it's, I
wouldn't do it. We'll see.

715
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:42,800
We'll see what the fallout is,

716
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:46,850
but my kid's not going to be part of
that fucking experiment. All right.

717
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,790
Premiere league soccer.
Soccer is in quotes.

718
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,230
So I'm imagining this is a fucking
somebody who doesn't live in the u s uh,

719
00:44:54,231 --> 00:44:55,490
hey Billy Ball breaker.

720
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,610
I've been listening for a long
time and really enjoy your podcast,

721
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:03,611
especially during football season as
I find your analysis is put more in

722
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:07,610
layman's terms for us Brits
being a fellow Patriot Fan.

723
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:12,611
Nice here also gets me shit as
most people follow the Seahawks.

724
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,070
Well isn't that interesting?
Yeah.

725
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,740
If you don't mind right back and let me
know why did they follow the Seahawks.

726
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,003
Okay.

727
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,311
And is it,

728
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:24,580
cause it's always cloudy over there and
they had the same kind of weather in

729
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:27,730
Britain as they do in Seattle.
That's really interesting. Um,

730
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,260
I've enjoyed your recent ramblings.

731
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:32,470
About the premier league and Liverpool's
battle with Manchester this year.

732
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:36,250
So I thought I'd share a few facts you
may enjoy and help you understand more.

733
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,840
Uh, Liverpool were actually the more
successful team in history with 18 league

734
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,670
titles. Oh yeah, I heard about this.

735
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,220
This is like before the
Premiere League existed.

736
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,560
It's almost like pre Superbowl error.
They had five Europe Aka,

737
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,070
so 80 league titles,

738
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,220
five European titles and a bunch of other
cups until recently when their biggest

739
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:57,784
rivals,

740
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,820
Manchester United overtook them and
have 20 titles but only three European

741
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:04,241
titles.

742
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:09,241
So that's basically the Celtics and
Lakers of a premier league football.

743
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,960
Um,
given your gripe about the Steelers,

744
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,160
I thought you'd be interested to know
that all 18 of Liverpool's titles were

745
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:19,750
before the Premiere League error,

746
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,880
but are still very much counted here
as it should be. Yes, it should. Uh,

747
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,470
their Wikipedia page is very interesting
as they have also faced tragedies along

748
00:46:29,471 --> 00:46:33,990
with other clubs and
still cake out on top.

749
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,070
Never heard that expression unless
you, that's a typo. Secondly, uh,

750
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,670
match man city are only recently
a good team as 10 years ago.

751
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:46,390
They were about,
they were,

752
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,120
I think you missed a word
here as 10 years ago,

753
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:54,930
they were about over by Arab,
I think they were bought out his what?

754
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:59,550
He wanted Arab billionaires
and it basically play paid
extraordinary amounts of

755
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:04,551
money for the best players and are still
not quite good enough to win all the

756
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:08,340
cops. See this is, this is
what you need to get into it.

757
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,450
It's already a beautiful game and now
I need is the backstory and the drama.

758
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,420
So I think that's really
interesting that man city,

759
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,840
all of a sudden they have all this money.
Um,

760
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,670
which who gives a fuck,
cause you know,

761
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:24,730
before then everyone was probably going
to man United or Liverpool if they

762
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:28,990
wanted to win a title. Now, hey,
they come out of nowhere. I like it.

763
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:33,580
It's good. You know, you guys
all got money. The Boston
Red Sox on the Liverpool,

764
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:38,320
God knows they got fucking more money
than God. Um, what about man United?

765
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,840
Did they get a bunch of money?
But that legacy,

766
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,430
I feel like they need to do something.

767
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:47,431
So are all of a sudden it starts to
fade a little bit like the Michigan

768
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:51,730
Wolverines. Like thank God they got
a, what's his face there? Captain,

769
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,820
come back to save the any
debts even though he hasn't
beaten no house state yet.

770
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,590
Uh, Harbaugh saved that fucking program
because you can only be bad for so long.

771
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,300
We're all of us. If you suck for
kids, uh, recruits entire life,

772
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,810
they don't give a shit that becomes
beetle ever. Stuff like, yeah, whatever,

773
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:10,210
that's yellow submarine football.
I don't give a fuck about it.

774
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,360
And they're going to end up in like
Oregon came out of nowhere cause all of a

775
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:18,040
sudden they started having these cool
uniforms and started winning games. Um,

776
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,110
Abbott. Don a total tangent here.
So let's see. Here we go. Thirdly,

777
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:28,000
going on what you said about the offsides
rule and the defending player slowing

778
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:31,870
down, they can do this, but if the
attacking player is behind them,

779
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,360
when the ball is played,

780
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,930
they are still on side and can
score. Wait, how does that work?

781
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,550
The attacking player is behind them.
When the ball is played,

782
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,880
what does that mean?
He ran past him with the ball.

783
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,940
He can't go past the last
defender without the ball. Right.

784
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,110
So the attacker must time they're run
with the are other players making the pass

785
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:05,961
and the defending players must do the
same but also be aware that if they get,

786
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,980
oh I see what you're saying.
So like if he's like parallel

787
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,080
to um,
or is it perpendicular?

788
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:19,680
If he's parallel to the defenseman
and somebody kicks the ball past the

789
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,793
Defenseman,

790
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,150
he can take off as the ball's
kicked and then he won't,

791
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:29,620
he'll still be on site. I get that.
All right. That's a little more, uh,

792
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,430
okay. I guess. So it's sort of
like a moving blue line I guess.

793
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:37,720
I really appreciate you taking the
time to explain this to me though. Um,

794
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,730
so let me read that again. Slowly when
the ball is played, that means kicked,

795
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:47,440
I guess then they are still
on the outside kids score.

796
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,410
So the a two, wait, wait,

797
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:52,310
where the fuck with thirdly going on
what you said about the offsides rule and

798
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:53,890
the defending players slowing down.

799
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,570
They can do this but if the attacking
player is behind them when the ball is

800
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:02,350
played, meaning kicked, then they
are still on site and can score.

801
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:04,960
So the attacker must time they're run.

802
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:06,420
Okay

803
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,600
with their other player.
I liked that there's a finesse to that.

804
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,590
I have to respect making the past.
Oh do you have to respect it?

805
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:15,390
You fucking arrogant con whatever.

806
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:20,391
I'm trying to be nicer and the defending
players must do the same but also be

807
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:22,130
aware that if they get

808
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:23,670
okay,

809
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,970
if they get wrong they have
to chase back and stop the,

810
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,150
there are also other factors such as the
other player isn't involved in the play.

811
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,950
He is an offside and can stand anywhere.
All right. Apologies for the length.

812
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,380
Nah Man, you actually cleared
it up a little bit more.

813
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:43,460
It's still don't think I 100% understand
it cause I don't know how far away you

814
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:47,770
have to be from the play and stay
and you can still be on side. Uh,

815
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,530
hope you found this interesting and
please do a show and either Belfast or

816
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:56,210
Dublin so I can go. Thanks and go fuck
yourself. I was out in Dublin last June.

817
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,440
I haven't been a Belfast in,
in a little bit, but, um,

818
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,010
I have to tell you how excited the two
tours I've done this year through Europe

819
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,980
if been incredible.
And um,

820
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,040
I got one more that starts in
Iceland at the end of April and um,

821
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:21,350
uh, it's, I don't know, it's just
incredible the people showing up,

822
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:25,940
the venues I get to play too. Um, yeah,

823
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,390
I dunno,
I'm still kind of a blown away by that,

824
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:33,260
so I'm looking forward to it and I
still have not been down to Australia.

825
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:36,080
I keep saying if something always ends
up coming up, I've got some acting work.

826
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,410
I had to push some dates, but, um,

827
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,600
after I do my next year
up on the next one, I do,

828
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:44,300
I have to go back to Australia because I
haven't been there in a couple of years.

829
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,030
Um,
all right.

830
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,270
And now I just take the specialist and
I got to build a fucking hour back up

831
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:53,570
again and I can't go over there when
it's weak. I got to make sure, you know,

832
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:57,820
cause those are these fucking people
don't screw around it. Right. Um,

833
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,880
so I gotta make sure it's where it needs
to be, but I will figure all of this up.

834
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,010
All right. Um, all right.
By Nuria all beats,

835
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,010
B I n. U. A R a. L. Beats dear bill,

836
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:13,340
have you heard of binary aisle beets?

837
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,650
They're a great alternative to silent
meditation and have the same benefits.

838
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,580
All you need is a nice pair of
headphones and Youtube on your phone.

839
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,360
Just wanted to let you know because
I'm also an angry cunt sometimes.

840
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,993
Um,

841
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:34,190
I found these and they really
help with every negative emotion.

842
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:39,200
They are even a few. There are even a
few that apparently help with migraines.

843
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:43,790
Check them out. Thanks for the laughs.
Is this a real thing? Is this a thing?

844
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,900
Let me see. Here we go. Let me
right. Let me, let me, let me,

845
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,280
let me look this up here.
B.

846
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:53,640
I n a r a l for the people
looking at it up to beats.

847
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,000
All right. Um, all right.

848
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:02,040
This is for meditation. This is
three hours and 15 minutes. Let's go.

849
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,520
We'll little listen to
a little bit of this.

850
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,860
A vegetarian. It's LV. Lily. Eat
French fries all day. Here we go.

851
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,590
Here is some binaural beats.

852
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,300
Sounds like a horror movie.

853
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,453
No.

854
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,550
All right. You know, I can get it to that.

855
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,190
Start off a little scanners started off
alumni going lie to you. I was a little,

856
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:51,510
uh, e Oh. Speaking is
scary movies. Did you, ah,

857
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,370
did you see Jordan peals the
trailer for his new movie?

858
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,190
That movie looks so scary.
I'm almost angry at him because I've got,

859
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,730
I'm going to go see it. I saw that and he
was like, oh my God. And I was like, dude,

860
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:08,710
fuck that movie. Fuck that. I'm
going to go see it. But Jesus Christ.

861
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:15,260
Oh my God, I fucking hate scary
movies, but I love Jordan,

862
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:19,580
so I'm going to go see that movie. And I
also love, this is the last one he did.

863
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:19,791
So,

864
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:24,620
but like this one looks like it's
just full on fucking horror and uh,

865
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,630
I don't need that, but you know,
I'm going to go see it. Alright.

866
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,120
Boyfriend's family is
silent during dinner.

867
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:35,330
We should go see me in d and then we'll
come on the podcast and talk about it.

868
00:54:35,331 --> 00:54:36,560
She'll be like, oh my God, I love that.

869
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:40,970
I love being scared and I'll be fucking
pissed that I went through that shit.

870
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,510
You know, I told you when I saw
it, when I saw the Blair witch,

871
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,540
I had a set at the laugh
factory and I went to the move,

872
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:52,130
like the midnight showing by myself, and
then I walked down to the parking garage

873
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,910
by myself to the car. Just totally
freaked off. Like Josh, Josh.

874
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:04,610
I know I, I'm not one of those people
that can just sit there and be like,

875
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:09,360
this is the movie I fucking buy in and
it's scares the shit out of me. Um,

876
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,950
all right. Boyfriend's family
is silent during dinner.

877
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,160
Yeah.

878
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,770
Okay. Let's see. What do we
do with this one? Dear Bill?

879
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:20,010
I need some advice about a guy
I've been seeing who is great,

880
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:24,630
but his family are kind of strange.
They are lovely and quite nice,

881
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:27,660
but they are incredibly awkward
when together as a family.

882
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,750
It's not that they say or do weird things,

883
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:33,630
it's that we basically sit in
the silence when we're together.

884
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,880
When I first met him, when I
first met them, Jesus Christ,

885
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:40,980
I feel like I should be playing
that and meditation. Music.

886
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:44,760
Well I fucking [inaudible]
cause I read this. Um,

887
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,830
there's nobody there stirring coffee
slowly or they are a tea, whatever it was.

888
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,170
Now when I first met them,

889
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:57,171
I thought that they must have just came
from a funeral because we went out for

890
00:55:57,301 --> 00:56:01,920
lunch and it was eerily silent. I was
trying to be nice and ask a few question,

891
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:04,620
but I was just getting one word answers.

892
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,940
I asked my boyfriend about this and he
had no idea what I was talking about.

893
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,050
Even started to get a bit defensive. Oh,
all right, well there you go. That's,

894
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:15,560
that's just how they are.
Um,

895
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,620
we'd been dating about six months and I
dread seeing that because it feels like

896
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:24,330
I'm being tortured and
an under of speaking.

897
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:25,870
Okay.

898
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:29,560
My boyfriend is completely oblivious
to it and love seeing his family,

899
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,740
which is crazy weird because I would say
he is reasonably outgoing and fun when

900
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:40,180
we go out with a group of friends. Yeah.
That is where it's really fucking weird.

901
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,910
Should I stop seeing him or do you think,

902
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,203
okay,

903
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,080
uh, he missed a word you'd think would
be some good techniques for dealing with

904
00:56:49,081 --> 00:56:53,820
them. Please give me some advice. A,
you're single, you're not married,

905
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:55,200
so this is all about you.

906
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:56,710
All right.

907
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,730
You, you just have to,
you have to figure out,

908
00:56:59,731 --> 00:57:02,370
do I love this guy you haven't
even said you loved them.

909
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,410
Am I into this person enough to put
up with this? Like these people,

910
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:08,760
you have a kid with this guy.

911
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,150
These fucking non talking motherfuckers
are coming over to your house.

912
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,100
All right.

913
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,210
It seems like you're early on.
We like,

914
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:18,910
should I stop seeing this
guy or should maybe a,

915
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:20,250
okay.

916
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,920
It all depends on how
much she liked the guy.

917
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,173
MMM.

918
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,091
That's so,

919
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:31,840
it's so weird that it's not weird that
they're like that and it's not weird that

920
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:34,420
he's oblivious because,
you know,

921
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:39,000
your family just seems like your
family you grew up, but the fact

922
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,360
that

923
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,880
he loves seeing them,
that's what's weird to me.

924
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,530
Like if they just like a not close,
cold family that barely talks,

925
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:53,800
like that's usually would mean that,
you know, I see once every year,

926
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:56,350
year and a half, I come around during
the holidays and then that's it.

927
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,710
But the fact that he goes there all
the time to sit there and then not say

928
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:00,660
anything to them.
Okay.

929
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,753
MMM.

930
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,020
I Dunno. It starts making me wonder if
they're like fucking aliens or something.

931
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:12,620
They're communicating through the center
of their foreheads or some shit. Um,

932
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,890
yeah, that's definitely strange. Uh,

933
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,740
okay.

934
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,850
And the fact that you're so uncomfortable
that now you're thinking maybe there's

935
00:58:22,851 --> 00:58:26,060
some good techniques that you're going
to go in there and Dr Phil and fix the

936
00:58:26,061 --> 00:58:30,800
whole fucking family and one
segment. It's not gonna happen. Um,

937
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,010
so I think you need to,
uh,

938
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,680
you got to make a tough choice there.

939
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,073
All right.

940
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,390
Neither let this Greg guy go and
try to find another great guy.

941
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:45,930
He sound like he's still young. He's still
drafted in the first couple of rounds,

942
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:49,800
so there's plenty of good talent left out
there and maybe you could have more of

943
00:58:49,801 --> 00:58:52,410
a normal family,
but that is a or,

944
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,633
yeah,

945
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,750
you just learn to deal with their
creepy horror show fucking vibe.

946
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,300
But,
um,

947
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,110
I don't know what good techniques
you're going to use to fix that.

948
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,680
Especially when you brought it up to him.

949
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:12,850
He had no idea what you were talking
about and was like defensive about it. So,

950
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,150
so there is that. Um, anyways,

951
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:17,800
okay.

952
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,300
I'm going to try that. That fucking horror
music chanting shit. Sorry. You your,

953
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:25,610
ah, I think I would actually
like this better than

954
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,560
I have a meditation app and it's just
this and this guy just keeps talking

955
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:35,561
throughout being like hello again and
welcome to another beautiful day with an

956
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:37,880
opportunity to clear your mind.

957
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:38,990
Okay.

958
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:39,823
Meditate.

959
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,830
I'd like you to find a comfortable chair

960
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,780
and just sit in it,

961
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:59,580
feel the chair
up against your body.

962
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,740
Are there places that it's

963
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:06,790
okay

964
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:07,990
touching you too much

965
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:15,030
or does it feel just right?
I'm

966
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:21,340
fucking that shit and it's just like,
oh my God, dude, just shut the fuck up.

967
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:25,210
All right. Just tell me to breathe
and that just shut up please.

968
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:27,790
For the love of God shut up.
So I think I would rather,

969
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,980
rather than listen to that guy,
I'd rather listen to this shit.

970
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,373
Josh.

971
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,780
I don't mean to end this so fucking
in such a creepy goddamn way. Um,

972
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,620
maybe I need to listen to this
shit so I can go see Jordan teals,

973
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,370
new fucking movie and not be overly
freaked out and traumatized by it.

974
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:55,060
Um, how great is it that
that guy's making movies is,

975
01:00:55,061 --> 01:00:57,830
it's every once in a while somebody
fucking like that comes along.

976
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,070
It's just awesome. It's awesome. If
you love movies, it's fucking awesome.

977
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:05,430
All right. That is the, uh, that is
the podcast, ladies and gentlemen.

978
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,680
I'll check it on. Yeah, on
Thursday. Go broads, go Celtics.

979
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,510
Um, if anybody knows how, if I can
watch a replay of the moto GP race,

980
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:18,740
I would love to watch it. Um,
send it to my Twitter account.

981
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:21,860
Please let me know. I would love
to see it. All right. That's it.

982
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:24,080
Go fuck yourselves and
I'll see you on Thursday.
