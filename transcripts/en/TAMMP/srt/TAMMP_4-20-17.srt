1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,570
Hey, what's going on? Bill? Burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,280
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Dan,

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,690
I'm just checking in on you. I'm
just checking in on you. Oh, needy.

4
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:19,160
What are you going going to go work out.
There you go. Get on the elliptical.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,440
Do it. All right. That was part
of our prenuptial agreement.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,480
Keep it looking good.
It's exactly what it is.

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,720
You would never dare try to get
a prenuptial agreement with me.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,680
What are you talking about?
I'm throwing it out there right now.

9
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:41,390
I'm going to get up post married,
prenuptial postnuptial agreement.

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,800
No, I'm going to get all
right. It's mine. All mine.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,650
You know I don't even give a shit.
You want all this stuff? I don't care.

12
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:52,190
It's a fucking headache. As long as they
got enough for a sandwich. I'm good.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,730
I want every color of izod shirt.

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,963
Yeah,
seriously though.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,300
Okay.

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,980
I will.
I will leave you.

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,900
There's a certain level that if
you allow it, if you drop below,

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,230
I'm walking his bald,
pasty,

19
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:14,440
redheaded male pushing
50 yeah. Good luck. Okay.

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,480
Don't look at me like I
don't have options. Woman.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,280
I've been out to the strip
malls. I've seen the looks. Okay.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,030
You put me in a strip
mall near that has a,

23
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:28,120
a dentist and a place where
they do your taxes. Okay.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,930
Fucking hedges whipping around.
Yeah.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,480
Uh, she could at least pretend that
I'm still kind of good looking. Right.

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,900
All right. Anyways, what's up everybody?
How are you? How's your week going?

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,140
Is it going bad? Well, it's almost over.

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,420
At least the bad part of it is,
Huh? How about a moment of silence?

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,840
How about a fun moment of silence for
everybody who sitting in a fucking place

30
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:02,750
they don't want to be right now, Huh?
There was your moment and you know what?

31
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,460
That's all you deserve. Why
are you still there? Stand up.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,700
Push that plastic wheelchair
away from that fucking,

33
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:15,200
I know what I want you to do, right?
Don't do that. You need a plan.

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,680
Come up with a fucking plan
and my stomach's can be
grounded like crazy. I just,

35
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,030
I just got off of a, got off of
the plane, had a 7:00 AM flight,

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,860
um, came back from New
York. I went to the, uh,

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,990
and it's just an amazing, a
memorial service for Charlie
Murphy yesterday. And uh,

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,410
I got to tell you this, um, cause you
know, it's a private ceremony. Some,

39
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:41,360
I can give any details, but I will
tell you this, you know, Comedians,

40
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,980
we, a lot of us may die young, but I will
tell you this, we have great funerals.

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,240
It's fucking unbelievable.
It was unbelievable. They,

42
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:53,830
a New York legend was sent
off by legends. It was, um,

43
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,290
it was incredible. It was
really incredible. So. MMM.

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,910
Yeah, I'm still sad though.
Obviously still sad, but he
would have been very happy.

45
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm like morning to speak for
him. Anything but like, uh,

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,050
I hope I get sent off
that. Well, it was a, yeah,

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,790
there was definitely something else.
So that's quite built,

48
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,210
bring up something that you're not going
to really give any details of. Well,

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,540
you know, whatever. I
just, I just, so anyways,

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,590
so everybody hung out afterwards to like
two 30 in the morning and I had like a,

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,520
you know,
7:00 AM flight and

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,470
the only way to it, there's two
ways to handle a 7:00 AM flight,

53
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,590
which is gonna involve like
a fucking 4:30 AM pickup.

54
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,430
All right?

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,130
There's only two ways to do it.
You either go to bed, you know,

56
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:45,240
you drink some hot cocoa at 7:00 PM and
you figure out how you're going to get

57
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:49,410
your fucking eight hours, whatever you
do. What do people do with your pills?

58
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,150
Is that what you do? Well, you sit fucking
Indian style foot of your bed going,

59
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
okay,

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,510
oh,

61
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,780
whatever is whatever that
meditation should is all
right. Which I have not done.

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,560
And I'll tell you the ramifications
of that here in a minute. Um,

63
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,150
do the do that or you just
stay out drinking with your
friends to like two 30 in

64
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,970
the morning and then you come home,
you get about an hour and a half,

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,920
two hours sleep, you stagger to the
fucking airport, whatever, out to the cab.

66
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,970
You go in there and you just,

67
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:22,950
the the biggest thing is not to nod
off at the gate, you got to stay awake,

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,940
but the lights are on in that type of
shit. And then once you get to your seat,

69
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:30,570
that's it. Then you're out.
You're out at sea. It's fucking,

70
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,620
and that's a great way to do it.

71
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:33,930
Cause then you don't have to sit there
bored out of your mind on the flight.

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,713
You know,

73
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,511
by the way,

74
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:41,511
thanks to the person that sent me that
fucking creepy video of that plane crash

75
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,430
in which for some dumb reason,
I'm sitting there watching it.

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,940
But the tail section
coming off this plane,

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,090
these pilots trying to figure out
a fucking way to try to land it,

78
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,910
which of course you can at that point.
Um,

79
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,770
I wasn't surprised that they didn't
invert. That's always a fun thing.

80
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:01,440
Half asleep to be watching because you
know, you have a sleep going like, wait,

81
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:05,820
am I on this flight or is this a, is
this a, should I be feeling that failing?

82
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,280
You know, they sent me this video and
I'm not getting on this plane. Well,

83
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:08,611
you know what?

84
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:13,611
I got on that God plane and I went
right to sleep and woke up like,

85
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,720
you know, five hours later, five hours
later on a six hour flights. Perfect.

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,353
You know,

87
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,290
they come over, sir. Would
you like anything? Would you
catch a kid? Well, my job.

88
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,330
Well I go, yeah. What do you
got? Well, we got a mush rob.

89
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:31,910
We got a a Portobello mushroom
sandwich. Yeah, that's sounds gross.

90
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,100
What else she got? I don't even
know what the other thing was.

91
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,620
I thought when she said the
mushroom thing with the other thing,

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,450
I thought it was all the same thing.
I go,

93
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:41,150
is that all one thing or is that two
things? She goes, that's two things.

94
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,860
And I went,
all right,

95
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,400
okay.

96
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,400
I, I don't want anything. I got a
new thing. I don't eat on planes.

97
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,050
I'm not fucking doing it. I'm not
fucking doing it. It's just, it's,

98
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,330
it's fucking shit food. Empty
going to do it. You're like,

99
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,510
I'm fucking five miles up from the
surface of the, of the, of, of the earth.

100
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,100
You know,

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,950
the only thing you should be eaten up
there as shit that you shouldn't be like,

102
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,400
like Pringles potato chips and stuff.
Why would you eat those?

103
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,310
And you'd just sit in there, you get
beat, just becoming a fat fuck. So, uh,

104
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,780
I sort of been doing this thing this
year is I'm trying to fucking drop some

105
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,640
weight here. You know, even though I'm
a dad, I'm not going to have the fun,

106
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,060
I'm not having the fucking
dad bod not having that thing.

107
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:30,110
You know the thing when you go to lift
up your arms just shirt comes up and it's

108
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:35,111
just that fucking pork shoulder spilling
out on the side and ain't happening to

109
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,630
me. Um, I was speaking of
which, so, uh, you know,

110
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,350
I packed hastily cause I,

111
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:47,180
I when I went to Boston first
and then to New York and uh,

112
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,790
so I grabbed a suit and everything
in my shoes. So I have them, uh,

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,510
for the memorial service and I forgot
to bring dark socks. All right.

114
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,100
And also I was working out and doing the
elliptical and all that type of stuff.

115
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:05,300
So I thought it brought enough boxers
and I didn't. So I was like, fuck.

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,850
So I landed in New York,

117
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,890
I get to the hotel and it's, you
know, would like in midtown and shit.

118
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,180
We meaning me and all my
fucking personalities. And uh,

119
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,300
so I called me up. I tell her where
I'm at. I was like, fuck, you know,

120
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,920
the car's coming to get me to take me over
to the service, you know, I need some,

121
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,620
uh, underwear, which should I
go, there's, this is New York.

122
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,220
There's no fucking gaps anywhere.
They're all like downtown or way up town.

123
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,200
And I'm right in the middle.
I don't have time.

124
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,840
And she asked me where I was at and
she goes, oh, I ain't know that.

125
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,630
And I was like, I guess
like a gay neighborhood. She
goes, go around the corner,

126
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:42,210
there's upstairs and one of those fucking
stores. So we've got across the store,

127
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,060
right straight, right. And
there's like, you know,

128
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,270
the second you see the
mannequins, you know what I
mean? You know that it's, yeah,

129
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,140
this is like a, it's a gay
store. It's for gay men.

130
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,070
So I don't give a fuck. I need underwear,
right? Gay Men still wear underwear.

131
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,260
So I walk in there and it
was just like Jesus Christ.

132
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,090
It was like cock rings on the
fucking wall, which by the way,

133
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:06,650
I thought that was the same is like, uh,
like when people get their Dick Pierce,

134
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,190
which I still don't know where they
do that. It's like a navel ring,

135
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:14,840
but it's on your Dick. So I
thought a cock ring, you know, I,

136
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,240
I thought that that was the same thing,
but it wasn't, it was like a, uh,

137
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,470
look like something you'd use in plumbing,
like a gasket.

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,040
Evidently you put that around your
Dick for some reason. Then what?

139
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,380
You Swivel your hips and it's like,
oh,

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,220
it's like a hula hoop for
your dick evidently. Right?

141
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:32,180
So I fucking go in the back and the
underwear, it's like ridiculous.

142
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,750
It was like all these Fred Flintstone
prince, you know what I mean?

143
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,340
There was like Asilis Shit.

144
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,800
And then I finally find a pair that was
just all black and on the waistband it's

145
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,200
said nasty pig.
So

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,020
finally just yell over to the
dude behind the counter, go, hey,

147
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,320
you got any like normal like mainstream
underwear here? And he's like,

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,930
defy normal or main street.
And I was like, oh, I don't,

149
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,460
it doesn't say nasty pig on the phone.

150
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:07,140
The waistband it as
material around the ass.

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,640
And when it does, it doesn't say fuck
my whole on the back, you know, regular,

152
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,820
just underwear. It's like, hang on.

153
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:20,250
And he fucking comes over there and he
ended up finding some that would just,

154
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:23,970
we'll all black, you
know, Greg Louganis style.

155
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,260
But uh, they will, the only
size they had was small,

156
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:31,920
which was fucking hilarious to
me because I was just like, yeah,

157
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,050
why would you have a medium?
This is like gay guys.

158
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:38,400
They want to see that their boyfriends
junk spilling out the side. Oh,

159
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,960
you nasty pig.

160
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,050
So I had the leave there and the
closest place was fucking Tj Maxx.

161
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,210
Oh my God.
The fucking animals.

162
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,130
Okay.

163
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,050
Uh,
half of it was the way they had the store,

164
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,890
like the way they had this store set up,
it's just like,

165
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,930
it was so fucked up. It's like,
it was like I was in Manhattan,

166
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,700
the crown jewel of fucking
cities in the United States.

167
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,830
Right. And the second I
walked into fucking Tj Maxx,

168
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,800
I mean I might as well Ben at a fucking
Walmart in the middle of nowhere.

169
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:21,000
And I am talking down to Middle
America and they're Walmart's.

170
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,010
I am talking down to it,
although I'm not actually,

171
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,730
you know those Walmarts aren't that
bad other than on black Friday.

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Black Friday is a day you don't want to
fucking go down there cause that's like

173
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
white people, bloods and crips,
you know, that's our version of it.

174
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,030
It's flannels and fucking in flip flops.

175
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,261
That's,

176
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:47,220
that's our bloods and crips and that
you don't still want to be there on that

177
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,020
day. You know when they have one Atari
for $3 way in the back of the store and

178
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,300
everybody's just basically
going to trample people.

179
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,140
Like they go into the fucking who concert
Cincinnati way back in the day there.

180
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,640
I mean other than that, you know,
it's not, it's not that bad a store,

181
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,813
you know,

182
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,810
it's got all kinds of food,
giant selections. I've gone
in there a bunch of times.

183
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,890
I don't know why I brought that up.

184
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:14,520
I just don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about this point. Oh TJ Maxx,

185
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:18,990
you get the Max bowl,
the number at Tj Maxx.

186
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,550
Um, so I go in there and it's, you know,

187
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,530
typical Manhattan fucking store where
it's like half the stores downstairs and

188
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,850
the others in is on the ground floor on
the others is like upstairs, you know,

189
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,980
cause they slammed this
little fucking store in there

190
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,813
and um,

191
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,650
finally find some underwears
and uh, I'm like, fuck,

192
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,040
I got to stand in this God
damn like Disneyland level
line. And like, all right,

193
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:48,020
they got 12 fucking registers open.
So even though there's like 24 people,

194
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,040
you know,

195
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,500
roughly each one of these cashiers just
knocks out to people and then it's turn,

196
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,390
all right, this shouldn't be this bad.
And it was this woman in front of me.

197
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,420
I don't know what kind of soap she used,
but like I would divorce her,

198
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,560
I swear to God, even if she made my
heart stop, I'd be like, I love you.

199
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,980
I wish nothing for you.
But this fucking soap,

200
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,560
it's a specific soap. I've smelt it
before. It wasn't, she didn't smell bad.

201
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:18,670
She smelled of this soap. I don't
know what the fuck it is, but it just,

202
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,450
I can't be around it but I had to beat
or someone's going to cut me and then

203
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,310
they just walked you through,

204
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,530
you know the Disneyland thing where
you walk all the way to the right.

205
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,480
Then you go back to the left, you know,
zig zagging all the way up. It just the,

206
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,610
the shit that they had,
you know,

207
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:37,600
the impulse buys in everybody. If they
weren't staring at their fucking phones.

208
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,910
We're just picking up these things and
the more I saw people picking up the shit,

209
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:46,930
looking at it like the angry or I was
getting like, why are you picking that up?

210
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,700
You don't need that. Let me find you
the names of these fucking things. Okay.

211
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:55,600
They had this one thing it said, I would
thank you from the bottom of my heart,

212
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,470
but for you,
my heart has no bottom.

213
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,390
And it was just framed in this piece of
shit would frame and on a white piece of

214
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,570
paper with just regular font

215
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,090
like please don't walk away with the
bathroom key, like the same kind of font,

216
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:16,270
you would use it that at the gas
station they wrote that fucking cheesy

217
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:20,200
heartfelt message.
And what the fuck was the next one?

218
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,690
Oh, it was just some sort
of like coconut almonds,

219
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,400
yummy clusters or something was called.
I know

220
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,100
that's how I was able to, this is like
this is the demographic come in, let's,

221
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,350
let's become fat fucks and talk
about how we love each other.

222
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,211
I don't want to talk about,

223
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:40,760
so I'll get the underwear and I
fucking get back to the hotel room.

224
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:44,150
And I realize in my looking
down at everybody in Tj Maxx,

225
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:48,380
I forgot to get socks so I had to
go back to the gay store, you know.

226
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:49,780
Okay.

227
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,920
And, um, you know,

228
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:54,040
I come walking into the store and the
same dudes behind the counter and I was

229
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,090
just like, dude, you got a,
you sell socks here, you know,

230
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:59,260
cause all he had was white sox.

231
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:01,210
I was going to sit down at church and
they were going to come up and they're

232
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,260
like ankles, like Nike socks. I was
going to with like fucking wing tips.

233
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,300
I wasn't going to do that.
So they actually had regular socks.

234
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,800
So that's what I learned at the gay store.
They just had regular Nike socks,

235
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,660
but for some reason the tag
on him took a picture of it.

236
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,340
I got to send this, I'm going
to going, you know what?

237
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:22,450
I'm going to tweet this out or whatever.
The tag on the socks just said, bitch,

238
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:24,910
please.
There's just some,

239
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,440
I guess woman or maybe a guy in
drag with his face all twisted up.

240
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,300
Um, I got on bitch please.
Socks by Nike, you know,

241
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,760
and they feel normal.
These are made for gay feet,

242
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:40,030
but for some reason they seem
to fit mine just, just fine.

243
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,870
I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about. Um,

244
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:48,340
I mentioned earlier that I hadn't been
meditating and it came to a head so to

245
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,950
speak. And uh, remember
when I was bitching,

246
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,100
updating my fucking phone and then trying
to update my laptop and there's no one

247
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:58,790
to call and I'm typing in
the right passwords and the
two are not in sync and I

248
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,630
don't know how to do it.

249
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I finally had a meltdown and my laptop
was closed and I took my phone and I just

250
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:13,211
fucking slammed it down like
corner first onto my laptop,

251
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,750
you know, somewhere between
a jab in an overhand right.

252
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,010
But it was a stabbing motion and uh,

253
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,413
I dunno what

254
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,140
then I fucking open my laptop
in the screen was broken.

255
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,180
So my question I have for you guys

256
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,720
okay,

257
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,170
is not, do I need anger management?
I know I do. My question is,

258
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,660
is can people just fix a fucking screen?
Do you can do that.

259
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:40,950
It's not the hard drive. It was no
water get, they just take that out.

260
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:43,740
It's like I got a broken windshield and
my laptop and they can they do that?

261
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm going to find out,

262
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm going to find out because once again
I didn't back up anything there and I

263
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:51,000
was just really thinking like I did back
anything up and I didn't back anything

264
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:55,830
up my phone when I dropped it in the
toilet. But do I miss any of that data,

265
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,980
data, whatever the fuck you say
it. And the reality is is I don't.

266
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,450
Okay.

267
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,630
I mean, most of my pictures is taking
pictures of shit that I hate. You know,

268
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,590
people's dirty feet and fucking heartfelt
photos and gay socks that say bitch,

269
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,020
please. I mean, do I, do I really
need to save these somewhere?

270
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,260
I just loved the idea that these
exist somewhere in a cloud,

271
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:20,130
in this cease fucking people trying to
figure out with the shit that I take a

272
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:24,450
picture of. Like what can they
sell me next? K Gay socks,

273
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,490
coconut clusters.

274
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,430
I would thank you from the
bottom of my heart, but for you,

275
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,020
my heart has no problem.
Okay.

276
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:36,040
This is a fat gay male
with a sugar addiction.

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,460
Yeah.

278
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,540
And a foot fetish.

279
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,120
Um, anyways, so I got to
read, um, oh, by the way,

280
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:49,550
my daughter laugh for
the first time yesterday,

281
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:53,270
twice and I was on the road and I didn't
get to see, I didn't get to hear it, but,

282
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,220
um, I'm hanging out with
her all, all day today, um,

283
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,860
other than the benefit I
have to do tonight and I'm
really like psyched. Like, um,

284
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,830
I came home and of course dropped
everything and picked her up and um,

285
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,500
okay.

286
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,560
She just smiled for like three
minutes straight, which was amazing.

287
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,400
And I could tell she was getting sleepy
and I can read her body language.

288
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,170
She was on the floor and she
started doing this thing,

289
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,460
like she's trying to sit up and my guard,

290
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,180
she wants to get up and I just put
her on my lap and we were watching

291
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,050
these people in Maine rebuild
cabins or some shit and um,

292
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,000
I felt her start to slump
slumped to the right.

293
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:35,110
And I knew that she was falling asleep
and she was asleep, which as I was like,

294
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,030
this is a perfect time to do the podcast,

295
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,490
but felt so awesome her just laying there.

296
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,540
Then I stayed there for like
another 20 minutes and I'm,

297
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,630
I'm kind of breaking down parenting into
just like sections where I know like I

298
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,700
was like, all right, I got 18 years
with her before she goes off to college.

299
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,960
God willing, so how many months
is that? I just did three of them.

300
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,600
And then the other big countdown
is the first three years.

301
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,100
So the first three years,

302
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,970
all I have to do is just fill
her up with love support.

303
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,520
And when I do lose my
temper because I'm going to,

304
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:15,060
I'm going to apologize to her and
ask her to help me work on it.

305
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,190
So she's not like necessarily afraid, you
know, I just don't, I got to kill this,

306
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:25,110
uh, this aspect of my family tree cause
everything else is pretty, uh, you know,

307
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,010
acceptable.

308
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,300
But I don't want to be the guy stabbing
his fucking laptop with this phone,

309
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,040
freaking his kid out. Do I do, you know,

310
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:36,420
who wants to be that person and you
laying on your death bed one day and they

311
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,530
come walk in and you know,

312
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:41,060
peaking and still nervous to be around
you just be like, yeah, sorry. Yeah,

313
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,020
sorry.
Are you

314
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,370
back at eight two dash 82

315
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,250
I don't want to have that. So, um, yeah,
I'm hanging out with her all day today,

316
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:55,780
reading books and the whole thing.
So I've also decided like, all right,

317
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:59,830
so I still gotta do my two weekends a
month. So those would be like six days.

318
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:00,664
I won't see her,

319
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,290
but I'll actually see her more than if
I had like a nine to five because then I

320
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,830
can come home and just totally
focused on her, you know,

321
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:13,240
for the next 10 days before I go
out on the road. So, you know,

322
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:16,270
and every person that's apparent,
they all say it goes by so fast,

323
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:20,570
it goes by so fast. So I just keep
thinking that every fucking time. Um,

324
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,480
every day. So hopefully, hopefully, you
know, hopefully I don't fuck this up,

325
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,300
but I'm not gonna lie to you. I know
I'm a mess, so I'm definitely, uh,

326
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,470
you know, the jury's out. Hate people walk
her home a great dead. I'm a great dad.

327
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:39,070
Shut the fuck up. That's not for you to
say somebody says that to you. You can't,

328
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,340
um, you know, awesome.
You know he's awesome.

a regular on the daily show.

344

He's got up specials on

345

He's the voice of anger in inside

connecting everyday on social media.
Uh,

347
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,940
I remember the first
time I saw Louis Black,

348
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:04,330
I saw him at the comedy cellar
right before he blew up.

349
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,570
He was about my age,
maybe a little younger,

350
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:11,530
about 45 46 and it was one of
those fucking hot brutally.

351
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,010
Okay.

352
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,420
Hot summer days.

353
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,640
Okay.

354
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,473
In La.

355
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,560
And he came and still wearing his sport
coat and all that and he was just like

356
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,960
miserable.
Okay.

357
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,020
He already walks around with
a certain level of agitation,

358
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,730
which I could totally relate to is,

359
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:32,731
remember I said I walk around at a six
so going up to 10 isn't that quick of a

360
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:33,714
ride.

361
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,930
So Louis came in and there was
like nobody in the fucking club.

362
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,180
It was like the mid nineties,
like 95,

363
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,540
96 and comedy was still
dealing with the 80s hangover,

364
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,600
still waiting to make another comeback.
And uh,

365
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:49,960
so he goes in there in front
of like three fucking people.

366
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:51,670
I don't have three tables of people,
whatever.

367
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,090
And I had never seen him
and he got in there and

368
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,380
okay,

369
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,380
he was legit upset about how fucking
hot it was outside and then you combine

370
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:07,711
that with his material and
his stage persona and he
got that finger going and it

371
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:09,310
was like,

372
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,300
I'll never forget that
I was fucking dying.

373
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,720
This guy when he was in front
of like 11 people murdering,

374
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,200
like he was at Carnegie Hall and um,

375
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,280
that was just one of those great jet just
moved to New York and it was just one

376
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,940
of those great, oh my God,
who the fuck is this guy?

377
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,310
How have I never seen this guy?

378
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,980
How doesn't everybody know who
this guy is? And within like three,

379
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,340
I was like 95,

380
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:42,341
96 and I want to say he hit around like
99 w was quick within like by 1999 I

381
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:47,180
think he went on the road and he did that.
Um,

382
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,770
that classic comedy tour lineup.
It was him,

383
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:56,630
Mitch Hedberg and Dave Attell.
Can you believe that? That
was a fucking tour. Hey,

384
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:59,150
we're going to go out and go see
comedy tonight. Oh yeah. Who you seen?

385
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,810
I don't know this Guy Louis Black,

386
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:05,030
this up and coming guy.

387
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,320
Mitch Hedberg Hedberg I'm trying to
think of a David tell had his show yet.

388
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,380
Um,
and I think he had insomniac.

389
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,770
Maybe Mitch had his half hour up,
but um,

390
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,510
I didn't even get to see that fucking
talk cause I was too busy slugging it out

391
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,390
my fucking hell rooms. I would have
loved to have seen that. Um, so anyways,

392
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,670
so I'm sitting here,
Babylon are supposed to be reading a

393
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,950
advertise. I'm telling stories.
All right. Frame bridge everybody.

394
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:33,960
Yeah.

395
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,430
So weird. I just shot one day on a
movie and Framingham, Framingham,

396
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:41,070
Massachusetts out there on
fucking off of route nine.

397
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:44,430
I believe I used to do the Nixon
Framingham up there a long time ago,

398
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,060
over 20 years where they go,
all right,

399
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:50,630
frame bridge everybody give your
personal experience using frame,

400
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:55,310
bridge.com if applicable. I've never
used it. It sounds like a great idea,

401
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,370
but I stabbed my fucking
laptop in the face,

402
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,740
stabbed in the face. I always have to say
in the face, you know what that's from.

403
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,570
That's from uh,

404
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,310
the great performance given by that
cop in the bathroom in reservoir dogs.

405
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,350
The way he, the rhythm of the way
he speaks is soap. Like perfect cop.

406
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,210
I said, buddy, I am going
to shoot you in the face.

407
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,090
You don't put your fucking hands.
And that dashboard,

408
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,780
that's one of those movies when
you've seen it that many times,

409
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,760
like all the usual lines and everybody
quotes out of the fucking blue. You know,

410
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:39,760
I'm trying to be a fucking professional.
You always got big kill asshole.

411
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,690
All those ones that everybody knows.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bam, Bam, Bam,

412
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:49,680
Bam, Bam. Look at dam and done.
What I told them not to do. Um,

413
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,850
everybody knows those lines. But then
once you want, once you get up to like,

414
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,230
you know, three, 400 viewings of it,

415
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,100
which you really can do on a summer if
you fucking put your mind to it and you

416
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,690
have no social life like me.
Yeah. That's when you start going,

417
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:07,370
who the fuck is this guy playing this cop?
The way he's killing this monologue?

418
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,600
Um, I dunno. I Dunno why.

419
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,190
It just reminded me of this comedian
Denny live from Philly and I remember when

420
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:20,240
he was, he was doing this white
Guy Dan. He's a black dude.

421
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:23,600
So he's doing this white guy. And the
way he was doing the cadence and the way,

422
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,430
the way the guy was talking was,
uh, you know, that was like sort of,

423
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,380
uh, at the height of the fallout
of the hacky white guy. Like James.

424
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,670
Like I got to do my taxes,

425
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:39,200
like that fucking thing that
he was actually legitimately
doing a white guy, uh,

426
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,520
like an impression that I
couldn't even fucking do,

427
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:45,320
but I could see the dude that he
was doing. Um, I don't know those,

428
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:48,110
those are the nerd things that I like when
I'm watching shit. But anyways, frame,

care and attention because meeting your

449

expectation is as important

450

I mean? It's between Yahoo. Uh,

465
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,900
and you Teddy's the old CB there.
I'm

466
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,770
sorry, Blue Apron. Everybody

467
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,140
remember that fucking movie that was
just on the CB was just above fucking

468
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,540
truckers. Kris Kristofferson
was, was in it. And uh,

469
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,730
Ernest Borgnine was, was the state
trooper up there in the helicopter convoy.

470
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,160
And I remember they were trying to get
this fucking convoy of trucks to just

471
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:41,210
stop driving.
It was like vanishing point with like 70,

472
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,730
72,000 fucking 18 wheelers.
They just,

473
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,650
when they weren't stopping for nothing,
man,

474
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:48,900
they were just out there and you're
just going to keep on driving.

475
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,590
So these cops were trying to stop them
and they for some reason couldn't send

476
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:57,180
out Ernest Borgnine, you know, sort of
the go between, between truckers and cops.

477
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:01,050
Like he understands him. So there's
some cut up in the elevator going, hey,

478
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:05,800
you fucking truckers. This is, this is
the place where up here to helicopter,

479
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,980
uh, we really don't have
a gun turn or anything,

480
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:10,770
but we're watching you so you
better be nervous. You know,

481
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:13,230
he's trying to make threats up
there in his fucking helicopter.

482
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,550
So Ernest Borgnine, it just
shakes his head. He goes at, it,

483
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:22,230
ain't going to listen to
that. And he grabs the CB,
goes these truckers, he goes,

484
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:26,240
they got a language all their own and
then he goes to talk to them down there

485
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,210
and he goes,
this is the bear in the air.

486
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,640
The,
I forget how you delivered that line.

487
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,050
Even fucked it up.
This is the bear in the air,

488
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,920
like smokey the bear, you know,
smokey the cop and all of them.

489
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,690
Do I have to break it down to,
you know,

490
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,250
that's one of the things that
I can't fucking stand. I hate

491
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,120
when obvious slang people feel
that they have to break it down to,

492
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,623
you know what I mean?

493
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,400
I remember one time I saw this
one man show and the guy goes,

494
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,560
we were going into Maddie Hattie.
He goes,

495
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,440
that's Manhattan for all you white
people. I want to be like, oh,

496
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,560
it was so slick. And Claire, I mean,
you're almost saying man at and,

497
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,800
and of course they got a laugh. White
people, they don't understand things.

498
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,970
Um, all right, let's get, what am I, am I
technically in the middle of a read here?

499
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,430
All right. Blue Apron. Yeah.
All right. Yeah. This is,
this is about food and aprons.

500
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,270
Okay.
Blueprints.

501
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,250
Mission is to make incredible home
cooking accessible to everyone. All right?

502
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,400
It's about time.
Up until in the button until blue apron,

503
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,910
only the upper 1% were allowed
to have food prepared for them.

504
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,170
All the rest of us were
fucking nine on bushes. Uh,

505
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,380
because blue apron ships the exact amount
of each ingredient required for the

506
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,310
recipe. You better not fucking
spill anything. Uh, no.

507
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:56,311
They are reducing food waste because
it's the exact amount you bought.

508
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:57,100
Bastards.

509
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,550
You're going to be like a crack head
crawling around a motel fucking floor

510
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:04,920
looking for a rock. Did the
bays will go under the bed. Uh,

511
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,450
cooking together, build
strong family bonds, juniors.

512
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:13,120
It's time to put in the sugar.
Research shows, research it.

513
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,890
Research shows that Blue Apron families
cook nearly three times more often.

514
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,790
Those who spend a lot at restaurants or
at high end grocery stores can now spend

515
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,890
under $10 per person for a
delicious meal each meal.

516
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,000
It's a weird word. Just realize that meal,

How great is that fucking
advertising campaign?

530
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,820
I have never had a desire to eat there
ever. It's like, I don't want fast food.

531
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:31,654
Roast beef.

532
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,430
Does anything fucking die quicker
than fucking roast beef? I mean,

533
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,740
I know it's dead already.
You know,

534
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,190
rotting flesh is all you fucking
stupid fucking vegetarians.

535
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:47,330
Talk about like your plant's not
dead already to the such dopes.

536
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,410
They really are. Um, all of
them. Every single one of them.

537
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,110
I put them all in one group because
that's what I do because I don't take the

538
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:58,220
time to get to know people.
Okay. And right now it's,

539
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,080
I think this country needs a little
more of that, don't you? All right. Cso,

00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:38,670
it's almost like a game show,
right? All of it higher.

563
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,460
You know this, there's certain
things that you have to say.

564
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,570
I can't think of a catchphrase from
a game show. Anyways. Hey Bill,

565
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,970
the shows already a hit.
It's in its second season.

566
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:51,270
They don't need you fucking retooling it.
It's like some ghosts producer.

567
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,530

let's plow ahead here.

587
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,320
Um, all right. Okay. Oh Jesus,

588
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:19,270
Boston sports. Let's Talk Boston
sports. Dudded add that data.

589
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,100
Um, Jesus, what a couple of fucking
games those were. Um, all right,

590
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,960
let's start with the Boston Bruins.

591
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,590
We've lost three games
straight to the Ottawa.

592
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,420
Um, I missed the law. Um,

593
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,660
I missed yesterday night's game
cause I was at the memorial service,

594
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:42,490
but I definitely watched game two and
game three. And although we had a furious,

595
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,720
got back and gave three, it was not
enough. I was actually in the north end.

596
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,050
I mean the cigar bar smoking his stogy
hoping it was going to be a good thing.

597
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,920
Um, what a fuck. And that was a great goal
though. And over time it'll give and go.

598
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,170
Got To admit. And, uh, I dunno. I Dunno.

599
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,540
They just been out playing us and they,
they deserve it.

600
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:08,950
Now granted it was a shit call but
there's going to be shit calls.

601
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,540
It's just going to
happen. But uh, you know,

602
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:13,980
yeah,

603
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,490
I dunno. Shit call a no shit call.
We've lost three games in a row.

604
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,980
So I mean get all,
you can only look in the mirror.

605
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,250
So we'll see what happens.
Um,

606
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,170
the excitement of the Bruins making
the playoffs is quickly subsiding here.

607
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,540
I would like to see them win a series
and now there they got their fucking

608
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,090
back's up against the wall.
So we'll see. We'll see.

609
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,870
We'll see when game five comes
up, I imagine tomorrow. All right.

610
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,090
And then the Celtics,
oh,

611
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:45,510
Jesus Celtics have been
completely exposed.

612
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,270
I know that that's probably
been said a thousand times.

613
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:51,360
You know what's funny is when
I first got back into the NBA,

614
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,800
which I got back into it cause Paul Versey
was coming out here and he loves the

615
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:57,150
NBA and he was staying with me,

616
00:37:57,151 --> 00:38:01,740
him and his lovely wife staying with me
and my lovely wife for like four or five

617
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:06,210
days and a I'm a hell of a host or
what a host, what a host. Right.

618
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,020
So I'm just like, all right, well you
know, I would first he's coming to town,

619
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,430
I got to get some Johnny blue,

620
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,370
I got to get the NBA package
so he can watch his Nixon.

621
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,110
I just got into the Celtics.
So I've been watching him since uh,

622
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,050
December of 2015. And my first
thought when I was watching him,

623
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:22,620
I was like,

624
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,030
where are we going to go with this game
plan where we have this superstar point

625
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:31,440
guard, we live and die by the three
and we don't get any fucking rebound.

626
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,690
So like I don't understand
how you can win.

627
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,370
Yeah.
Anything

628
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,070
playing basketball like that.
But then here's what happened.

629
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,600
They did and they just kept
winning and everybody else,

630
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:48,690
it just became socially acceptable on
the hard court to fucking run down the

631
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,090
court with the ball. Three people. Right.

632
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,240
Okay.

633
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,050
From the other team onto the net.
Nobody on your team or maybe one guy.

634
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:59,580
It was totally acceptable to say,

635
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:02,490
I'm not waiting for my other teammates
and I'm just going to launch a fucking

636
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:06,900
three, you know, and we're up by one with
like fucking eight minutes to go like,

637
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:10,140
what are you doing? But
that just, you know,

638
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,440
the same way after Jordan,
people were just like, well,

639
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:17,040
I guess we don't need to feed it to a big
man. Do we even need a big man, Randy?

640
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,470
[inaudible]. So I was like, all
right, I guess this is the new game.

641
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,520
So we ended up not only doing great
this year once we added Al Horford.

642
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,770
Yeah,
we fucking got the number one seed.

643
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,240
And at that point I completely forgot
about my initial reaction to the way that,

644
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,820
that they were playing. And I was
like, all right, I guess, yeah.

645
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,060
With a number one seed, we
get an eight seat. All right.

646
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,030
And after the first two
games, it's like a, you know,

647
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:48,150
it seems like the opposite.

648
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,440
Seems like they're the number one seat
and where the eight seat and I kind of

649
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,520
knew we were in trouble.

650
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,700
Uh,

651
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,820
I guess,

652
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,080
well when Charles Barkley just basically
broke our team down after the first

653
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:03,240
half or the first game going,
yeah,

654
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:07,170
you just basically you double team Isaiah
tried to make a beat the double and

655
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:11,100
then if these guys don't hit their threes,
you know, they're not getting any fuck.

656
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:12,900
I don't know what the hell he said,
but it's just like, all right,

657
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:17,670
this guy's already figured this out.
Basically what I'm saying is, um,

658
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,280
I think this is the first
real test for Brad Stevens,

659
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,230
this next game where he has to make a
drastic adjustment with the players that

660
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:30,231
he has because they figured
this out before the opening
tip off and that has led

661
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:36,390
to two losses and we have not been
able to make any adjustment. And,

662
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,990
um,

663
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,230
what's fascinating about the bowls is
even though that they're an eighth seed,

664
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:45,000
they got Rondo and they got Dwayne
Wade and Rondo's got a ring and I think

665
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:49,140
Dwayne Wade, he's got what?
Three rings, four rings, he won,

666
00:40:49,141 --> 00:40:53,010
one was shack and then two with
Lebron. Lebron, I can't remember,

667
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:54,840
I'm not a big NBA guy.
He's got at least three weeks.

668
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,610
So there's four rings right there.

669
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,120
Those guys have been
through it numerous times.

670
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,680
So they're not afraid of the
ebbs and flows of the game.

671
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,220
They're not afraid of playing on the road.
They're just totally chill.

672
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,280
And I think that affects
the rest of the team.

673
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,420
And then he got Butler and Lopez who
have just fucking animals just hitting,

674
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,780
you know, 12 foot jumpshot's 15 footers
while getting all these rebounds.

675
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:26,781
And then that fucking white dude from
Europe Vladi devakt junior d voc jr he's

676
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,150
fucking started hitting threes.
And um,

677
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,180
okay.

678
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,430
You know, we're getting asses kicked, so

679
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,370
I'll see what happens.
And you know, but uh,

680
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,540
Jesus Christ, I mean, we were down
three to one in hockey and went down,

681
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:48,280
oh to going out to Chicago.
So I'm hoping I'm

682
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,000
okay.

683
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,940
I'm hoping. Yeah. Jesus. So we
don't get fucking swept. I mean,

684
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,600
I dunno. Brutal, brutal, brutal. But
you know, what are you gonna do it?

685
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,340
And it's just a fucking game. I realized
that if the first one when I'm watching,

686
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,440
you know, Isaiah Thomas
crying about losing this sift,

687
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,700
it was a really a brutal week
for that type of shit. Huh?

688
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,180
An Aaron Hernandez hung himself.
Man, that was fucking brutal.

689
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,260
The whole thing was brutal.

690
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,030
And then all those fucking jokes that
people were making like, oh yeah,

691
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:21,710
he got hung up. He's got an upper
body injury to the fucking neck.

692
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,140
Oh, all this dumb shit. Um, that,

693
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,860
that shit to me is always weird.

694
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:31,100
Where are you going to sell that guy's a
murderer. He's a fucking piece of shit.

695
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,010
And uh, and then everybody acts like a
fucking animal when he kills himself.

696
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,753
MMM.

697
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,560
Of course there's people out there
that don't, that think, you know,

698
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,660
something else happened.
It's like, all right,

699
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:46,380
you got just got acquitted on those
other two murders and then you had a good

700
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:51,120
chance for an appeal. You
know, you had some hope. Um,

701
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,330
but I dunno who the fuck knows.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

702
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,450
I don't necessarily agree with that
or disagree. I have no fucking idea.

703
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,200
But I do know was I think if any
sort of a fucking human being,

704
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:05,510
the whole thing was just sad.
It's just like, you know,

705
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:12,310
it's just all these lives just
fucking thrown away over nothing.

706
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,390
Granted,
you know,

707
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,300
obviously he pulled the fucking trigger
and everything like that, but still,

708
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:20,090
I don't take any sort of a, I don't
know. Honestly, I didn't get that.

709
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,350
I was just like, ah. It was just,
yeah, it's one of those things.

710
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,430
He's just from front to back.
You just wish it didn't happen.

711
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:30,170
And everybody's like, oh, hey,
here's my fucking obvious joke.

712
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,730
Um, so anyway. Oh God.

713
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,890
Am I really gonna be talking
about fucking him killing himself?

714
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:41,280
Is that how I'm going to end this
podcast? How long has this podcast, Ben?

715
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,580
43 minutes. While you know what?
I'm in overtime. All right,

716
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,560
let's end up on something
positive tonight.

717
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,620
Of course I'm working tonight and this
fucking band that I've been wanting to

718
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:54,990
see cause it drummers, amazing. I
don't have his name in front of me.

719
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:55,651
I should have it,

720
00:43:55,651 --> 00:44:00,150
but I don't spend called
Russian circles is playing.

721
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,183
MMM.

722
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,330
Is playing at the uh, oh for fuck sakes.
What's the name of the fucking thing?

723
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:11,670
Every goddamn theater begins with a
p out here. Hang. I gotta hit pause.

724
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:16,290
I got to make sure I have this information
hung. Hang on the palladium. Fuck.

725
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,340
Get ticket.

726
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,090
Paramont the pompadour the
fucking palladium actually
that's where Richard Pryor,

727
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,430
uh, tape, uh, live on the sunset strip.

728
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,420
So I was introduced to this band.
They played this song,

729
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:33,040
Harper Louis Live and uh,

730
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,610
their drummer absolutely fucking
blew me away with his, um,

731
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,380
just how solid
his is.

732
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,200
His beats were,
and then his use of dynamics.

733
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:48,670
It's just on a whole other fucking level,
which I really think is a lost art. Um,

734
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,540
but they're playing tonight,
um, since 6:30 PM. And, uh,

735
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,251
I wish I could go,

736
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:58,630
but I got a fucking God damn
benefit so I can't make it.

737
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:01,960
But I'll post that clip of the band
playing that song. Harper Lewis.

738
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,650
It's the live version and just the way,
you know,

739
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:08,590
it just starts off with the drum beat
that he's playing and he's playing it,

740
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:13,510
you know, it gradually
builds in intensity, gets
louder and louder. And then,

741
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,880
uh, then when they go into that, I
don't, it's an instrumental band.

742
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,190
I don't know how to say versus chorus.
I don't know what the fuck they're doing,

743
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:20,770
but just absolutely blew me away.
If you've got nothing to do tonight,

744
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:23,800
you want to see a killer band, go down
and get a couple of tickets to that.

745
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:27,820
I guarantee you have a great time.
Um, all right, that is the podcast.

746
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:33,160
Um, Eh, I guess cause it's
four 20, like weed man,

747
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:36,250
I guess a, Andrew's going to be
giving you guys some extra clips.

748
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:39,370
It's going to be a little bit
longer and a, and that is it.

749
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,130
And it was an honor to be a
Charlie Murphy's memorial service.

750
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:45,300
It was an honor to know that
guy. And I want to thank, uh,

751
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,500
everybody who spoke that night.
Last night though,

752
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:52,870
the way that they sent that guy
off, it was just like, it was

753
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,610
okay.

754
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,480
It just was a level of greatness in
the performances that I saw from the

755
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:01,510
comedians that went up and spoke. And, um,

756
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:02,630
okay.

757
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:06,780
Charlie was one of the greats,
you know, and it was just,

758
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:11,430
it was such a perfect sendoff and I'm
really glad that I was able to be there

759
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:13,680
and witness it. All right.
So that's it. I'll, uh,

760
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:17,250
you fucking cunts have
a great weekend and, uh,

761
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:19,160

uh,

762
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,200

Monday or a Thursday gone by.
