1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,330
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,570
Bill Burr is time for the Thursday 
afternoon,

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,020
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:07,854
and Ahh,

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,880
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,714
Oh needy.
What are you going going to go work out 

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,160
there you go.
Get on the elliptical.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,470
Do it.
All right.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,470
That was part of our prenuptial 
agreement.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,450
Keep it looking good.
It's exactly what it is.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,643
You would never dare.
Try to get a prenuptial agreement with 

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:33,740
me.
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,680
Throwing that out there.
I'm throwing it out there right now.

14
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm going to get a post married,
prenuptial postnuptial agreement.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,490
No,
I'm going to get all right.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,360
Mine all mine.
You know I don't even give a shit.

17
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,650
You want all this stuff?
I don't care.

18
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:50,470
It's a fucking headache.
Songs.

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,190
They got enough for a sandwich.
I'm good.

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,150
I want every color of izod shirt.
Yeah,

21
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,720
seriously though.
I will.

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,613
I will leave you.
There's a certain level that if you 

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,900
allow it,
if you drop below,

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,230
I'm walking his bald,
pasty,

25
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:13,270
redheaded male,
pushing 50.

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,813
Okay.
Don't look at me like I don't have 

27
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,624
options.
Woman.

28
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,250
I've been out to the strip malls.
I've seen the looks okay.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,980
You put me in a strip mall near that has
a dentist and a place where they do your

30
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:28,120
taxes.
Okay.

31
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,700
Fucking hedges.
Whipping around.

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,373
Yeah.
She could at least pretend that I'm 

33
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,480
still kind of good looking.
Right.

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,381
Alright.
Anyways,

35
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,730
what's up everybody?
How are you?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,120
How's your week going?
Is it going well?

37
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,480
It's almost over.
At least the bad part of it is.

38
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,390
Huh?
How about a moment of silence?

39
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,763
How about a good moment of silence for 
everybody who's sitting in a fucking 

40
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,980
place?
They don't want to be right now.

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,720
Huh?
There was your moment and you know what?

42
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,870
That's all you deserve.
Why are you still there?

43
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,213
Stand up.
Push that plastic wheelchair away from 

44
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,550
that fucking.
I know you were.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,620
Then what do you do?
Right?

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,230
Don't do that.
You need a plan.

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,350
Come up with a fucking plan and my 
stomach's can be grounded like crazy.

48
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,040
I just,
I just got off of a,

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,430
got off of the plane,
had a 7:00

50
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,360
AM flight,
came back from New York.

51
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,830
I went to the,
uh,

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,453
it's just an amazing,
a memorial service for Charlie Murphy 

53
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,480
yesterday and uh,
I got to tell you this because,

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,140
you know,
it's a private ceremony.

55
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,480
Some I can give any details,
but I will tell you this,

56
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,360
you know,
comedians,

57
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,040
we,
a lot of us may die young,

58
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,980
but I will tell you this,
we have great funerals.

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,000
It was fucking unbelievable.
It was unbelievable.

60
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:49,834
They,
a New York legend was sent off by 

61
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:53,350
legends.
It was,

62
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,480
um,
it was incredible.

63
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,130
It was really incredible.
So,

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,170
um,
yeah,

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,320
still sad though,
obviously still sad,

66
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,154
but he would have been very happy.
I'm like morning to speak for him 

67
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,120
anything but like,
uh,

68
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,300
I hope I get sent off that well.
It was A.

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,220
Yeah,
there was definitely something else.

70
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,870
So that's quite built.
Bring up something that you're not going

71
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,210
to really give any detail stuff.
Well,

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,860
you know,
whatever.

73
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,760
I just,
I just.

74
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,660
So anyways,
so everybody hung out afterwards to like

75
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,690
2:30
in the morning and I had like a 7:00

76
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,690
AM flight and the only way there's two 
ways to handle a 7:00

77
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,090
AM flight,
which is going to involve like a fucking

78
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,560
4:30
AM pickup.

79
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
All right?

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,500
There's only two ways to do it.
You either go to bed,

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,410
you know you drink some hot cocoa at 
7:00

82
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,230
PM and you figure out how you're going 
to get your fucking eight hours.

83
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:49,410
Whatever you do.
What do people do with your pills?

84
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,150
Is that what you do when you sit fucking
Indian style 40th bed going,

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,993
okay.

86
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,410
what?
Whatever's whatever that meditation shit

88
00:03:59,411 --> 00:03:59,941
is.
All right.

89
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:00,774
Which I have not done and I'll tell you 
the ramifications of that here in a 

90
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,104
minute.
Do you either do that or you just stay 

91
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:09,030
out drinking with your friends to like 
2:30

92
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,970
in the morning and then you come home,
you get about an hour and a half,

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,900
two hours sleep.
You staggered to the fucking airport,

94
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,080
whatever out to the cab.
You go in there and you just do.

95
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,690
The biggest thing is not to nod off at 
the gate,

96
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,553
you got to stay awake,
but the lights are on and that type of 

97
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,910
shit.
And then once you get to your seat,

98
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:27,930
that's it.
Then you're out.

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,910
You're out.
Let's see,

100
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,743
let's fucking.
And that's a great way to do it because 

101
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,930
then you don't have to sit there bored 
out of your mind on the flight,

102
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,713
you know,

103
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,923
by the way,
thanks to the person that sent me that 

104
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:43,140
fucking creepy video of that plane crash
in which for some dumb reason,

105
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:43,974
I'm sitting there watching it,
but the tail section coming off this 

106
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,234
plane,
these pilots trying to figure out a 

107
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,440
fucking way to try to land it,
which of course you can at that point,

108
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,853
um,
I wasn't surprised that they didn't 

109
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,770
invert.
That's always a fun thing.

110
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,330
Half asleep to be watching because you 
know,

111
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,440
you're half asleep going like,
wait,

112
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,370
am I on this flight or is this a,
is this a,

113
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,030
should I be feeling that failing?
You know,

114
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,130
they sent me this video and I'm not 
getting on this plane.

115
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:08,611
Well,
you know what,

116
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:09,444
I got on that Goddamn play.
And I went right to sleep and woke up 

117
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:18,190
like five hours later,
five hours later on a six hour flights.

118
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,043
Perfect.

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,333
You know,

120
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,680
they come over,
sir.

121
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,290
Would you like anything?
Would you care to give up my job?

122
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,250
Well,
I go,

123
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,150
yeah.
What do you got?

124
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,180
Well,
we got a mushroom.

125
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,110
We got a Porta Bella mushroom sandwich.
Yeah,

126
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,690
that sounds gross.
What else you got?

127
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,100
I don't even know what the other thing 
was.

128
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,620
I thought when she said the mushroom 
thing with the other thing,

129
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,903
I thought it was all the same thing.
Goes at all one thing or is that two 

130
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:40,341
things?
She goes,

131
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,410
that's two things.
And I went,

132
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,244
all right.

133
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,650
I,
I don't want anything.

134
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,400
I got a new thing.
I don't eat on planes.

135
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not fucking doing it.
I'm not fucking doing it.

136
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,120
It's just,
it's fucking shit.

137
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:56,954
Food empty.
And do you have like a fucking five 

138
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,160
miles up from the surface of the,
of,

139
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,480
of,
of the earth,

140
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,363
you know,
the only thing you should be eating up 

141
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,750
their shit that you shouldn't be like 
pringles potato chips and stuff.

142
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Why would you eat those?
And you just sit in there and get big,

143
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,403
just becoming a fat fuck.
So I sort of been doing this thing this 

144
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,293
year is,
I'm trying to fucking drop some weight 

145
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,150
here,
you know,

146
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,590
even though my dad,
I'm not going to have the fun,

147
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,060
I'm not having the fucking dad bought.
Not having that thing,

148
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,900
you know,
thing where you go to lift up your arms,

149
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,110
your shirt comes up in this.

150
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,740
Just that fucking pork shoulder spilling
out on the side.

151
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,780
That ain't happening to me.
Um,

152
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,691
oh.
Speaking of which.

153
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,524
So,
uh,

154
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,203
you know,
I packed hastily because I went to 

155
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,130
Boston first and then in New York and 
uh,

156
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,700
so I grabbed a suit and everything and 
my shoes.

157
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,060
So I have them for the memorial service 
and I forgot to bring dark socks.

158
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,450
All right.
And also I was working out and doing the

159
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:03,110
elliptical and all that type of stuff.
So I thought it brought enough boxes and

160
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,760
I didn't.
So I was like,

161
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,850
fuck.
So I landed in New York.

162
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,350
I get to the hotel and it's,
you know,

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,193
would like in mid town and Shit,
we meaning me and all my fucking 

164
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:18,740
personalities and uh,
so I called me up,

165
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,670
I tell her where I'm at.
I was like,

166
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,330
fuck,
you know,

167
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,820
the car's coming to get me to take me 
over to the service,

168
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,890
you know,
I need some,

169
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:25,790
uh,
underwear.

170
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,620
What should I go?
This is New York.

171
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,330
There's no fucking gaps anywhere.
They're all like downtown a way uptown.

172
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,170
I'm right in the middle.
I don't have time.

173
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,390
And she asked me where I was and she 
goes,

174
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,210
I know that.
And it was like,

175
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,970
I guess like a gay neighborhood.
She goes,

176
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:38,940
go around the corner,
there's up,

177
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,250
there's one of those fucking stores.
So go across the store,

178
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,100
right street,
right.

179
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,060
And there's like,
you know,

180
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,370
the second you see the mannequins,
you know what I mean?

181
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,280
You know that it's,
yeah.

182
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,640
This is like a,
it's a gay store.

183
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,400
It's for gay men.
So I don't give a fuck.

184
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,570
I need underwear,
right.

185
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,583
Gay Men still wear underwear.
So I walk in there and it was just like 

186
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,040
Jesus Christ.
There was like cock rings on the fucking

187
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,060
wall,
which by the way,

188
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,450
I thought that was the same is like,
uh,

189
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,533
like when people get their Dick Pierce,
which I still don't know where they do 

190
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:08,924
that.

191
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,060
It's like a navel ring,
but it's on your Dick.

192
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,610
So I thought a cock ring,
you know,

193
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,090
I thought that that was the same thing,
but it wasn't,

194
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:17,924
it was like a,
a looked like something you'd use in 

195
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,500
plumbing,
like a gasket.

196
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,930
Evidently you put that around your Dick 
for some reason.

197
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,300
Then what?
You Swivel your hips and it's like,

198
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,010
it's like a Hula hoop for your dick 
evidently.

199
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:28,844
Right.
So I fucking go in the back and the 

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,180
underwear,
it's like ridiculous.

201
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,090
It was like all these Fred Flintstone,
prince,

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,310
you know what I mean?
There was like Atlas Shit.

203
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,953
And then I finally find a pair that was 
just all black and on the waistband it 

204
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:43,614
said nasty pig.
So finally just yellow to the dude 

205
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:51,020
behind the counter go,
hey,

206
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,290
you got any like normal,
like mainstream underwear here.

207
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,370
And he's like,
define normal or main street.

208
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,920
And I was like,
well I don't,

209
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,300
it doesn't say nasty pig on the,
on the waistband,

210
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,400
it has material around the ass and when 
it does,

211
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,590
it doesn't say fuck my whole on the 
back,

212
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,670
you know,
regular,

213
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,820
just underwear,
like hang on,

214
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,683
the fucking comes over there.
And he ended up finding some that would 

215
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,580
just wear all black,
you know,

216
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,420
Greg Louganis style.
But they will.

217
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,303
The only size they had was small,
which was fucking hilarious to me 

218
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,920
because I was just like,
yeah,

219
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,050
why would you have a medium?
This is like gay guys.

220
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:37,320
They want to see their boyfriends junk 
spilling out the side.

221
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,933
Oh you nasty pig.
So I had the leaves there and the 

222
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,600
closest place was fucking Tj Maxx.
Oh my God.

223
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,210
They'll fucking animals.

224
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,020
And half of it was the way they had the 
store,

225
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,050
like the way they had the store setup,
it's just like it was so fucked up.

226
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,930
It's like it was like I was in 
Manhattan,

227
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,700
the crown jewel of fucking cities in the
United States.

228
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,923
Right.
And the second I walked into fucking Tj 

229
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,540
Maxx,
I mean I might as well benefit a fucking

230
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,374
walmart in the middle of nowhere.
And I am talking down to Middle America 

231
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,080
and they're Walmart's.
I am talking down to it,

232
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,250
although I'm not the expert,
you know,

233
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:26,730
those walmarts aren't that bad other 
than on black Friday.

234
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,564
Black Friday is the day you don't want 
to fucking go down there because that's 

235
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,500
like white people,
bloods and crips,

236
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,750
you know,
that's our version of it.

237
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,130
It's flannels and fucking in flip flops,
that's,

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,113
that's our bloods and crips and you 
don't still want to be there on that 

239
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:47,581
date.
You know,

240
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,414
when they have one Atari for $3,
way in the back of the store and 

241
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:54,300
everybody's just basically going to 
trample people.

242
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,163
Like they go into the fucking who 
concert Cincinnati way back in the day 

243
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:58,770
there.
I mean,

244
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:01,100
other than that,
you know,

245
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,160
it's not,
it's not that bad.

246
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,994
A store,

247
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,753
you know,

248
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,400
it's got all kinds of food.
Giant selections.

249
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,920
I've gone in there a bunch of times.
I don't know why I brought that up.

250
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,520
I still knew what the fuck I'm talking 
about this point o t j Maxx,

251
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:18,990
you get the Max for the man above at Tj 
Maxx.

252
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,530
So I go in there and it's,
you know,

253
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,530
typical Manhattan fucking store where 
it's like half the stores downstairs and

254
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,364
the oldest in is on the ground floor on 
the other is like upstairs because they 

255
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,980
slammed this little fucking store in 
there

256
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,813
and um,

257
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,200
finally find some underwears and I'm 
like,

258
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,034
fuck,
I gotta stand in this God damn like 

259
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,860
Disneyland level line.
And like,

260
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,810
all right,
they got 12 fucking registers open.

261
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,520
So even though there's like 24 people,
you know,

262
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,873
roughly each one of these cashiers just 
knocks out to people and then it's my 

263
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,760
turn.
All right,

264
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,420
this shouldn't be this bad.
And it was this woman in front of me.

265
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,420
I don't know what kind of soap she used,
but like I would divorce her.

266
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,090
I swear to God.
Even if she made my heart stop,

267
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,560
I'd be like,
I love you.

268
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,950
I wish nothing for you,
but this fucking soap.

269
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,120
It's a specific soap.
I've smelled it before.

270
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,560
It wasn't,
she didn't smell bad,

271
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,260
she smelled of this soap.
I don't know what the fuck it is,

272
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,000
but it just,
I,

273
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:19,834
I can't be around it,
but I had to be around someone who's 

274
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:24,310
going to cut me and then they just 
walked you through,

275
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,144
you know,
the Disneyland thing where you walk all 

276
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,530
the way to the right.

277
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,760
Then you go back to the left,
you know,

278
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:28,594
zig zag and all the way up.
It just the shit that they had the 

279
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:37,030
impulse buys in everybody.
If they weren't staring at their fucking

280
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,490
phones,
we'll just pick it up.

281
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,910
These things and the more I saw people 
picking up this shit,

282
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:44,800
looking at it like the angrier I was 
getting,

283
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,900
like,
why are you picking that up?

284
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,770
You don't need that when you find you 
the names of these fucking things.

285
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,263
Okay.
They had this one thing that said I 

286
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,600
would thank you from the bottom of my 
heart,

287
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,513
but for you,
my heart has no bottom and it was just 

288
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,160
framed in this piece of shit frame and 
on a white piece of paper,

289
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:06,994
which is regular font,
like please don't walk away with the 

290
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,090
bathroom key,
like the same kind of font.

291
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:14,620
You would use the data at the gas 
station.

292
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,350
They wrote that fucking cheesy heartfelt
message.

293
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,000
And what the fuck was the next one?
Oh,

294
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,690
it was just some sort of like coconut 
almonds,

295
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,170
yummy clusters or something was called 
that.

296
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,570
And that's how I was able to.
This is like,

297
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,080
this is the demographic I'm in.
Let's,

298
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,350
let's become Fed Fox and talk about how 
we love each other.

299
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,920
I don't want to talk about.
So I get the underwear and I fucking get

300
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:40,754
back to the hotel room.
And I realized in my looking down at 

301
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,590
everybody in Tj Maxx,
I forgot to get socks.

302
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,380
So I had to go back to the gay store,
you know.

303
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,860
And um,
you know,

304
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,753
I come walking into the store and the 
same dudes behind the counter and I was 

305
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,581
just like,
dude,

306
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,830
you got a,
you sell socks here,

307
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,280
you know,
because all he had was white socks.

308
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,114
I was going to sit down at church and 
they were going to come up and they're 

309
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:01,840
like,
ankles,

310
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,710
like Nikes,
socks.

311
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,270
I was gonna wear with like fucking wing 
tips.

312
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:07,300
I wasn't going to do that.
So they actually had regular socks.

313
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,130
So that's what I learned at the gay 
store.

314
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:09,964
They just had regular Nike socks.
But for some reason the tag on him took 

315
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,650
a picture of it.
I got to send this,

316
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,340
I'm going to,
you know what,

317
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,090
I'm going to tweet this out or whatever.
The tag on the socks just said,

318
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,560
bitch,
please.

319
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,440
I guess woman or maybe a guy in drag 
with his face all twisted up.

320
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,110
I got on bitch please socks by Nike,
you know,

321
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,760
and they fail normal.
These are made for gay feet.

322
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:40,030
But for some reason they seem to fit 
mind just just fine.

323
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,760
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking 
about.

324
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,313
Um,
I mentioned earlier that I hadn't been 

325
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,850
meditating and it came to a head so to 
speak,

326
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,950
and uh,
remember when I was bitching,

327
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,003
updating my fucking phone and then 
trying to update my laptop and there's 

328
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,694
no one to call and I'm typing in the 
right passwords and the two are not in 

329
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:58,934
sync and I don't know how to do it.
I finally had a meltdown and my laptop 

330
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:09,431
was closed and I took my phone and I 
just fucking slammed it down like corner

331
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:14,530
first onto my laptop,
you know,

332
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,750
somewhere between a jab in an overhand 
right.

333
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,930
But it was a stabbing motion and a,

334
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,413
I don't know what.

335
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,140
Then I fucking opened my laptop and the 
screen was broken.

336
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,150
So my question I have for you guys

337
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,700
is not,
do I need anger management?

338
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,220
I know I do.
My question is,

339
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,150
is can people have just fix a fucking 
screen?

340
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,950
You could do that.
It's not the hard drive.

341
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,950
There was no water get.
They just take that out.

342
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,800
It's like I got a broken windshield on 
my laptop.

343
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,740
Can they,
can they do that?

344
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,070
I'm going to find out.
I'm going to find out because once again

345
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:47,904
I didn't back up anything there and I 
was just really thinking back anything 

346
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:52,650
up and I didn't back anything up my 
phone when I dropped it in the toilet.

347
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,310
But do I miss any of that data,
data,

348
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,490
whatever the fuck you say it.
And the reality is,

349
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,324
is I don't,
I mean most of my pictures is taking 

350
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:03,610
pictures of shit that I hate,
you know,

351
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,590
people's dirty feet and fucking 
heartfelt photos and gay socks that say,

352
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:10,891
Bitch,
please.

353
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:11,461
I may do.
I do.

354
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:12,294
I really need to save these somewhere.
I just loved the idea that these exist 

355
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,174
somewhere in a cloud in this,
these fucking people trying to figure 

356
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:22,080
out what the shit that I take a picture 
of like what can they sell me next.

357
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,460
K Gay socks,
coconut clusters.

358
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,860
I would thank you from the bottom of my 
heart,

359
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,780
but for you,
my heart has no problem.

360
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:32,614
Okay.
This is a fat gay male with a sugar 

361
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:40,231
addiction in a foot fetish.
Um.

362
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,620
Anyway,
so I got to read.

363
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,121
Oh,
by the way,

364
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:49,550
my daughter laugh for the first time 
yesterday,

365
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,950
twice and I was on the road and I didn't
get to see,

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,550
I didn't get to hear it,
but I'm,

367
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,150
I'm hanging out with her all day today,
um,

368
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,120
other than the benefit I have to do 
tonight and I'm really like psyched.

369
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,830
Like I came home and of course dropped 
everything and picked her up and um,

370
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,660
she just smiled for like three minutes 
straight,

371
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:11,494
which was amazing and I could tell she 
was getting sleepy and I can read her 

372
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:15,574
body language.
She was on the floor and she started 

373
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,070
doing this thing like she's trying to 
sit up.

374
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:18,490
I'm like,
all right,

375
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,323
she wants to get up and I just put her 
on my lap and we were watching these 

376
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:26,440
people in Maine rebuilding cabins or 
some shit.

377
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,100
And um,
I felt there start to slump,

378
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,993
slumped to the right.
I knew that she was falling asleep and 

379
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,110
she was asleep,
which as I was like,

380
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,030
this is a perfect time to do the 
podcast,

381
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,490
but felt so awesome her just laying 
there.

382
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,324
Then I stayed there for like another 20 
minutes and I'm kind of breaking down 

383
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:48,040
parenting into just like sections where 
I know,

384
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,040
like I was like,
alright,

385
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,700
I got 18 years with her before she goes 
off to college.

386
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,520
God willing,
so how many months is that?

387
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,563
I just did three of them and then the 
other big countdown is the first three 

388
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,164
years.
So the first three years all I have to 

389
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:08,721
do is just fill her up with love support
and when I do lose my temper because I'm

390
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:11,724
going to,
I'm going to apologize to her and ask 

391
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:18,000
her to help me work on it.
So she's not like necessarily afraid,

392
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,310
you know,
I just don't,

393
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,610
I got to kill this,
uh,

394
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,390
this aspect of my family tree because 
everything else is pretty,

395
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,170
uh,
you know,

396
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,003
acceptable.
But I don't want to be the guy stabbing 

397
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,290
his fucking laptop with this phone.
Freaking is cut out.

398
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,300
Do I do know who wants to be that 
person?

399
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,400
And you laying on your death bed one day
and they come walking in Pekin instill,

400
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,110
nervous to be around you.
Just be like,

401
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:40,944
yeah,
sorry.

402
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,690
Sorry.
Back to,

403
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,460
I don't want to have that,
so I'm,

404
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,210
yeah,
I'm hanging out with her all day today,

405
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,480
reading books and the whole thing.
So I've also decided like,

406
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,314
all right,
so I still gotta do my two weekends a 

407
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,830
month.
So those will be like six days.

408
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:03,670
I won't see her,
but I'll actually see her more than if I

409
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:04,504
had like a nine to five because then I 
can come home and just totally focused 

410
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,800
on her,
you know,

411
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:11,980
for the next 10 days before I go out on 
the road.

412
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,210
So,
you know,

413
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,270
and every person that's apparent,
they all say it goes by so fast,

414
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,104
it goes by so fast.
So I just keep thinking that every 

415
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:22,330
fucking time.
I'm every day.

416
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:23,350
So hopefully,
hopefully,

417
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,450
you know,
hopefully I don't fuck this up,

418
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,050
but I'm not gonna lie to you.
I know I'm a mess so I'm differently.

419
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,810
Uh,
you know,

420
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,780
the jury's out.
Hate people walk around with great debt.

421
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,160
I'm a great dad.
Shut the fuck up.

422
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,260
That's not for you to say somebody says 
that to you.

423
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,450
You can't,
um,

424
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,350
you know.
Awesome.

425
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,960
Always awesome.
You know why?

426
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,600
Because I said so.
I'm alright.

00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:04,330
I saw him at the comedy cellar right 
before he blew up.

451
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,570
He was about my age,
maybe a little younger,

452
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,010
about 45,
46,

453
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:14,011
and it was one of those fucking hot,
brutally hot summer days

454
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,473
in La.
And he came and still wearing his sport 

455
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,530
coat and all that.
And he was just like,

456
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,960
miserable.
Okay.

457
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:26,020
He already walks around with a certain 
level of agitation,

458
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:29,620
which I could totally relate to is.
Remember I said I walk around at a six,

459
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,280
so going up to 10 isn't that quick of a 
ride.

460
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,900
So Louis came in and there was like 
nobody in the fucking club.

461
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,180
It was like the mid nineties,
like [inaudible] 95,

462
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,510
96 and comedy was still dealing with the
eighties hangover,

463
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,010
still waiting to make another comeback.
And so he goes in there in front of like

464
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,160
three fucking people,
I don't know,

465
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,670
three tables of people,
whatever.

466
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,343
And I had never seen him.
And he got in there and he was legit 

467
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,523
upset about how fucking hot it was 
outside and then you combine that with 

468
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:03,994
his material and his stage persona and 
he got that finger going and it was 

469
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:09,604
like,

470
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,300
I'll never forget that I was fucking 
dying.

471
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,720
This guy when he was in front of like 11
people murdering,

472
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,140
like he was at Carnegie Hall.
And um,

473
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,933
that was just one of those great.
Jed just moved to New York and it was 

474
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,660
just one of those great,
oh my God,

475
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:31,310
who the fuck is this guy?
How I never seen this guy.

476
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,910
How does everybody know who this guy is 
in?

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,340
Within like three.
I was like 95,

478
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:40,610
96 and I want to say he hit around like 
99.

479
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,463
W was quick within like by 1999,
I think he went out on the road and he 

480
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,260
did that.
Um,

481
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,770
that classic comedy tour lineup.
It was him,

482
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,500
Mitch Hedberg and Dave attell.
Can you believe that?

483
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:56,630
That was a fucking tour.
Hey,

484
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,280
we're going to go out and go see comedy 
tonight.

485
00:22:58,281 --> 00:22:59,150
Oh yeah.
Who you seen?

486
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,810
I don't know.
This Guy Louis Black,

487
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:06,620
this up and coming guy,
Mitch Hedberg.

488
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,933
I'm trying to think of a David tell had 
his show yet and I think he had 

489
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:16,310
insomniac.
Maybe Mitch had his half hour up,

490
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,144
but um,
I didn't even get to see that fucking 

491
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,150
talk because I was too busy slugging it 
out my fucking hell.

492
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,440
Rooms.
I would have loved to have seen that.

493
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,390
Um,
so anyways,

494
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
so I'm sitting here,
Babylon and supposed to be reading a

495
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,520
advertise.
I'm telling stories.

496
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:31,950
All right.
Frame bridge everybody.

497
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,763
That's so weird.
I just shot one day on a movie and 

498
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,430
Framingham,
Framingham,

499
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:41,070
Massachusetts out there on fucking off 
of route nine,

500
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:41,904
I believe.
I used to do the Nixon Framingham out 

501
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:46,790
there a long time ago.
Over 20 years where they go.

502
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,601
All right.
Frame Bridge.

503
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,434
Everybody.
Give your personal experience using 

504
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:52,250
frame bridge.com
if applicable.

505
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,310
I've never used it.
It sounds like a great idea.

506
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,340
But I stabbed my fucking laptop in the 
face.

507
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,540
Stabbed in the face.
I always have to say in the face,

508
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,970
you know what that's from.
That's from,

509
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,873
uh,
the great performance given by that cop 

510
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:11,420
in the bathroom in reservoir dogs.
The way he,

511
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,350
the rhythm of the way he speaks is soap.
Like perfect cop.

512
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,030
I said,
buddy,

513
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,643
I am going to shoot you in the face.
You don't put your fucking hands in a 

514
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,324
dashboard.

515
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,780
That's one of those movies when you've 
seen it that many times,

516
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,643
like all the usual good lines that 
everybody quotes out of the fucking 

517
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:34,791
blue,
you know,

518
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:38,180
I'm trying to be a fucking professional.
You always got big killed,

519
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,420
asshole.
All those ones that everybody knows.

520
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,140
Yeah,
yeah,

521
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,360
yeah.
Bam,

522
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,720
Bam,
Bam,

523
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,553
Bam,
Bam.

524
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,140
Look at them and done what I told them 
not to do.

525
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,970
Everybody knows those lines.
But then once you want,

526
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:55,220
once you get up to like three,
400 viewings of it,

527
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,163
which you really can do in the summer if
you fucking put your mind to it and you 

528
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,760
have no social life like me.
Yeah.

529
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,594
That's when you start going,
who the fuck is this guy playing this 

530
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:08,670
cop the way he's killing this monologue?
Um,

531
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,630
I dunno,
I don't know why.

532
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,973
It just reminded me of this comedian 
denny live from philly and I remember 

533
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,660
when he was doing this white guy 
denny's,

534
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,040
a black dude,
so he's doing this white guy and the way

535
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:26,240
he was doing the cadence and the way,
the way the guy was talking was,

536
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,403
you know,
that was like sort of at the height of 

537
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:33,220
the fallout of the hacky white guy like 
that.

538
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,670
He's like,
I gotta do my taxes,

539
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:37,730
like that fucking thing.
But he was actually legitimately doing a

540
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:38,564
white guy,
like an impression that I couldn't even 

541
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:41,804
fucking do it,
but I could see the dude that he was 

542
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,310
doing.
Um,

543
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,663
I don't know those,
those are the things that I like when I 

544
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:47,870
watched and shit.

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,190
the CBI was just above fucking truckers.

599
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,920
Kris Kristofferson was,
was in it.

600
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,290
And uh,
Ernest Borgnine was,

601
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,070
was the state trooper up there in the 
helicopter.

602
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,933
Convoy.
And I remember they were trying to get 

603
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,960
this fucking convoy of trucks to just 
stop driving.

604
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,220
It was like vanishing point with like 
70,

605
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,770
72,000
fucking 18 wheelers.

606
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,350
They just weren't,
they weren't stopping for nothing,

607
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,850
man.
They were just out there and you're just

608
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,684
gonna keep on driving.
So these cops were trying to stop them 

609
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,670
and they for some reason couldn't.
So now Ernest Borgnine,

610
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,563
you know,
sort of the go between between truckers 

611
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,110
and cops,
like he understands them.

612
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,810
So there's some cut up in the elevator 
going,

613
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:02,360
hey,
you fucking truckers.

614
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,373
This is,
this is the place where up here to 

615
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,963
helicopter,
we really don't have a gun turret or 

616
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,424
anything,
but we're watching you so you better be 

617
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,770
nervous,
you know,

618
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:13,230
he's trying to make threats up there and
this fucking helicopter.

619
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,710
So Ernest Borgnine,
it just shakes his head.

620
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,690
He goes,
that ain't going to listen to that.

621
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,810
And he grabs the CB,
goes these truckers.

622
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:24,030
He goes,
they got a language all their own.

623
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,250
And then he goes to talk to them down 
there.

624
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:30,200
And he goes,
this is the bear in the air.

625
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,640
Now I forget how you delivered that 
line.

626
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,050
Even fucked it up.
This is the bear in the air,

627
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,580
like smokey the bear,
you know,

628
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,220
smokey the cop.
Do I have to break it down to,

629
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,183
you know,
that's one of the things that I can't 

630
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:47,764
fucking stand.
I hate when obvious slang people feel 

631
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,610
that they have to break it down to you.
You know what I mean?

632
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,400
I remember one time I saw this one man 
show and the guy goes,

633
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,560
we were going into Maddie Hattie.
He goes,

634
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,600
that's Manhattan for all you white 
people.

635
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:02,470
I want to be like,
oh,

636
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,720
I couldn't figure that one out.
It was so.

637
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,910
It was so slick and clever.
I mean,

638
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:14,230
you're almost saying Manhattan.
And of course it got a laugh.

639
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,800
White people,
they don't understand things.

640
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,330
Um.
All right,

641
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,164
let's get.
What am I on my technically in the 

642
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,353
middle of a read here.

643
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,400
All right.
Blue Apron.

644
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,234
Yeah.
Alright.

645
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,670
This is about food and aprons.
Okay.

646
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:28,504
Blue aprons mission is to make 
incredible home cooking accessible to 

647
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:33,250
everyone.
All right?

648
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,380
It's about time.
Up until then,

649
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,214
the button tell blue apron.
Only the upper one percent were allowed 

650
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:38,734
to have food prepared for them while the
rest of us will fucking nine on bushes 

651
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,193
because blue apron ships the exact 
amount of each ingredient required for 

652
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,960
the recipe.
You better not fucking spill anything.

653
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,973
No,
they are reducing food waste because 

654
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:57,050
it's the exact amount you bought.
Bastard,

655
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,410
you're going to be like a crackhead.
Crawled around a motel,

656
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,300
fucking floor looking for a rock.
Did the basil go under the bed?

657
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,660
Cooking together,
build strong family bonds,

658
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,703
juniors,
it's time to put in the sugar research 

659
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,110
shows,
research it.

660
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,920
Research shows that Blue Apron families 
cook nearly three times more often.

661
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,760

It was just so many different ways you 

676

Read Blue Apron,

677
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:21,310
a better way to cook,
right?

678
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:22,450
Like fucking ving rhames.

679
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,283
We have the meats.
How great is that fucking advertising 

680
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,124
campaign?
I've never had a desire to eat there 

681
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:30,820
ever.
It's like I don't want fast food.

682
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:31,654
Roast beef.
Does anything fucking die quicker than 

683
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,430
fucking roast beef?
I mean,

684
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,660
I know it's dead already.
You know,

685
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,220
rotting flesh is all you fucking stupid 
fucking vegetarians.

686
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:47,300
Talk about like your plants not dead 
already to the such dopes.

687
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,420
They really are.
All of them.

688
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:51,254
Every single one of them.
I put them all in one group because 

689
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,310
that's what I do because I don't take 
the time to get to know people.

690
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,150
Okay.
And right now it's.

691
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,440
I think this country needs a little more
of that,

692
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:01,380
don't you?
Right.

693

749
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,510
Not to nitpick but I would've spelled it
s e e s e o.

750
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,580
So when you spell it out,
you know,

751
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,780
two weeks.
Two SS.

752
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:03,800
Two E's.
Two O's.

753
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,350
See,
so cecil.

754
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,400
Um,
alright let's plow ahead here.

755
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,630
All right.
Okay.

756
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,160
Oh Jesus.
Boston sports.

757
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:18,800
Let's Talk Boston sports that it at that
data.

758
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,100
Um,
Jesus.

759
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:22,840
What a couple of fucking games those 
were.

760
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,110
Um,
all right,

761
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:24,944
let's start with the Boston bruins.
We've lost three games straight to the 

762
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,580
Ottawa senators.
Um,

763
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,463
I missed the,
I missed yesterday night's game because 

764
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:39,430
I was at the memorial service,
but I definitely watched game two,

765
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,293
game three.
And although we had a furious got back 

766
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:44,770
and [inaudible] three,
it was not enough.

767
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,750
I was actually in the north end.
I mean the cigar bar smoking his stogy,

768
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,320
hoping it was going to be a good thing.
What a fuck.

769
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:56,950
And that was a great goal though.
And overtime they'll give and go,

770
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,530
got to admit.
And uh,

771
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,423
I dunno,
I dunno if they'd just been out playing 

772
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,810
us and they deserve it.
Now,

773
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:08,950
granted it was a shit call,
but there's going to be shit calls.

774
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,870
It's just going to happen.
But uh,

775
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:12,843
you know,

776
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,930
I don't know shit.
Call a no shit.

777
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,490
Call.
We've lost three games in a row.

778
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,324
So,
I mean,

779
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,530
you can only look in the mirror.
So we'll see what happens.

780
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,453
Um,
the excitement of the bruins making the 

781
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:26,904
playoffs is quickly subsiding here.
I would like to see them win a series 

782
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:31,464
and now they're,
they get their fucking backs up against 

783
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,490
the wall.
So we'll see.

784
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,250
We'll see.
We'll see when game five comes up.

785
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:39,870
I imagined tomorrow.
All right.

786
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,090
And then the celtics.
Oh,

787
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:45,510
Jesus Celtics have been completely 
exposed.

788
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,270
I know that that's probably been said a 
thousand times.

789
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:51,360
You know what's funny is when I first 
got back into the NBA,

790
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,763
which I got back into it because Paul 
[inaudible] was coming out here and he 

791
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,150
loves the NBA and he was staying with 
me,

792
00:37:57,151 --> 00:38:01,740
him and his lovely wife staying with me 
and my lovely wife for like four or five

793
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:02,574
days.

794
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,430
And uh,
I'm a hell of a host or what a host,

795
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:06,264
what host,
right.

796
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,470
So I'm just like,
alright,

797
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,363
well,
you know,

798
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,400
he's coming to town.
I got to get some johnny blue.

799
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,370
I got to get the NBA package so he can 
watch his Nixon.

800
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:15,204
I just got into the Celtics.
So I've been watching them since 

801
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,870
December of 2015.
And my first thought when I was watching

802
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:22,590
them,
I was like,

803
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,540
where are we going to go with this game 
plan?

804
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,390
Where we have this super superstar point
guard,

805
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,610
we live and die by the three and we 
don't get any fucking rebound,

806
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,690
so like I don't understand how you can 
win

807
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,370
anything

808
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,070
playing basketball like that,
but then here's what happened.

809
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,540
They did and they just kept winning and 
everybody else,

810
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,523
it just became socially acceptable on 
the hard court to fucking run down the 

811
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,020
court with the ball.
Three people

812
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,060
from the other team onto the net.
Nobody on your team or maybe one guy.

813
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:58,894
It was totally acceptable to say I'm not
waiting for my other teammates and I'm 

814
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,230
just going to launch a fucking three,
you know,

815
00:39:04,231 --> 00:39:06,900
and we're up by one with like fucking 
eight minutes to go like,

816
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:09,180
what are you doing?
But that just,

817
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,600
you know,
the same way after Jordan,

818
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,730
people were just like,
well I guess we don't need to feed it to

819
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:15,590
a big man.
I do.

820
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:17,020
We even need a big man,
randy,

821
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,881
you know.
So I was like,

822
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,440
all right,
I guess this is the new game.

823
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,300
So we ended up not only doing great this
year,

824
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,463
once we added Al Horford yeah,
we fucking got the number one seat and 

825
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:34,740
at that point I completely forgot about 
my initial reaction to the way that they

826
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,720
were playing.
And I was like,

827
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:37,560
alright,
I guess,

828
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,350
yeah,
we're the number one.

829
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:42,030
See we get an eight seat.
All right.

830
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,000
And after the first two games it's like,
you know,

831
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:47,834
it seems like the opposite.
Seems like they're the number one seed 

832
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:52,520
and where the eight seat and I kind of 
knew we were in trouble.

833
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,670
Uh,

834
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,190
I guess,
well when Charles Barkley just basically

835
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:03,060
broke our team down after the first half
of the first game going,

836
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:03,894
yeah,
you just basically you double team 

837
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,023
Isaiah tried to make a beat the double 
and then if these guys don't hit their 

838
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,200
threes,
you know,

839
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,970
they're not getting any fuck.
I don't know what the hell he said,

840
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:12,900
but it's just like,
all right,

841
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:13,734
this guy's already figured this out.
Basically what I'm saying is I think 

842
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,280
this is the first real test for Brad 
Stevens,

843
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,230
this next game where he has to make a 
drastic adjustment with the players that

844
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:26,064
he has because they figured this out 
before the opening tip off and that has 

845
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:34,920
led to two losses and we have not been 
able to make any adjustment.

846
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,743
And what's fascinating about the bowls 
is even though that they're an eighth 

847
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:40,644
seed,
they got Rondo and they got Dwayne Wade 

848
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,480
and Rondo's got a ring and I think 
Dwayne Wade,

849
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:46,020
he's got what?

850
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,853
Three rings for rings.
He won one was shack and then two with 

851
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,040
Lebron three with Lebron.
I can't remember.

852
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,840
I'm not a big NBA guy.
He's got at least three rings,

853
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:59,700
so there's four rings right there.
Those guys have been through it numerous

854
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:00,534
times,
so they're not afraid of the ebbs and 

855
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:04,554
flows of the game.
They're not afraid of playing on the 

856
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:06,954
road.
They had just totally chill and I think 

857
00:41:09,691 --> 00:41:10,524
that affects the rest of the team.
And then he got Butler and Lopez who 

858
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:18,201
have just fucking animals,
just hitting 12 foot jump shots,

859
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:21,780
15 photos while getting all these 
rebounds.

860
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,880
And then that fucking white dude from 
Europe,

861
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,523
Vlade Divac Junior Jr.
He's fucking started hitting threes and 

862
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,830
you know,
we're getting asses kicked.

863
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,610
So

864
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,370
I'll see wHat happens if you know.
But uh,

865
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,893
jesus christ,
I mean we were down three to one in 

866
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:43,750
hockey and went down.
Oh,

867
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,710
to going out to chicago.
So I'm hoping.

868
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,863
I'm hoping.
Yeah.

869
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,700
Jesus.
So we don't get fucking swept.

870
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,553
I mean,

871
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,910
I dunno.
Brutal,

872
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,451
brutal,
brutal.

873
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:57,840
But you know,
what are you gonna do with him?

874
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,933
It's just a fucking game.
I realized that if the first one when 

875
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,390
I'm watching,
you know,

876
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,890
isaiah thomas crying about losing his 
sister was really a brutal week for that

877
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,830
type of shitter than Aaron Hernandez 
hung himself.

878
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,180
Man,
that was fucking brutal.

879
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,103
The whole thing was brutal.
And then all those fucking jokes that 

880
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:17,020
people were making like,
oh yeah,

881
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:17,854
he got hung up.
He's got an upper body injury to the 

882
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,570
neck.
Oh,

883
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,640
this dumb shit.
That shit to me is always weird.

884
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:28,521
Where are you going to say,
oh,

885
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:31,100
that guy's a murderer.
He's a fucking piece of shit.

886
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,020
And then everybody acts like a fucking 
animal when he kills himself.

887
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,793
Um,

888
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,290
of course there's people out there that 
don't think,

889
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,520
you know,
something else happened.

890
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,661
It's like,
all right,

891
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:43,494
you got just got acquitted on those 
other two murders and then you had a 

892
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:48,990
good chance for an appeal.
You know,

893
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:50,950
you had some hope.
Um,

894
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,360
but I don't know who the fuck knows.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

895
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,370
I don't necessarily agree with that or 
disagree.

896
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:59,370
I have no fucking idea.
But I do know was,

897
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
I think you've already sort of a fucking
human being.

898
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:04,880
The whole thing was just sad.
It's just like,

899
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,833
you know,

900
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,700
it's just,
all these lives just fucking thrown away

901
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,373
over.
Nothing.

902
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,390
Granted,
you know,

903
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,850
obviously he pulled the fucking trigger 
and everything like that,

904
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:19,000
but still I don't take any sort of a.
I don't know,

905
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,060
honeStly,
I didn't get that.

906
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,040
I was just like,
ugh.

907
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,640
It was just.
Yeah,

908
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,430
it's one of those thIngs you just from 
front to back,

909
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,020
you just wish it didn't happen.
And everybody's like,

910
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,170
hey,
here's my fucking obvious joke.

911
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,340
Um,
so anyway.

912
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:35,174
Oh god,
am I really gonna be talking about 

913
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:36,584
fucking him killing himself?
Is that how I'm going to end this 

914
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:41,280
podcast?
How long has it has been?

915
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,750
Forty three minutes.
Well,

916
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:43,970
you know what?
I'm in overtime.

917
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,133
All right,
let's end up on something positive 

918
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:47,034
tonight.
Of course I'm working tonight and this 

919
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:53,730
fucking band that I've been wanting to 
see because their drummers amazing.

920
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,650
I don't have his name in front of me.
I should have it,

921
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:58,350
but I don't spend called russian 
circles.

922
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,240
Is playing,

923
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,143
um,

924
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,360
is playing at the uh,
oh,

925
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:07,320
for fuck sakes.
What's the name of the fucking day?

926
00:44:07,321 --> 00:44:09,690
Every goddamn theater begins with a p 
out here.

927
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,670
Hey,
I got to hit pause.

928
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:13,140
I gotta make sure you have this 
information hung.

929
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:16,320
Hang on the palladium.
Fuck,

930
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,940
get tickets.
Paramont the pompadour,

931
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,010
the fucking palladium.
Actually,

932
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:25,430
that's where richard pryor tape a live 
on the sunset strip.

933
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,420
So I was introduced to this Band.
They played this song,

934
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:34,421
harper louis live and uh,
their drummer absolutely fucking blew me

935
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:37,490
away with his,
um,

936
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,850
Just how solid

937
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,553
his,
his,

938
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,200
his beats were and then his use of 
dynamiCs.

939
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:45,910
It's just on a whole other fucking 
level,

940
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:48,700
which I really think is a lost art.
Um,

941
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:53,701
but they're playIng tonight at 6:30
PM and I wish I could go,

942
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:58,630
but I got a fucking goddamn benefit so I
can't make it,

943
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,360
but I'll post that clip of the band 
playing that song.

944
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,660
Harper louis.
It's the live version and just the way,

945
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:05,983
you know,
it just starts off with the drum beat 

946
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:09,040
that he's playing and he's playing it,
you know,

947
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,510
it gradually builds in intensity,
gets louder and louder and then,

948
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:14,820
uh,
then when they go into that on,

949
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,320
it's an instrumental band.
I don't know how to say versus chorus.

950
00:45:17,321 --> 00:45:18,190
I don't know what the fuck they're 
doing,

951
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:20,770
but just absolutely blew me away.
If you've got nothing to do tonight,

952
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:21,604
you want to see a killer band,
go down and get a couple of tickets to 

953
00:45:23,561 --> 00:45:25,360
that.
I guarantee you have a great time.

954
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,501
Um,
all right,

955
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:30,640
that is the podcast.
I'm it,

956
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,160
I guess because it's 4:20
like weed man,

957
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:36,280
I guess a andrew's going to be giving 
you guys some extra clips.

958
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:38,370
It's going to be a little bit longer and
uh,

959
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,363
and that is it.
And it was an honor to be at charlie 

960
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:41,794
murphy's memorial service.
It was an honor to know that guy and I 

961
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:45,480
want to thank,
uh,

962
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,330
everybody who spoke that night last 
night,

963
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,130
the,
the way that they sent that guy off,

964
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:52,840
it was just like it was,

965
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,443
it just was a level of greatness in the 
performances that I saw from the 

966
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:03,481
comedians that went up and spoke and um,
charlie was one of the greats,

967
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,780
you know,
and it was just,

968
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:07,614
it was such a perfect send off and I'm 
really glad that I was able to be there 

969
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:12,450
and witness it.
All right,

970
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:13,284
sO that's it.
I'll let you fucking concept a great 

971
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,104
weekend and enjoy this music and some,
some clips from a podcast recorded 

972
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,440
monday or a thursday gone by.
