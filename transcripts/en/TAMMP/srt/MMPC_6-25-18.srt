1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,060
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:07,860
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday, uh,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,810
June 25th, 2018 what's
going on? I whoa. Yo,

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,890
how you doing? How you doing with the,
the summer, the summer's here, right?

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,160
We're in the,
we're in the twenties of June.

6
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,760
Somewhere along the lines of first day
of summer. You know, back in the day,

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,810
used to know it right?

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,480
Because there wasn't as many channels
and you would watch the local news and

9
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:33,180
they'd bring it up. Tonight is the
first day of summer. Tell us, Jack,

10
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:37,800
what can people look forward to weather
wise? While I'll tell you a bike.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,240
We got a low pressure.
Says, look, Google it.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,640
It's so don't inflate those fucking
above ground pools. Yes. Yep.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,520
Um,
and then they'd laugh for no reason.

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,970
Your weekend's going to suck. Um, anyways,

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,910
uh, it's gotta be a summertime,
right? The fucking son's out.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,070
There you go right there.
Global warming. Um,

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,100
what'd you do this weekend?
I have a couple, of course,

18
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:09,180
like that's his generation's Budweiser,
Coors light. They're crushing it.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,570
You know,
Peyton Manning's fucked up.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,420
You notice the second Peyton
manning fucking bought Budweiser.

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,980
Now it's second place. You
know, you didn't buy it.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,880
He bought into it the
second he fucking God.

23
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,690
And I bet he started pointing fingers
at everybody. You know, we, we, we got,

24
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,250
we had some hops issues,
right? And all of a sudden,

25
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,250
nobody's getting along over there and
of course lights now cause lights ahead.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,560
Right? I Bet Tom Brady
invested in concourse lite.
Sorry. Why would I do this?

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
I like Peyton manning now
that he's retired. You know,

28
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,330
I could look back and be like,
you know what,

29
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:41,520
that fellow was sat quite quarterback,

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,460
but when they're playing against your
team, you hate him. It's stupid. You know,

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,770
you don't hate them. You
just, hey, it's weird. Um,

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,690
anyways,
uh,

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,480
the summers here I am back
from vacay shawl and a,

34
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:03,330
I'm getting ready this weekend. Oh,
freckles. Shaking off the cobwebs.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,790
I'm going to be in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, in Detroit,

36
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,770
Michigan. Okay. A couple, uh,
Joe, six pack towns, you know,

37
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,800
where they put their pet to
one leg at a thought. Uh,

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,650
looking forward to that and a,

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,160
so I'm going to be around La doing a
bunch of spots, shaking off the dust.

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,190
I'm on the elliptical,
working off the cholesterol panel.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,580
Shock a lot. I never had
any of those, you know,

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,540
my wife's into those
fucking things I liked.

43
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,930
I like the plain old
boring white guy croissant.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,500
I don't need any flavor.
Uh,

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,720
anyways. Oh my God. Um,

46
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,090
I don't want to talk about this early on,
but I have to out of respect, uh, to sad,

47
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:54,050
sad, sad, sad day. Uh, the passing of V,

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,620
the Great Vinnie Paul,
um,

49
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,160
drummer of obviously Pantera damaged
blend and hell yeah, good Lord.

50
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,170
What a, what a loss. Can't even,
can't even put it into words.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,150
And I was lucky enough to meet him.

52
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,440
He was a big comedy fan and I
remember the first time I met him,

53
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,920
I was opening for the
late Great Charlie Murphy.

54
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,920
This is what happens when you get older.

55
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,010
Like half your stories is like half
the people in a more like fucking dead.

56
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:28,510
It's sucks. Um, but anyways, yeah, me,

57
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:32,560
Charlie and Danelle or on tour.
And we did the Addison Improv

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,390
and, uh, I remember that that was one of
those shows, one of the few times I ever,

59
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,360
I went over without even realizing it.
I always knew when I was going over,

60
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,970
but I did like 40 minutes and
I was supposed to be like 25.

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,370
It just one of those that just let,

62
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:49,120
there was talking and I don't
know what happened. And, um,

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,740
Charlie was cool with it, but I was
in Paris because I never do that shit.

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,300
And it's a real country thing to do
and it's something, you know, mixed.

65
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,630
The headline is job more difficult
because you ate up all of that extra time

66
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:04,000
wearing them out and all
of that shit. So, uh,

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,510
I do remember that from that weekend,
but one of those shows,

68
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:12,190
it wasn't the show and I went over,
but, uh, I was standing after the show,

69
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,410
selling my cds. This is how long ago
this was. It was right around, uh,

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,330
it was 2004. His brother
was still alive. Um,

71
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,720
and I was just standing there
and I just looked up and he,

72
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,080
and he was standing right there,
Finney fucking Paul. And you know,

73
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,850
it wasn't like he was Vinnie Paul
offstage. He just was Vinnie Paul.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,360
He had the fucking cowboy hat on,
you know,

75
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,330
this shirt with flames on it and shit,

76
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:44,560
these crazy cowboy boots and he's just
standing of the big smile on his face.

77
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,330
And I was just like, oh, I
mean, this guy, he's like,

78
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,180
guys saw on the cover of modern drummer.
I couldn't believe it. I was like,

79
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,420
I was like,
Holy Shit in fucking Vinny Foley.

80
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,290
You started laughing and you know,

81
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,860
it was super complimentary
about the show and all that.

82
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,820
And then he invited us out. Uh,
he had his own club out there,

83
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,350
gentleman's club,

84
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,610
then we all went out there
and he was nice enough,

85
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,670
I actually sat with him in
his club for like 45 minutes,

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
like a total drum nerd and asked
them all of these questions about,

87
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,640
um, Trump parts that he did. And, and, um,

88
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,530
like, who were the guys that he
listened to? And, uh, and, you know,

89
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,371
I asked and I said,
you know,

90
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,250
who do you think only one
of the underrated drummers
out there? And he was like,

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,570
Oh, Alex van Halen, you know,
and we went on and on about him.

92
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,020
It's kind of ironic because I really
feel that Vinnie and dime bag where the

93
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,770
Eddie and Alex, I should say Alex and
Eddie of their generation. And um,

94
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,330
it just sucks man. He was just such
a nice guy. And then after that, uh,

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,320
he probably came out to two or three
other shows and he always was smiling,

96
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,970
always was just the greatest,
nicest guy. And, um,

97
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,891
it's,
I dunno,

98
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,890
one of the reasons why I never got into
double bass playing was because so many

99
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:11,180
people, I just felt like once,
like they all have fills,

100
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:16,181
everything was just their fucking feet
and their hands stunk and it didn't

101
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:20,560
groove. It just was going nine
zillion miles an hour. And, you know,

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,260
it was impressive to look at, but it
didn't, it didn't give me the chills.

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,300
It didn't make me want to do it.
And he was a guy that changed that.

104
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,510
And I, I, when I listened to him play, um,

105
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,180
my younger brothers who were independent,
Tara, I fucked up. I never saw him a,

106
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,290
I remember one of my
brothers went to go see him,

107
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,380
was telling me how amazing the show is.
But to be honest with you, like I, I just,

108
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,750
you know,
conscious with different,

109
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:49,751
back then you could get fucked up at
a concert and there was no cell phone

110
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:54,080
footage. She just got fucked up and that
was it. And there was like mosh pits.

111
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,770
Like it just, it changed.
And I got a little bit older.
I was in my mid twenties,

112
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:01,820
basically when they came around and I had
already started doing standup and shit.

113
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,560
And um, you know, I remember
going to a couple of, uh,

114
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,060
you know, concerts like ACDC and shit
and people were doing blow and it was,

115
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,100
you know, it was a little
fucking, you know, there was you,

116
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,380
you had to be like a certain level of
fucked up just so you could stay relaxed

117
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,240
so you could kind of navigate it,
you know what I mean?

118
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,840
You couldn't be sitting there looking
fucking nervous. And I, you know,

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,260
and that was just it like ACDC,
which was always like a fun show.

120
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:29,000
So like put this pant,
Tara came in.

121
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:33,590
It was a new level of aggression and anger
certainly, you know, with Phil singing,

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,550
I had never heard anything like that.
And um,

123
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,630
you know, just the way I was just,
I just had this feeling of my house.

124
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,730
I was too afraid I was, I'm going
to fucking going to go down there,

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,170
my fucking orange hair trying to grow it
out and it just gets bigger and bigger

126
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:51,110
and it looked like Bernie from
room to 22 and there's a mosh pit.

127
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:51,944
I'm going to get the Sh,

128
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,370
you know how I always got over with
people was making them laugh and the show

129
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,780
was going to be too fucking loud.

130
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,010
So if they would just going to look at
me the way I looked, I mean I would,

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,030
I just felt like it
wasn't going to go well.

132
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,350
So I was a fan from afar and I really
fucked up by not seeing those guys.

133
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,400
And, um, I remember when Vinny came down
on the show, he said, hey, you know,

134
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,870
I got this, this new, uh, this new
band. I think it was. Yeah, it was,

135
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,550
it was damaged plan. He said, we play
in New York. He said, he goes, he goes,

136
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,200
I'll hook you up. I said,
really? He said, dude, he goes,

137
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,430
you can fucking stand right
behind me while I play the
whole show. And of course,

138
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,410
um, I had some fucking road
gig when they came to town.

139
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,120
I think Florentine went,

140
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,620
cause I remember talking to him about
it and I was so fucking envious that he

141
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,190
got to go and I, I didn't get to go,
so I never saw him play live. But, um,

142
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,373
you know,

143
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,990
since doing that Dean del Ray's show
or I had to learn how to play a much,

144
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,010
I butcher the sun,

145
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,980
but I tried to learn how to play
that song by Motley Crue live wire,

146
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,810
which had the double bass, you know,
basic thing in there. Since then,

147
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,460
I've just kinda gotten addicted to it.

148
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,550
And I was listening to all of the
Pantera stuff in a whole nother level.

149
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,600
And um, you know, cowboys
from Hell and fucking,

150
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,450
uh, um, broken and this love,

151
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:18,340
just loving the drum parts are just
so fucking perfect in all of those.

152
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,151
And I was just talking,

153
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:24,130
I was talking to my drum teacher
literally that day of how great, um,

154
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,190
Finney Paul was, um, with
his work in that band and,

155
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,390
and then like it fuck,
it was so weird that night.

156
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,640
Then all of a sudden I got that text,
I couldn't fucking believe it.

157
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,350
And I'm Super Sad. But, um,

158
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:39,890
I don't know.

159
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,500
Like the only good thing I could say is
that got the mark that the guy left his,

160
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,460
he, he won't be forgotten and obviously
his brother hasn't been. So anyways,

161
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,810
that's my little,

162
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,290
my little point of view on a truly one
of the great artists that I ever heard of

163
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,330
or got to, I dunno, listen to whatever
hang out with or anything. So,

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,340
so that sucks. And that's sad. So I don't
know where the fuck did go from here.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,140
How do you, how do you turn it
back to being funny? You know,

166
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,860
can I talk about the Germans playing the
Swedes and the fucking, uh, do they play?

167
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:20,060
Sweden is out or was it by the, the, the
shirts for the same colors, their flags.

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
So, um, I always fucked that up. Sweden,

169
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,490
it's Switzerland because I'm
an American and we never,

170
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,200
they never taught us geography like that.

171
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:30,140
And I remember one time I did a
Gig in Sweden and I said, hey,

172
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:31,940
it's great to be here in Switzerland.

173
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,350
And they all laughed thinking I was
joking and I honestly fucked it up and I

174
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:39,500
just rolled with it. I was just
like, Hey, just fucking with you.

175
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:43,640
They both start with sw, but I, I did
that the whole, thank you Cleveland.

176
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,970
Whatever the fuck it
was a spinal tap thing.

177
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,700
I got to get back there.
I haven't done, um,

178
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,000
what would you call that? Hitler's ranch
up there. Norway, Sweden and Finland.

179
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,390
All those places. When he used to look
across the, was it the Baltic Sea?

180
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,090
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It's just look across that water.

181
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:08,990
They're all desserts is what
people should look like. Yeah.

182
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,640
Frolicking in the grass.
Um,

183
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,270
anyways, um, tello swing,
did you know, they,

184
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,990
they, they were noncommittal a World War
II ended up being a great fucking move.

185
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,680
Not socially. It wasn't a good move, but
it was a great fucking move financially.

186
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:30,920
Cause just for the fact that they were
still standing after World War II never

187
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:34,310
got bombed. You know, let the, let the,

188
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:38,870
let the crowds fucking use a
train to go to Norway. MMM.

189
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,660
They stood there. They're fucking apple
piece was still open at the end of it,

190
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:48,520
you know. So I mean, I, if I guess
you can learn something from Sweden.

191
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,270
Okay.

192
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,270
When Shit is hitting the fan and
you to stand up and make a stand,

193
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,810
don't let other people do it. Just kind
of sit back and see who wins it. Ed, uh,

194
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,753
carry on

195
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,760
anyways, so the Swedes or
play in Germany. All right.

196
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm mostly German,
so I usually root for Germany.

197
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,983
MMM.

198
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,910
Or whatever. Or I just root
for an underdog. Like Iceland.

199
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:23,960
I mean high enough fucking roof, Iceland
and Poland and shit like that. You know,

200
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:28,010
I'm rooting for all any anybody other
than the powerhouses that always seem to

201
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:31,730
be in an, I don't know shit
about soccer. So this is, boy,

202
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,230
it's going to make it funny.
But anyway,

203
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:37,650
so I'm watching this fucking game
and this Swedish dude, right? Yeah.

204
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,960
He's on a fucking break away
going, God, he's all all alone.

205
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,080
Right? And then this Joe Guy in
the German team, a black dude,

206
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,990
which is hilarious. You know what I mean?
I was always just sitting there like,

207
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:54,870
like how conflicted would Hitler
be Germany one. But what's,

208
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,920
what does the whole foods,
is that outside,

209
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,960
he comes down and goes to not
only went to like trip the guy,

210
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,853
he also cut,

211
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,240
like just pushed him from behind and like,
oh,

212
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,540
fucking referee and the WWE,

213
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,310
somehow this guy didn't see it.

214
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,710
Okay.

215
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,460
I mean, I think it happened in
the box, in the painted area,

216
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,350
whatever the fuck they
call it in that sport.

217
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:26,610
And I think that that should have just
been one of those fucking penalty kicks

218
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
with a goalie.
Just dives and guesses one side.

219
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,730
Um, but anyways, the Swedes ended up going
up one, nothing that Germans tied it up.

220
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,690
And then this guy,

221
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:41,691
he did the old bend it like Beckham
did the old fucking a roundabout there.

222
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,400
I don't know how to talk about the sport.
Uh, but I got to tell you something.

223
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:48,600
I actually,

224
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,050
okay,

225
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,950
I love making fun of soccer but I have
to watch it in order to make fun of it.

226
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:56,020
And now having watched it,
I'm actually,

227
00:13:56,021 --> 00:14:00,070
I kind of love it now and I kind of
understand the beauty of the game.

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,121
Finally.

229
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:06,121
I'm starting to get it and it is really
cool that it is so hard to score that

230
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:09,910
when it happens that people
absolutely lose their fucking minds.

231
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,520
So I am on board.
I'm going to continue to make fun of it.

232
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,500
I had it on in the
background and you know,

233
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,590
I had like fucking two weeks of male
here that I was going through and um,

234
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,800
okay.

235
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,660
And the amount of times that I just kept
looking over at the TV cause he knows

236
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:28,130
he'd be like,
oh,

237
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,430
oh,
he's going to be sick.

238
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah.

239
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,390
So I was sitting at the table
going like, oh my God. Oh,

240
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,920
something almost happened. That's
what it just seemed like. Um,

241
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,480
okay.

242
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,010
But it really is a great game. Uh, GI
bill. Yeah. You really, uh, you know, you,

243
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,010
the rest of the world is right, Bill.
And you might be wrong on this one. Um,

244
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,350
but I missed it today.

245
00:14:56,351 --> 00:15:01,351
A good friend of mine wrote in a Protean
sent me a text and I'm in podcast mode.

246
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,190
She sent me a text message and
asked me if I had saw the, um,

247
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,560
England play today.
I guess they played a great game.

248
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:14,030
And I heard Mexico had a pretty scrappy
game with the Koreans heard it was

249
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,630
getting a little nasty. They're like,
the Koreans would desperate like, oh,

250
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:20,710
we don't give a fuck. You know, we
can't score unless we have the ball. Uh,

251
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,250
you know, I guess Mexico's
fast. That's what I know.

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,200
And I promise you this week I'm going to
neglect all my responsibilities and I'm

253
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,400
going to try to watch some of this
shit cause uh, it is, it is fun.

254
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,700
Go once every four years,

255
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,590
the entire world gets together to play
for an actual world championship is

256
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:42,300
pretty, that's pretty sick. You know,
I just wish I could use their hands.

257
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,450
You just see that one Connie
fucking jumped over the
guy and accidentally kicked

258
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:49,120
him in the face.
I mean that's gotta be like,

259
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:50,990
okay.

260
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,150
Kicking a guy on the ground in the face,

261
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,720
in the realm of like losing
your man card forever.

262
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,160
Like, who fuck who does that with your
shoes on leash, you can be barefoot.

263
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,190
So maybe make you foot sting a little bit.
Um,

264
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,430
I would be so disappointed
if I had a fucking son and
he ended up playing soccer.

265
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:12,910
First of all, I'd be happy for his brain,
but you know, if that's what he did,

266
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,830
you're going to frolic down the field
and jump in the air like some baby deer

267
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,070
and then kick somebody in the face.
Um,

268
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,040
knowing like the guy does,
he takes out a yellow card.

269
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,250
I hate the way they take it out in the
guy just stands up in front of the guy,

270
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,750
the stupid thing up in the air, like
he's bidding on a fucking Shelby. Um,

271
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,360
anyways, congratulations to anybody
you want. Uh, I got to get into it.

272
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,250
Sorry. I did watch the, uh,

273
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,140
the one finally I was in town.
I got to watch her watch the French GP.

274
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:46,880
Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton.

275
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,310
Max Verstappen was fucking hilarious
in the press conference afterwards. Uh,

276
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,820
cause federal slammed into botox back.
She was going, you know, I think he needs,

277
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,160
you guys should tell him he needs to
adjust his style because they were given

278
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:04,790
Max Shit, you know, beginning of the
year. I forget. He took out his own teeth,

279
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,110
took out a, what's his face there? Um,

280
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,700
Daniel Ricardo and they
gave him all this shit does,

281
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:13,040
does he need to adjust his style?

282
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,320
All these fucking assholes
who don't drive for a living.

283
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,050
So he was trashing all of them go
and you should tell Vettel. Yeah,

284
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,540
you should tell him he needs to do it
justice style and then he shouldn't

285
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,360
adjusted at all the way
I didn't adjust my style.

286
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,750
And now here I sit three races in a row,
whatever on the fucking podium.

287
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,790
You fucking cunt Kimmy ragged.
They kept bringing up the,

288
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:36,770
this is his 25th,
the 26th podium without winning a race.

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,740
It's like this guy's fucking
Lewis Hamilton went because
of Louis samples at my

290
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:45,700
kid's sleeping. It's cause fucking Lewis
Hamilton wins every God damn week. Okay.

291
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,790
That's like giving somebody shit who
played when Michael Jordan was at the

292
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,680
height of his powers.

293
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,950
Yeah.

294
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,770
He never got a ring. Nobody
got a ring. You know,

295
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:55,780
I've got to ring Olijahwaun would fucking,

296
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Jordan was playing basketball and then
when he was a little out of shape the

297
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,240
next year, other than that,
everybody got shut the fuck down.

298
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,310
All right. That's what
happens. So what Ha, what, what
needs to happen is the next,

299
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:13,150
uh, the next Drake great
driver has to come around.

300
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,220
And also for one,
my,

301
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,730
what I little know about the sport is
they got to fucking get with either

302
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,190
Mercedes and Ferrari. Basically. Mercedes,

303
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:26,080
it seems to have the fastest car out
there cause I think, what's this?

304
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,750
I think Daniel Ricardo was gonna fucking,
he's going to jump somewhere, right?

305
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:33,280
That's what they say. Um, by like both
those drives and I'll put the eggs,

306
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,470
how the Americans will be coming,
like six to seventh.

307
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,890
We've got some points and our gray cars

308
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,670
or overcast cars. Um,
what else did I do here?

309
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,880
Oh, I got back on my fucking
diet. This has been tough.

310
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,350
It's been tough to get back on the Diet.

311
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:53,800
I fell the capes I fucking
hate over in France, you know,

312
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,170
and a couple of slip ups, but
at back to the keen one, um,

313
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,630
hitting the elliptical.
Oh God.

314
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,930
The first two minutes of getting on
the elliptical, my age, Jesus Christ.

315
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,780
After that I just kind of
go numb and then it's fine.

316
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,920
I listed my fucking songs
and then it's over. But, um,

317
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,830
I finally got the shoulder thing B and uh,
I have,

318
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,350
I think I have to join a
gym though because in order
to rehab my shoulder where

319
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,410
I can do pull ups again,
I got to do those,

320
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,300
those fucking lat pull downs with like
20 pounds and then 30 and work my way up

321
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,650
to my body weight and then I can attempt
to do like a pull up because what I did

322
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:37,240
last time when I rehabbed it was I then
got these like those help or bands,

323
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,680
you know, that you stand on and make the
pull up easier. But I was still, you know,

324
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,360
trying to pull up,
you know,

325
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:46,660
90 a hundred pounds with the weight
and I fucking Jack my shoulder against,

326
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:50,560
so I got to do what I don't want to do.
I've got to go join a fucking gym,

327
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:54,280
so I got to find a local
gym, not a fucking, uh,

328
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,900
a chain. What? Cause those are the ones,

329
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,570
they get your credit card and then
you can't fucking get out of it.

330
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,940
I've been tell you that
time I went to Bally's,

331
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,460
I joined Bally's and there was
like trying to fucking leave AOL.

332
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,140
You just couldn't do it.
They'd be,

333
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:13,770
oh okay Cindy in a hundred
dollar cancellation fee.

334
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,300
And then I sent it in and then they
go, oh yeah, yeah, but there's another,

335
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,940
there's another gym within
like a five mile radius.

336
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:26,370
So you can't cancel like, oh and
I was to put the fuck, he just,

337
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:30,420
he just took $100 from me. I should have
sued the fucking shit out of him. And I,

338
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,450
and I didn't. So I just didn't
pay him. I just, you know, I did,

339
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:38,040
I cancelled the credit card.
That was the only way out and it was,

340
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,560
it was quiet for months.
I didn't hear from anybody.

341
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,080
And then all of a sudden this
collection agency called me up,

342
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,430
the only anti he was William burned the
hair please. And I'm like this, hey.

343
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,450
They're like, Hey, this is showing show
from the show and show collection agency.

344
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,440
We bought your dead from Bally's total
fitness and would like to discuss it with

345
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:59,250
you. And I was just like, well, I don't
know what the hell you did that for.

346
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,800
You know, I didn't pay them. What,
what the hell, but why would I pay you?

347
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,820
I don't even know you,

348
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,963
you know,

349
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,960
this is your business.

350
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,990
You actually earn a living doing this
shit by debt that other people can't

351
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:20,430
fucking collect. And so she was
like, you know, giving me Shit,

352
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,220
telling me I had to click or I'm
not doing it. You know, I go, I go,

353
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:25,590
I have perfect credit.
I've paid everything. Okay.

354
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:30,591
I really don't think that someday in
the future when I go to buy a house,

355
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,210
they're going to be like, you know
what? We really want to let you know,

356
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:36,390
give you a couple hundred
thousand dollars a loan here,

357
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:40,500
but you owe $300 to a gym.
And she's like, oh my God.

358
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,240
You know what? We just had
a client who just called us
up and said, please, please,

359
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,330
please, I have to pay off. You know,

360
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,280
this $400 that I owe you
because I'm trying to buy a
house and they won't let me.

361
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,920
And I was like, wow. I
go, that's incredible.

362
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,460
That's almost the exact same scenario
that I just presented to you.

363
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,860
It's almost like you made it up.
Right.

364
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:06,040
And then she got fucking mad at me and
then I just started hitting on her and

365
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,330
she started saying it was harassment and
I just gay. How old are you? You know,

366
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,830
you live around here, you know, you got a
boyfriend or anything. And she ended up,

367
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,580
she got so mad, she
hung up on me. You know,

368
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,330
I'll probably get me to get over that.

369
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,760
And ever since then I been afraid
of the phone. Every time it rings,

370
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,720
I shake.

371
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,350
Okay,

372
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,480
please tell.
Phone's always on styling.

373
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,260
Um,
anyways,

374
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,820
what are we got 22 minutes in here?
Is it time to fucking say?

375
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,500
And you know what I got to met? They
just kept harassing me, harassing me.

376
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:47,050
I just got sick of it. It was only
300 bucks. So I just fucking pay them

377
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,350
and um,

378
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,700
I shouldn't have, there's a couple people
that I shouldn't have paid and I did,

379
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:59,020
but I just, I didn't like
the, uh, the stress, you know,

380
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,750
I couldn't put it into perspective and I
just got sick of them calling me and I,

381
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,310
you know, I had fun with them. Shit.

382
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,833
Okay.

383
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,090
Hitting on them or are saying that I
had gotten into some horrible accident.

384
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,250
That was another big one that I just said.

385
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,220
I don't know how many times I have to
tell you I lost my leg in a car accident.

386
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,640
What kind of Pete went? Oh my God, sir.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, are you,

387
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,740
this is like the third time.

388
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:27,510
I'm literally sitting here right now with
my stump elevated so I don't bleed out

389
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:31,210
because the sutures have come loose
again and here you are harassing.

390
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:35,590
This is what you do. And then they
would, you know, it was that thing. Um,

391
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,740
and I just ran out of ways
to have fun with them.

392
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,323
Uh,

393
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,330
and then I, I think I just
finally fucking paid him. Yeah,

394
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,350
I've done that a couple of times.

395
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:52,630
I had a fucking landlord that's stole
from my apartment managers stove,

396
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,480
my pubs on the road. And I came back and,
uh, it was on the road for three weeks.

397
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:57,920
I was on the road for so
long when I came back,

398
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,170
like most of the water had
evaporated out of the toilet

399
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,750
and they had this check the smoke alarm.

400
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:07,070
So legally they could go into my
apartment when I wasn't there without my

401
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,340
consent, because if there was a fire,
it could affect the other units.

402
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,130
That's what they said.
And uh,

403
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:15,170
all of a sudden I noticed
there was a camera missing.

404
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:19,280
They'd picked through my cds.
It was a hip hop fan. And, um,

405
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,390
so I went down and I talked to the guy
about it thinking that the manager was

406
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:23,751
going to be like,

407
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:26,980
oh my God started where we got to get
to the bottom of this age, who says,

408
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,690
I don't appreciate you coming
down to excuse you, accusing me.

409
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,760
And he started saying all this shit,
I have the power.

410
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:36,200
He kept saying I have the power. So it
was like, Oh yeah, you've got the power.

411
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:41,030
I buddy and I just stood outside the
office and anytime anybody new came,

412
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:44,240
I stood out to for two hours. I was
like, yeah, don't run from these paypal.

413
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,650
They uh, they stole from my apartment
and all that. That's like, dude,

414
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,810
I'm a comedian.
I can do this all day.

415
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:53,000
I will be down here
every single fucking day.

416
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,630
And it was bullshit because the next
day I went on the road and I just,

417
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,330
I just didn't have it in me and um,
I shouldn't get,

418
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,310
hey, hey, come on in here.
The lovely Nia, everybody,

419
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,760
can we hear
what's going on?

420
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,880
I was just talking to them

421
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,250
about collection agencies and all of
that type of stuff and all the crap I've

422
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:24,480
gone through. Um, I haven't had a lot of
that stuff, but you know, David's side.

423
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,080
Then I, the time that woman
called me up, I know it was bally,

424
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:32,520
total fitness and they, and I just started
hitting on her and she got mad at me,

425
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,740
said it was harassment.
I ended up,

426
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,830
I ended up getting her to hang up those
up on me. That was like the highlight.

427
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,050
What's a matter with you?
Oh you do. Um, all right,

428
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:44,970
well I gotta knock
another 35 minutes here.

429
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm just going to read some advertising
and I got some great questions from

430
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:51,210
people this week.
All right.

431
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,360
You want to go get some floss instead
of just staring at me with the lick your

432
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,380
fingers in your mouth.

433
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,440
You know what sexy to me. You
know, it's sexy to me at my age.

434
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:09,190
Eight hours sleep that, that turns me
on. All right. All right. Listen to me.

435
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:11,070
I'd love to talk to you
while you pick your teeth.

436
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,220
I got to keep the momentum going here.
We have floss.

437
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,330
You can get your fingers between
your teeth. Get out of here.

438
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,180
There you go. Tenacity. Yeah.

439
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,890
Alright,
let me go.

440
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,510
He says they always want to go somewhere.
You know what I mean?

441
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,020
Only once a fucking house and then you
get a one and then only want to do is

442
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:40,380
leave. Yeah. Boy.

443
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,740
Fucking believable. I, when is the,

444
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,100
when is the guy me too thing going to
fucking happen. You know what I mean?

445
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,950
The reverse. Me Too. You know,

446
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:52,200
I take a lot of these feminists
a little more seriously.

447
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:54,960
If they ever bitched about something
that didn't affect their life,

448
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,770
you know what I mean? Yeah. I'll
see. Need to fix. Let me guess.

449
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:02,430
Something that affects you.
You're self centered. Fucking,

450
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,820
um, all right. Let's, uh,
let's move on here. Oh,

451
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:10,020
and then I'm going to tell you about this,

452
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,150
this music festival I went to yesterday.

453
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,500
Definitely feeling my
age at a music festival.

454
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,310
Just having to stand standing too long.

455
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:23,610
Throws out my back at this
point. I know. It's my posture.

456
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,730
I don't need you all Yunan
doctors out there. Just save me.

457
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:29,130
You're fucking remedies.
All right. All right. Oh,

458
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:33,540
here's something from a friend
of mine. Um, a buddy of mine,

459
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,010
he actually died a couple
of years ago and uh,

460
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,810
his widow is trying to finish
a project that he started,

461
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:47,490
which is a really great idea. It's called
the, uh, the untold legends of hip hop.

462
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,870
And my buddy Pete coming rest his soul.

463
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,900
He was out there interviewing all of
these legends from the early days of a rap

464
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:03,390
music. Curtis blow, Russell
Simmons spliff starved.

465
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,340
And I say that right. Um, and he,

466
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:11,250
they would do these two minute little
stories talking about the early days of

467
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:15,390
hip hop and then they were animating it
and I saw some of the clips in it looked

468
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:19,530
fucking incredible and they
want to finish this thing. Um,

469
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,610
so they have a startup.
If you're a fan of hip hop music,

470
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:25,740
animation and all that stuff,
just cool stuff.

471
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:29,760
You like to learn about music the way
I do. Uh, the website is halo boost,

472
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:33,210
h a l o B o s t.com.

473
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,890
And uh,

474
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,660
the project is the untold legends of hip
hop people go to halo boosts and click

475
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:44,190
on the featured project and then you
go to the untold legends of hip hop

476
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:48,420
campaign, need, donate a dollar, whatever
you can do to try to get this thing made.

477
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,750
It's a really, really
cool project. And, um,

478
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,810
from one of the great people that
I've met in this business. Um, I'll,

479
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,030
I'll definitely retweet the link and all
that type of stuff, so I appreciate it.

480
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,540
You know, if you're a, if you're into it,
I'm not, it's no pressure here. All right.

481
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,290
All right, here we go. Ah,
butcher box. Everybody, uh,

482
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,660
these guys, these guys, these
guys know what they're doing yet.

483
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:15,661
Put your box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

484
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,190
free range,
organic chicken

485
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,960
and heritage breed pork bread,
Brie Porchia.

486
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,410
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment of

487
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:33,411
raising animals humanely before they
killed him and free of antibiotics and

488
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,860
hormones.
I've got to tell you something.

489
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,340
I cannot say enough about
their heritage breed pork.

490
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,530
You got to get it all right.
You've got to do it.

491
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,550
The skill it sear it on both sides.
[inaudible] finish to the other.

492
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,860
Come out a little fucking
garlic butter bath.

493
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,220
I don't give a fuck where your
wife wants to go the next day.

494
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:55,660
You're gonna have a smile on your face.
It is fucking delish.

495
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,470
Each box comes with at least
nine to 11 pounds of meat,

496
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,620
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

497
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,060
You can choose from five different box
types. I swear to God this was around,

498
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:10,150
there'd be, you know, back in the day that
there would've been no Jeffrey Dahmer,

499
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,160
all beef beef and chicken, beef
and pork, mixed pork custom box.

500
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,520
I'm just saying cause there's so
much of it, you know, I'm sorry.

501
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:21,280
You know way I'd use that
circular reference and I
know they're going to give me

502
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:24,280
shit about it was I was
thinking 24 pounds of meat.

503
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,590
Oh 2011 pounds of meat. I was
just thinking like, you know,

504
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,710
you're double up the order.

505
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,300
You get one of those meat freezers
in your fucking garage, you know,

506
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,270
you know Lezama getting people so they
got all that meat you'd have, you know,

507
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,840
everybody else is starving to death and
you're just sitting there going like,

508
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,630
yeah, I don't know when helps coming.
And they're looking at you like,

509
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:47,260
well how come you're not getting
skinny like us? Right. They're like,

510
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:47,981
he's got food.

511
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:51,190
But by then that two week and you've
got all that fucking heritage breed pork

512
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:55,930
and you're all that protein, you
fucking knock their asses out. Right?

513
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,240
I Dunno. And then they just, whenever
you think of a giant meat freezer,

514
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,850
you just always think of a fee.
I don't know.

515
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,850
You just think of somebody
chopping up a body.

516
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,380
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.
Antibiotic slash hormone,

519

Free of antibiotics and hormones
and humanely raised on open passion.

520
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,950
I guess it's fucking delicious.

Tell that bitch together around
you're making some bacon.

545
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,120
Now leave me alone.
I wanted fair and fucking square.

546
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,560
We got to bake and fucking prenup and
my balls of feeling nice and soft in my

547
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:12,310
nice tight Greg Louganis
pair of underwear is um,

548
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,540
you definitely heard me
talk about me and he's, hey,

549
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,710
you guys have to be singing about it.

550
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,300
You know the fun comfy undies
that feel as good as they look to.

551
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,850
Those of you haven't tried them yet.
Listen Up.

552
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,350
There's a reason your balls are crying
because all the other balls are walking

553
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,580
around bragging about it.

554
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,660
You can get incredible underwear sent
to your door with me undies meaning no

555
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,340
more hunting around for perfect,

556
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,240
for a perfect pair at a crowded store
and eventually settling for good enough.

557
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,110
I guess these don't make
my balls to achieve me.

558
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:46,010
Undies are made with sustainably
sourced material from beechwood trees.

559
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:50,630
How they make their underwear on of trees.
I have no idea. They're naturally soft.

560
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,830
Fiber makes a fabric that won't Sag.
You know,

561
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,220
we and your balls hanging there like
the beginning of an action movie.

562
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,290
Sebesta Salone trying to reach down
and grab him or they don't write up,

563
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,930
you know, like in some claustrophobic
relationship where you're killing me.

564
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,110
My biological clock is ticking. He
twisted my nuts there. Trust me.

565
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,520

but I'm going to give you guys a break.
All right.

626
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,500
Yesterday I went to a music festival.
All right.

627
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,400
I went to go see the pretenders
when I was in England.

628
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,530
Um, the great Chrissy hine came
down with some of her friends,

629
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:09,990
some of the band members and
stuff that came down to my show.

630
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,960
That's the second time she's come to one
of my shows over there. So I was like,

631
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:17,580
next time you come to the u s I'm
going to your show, you got me going.

632
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,020
And she said, cool, guess what?

633
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,690
I'm going to be there a few days after
he come back. So I was like, all right,

634
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,670
done don Dale.

635
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,730
So I figure they're going to be playing
like some theater Assam shit out here.

636
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,260
You know, I'm an old band. I'll sit down
in his seat, get myself assessed Barilla.

637
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,550
That'd be once in a while,

638
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:36,400
stand up and wave my fist and feel
like I've as an audience member.

639
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:41,401
But now they were doing a music festival
and I get the email from our manager

640
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,720
and there's a map and it's
to the rose bowl. I'm like,

641
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:49,960
Holy Shit. Who the fuck is
on this bill? And it was,

642
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,910
it was Neil Young, Jack White,
the pretenders, the smiths,

643
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,930
and a bunch of other people
that I'm sure I missed.

644
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,430
And that will fucking amazing, right?
So I'm like, wow, this is going to be,

645
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:05,380
I never saw a concert at, uh, at the
fucking Rosebowl is going to be amazing.

646
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:09,580
So, you know, I walk in there, I
walked right where it's, you know,

647
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,690
the Rosebowl logo.

648
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm having all of these flashbacks of how
many times have been they're hammered.

649
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,800
Going to the rose bowl game kind of
struck me as funny to be walking the golf

650
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:20,110
course. It's a big golf course
outside the stadium, by the way.

651
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,810
I'm finally doing it sober.

652
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,250
So I'm walking in there and the first
thing I tried to go into the main entrance

653
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,330
into the, uh, the Rose Bowl
stadium. They're like, Nah, Nah,

654
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:33,100
you got to go around and you got
to go around. And I'm like, well,

655
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,090
of course she got to go around.

656
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,890
They always make eco the longest fucking
possible way. Why do I got to go around?

657
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,000
Why the fuck do I got to do that?
You fucking assholes.

658
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,690
And then I go in there and then we
got to make a left turn and then a,

659
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:50,080
right now I'm going to cut across the
bridge, the stadiums right fucking there.

660
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,150
And I go to go across bitch gun.
Sorry sir. This is one way. It's a,

661
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,720
it's one way for walking.

662
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,540
Are you worried there's going to be a
head on collision when a fuck do I have to

663
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,300
gut guy and got to go up
dairy and I'm losing my shit.

664
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,100
And then I'm looking around,

665
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,860
there's all these tents and all this shit
and all of a sudden he finally fucking

666
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:10,140
dawns on me that the concert
is not in the Roseville.

667
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,130
It's all over this giant golf course.

668
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,130
So the whole time I'm
trying to go in the stadium,

669
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:20,120
there's nothing going on in the
stadium. Fucking moron. Right. And uh,

670
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,810
and also I'm trying to keep
my cool because somebody
told me the other day said

671
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,940
like, dude, you, you do
not handle stress well.

672
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,110
And that of course hurt my ego. I'm
like, what are you talking about?

673
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't handle stress. Well,
I'm a stand up comedian.

674
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,620
I've performed at Madison Square Garden.

675
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,660
I dealt with doing five
minutes of stand up on,

676
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:41,120
on the Dave Letterman show when it was
like 30 below with the air conditioner.

677
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,990
Okay.
One of the most intimidating things ever.

678
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:49,490
And I was able to set aside that fucking
stress and get through it. And uh,

679
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,770
then the person's like, all
right, all right, Geez. You
know, just saying, you know,

680
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,670
and then I realized, it's like, you know,

681
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,170
thinking about it the next day actually
snapping again over something fucking

682
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,630
stupid. That of course, five
minutes later I figured out,

683
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:06,380
probably three minutes later I actually
realized that this person was right.

684
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,020
That I,
it's not,

685
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,120
I don't handle inconvenience.
Well, and then I turn it into like,

686
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,510
what's going on in Hawaii right now with
the lava pouring out and all his shit.

687
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,063
So

688
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,870
yeah.

689
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,240
I don't know. I've done this so many
times. The last couple of days, you know,

690
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,700
except for at the festival when they,

691
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,880
I was doing well with the stress until
they told me the bridge where people were

692
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:35,220
walking was one way.

693
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,540
Yeah.

694
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,380
You know, I just, all right.
I mean if I even taught,

695
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,450
say that one more time you guys, I'm
going to lose my shit again. So anyways,

696
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:45,700
I drove in traffic yesterday.
I was completely relaxed,

697
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:47,410
but I've done this a
million fucking times.

698
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,340
1 million times is somebody
says something to me about it.

699
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,370
It makes me want to change. And
then for two, three days I'm okay.

700
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,930
And then gradually I just go
back to the way I was, you know,

701
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,520
flipping the fuck out.

702
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:08,470
So I think I'm going to start talking
about it on the podcast the way I do with

703
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:10,000
my boozing,
cause I keeps my booze and,

704
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:12,490
and check to tell you guys if I'm
on the wagon, I'm off or whatever.

705
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,440
And then you guys give me shit,
a Billy booze bag,

706
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:17,740
a Billy fucking fat tits and all that
Shit. It makes me hard. Fuck these people.

707
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,640
I'm going back to crushing
waters. Um, so anyways, I'm just,

708
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,130
I finally,
I figured out that this festival is uh,

709
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,600
outside and now,
you know,

710
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,960
I don't know where the fuck I'm going
and the pretenders are going to be on.

711
00:42:34,961 --> 00:42:37,570
They were on in the afternoon,
five 25. Right. Right.

712
00:42:37,571 --> 00:42:40,720
At dusk or should have been
dusk. Different time of
year would have been dusk.

713
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:42,460
Right.
And um,

714
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,780
okay.

715
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,240
I was looking like, what, what the fuck
do I do here? I've got to get some booze.

716
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:50,990
Right. So, you know, they're doing
these little fucking, you know,

717
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,290
they're not pulling at home port.

718
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:56,990
So I got like two whiskeys and I'm walking
around, you know, my stupid Little Cup.

719
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,440
Right. And I see this fucking
guy even older than me.

720
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:04,010
He must've been like 63.
It's actually still in pretty good shape.

721
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:08,510
But he had the long gray hair. He had
his shirt off, you know, just that guy.

722
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:13,510
He's been going to concerts forever,
you know, and the pretenders startup.

723
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,490
And I'm trying to find
where the, uh, you know,

724
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:20,090
the best place where I could watch it.
And he starts doing like that, you know,

725
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:23,930
that like that,
that fucking hippie surfer,

726
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:28,730
spiritual white guy dancing.
It was a touch of Tai Chi in there.

727
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,120
You know,
he's still in that fucking dance

728
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,940
and you know,
it's the same dance he does to all music.

729
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,510
I don't even know what it is. And they
always have like this look on their face.

730
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,830
When you look in this smiling,

731
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,550
they always look at you like they have
life figured out. Like they know what,

732
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,580
what makes they like,
hey man, like you know,

733
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:52,430
they're going to say all this spiritual
bullshit to you that you could find on

734
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:55,700
the side of a fucking
Dixie Cup. You know? Um,

735
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,340
then whoever that guy is, I
want to thank you. I fuck it.

736
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:03,020
It was laughing my ass off.
Uh,

737
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,670
just a faggy had his shirt off. I
get to sit. He was still doing the,

738
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,310
I got him [inaudible] he was still doing
the pushups so he didn't have the man

739
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:14,070
boobs. But still, it's like, come
on man, these young people here,

740
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,580
if they don't want to see that,
cover yourself up.

741
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:22,370
This whole fucking pride in your
age and everything, you know,

742
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:25,490
or how you look is all well and
good, but you know, you know what?

743
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,270
It's kind of disappeared is common
fucking courtesy for your fellow man.

744
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,430
Good Lord. You know, I just, it just
blows my mind. It really doesn't. It does.

745
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,580
Doesn't cause you know what?

746
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,230
I think that guy was a baby boomer,

747
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,290
you know, and there's never, you know, you
know, right before the baby boomer, sorry,

748
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,300
gotta plug my headphones back in right
before the baby boomers was the greatest

749
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:55,950
generation. According to Tom Broker,
they're the greatest generation. Like,

750
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:58,740
I think the baby boomers
resilink like the most selfish,

751
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,750
like maybe because there's so many of
them that they had such an influence on

752
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:07,110
the culture and they think every fucking
thing that happened during that time

753
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,140
was just so God damn important.
That just, I dunno, I think,

754
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:15,141
and I think that there would just so up
their own ass about themselves that now

755
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,390
that they're old and all wrinkly,
they just can't, they can't,

756
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,240
they just can't let it go. Can't
let it go. You know? I mean,

757
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:23,791
I'm not gonna lie to you.

758
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:28,530
I'm fighting aging by trying to work out
and stay in shape and eat right and all

759
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:30,600
that type of stuff. But
yeah, I stayed covered up.

760
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,780
I have empathy for people in their 20s.
They, they, they don't want to see it.

761
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,130
So anyways,
um,

762
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,620
I go by the spiritual dancing guy and I
wore my way up as close to the stage as

763
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:50,280
I possibly can. And I have to tell
you something, man, have Chrissy Hine,

764
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,590
the paternity is fucking murdered.

765
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,250
She sounded like she once
again, two weeks in a row.

766
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,270
I've seen great concerts.
She sounded as great as the albums that I,

767
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:06,300
I grew up listening to.
And um,

768
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,810
the song she opened with was on her,
her new album.

769
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:15,470
It was just about being a loner and liking
not being in a relationship and shit.

770
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:18,530
And, uh, the lyrics are hilarious and I,

771
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,990
I'm almost a little ashamed at
like how much I relate to the song.

772
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:23,760
I told her afterwards, I was
like, I fucking love this.

773
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,390
Okay.

774
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,223
Um,

775
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,350
but they just fucking murder and
she's such a bad ass total rock star.

776
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,290
Like the real deal, paid her dues, all
that shit. You just see all of that.

777
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,060
When you watch her perform.
It was tremendous.

778
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:44,690
And she gets off stage and
then next up was Jack White,

779
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:46,800
Jack fucking white,
right?

780
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,050
I get to see him come out with this
new lineup, the new sound that he has,

781
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:56,790
he was fucking unbelievable day.
You know, there's another guy,

782
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,200
if you go see him,
it's like,

783
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,240
when have you ever seen that guy even
remotely take a show of like half a second

784
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:04,890
off during a show?
Forget about a show.

785
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:08,550
That guy never is the
intense of phoning it in.

786
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:13,320
Whenever I see that guy perform live,
I always get inspired as a comedian.

787
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:16,380
Like I could be working a little harder.

788
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:18,260
Okay,

789
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,860
I can be trying to give people
a better show here. So, um,

790
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,200
his said ended and um,
I walked over

791
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,910
to go see the smiths who I run my,
one of my brothers listen to them.

792
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,950
Everybody I knew listened to better
music than I listened to in the 80s.

793
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:40,710
I just was listening to like, I
mean, I listened to some good shit,

794
00:47:40,711 --> 00:47:43,770
but I was listening to a lot of
fucking hair metal, you know,

795
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,850
which is why I missed out on Pantera and
fucking all those bands that came out.

796
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:52,350
Like I was, I was, I was too far
the other direction. Like, Hey,

797
00:47:52,351 --> 00:47:55,860
every rose has its door, you
know? Then also I was like,

798
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,350
Pauly Paul Shad, right? I'm just like,
what the fuck is this? This is, you know,

799
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,030
I'm as cynical as the next guy, but
Jesus Christ, that's another thing.

800
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:09,240
I started listening to that Iowa album,
that slipknot shit and like,

801
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:10,740
okay.

802
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,280
I always liked the, uh, the heretic
thing. People equal shit. I was,

803
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,070
that was kind of funny.
Um,

804
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,080
but I never like,
I dunno,

805
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:24,950
it was just too much going on and now
I'm listening to a fucking 20 years after

806
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:29,600
it came out going like, this
fucking album is unbelievable. Um,

807
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,960
but I mean, have, you know, there's
only so much fucking music he can lead.

808
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,590
You're going to miss something, right?
I've got to forgive myself on some level.

809
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,450
So anyways, uh, I went over and I saw
the smiths and I remember that one,

810
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,990
that one song that crossed over that even
like a fucking mainstream Charlie like

811
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:50,820
me heard where it was a, that
stopped the meds. You know, rab, uh,

812
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,960
stop. It's up to your
future. Right. Anyways,

813
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:58,961
I watched those guys that band fucking
murdered and did the impossible.

814
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:04,630
I felt it had like 10,000 white people
all dancing for their entire fucking set.

815
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:11,060
It was ridiculous. Um, how hard they
killed and then they ended this, this set.

816
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,620
Yeah.

817
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,530
Such a cool way they had
the crowd do was sing along.

818
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,330
Okay.

819
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,090
As a band we started playing a little
more quiet, a little more quiet,

820
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,120
a little more quiet.
And,

821
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:24,920
and the lead singer was like roasting
people in the crowd go, great job.

822
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,100
Great job. You don't sound that good.
You feel like you got bronchitis

823
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,060
and everybody's laughing.
And then the band just sorta,

824
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,640
just gradually stopped playing
and the crowd one more time sang,

825
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:43,310
uh, or does it the chorus. And then
they said, thanks a lot. Good night.

826
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:46,610
It was so fucking cool. And, um,

827
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,520
and then Neil young starts playing.

828
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:51,200
Now you got to walk across
the golf course again.

829
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:56,120
And my back was fucking killing me and
I was jet lagged and all of that shit.

830
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,470
And I just, I hate to say this, I've
never seen Neil young and concert. I just,

831
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,980
I couldn't make it, you know,
and I had to get home, you know,

832
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:06,740
I got a kids getting up and
shit and it's just like,

833
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,910
I don't want to fucking see Neil young
standing outside with my backbone fucking

834
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:12,803
okay.

835
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,020
You know,

836
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,620
it's talking to me next to some fucking
60 year old guy doing his Tai Chi

837
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:22,640
fucking hey man, dance. I want
to see this guy in a theater.

838
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:27,080
So I, I stood there and I
watched him play one song.

839
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,260
Um, so I could say, or at least most
of the first sock, he didn't even sing.

840
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:37,610
It was just like him playing guitar and
Shit. I think his experience was like,

841
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,240
I got to get all those people that would
just over at the Smith's time to come

842
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,690
over. Sure. People's feet hurt
and their backs hurt. I mean,

843
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:49,610
he's probably doing me a favor,
but I just, you know, I dunno.

844
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,880
I just said to my friends, I was
like, guys, I gotta I gotta go home.

845
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,800
I can't and I ubered here and it's just
going to be a thousand fucking people to,

846
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,420
and I just know how I'm wired.

847
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,320
I have to find that one way bridge
that's going to allow me to get the fuck

848
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:07,700
outta here. And I actually left, um,

849
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,900
during one of my favorite singers of
all time during his fucking set. Um,

850
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,470
but anyways, it's a great show
and all that. If you're younger,

851
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,800
definitely check it out. If you're
older, definitely stretch, you know,

852
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:25,700
try to keep your shirt on. Um, I
saw these two people. Oh my God,

853
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:26,860
these two fucking Wales,

854
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,460
he's too fat people like one of those
fat couples and they were just asleep on

855
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:32,450
their picnic blanket.

856
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,940
Like both in like the spooning position,
but faced opposite.

857
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,600
It was like a fat ying Yang.

858
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,770
They would just lay in there. You
know what they look like, you know,

859
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,120
like at the zoo when they
tranquilize like, uh,

860
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,500
one of those big cats when those predators
and then it's just like, all right,

861
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:52,580
now that we knocked it out,

862
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:55,250
we need to bring a fucking machine
over here to pick this thing up.

863
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,430
It weighs like 600 fucking pounds.
Um,

864
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,050
and I dunno, they were,
they were oddly adorable.

865
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:08,600
Like I was like, it must be
fun. You know what I mean?

866
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:12,380
Like you like those commercials
come out and you see like

867
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,750
Domino's or like Papa Ginos we'll
have like a fucking some deal,

868
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:20,960
like get two pizzas for seven
bucks and if you get that,

869
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:25,010
we'll throw in the fucking chocolate chip
cookie pie with the whipped cream and

870
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,300
ice cream.
Right.

871
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,510
And I always make fun of that Shit and I
always make fun of it because this is a

872
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:34,430
big part of me that just wants to
order that and take the ride, you know,

873
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,660
have the salt fucking take me down to
the ground. Right. And that the is,

874
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:43,010
I think I'm going to fucking, you know,
sink into the rug like that. Dude.

875
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:43,791
And trade spotting.

876
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:48,110
Then he started eating the fucking
cookie pie and you start coming back like

877
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,370
Hulk Hogan.
You know when he,

878
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,670
when they went to drop his hand that last
time and it didn't go down and all of

879
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:55,060
a sudden you eat the cookie thing
and you start shaking your Yag,

880
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:59,090
he starts strutting around.
Right. But you don't,

881
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,680
you don't. And they get,
they get to live that life.

882
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,540
They get to sit there and like I bet
they got one of those, you know those,

883
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:14,420
you know those big fucking couches that
on either side there's the recliner but

884
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:18,110
it's still like a sofa. I bet
they got one of those, right.

885
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:22,160
And then in the middle the thing comes
down. Remember that it was basically,

886
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:26,070
it was a fat fuck couch.
These to make this thing before,

887
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,810
like the biggest loser
and everything came out.

888
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:31,560
It was like catering for people
who were fat fucks or were,

889
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,620
their goal in life was to become a fat
fuck because on either side of this big

890
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:40,470
couch like cute, you could pull a
lever and you've feet could go up.

891
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:42,360
And then in the middle
this thing would come down.

892
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:46,890
There's a place for your drinks and like
a fucking pizza and he just sit there

893
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:50,310
with you, with the girlfriend, you know,

894
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,350
watching the TV you feed up,

895
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,920
get the AC cranked can just destroy,

896
00:53:55,921 --> 00:54:00,921
like just destroying the fucking
planet and your absolute like Utopia.

897
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:04,951
I mean,

898
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,610
I don't know if you guys believe in an
afterlife and which I've thought about a

899
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,850
lot when Vinnie past,
you know,

900
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:14,790
there was all that talk
about now he's reunited,

901
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,510
reunited with his brother and I
was definitely thinking, you know,

902
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:23,070
I really hope that that
happens, you know? Um,

903
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,730
so let's say that it does okay.

904
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,760
If you're a fat couple and you have one
of those couches and you'll watch it,

905
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:36,450
one of your favorite shows on Netflix
or Hulu, whatever the fuck you do,

906
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:40,320
and you're sitting there with your feet
reclined eating a pizza and he got that

907
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:43,830
cookie fucking pizza thing coming next,

908
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,160
drinking your favorite drink.
It's just like,

909
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:52,161
what could the afterlife offer you that's
going to be any better than that if

910
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:57,510
you truly love one another, you know,
when you got the AC going, you know,

911
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:01,180
you get your toes out. I mean, I dunno,

912
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:04,680
I think I'm selling a lifestyle right now
here. I think I'm selling some couches.

913
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,510
Um, anyways, but I had a great
time and uh, if you get a chance,

914
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,590
you know,
like I said,

915
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:14,710
definitely check out that festival and I
feel really bad that I had to leave to,

916
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,860
I left during Neil Young. The
fuck is wrong with me. I have to,

917
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,760
I have to fix that in the future
by seeing him. But like, you know,

918
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,750
I want to see that guy.
Like,

919
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:25,840
did you have a scene when he
did that film was at the Ryman.

920
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,050
That's what you want to see fucking
deal young. Yeah. You see him at this,

921
00:55:29,051 --> 00:55:33,010
I'm not trying to not sell this festival,
but I'm just saying, look, I'm old.

922
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:35,920
I need a chair. Okay.
There I said it all right.

923
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,500
I used to be able to stand.
Evidently I can't any longer.

924
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,320
I was able to kind of work, but
work my way out of it. I know it's,

925
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:48,040
it's my fucking posture.
Posture stinks, you know,

926
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,300
it's all those years from fucking
hating yourself, you know,

927
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,980
fucking slinking down.
I'm an albino stop looking at me.

928
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:57,640
Alright.

929
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,640
Indochino indocin or talk about how
every man looks better in a suit.

930
00:56:03,261 --> 00:56:07,010
Well, you know, when I'm
out there trolling for cock,
you know, it's just like,

931
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,960
I hate to be picky,
but guys,

932
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,800
the sweatpants and the lazy look
isn't doing it for me. All right?

933
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:16,220
If I'm going to give it up,
I want a nice meal. Okay.

934
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:17,870

989
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:24,950
All right,

990
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,430
good to give you 100% effort at 50 years
of age and you can only get them if you

991
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:31,160
go out to the show cause I'm not shipping
them out. Again, dealing with, hey man,

992
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,120
like I fucking Yag thinking
ain't can't find it right now.

996
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:51,320
All right. We got some great emails
this week. The first one, Vinnie, Paul.

997
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,970
Hey Bill.
By now,

998
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:55,760
I'm sure that you're heard that Vinnie
Paul passed away last Friday. Uh,

999
00:59:55,761 --> 00:59:59,210
much like you talked about
Malcolm Young after his death.

1000
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,570
I feel like Vinny was another one
who just lived an amazing life.

1001
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,570
One of the great drummers to ever get
behind the kid. I got to tell you,

1002
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:10,571
like all everything that I saw on Twitter
from all these big time rockstars over

1003
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:17,420
and over and over again, other than
stating the obvious what a monster,

1004
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,120
amazing drummer he was.
Everybody's just talked about what a,

1005
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,810
what a nice guy he was. Um, anyways,

1006
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:26,120
he said I was too young when Panthera
was leaving their mark on the metal scene

1007
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:30,040
through the 90s. So I never got to see
Pantera played live before they disbanded.

1008
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:34,330
However, I did get to see Vinny play
with hell yeah, back in the day, uh,

1009
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,570
back in 2016 at a Rockfield
festival in Jacksonville, Florida.

1010
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:43,400
He was quite simply incredible. Oh, this
is a cool story. I read this before, um,

1011
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,760
the podcast, something I never
do, but I saw it said, Vinnie.

1012
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:48,860
Paul said I wanted to read it.
I said,

1013
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,830
I remember being pretty close to the front
of the stage and Vinnie was the first

1014
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:54,020
band member to come out
before the show started.

1015
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,560
When he stood up behind the drum kit,
he had this smile on his face.

1016
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,900
Like he was just really happy to be there.

1017
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,180
He twirled his drum
stick at the whole crowd.

1018
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,310
A crowd saluted by putting his fist
in the air and then the madness begin.

1019
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,510
But for most of the show,

1020
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:12,950
I couldn't take my eyes off of him because
of how good he was. Oh, that's awesome.

1021
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,810
And even though he was that good,

1022
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:18,260
the biggest memory I have of him was
that he was smiling the whole show.

1023
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,300
Like he just loved playing in c,

1024
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,070
seeing people enjoy themselves as much
as he was. He will be missed by more.

1025
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:28,040
You will be missed by more than we know.

1026
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,990
I don't know if that sentence
makes sense. Um, if you remember,

1027
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:36,990
please cranked a Panthera song up as
loud as she can. Today. I'm sure Vinnie,

1028
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,690
we'll hear it. Best
switches, Eh, um, a I um,

1029
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,560
best which is incompetent. It said, um,

1030
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,320
the hours already listened to the fucking
shit every day anyways. You know what,

1031
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,710
you know, it's a great album. Great
live album. Is there 101 proof?

1032
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,830
I'm such a bad ass Alba and my,

1033
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,880
one of my favorite things is when they
play unbroken and fill as Phil's doing

1034
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:04,790
the intro video. Vinnie's already counting
in the song. Just how tight they were.

1035
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,560
Always our world shore. We Bernard's
called our broker. No Maverick of course.

1036
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:13,640
Jab Brown al Bag.
Alright, coco the gorilla.

1037
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:13,851
Oh,

1038
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:18,851
I saw this too at fucking
sweetheart of a gorilla.

1039
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:20,500
Okay.

1040
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,960
Um, did I did the bit
above. Hey Bill, I saw you.

1041
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:27,460
You live last year and I love you special.
We talk about teaching gorillas,

1042
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:28,294
sign language.

1043
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:33,420
I was watching clips of cocoa interacting
with people like with flee from the

1044
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:36,160
Chili peppers and Robin Williams.
I watched those.

1045
01:02:36,161 --> 01:02:40,330
I was still nervous and I just saw a flea
laying down and there's like a fucking

1046
01:02:40,331 --> 01:02:44,530
gorilla right next to them. Um, I dunno,

1047
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,180
I get you're shooting the shit with
it. You can kind of, I dunno. Um, um,

1048
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,210
it made me nervous,
you know,

1049
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:57,430
I wonder if it made me nervous just
because I'm such a big fan of flee and I

1050
01:02:57,431 --> 01:02:58,900
didn't want to see anything happen to him.

1051
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:02,120
Like it was a bass player from a band I
didn't give a shit about. And they go,

1052
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,440
look at this guy, this could get
interesting. Um, anyways, it was,

1053
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:10,240
it was charming as hell. I was wondering
if you ever sat down with cocoa,

1054
01:03:10,241 --> 01:03:14,100
if ever given a chance. Well, no, not
after the bid. I did. They probably,

1055
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,890
this guy's a fucking asshole.
Uh,

1056
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:19,960
you could have asked him why the chicken
cross the road and wait for a chuckle

1057
01:03:19,961 --> 01:03:21,880
or try to explain humor to him.

1058
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,353
MMM.

1059
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,290
Five. Or sat down with that gorilla
I, and that thing, actually,

1060
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:32,350
if that wasn't a party trick, if it
actually knew how to do sign language,

1061
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,140
I imagine it would sign to me.
You seem nervous.

1062
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,070
Yeah.

1063
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:40,250
At our and back. Yeah. Well,
you're a fucking gorilla.

1064
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,340
Um, anyways, kid show recommendation.

1065
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,410
Um, hey there, Billy
Barnicle balls. I want to,

1066
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,690
I want, if you want a show to watch
with your girlfriend, checkout.

1067
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:58,610
Okay.

1068
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,520
I thought it said octo nuts
like something with eight balls.

1069
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,300
Octonauts is it an octopus in outer space?

1070
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:10,460
I watched it with my girls and kids and
I actually learned some stuff. All right,

1071
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:12,670
well that was about as vague as the,
uh,

1072
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:17,840
what was it that was that movie way back
in the game, the silent game or the,

1073
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,500
okay.

1074
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,170
There's something game or
the something or other.

1075
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
David spade had that joke.
I'm going to tell the,

1076
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:32,001
so I'm going to tell you guys the
secret of the crying game and he goes

1077
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,503
overrated.

1078
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:36,690
Okay.

1079
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:40,930
All right. Hair, transplant, depression.
Oh No. Hey old freckled Dick.

1080
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:45,400
I'm a 21 year old man. I recently
got a hair transplant surgery. Well,

1081
01:04:45,401 --> 01:04:49,970
you must be a hairy motherfucker,
man. You went bald that are soon. Um,

1082
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,620
the surgery went great.
Good, good for you.

1083
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,670
But I now hate that I have a
huge scar in the back of my head.

1084
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,570
I don't they do it now where
they just vacuum the shit out.

1085
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:06,110
So you don't have to have that smile
on the back of your head. You Go.

1086
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:10,120
So every time I cut my hair, you can
see it. Could you give me some advice?

1087
01:05:10,121 --> 01:05:14,020
So what I should do?
Well yeah,

1088
01:05:14,021 --> 01:05:18,000
don't cut your hair so fucking short
now that you got of back on top of your

1089
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:21,930
head. Grow your hair out. You'll
be fine. That was an easy one.

1090
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,420
What are you doing? You got hair plugs
yet? I'm hacked the back of your head.

1091
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:31,990
Then you got fucking hair plugs and now
you're shaving your head down to the

1092
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:35,730
point where you can fucking see it
anyways. What was the point? Um,

1093
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,320
I dunno. I would just, I guess I would
just grow my hair out a little bit.

1094
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,770
I don't think it has to be
that long to cover the scar.

1095
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,160
As long as it's long enough
that you can't see your scalp,

1096
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:52,450
I think he should be all
right. Right. Anyways,

1097
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,460
pit bull problems.
Dear [inaudible].

1098
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,940
Oh Billy. Easy shave butter. Oh,

1099
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:04,090
fussy Ellie's face right now.
That's easy for Seeley's. Easy.

1100
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:11,130
I Dunno, I have no idea. I suck at
that shit. As he former pit bull owner,

1101
01:06:11,131 --> 01:06:15,300
I'd like to ask your advice on a problem
I'm having. My wife comes home from,

1102
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,040
my wife comes from a large family and
they get together at her parents every

1103
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,280
month for Sunday dinner and family
hang out. It's the last two times.

1104
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,010
My brother in law has brought,

1105
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:29,760
his recently is recently adopted pit bull.

1106
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,590
It's a rescue dog and he doesn't take,

1107
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:35,820
it was abused or used to fight
because it's so good with kids.

1108
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:38,610
According to him it's a large family.
So there,

1109
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:43,110
there are about 50 kids ages three to
11 running around and my four year old

1110
01:06:43,111 --> 01:06:46,770
daughters, one of them, she loves
dogs and likes this one in particular,

1111
01:06:46,771 --> 01:06:48,720
but both times he's brought my dog.

1112
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:53,310
My daughter has come running to me in
tears because it got over excited and

1113
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,730
jumped onto her too rough.
Well that's the thing about pities man.

1114
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,870
They just a big fucking
awesome ball of muscle.

1115
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,360
And when I used to wrestle with my dog,

1116
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:06,880
I used to have to lay my
neck over the top of neck.

1117
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:11,890
He had to get inside because she was
lightening quick and she would turn around

1118
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:16,980
and her head was like a wrecking ball.
God,

1119
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:20,490
I miss that fucking dog. I still get to
see her every couple of months. But I,

1120
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,870
I really miss that. Um, anyways, he goes,

1121
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:28,890
I don't hate dogs, but I don't love them
either and I don't trust pitbulls. Well,

1122
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:31,830
you have to validate all of
that. Okay. To be quite honest,

1123
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:32,970
I'm kind of afraid of them.

1124
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,700
I never forget myself as
something happened to my daughter.

1125
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:39,510
If I say something to my inlaws,
I looked like a kill joy asshole.

1126
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,050
But I'm too stressed out to enjoy the
family gathering because I'm hovering over

1127
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:43,884
a constantly.

1128
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,880
So my wife's response has been to treat
me like I'm overreacting and dismiss my

1129
01:07:47,881 --> 01:07:49,890
concerns.
It's bothering me so much.

1130
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:52,470
I've considered just keeping
my daughter home next time.

1131
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,680
But am I making too big a deal about this?

1132
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,810
I think it's a recipe for disaster.

1133
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:01,800
I don't feel like it's my place to tell
my brother in law to keep it at home and

1134
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:03,750
my wife's not supporting me.
Please tell him.

1135
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,890
Please let me know if you have any ideas.
Uh,

1136
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:12,810
may I see a Vod Vod to fair for two.
Thank you.

1137
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,780
Thank you. And I imagine
that's saying go fuck yourself.

1138
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,860
Um,

1139
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,480
I know ed and go to is you fit all right.

1140
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:30,620
Anyways. Um, I would say this dude,

1141
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,670
you have to like,
if that's what you're feeling,

1142
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,350
you don't have to tell anybody,

1143
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,000
leave a dog home and you just have to
communicate this to people. All right?

1144
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:44,360
Say you don't hate dogs,
you don't love him either and you don't,

1145
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:46,940
I don't trust pit bulls.
Okay.

1146
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:50,620
And just tell them that rather than be
like he did fucking lunatic. Good. No,

1147
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,450
just tell them that.
All right.

1148
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,410
And I would sit down with
your wife and say that,

1149
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:58,640
you know,

1150
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,640
I don't feel like you're
hearing me all right.

1151
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:07,970
She's my daughter and I'm concerned
and I have to be honest, you know,

1152
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:09,410
if you had these concerns,

1153
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,850
I would listen to them and you're not
validating what I'm feeling and it's

1154
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:17,120
really bothering me and I can't
enjoy when I go over there.

1155
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,050
I don't want to be this kill joy,
but I'm hovering over our kid and I just,

1156
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:25,460
you know, it's bothering me.
You married me, you love me,

1157
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,920
I'm telling you something's bothering me.
We need to talk.

1158
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,260
If I say you can't go
there because I'd be,

1159
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,370
and you fucking talk to me about this,
that's what I would do.

1160
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,930
Keep it in the register.
I was just in all right.

1161
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:42,100
And don't stop having the conversation
until there's a solution that you're

1162
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:47,300
satisfied with. It should
daughter. Okay. And uh,

1163
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:52,040
you know, dogs are abused. All right?

1164
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:56,660
And if a dog snaps, you know,
it's a bad thing around a kid.

1165
01:09:56,661 --> 01:10:00,200
And then when you have a pit bull, the
thing about a pit bull is its capability.

1166
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,230
You know what I mean?
Some dogs,

1167
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:06,470
they like a little water pistol and other
dogs or like a fucking bazooka at that

1168
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:10,430
dog is a bazooka.
So not saying the breed is bad,

1169
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,390
I'm just saying if somebody fuck
that dog up and it does snap,

1170
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,370
the results are,
you know,

1171
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:22,130
going to be really bad. So, and you have
to address that. That's being a real,

1172
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:26,900
being a responsible parent and these
people need to listen to you and a,

1173
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:29,570
you need to speak up. You gotta stand
up for yourself there, buddy. Boy,

1174
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,780
that's my advice. All
right, good luck. Okay.

1175
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:36,440
Lay De lady manager crossing the line.

1176
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,560
Dear bill or William below will you
call yourself but a little below wall.

1177
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:47,980
I'm a 23 or 23 year old lady who just
started working in an office for,

1178
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:51,740
I love when women write in. It's always
guys, God bless you for writing it.

1179
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:56,000
Who just started working in an office
for a big company. It's a boring job,

1180
01:10:56,001 --> 01:11:00,410
but while I figure out what to do with
my life after graduating, it's all right.

1181
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:03,560
Well there you go. That's not bad. He's
23. He gets your whole life ahead of you.

1182
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:08,390
Uh, I got promoted with the recommendation
from my former manager at this 40

1183
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:12,710
something year old woman who
I thought was quite nice. Uh,

1184
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:16,550
now she's not my manager anymore,
although she's still senior to me.

1185
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:21,470
She has been a little inappropriate
with me after an office Christmas party.

1186
01:11:21,471 --> 01:11:24,860
Me and my colleagues went to a club.
Uh,

1187
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:27,860
I came out of the club
bathrooms and she was waiting.

1188
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,220
She didn't even come with
us. Well, that's weird.

1189
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,780
She waved me over to sit next to her
and asked me if I was gay. I said, no,

1190
01:11:35,781 --> 01:11:40,310
I'm not. And she went fine and it didn't
speak to me for the rest of the night.

1191
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:45,830
All right, well she needs a better
opening line that she's a little blunt.

1192
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:50,720
You know, she's in business. She
got right down to brass tacks. Uh,

1193
01:11:50,721 --> 01:11:54,650
she said I was a bit uncomfortable with
the question because what business is it

1194
01:11:54,651 --> 01:11:55,484
of hers.

1195
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:56,930
Okay.

1196
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:58,850
Oh, I thought she was gay. She
wanted to hook up with you.

1197
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,240
Yeah,

1198
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,860
because what business is it of her?

1199
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:06,480
So I told one of my work
pals what had happened. Uh,

1200
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:10,920
they had been at the company longer than
me went, wow, you're her new one then.

1201
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,810
Oh boy.

1202
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,810
Oh Gee.
I asked them what they meant.

1203
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:22,170
And a guy said, well, I
mean, look at her right now.

1204
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:26,970
She's filming you and
she, Sarah enough. What?

1205
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:29,850
And sure enough she was. She
was, when I turned around,

1206
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:33,870
she hid her phone as I was a little
bit too drunk and under the influence.

1207
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:37,620
I was already paranoid, so I decided
to leave because I felt so gross.

1208
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:38,881
Since then,

1209
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:43,881
she's pulled me aside to say that
I looked delicious and scrumptious.

1210
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,820
Oh, what a crape. Whenever she
sees me at the end of the day,

1211
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:50,850
she taps her cheek and demands that kiss.

1212
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,453
Okay.

1213
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:57,060
Oh yeah. What the fuck is this
part? She Ain't, oh, that's,

1214
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,220
that's like a gross relative.

1215
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:06,550
She asked a girl who works for me to take
pictures of me and to send it to her.

1216
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:09,110
When we're at a pub.

1217
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,920
I consider myself an assertive girl,

1218
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:17,970
but there's something about
how public about her actions,

1219
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:21,900
which makes me so timid,
so I go along with it. No,

1220
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,470
I'll do that.

1221
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,590
You think you would think that
because she's not my manager anymore.

1222
01:13:27,591 --> 01:13:29,240
Now that I've been promoted,
it wouldn't be a problem,

1223
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:31,490
but it is because my new
manager is their best friend.

1224
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:35,630
I don't want to cause a riff in this new
job, but it's really stressing me out.

1225
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:39,980
Am I within my rights to tell her to stop?
Absolutely. You are. I do. I tell it.

1226
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:41,570
Is that no,

1227
01:13:41,571 --> 01:13:44,720
I don't want to kiss her on her cheek
every time I see you without looking like

1228
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:47,030
a bitch.
Listen,

1229
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:52,160
the way you're looking
at this is fucking crazy.

1230
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:53,590
Yeah.

1231
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:57,400
You're, you're sitting here looking at
like how like your being an asshole.

1232
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:00,790
You're not,
this person is completely out of line.

1233
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,810
She said a few of my friends thinks
it's a funny situation, but I don't,

1234
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,280
and if you don't then it isn't.

1235
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:10,660
You've got to validate that if this
was a male manager, he'd be reported.

1236
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,570
I your stuff so much and I
wish I could come back to,

1237
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:17,810
you'd come back to Glasgow someday
from a fellow fellow pasty redhead.

1238
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:23,180
Um, all right. Dev
Fellow fucking pasty. Um,

1239
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:24,720
okay.

1240
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:29,640
This is what you gotta do. She
asked for a kiss. You tell her no.

1241
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,570
Okay.

1242
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,280
And I just stare at, I mean, listen,

1243
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,880
you have all the fucking power in the
world or if you just want to go to the

1244
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:38,320
manager and say,
listen,

1245
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:41,740
I don't want to cause some me
to scandal or any of that shit.

1246
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,780
Can You keep this weird old fucking
bag away from me and tell her to be

1247
01:14:46,781 --> 01:14:50,650
professional? I mean, that's
the proper way to do it.

1248
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,890
Those are the proper channels,
but I have to

1249
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,710
do it that way. Do it that way. Okay.

1250
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,380
Do it that way. And, and, and
document that this has been happening.

1251
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:10,130
You have all these witnesses about them
filming her and all of this type of shit.

1252
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:14,390
If they ever tried to fire you, I
mean, you don't have a problem at this.

1253
01:15:14,391 --> 01:15:18,410
This kind of thing needs to stop and uh,
you know,

1254
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,610
in a perfect world you'd go to her
because I don't like that whole telling on

1255
01:15:21,611 --> 01:15:25,940
her thing. But that's how the
business world works. Um, you know,

1256
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:29,000
in a perfect world when she fucking goes,
like pointed to were cheeky.

1257
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,260
That's right where you should punch her

1258
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,500
fucking blast or right
in the fucking face.

1259
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,503
Yeah.

1260
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:42,510
Yeah. I mean if you were ever at a
bar again and she's doing that Shit,

1261
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:45,090
I would fucking dump a drink
right over her fucking head.

1262
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,420
Like that's just creepy
behavior. I would just, MMM,

1263
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:50,460
okay.

1264
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,970
You got to stop this Timothy. Cause if
you're timid someone like that, it's,

1265
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:56,640
it's gonna. It's like a magnet.
They're going to go right towards you.

1266
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,640
You got to step up to her and tell
her what a fucking creep she is.

1267
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:03,090
And if I catch you take
a video of our, our, uh,

1268
