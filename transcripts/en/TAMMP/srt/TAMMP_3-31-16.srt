1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,130
Hey, what's going on is bill burn
is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,920
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Yeah.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,620
Just checking it on you.
What's, uh, what's going on?

4
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,630
I am actually doing this podcast.

5
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:19,450
I'm in the middle of a radio tour right
now and I have a 15 minute break and I'm

6
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,870
on my way to the fucking airport after
that and have to bike cleo. We, oh,

7
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:27,010
we're going to buy her some dog food, you
know, so my wife has some, the Fijian,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,870
isn't that right buddy? All right,
get out of here. Go lay down. Qt. Um,

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,461
so I got a full day,

10
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:36,700
so I'm trying to knock out 15 minutes
before I go back to doing the radio tour,

11
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:40,470
which is why I sound like I'm already
off and running as opposed to my, you,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,740
I guess I'm never chilled and laid back.
So I've been doing morning radio, um,

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,520
to hype my Saint Louis and Kansas City,
uh,

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,020
dates that are coming up and a,

15
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:55,870
and then also I got this a Canadian
tour that I'm doing. And, um,

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,330
so I just spent on the fucking radio
all day and everybody's just, you know,

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,100
I was taught more Canadian fucking Djs
were going to bust my balls about the

18
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:06,760
Bruins. I guess you can't, you know,

19
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:10,630
considering not one Canadian team is
going to make the fucking playoffs,

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,970
which is play off that, which is insane.
Not One of them. Cleo, can you believe it?

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,930
Not The fucking blue block.
A douche is not Ottawa,

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,540
Not Toronto. Toronto, Toronto.

23
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,490
Not The fuck at the Calgary flames.

24
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:32,491
The Edmonton oil is the Vancouver
Canucks l or the Winnipeg jets.

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,040
You know, I don't think that's
good for hockey. I mean,

26
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,490
it's a funny thing to bring
up as an American when I
go up there and believe me,

27
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:42,970
it will be brought up. No, I'm not going
to rub your face is in it. How could I,

28
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:44,670
yeah,

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,440
but Goddamn Bruins, you know,
we're a three seat now. We're,

30
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:52,530
we're like,
we've launched six of the last seven

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,670
fucking unbelievable.
Thank God for Toronto.

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,930
Got To left Toronto most
generous fucking team out there.

33
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,050
They're always there to pick
you up off the mat, aren't they?

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,540
That's the only team we beat.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,080
Okay.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,820
Fucking laws to everybody. Rangers,
Panthers, San Jose, Anaheim,

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,111
the kings.

38
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:17,830
And then we just fucking lost two to one
hat breaker to the fucking devil's now

39
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:20,550
like we're playing bad.
I still think we're going to get in there.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,710
Okay.

41
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,543
You know what I mean?

42
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,540
I just want us to make the
playoffs so fucking clickbait. Uh,

43
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,820
Dan Shaughnessy doesn't start writing
his dumb ass fucking articles about how

44
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:32,870
they need to do something.

45
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,350
It's Sophie being a coach is so fucked
up cause you got deal with the dance.

46
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:39,710
Shauna's seas of the world.
How unathletic does that guy look?

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,850
You know what I mean? He doesn't
even look like he plays chess either.

48
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,170
He just looks like a dope

49
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,750
that's saying I don't,
but I've never just seen a deck.

50
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:52,880
Fucking guy should be run out of Boston.

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,240
Okay.

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,290
This whole fucking thing.

53
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,160
He lives for the moment when
the home team isn't doing well.

54
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,970
That's his whole fucking thing.
I had never forget that when the fucking,

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,020
I think it was one of the red sox won
the world series. Finally. He was like,

56
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,860
I don't even know how to write this
article because you doubt your negative

57
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,723
comment.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,070
I bet it for fucking plane crashed into
the stadium and killed the whole fucking

59
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:21,870
home TV. That, that, that article would
be a breeze as you pretended to be sad.

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,120
Oh, Doug, that guy drives
me nuts. Drives me nuts.

61
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,040
He should be writing for
a New York newspaper.

62
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:33,990
He Shits on fucking Boston
teams so much. Um, so anyways,

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,670
anyways, where the fuck am
I? Clio for the love of God.

64
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,750
Are you allergic to your bed?
It's all you do is itch now.

65
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,830
Huh?
Look at that face.

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,850
That face that stupid that
my dog has such a classic

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,830
pooch face. It's ridiculous. Is
that what they call you? Clear off?

68
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:58,710
Was that your nickname in
high school? Oh, pooch face.

69
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,830
Can you get over there and lay down and
stop looking at me like I didn't take

70
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:05,380
you out. Why didn't take it out? I let you
down the stairs, but I also fed ya. Hey,

71
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,450
get over there. Lay down. Go on fucking
thing doesn't even listen to me anyway,

72
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,840
go on.
I shouldn't be yelling at my dog.

73
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:18,170
My dog's is senior now.
She's eight and a half years old,

74
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:22,430
so she's officially a senior.
So when I go and buy dog food,

75
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,270
I got buy, you know, I got
it by the advanced age shit,

76
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,130
you know the same stuff.

77
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:32,450
They're feeding your fucking Nanna and
your granddad or whatever the fuck you

78
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:37,220
know, putting them in a
fucking home. That's the worst.

79
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,690
Okay.

80
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,950
That's the fucking worst,
Matt.

81
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,690
At least according to every fucking movie
or news report you see, it's just like,

82
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,310
this is a wonderful facility.

83
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,240
They're going to be listening to Mitch
Miller the entire time they're here.

84
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,700
All of our facilities are top notch.

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,900
They're going to be getting a
wonderful food there and great care.

86
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,880
You can visit them whenever you want.
Right?

87
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,130
And then the fuck could second
you drive away. You know,

88
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,180
you fucking put a hard hat on your
grandmother and make her start doing some

89
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,010
fucking yard work.
Isn't that how it works?

90
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,090
Trying to steal or pension or is this
just all some Hollywood drama? Shit,

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,370
I dunno.
Like I said,

92
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:17,960
so I'm gonna have to tap out here
and then come back and about, um,

93
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,170
what the fuck is it in like nine minutes.

94
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,730
I want it to go back out to the
fucking world of morning radio.

95
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,580
I literally had one of these
guys this morning clean.

96
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,880
I'll get over there and lay down.
You know what's weird about this dog?

97
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:37,900
The thing won't shit unless I take
it down the street, which is great.

98
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,670
Is that what it is?
You gotta take a shit?

99
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,763
Yeah.

100
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,070
Is that why you staring at me?

101
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:46,010
Is that what you're trying to
communicate right now? Huh?

102
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,270
Like someone who's still sound of mine,
but he's lost the ability to speak.

103
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:51,500
This is like a metallic of video.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,620
[inaudible] stop fucking
looking at me like that.

105
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm going to take you down the street.
All right buddy. I'm going to do it.

106
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,020
Fucking thing is staring
all through my head.

107
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,123
Yeah.

108
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,590
I just left you outside fucking
10 minutes. Why won't you go?

109
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,970
Okay.

110
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,330
All right. This is going to
kill me. Okay. All right. Well,

111
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,950
I'm going to be talking to guys who
not born that my dog's taking a shit.

112
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:20,270
Evidently. Um, so anyways,

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,750
like I've been at least morning
fucking radio guys are hilarious.

114
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:26,250
They literally sit there and they go
like, uh, they'll just be talking to you.

115
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,020
A couple of them, but like the
classic guys like just to clean.

116
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,370
I'll get over there and laid out
going, get over there. Get over there.

117
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,633
All right.

118
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,290
I wish dogs understood.
Just give me five minutes Cleo.

119
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,090
Get the fuck over there.

120
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,763
Lay down.

121
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,690
I actually know what I think it is.

122
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:51,390
I think she wants to get up on the
couch with me. It's just fucking lyrics.

123
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,190
I have a pit bull in the, any sound
of wind. Wind freaks her the fuck out.

124
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,780
A Sasquatch could literally come into
my house and she'd be like, all right,

125
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,130
let's fucking do this.
Okay.

126
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,770
But if she hears a noise and she
can't see where it's coming from,

127
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,290
she just freaks the fuck out right now.
I have the heat on.

128
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,500
I think that's bugging her and then
all of a sudden she becomes like this.

129
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,590
She turns into like a Chihuahua.
You know,

130
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,440
those dogs always look like they're feed
in for something. Like, come on man,

131
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,380
just give me another hit, man. She starts
getting that look. She starts like,

132
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,690
she's not shaking yet.
Thank God. Um, but anyways,

133
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,470
a couple of these morning djs were
the classic, like they just talk,

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,470
they call you up and be like, hey bill,
how you doing? Uh, so and so from K,

135
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:34,380
whatever, blah, blah, blah,
blah. Yeah. So listen,

136
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,290
we're going to be a
talk in here in about a,

137
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,990
about a minute coming out of this
commercial. Is there anything,

138
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:43,680
any subject she want me
to hit on a and thing? Uh,

139
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:47,410
you want me to steer you towards, Hey, you
know, whatever I'm talking about a blah,

140
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:49,590
blah, blah, and he's that guy. All right,

141
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:51,630
we'll be on a right at
the end of this break.

142
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,750
And then all of a sudden it just goes,

143
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,760
it was,

144
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,760
wow how Lou bill bell scale of that.

145
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,400
And also you just like,
dude,

146
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,450
what happened to the guy I
was just fucking talking to

147
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,570
dragged to add is 18 we have a rock.
To Abby,

148
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,380
got some laps coming your way,
coming to the local Yuk Yuk. Fuck,

149
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,490
fuck bill, but have a lab.
Well, what's been on your map?

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,390
Um, I almost said it to
the guy. Be like, dude,

151
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:29,920
what happened to the guy was just
talking to five minutes ago. Um,

152
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,260
other than that,
the rest of them have been fine.

153
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,330
I have no fucking idea what I'm doing
here. But anyways, I'm getting ready to,

154
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm ready to, um, to do this tour here,
going through Canada. And uh, you know,

155
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:43,290
I had those big shows last week,
so I feel like I'm,

156
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,270
I've been doing spots around town.
I'm fucking ready to go.

157
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,070
I'm going to be doing the
treadmill, by the way. My Home Gym,

158
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,230
the gym that I'm going to have at home.
They're a did.

159
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,730
They're doing the floor.
It's a three day process.

160
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,930
Cause I got the fucking, the
autocall days, I got the,

161
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,650
it's called the lava finish or some
shit. I know. Stupid fucking name,

162
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:10,940
but it looks sick, man. It's fucking
a, it's going to look shiny and clean,

163
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,970
exciting and new.
Lift some weights

164
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,700
and become a shredded freckled.
Cons.

165
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,110
He's Bill Burke.

166
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,160
He's tired of looking like
a sack of mash potatoes.

167
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,400
He's going to do some dips,

168
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,650
walk down the street shirtless
and gets sun poisoning. Um, yes.

169
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:38,180
Everything's coming. So today, all the
gym shit is dropping off today, right?

170
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:40,640
Which was so fucking funny
courses today I'm going to leave.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,450
So it's coming ups and they're just
like a, you know, basically, you know,

172
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:48,590
we're going to be there sometime
between 3:00 AM and 12 midnight. Good.

173
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:51,020
Could you just try to be home in course.
I'm not going to be here.

174
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,380
She's now I've got to tell the lovely
Nia and I was just like a sweetie,

175
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:57,240
what did you have planned
tomorrow? She's like, well,

176
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:59,410
I was going to go to the show,
like cancel it.

177
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,440
She got so fucking mad at me
so it can all this stuff to do.

178
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:11,441
It's like it's one fucking day to have
a free gym for the rest of your life.

179
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,890
Okay. You're going to get to go
out there. You're going to listen.

180
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,970
You're going to get to listen to your
music as opposed to the gyms, music.

181
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,040
Now I know that you can put headphones on,

182
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,760
but every has those ear buds and the
fucking Jammin in your ears and you're

183
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:29,630
basically blowing out your ear drums,
giving yourself tinnitus or tetanus.

184
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:33,980
However the fuck you say it. Um,
cause you don't want to listen to, uh,

185
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,280
what's that song they always play.
Ah, we assault assault, right?

186
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,870
It takes me to make a Bingo.
Right.

187
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,280
You know, they play that for some reason
Jim music stopped in the early nineties.

188
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,050
That girl is poison.
They're even play shit like that.

189
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,940
Did they stay place?

190
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,860
I don't want to fall in love.

191
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,720
It sounds like he called.
Is that Banana Rama? Who to,

192
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,380
who the fuck I remember this song.

193
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,590
You start thinking to the
chicky would dating at the time.

194
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,830
You start thinking about all the
fucking, all the time. Oh, who's kidding?

195
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:09,710
Who the chick you wanted to date but
didn't have the balls to see you hooked up

196
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,310
with that fucking monster who is
working in customer service. Right.

197
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,220
It's be a little more accurate here.
Um,

198
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,340
yeah, I don't like, uh, I'm not into
that shit. So anyways, so she has,

199
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,060
the poor thing's got to be home all
day today. You know, with any luck,

200
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,820
it's actually between, like they said,
between 10 30 or 10 and five or some shit.

201
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:35,270
So hopefully I'm really
hoping that it's going to, um,

202
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,370
it's going to come early, you
know what I mean? For the, uh,

203
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:44,060
the amount of pouting that she did about,
you know, you know what's so funny too,

204
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:46,580
is whenever somebody says they can't
do something and they go, why, why,

205
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
what are you doing? And then they tell
you what the donuts, it's like, yeah,

206
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,960
you're not doing shit.
You know,

207
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,970
because you're so focused on
what you want them to do for you.

208
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,050
Yeah.

209
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,490
It's just like, yeah, you know, I, I, I
lost my passport and somebody found this.

210
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,910
I didn't do that tomorrow.

211
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,780
Yeah.

212
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,230
Yeah. I have a dialysis. I don't
know if I told you I have, you know,

213
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,650
double kidney failure, so I have to do
it. If I don't do this, I'm going to die.

214
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,500
You can't put it off the
fucking eight hours for me.

215
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,590
Wait,
come on.

216
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,350
It's kind of going into that mode.
Um,

217
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,810
okay.

218
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,810
But anyways, Jesus Christ, who the fuck?
I don't even want to look the fuck.

219
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,260
Am I Bruins playing next? This funny
when the Bruins are winning or you know,

220
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,210
kind of paying attention,
but whenever they were in trouble,

221
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,500
that's when I fucking sit down and
watch. Cause I'm a real fan. I'm the,

222
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm there for during the bad times.

223
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,090
That's half the reason why I
watched so many games this year.

224
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,390
I was just sitting there going like, well
they got rid of the whole fucking team.

225
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,590
You know, this is going to be a tough
year. So, all right, I'm going to see a,

226
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,990
I don't know, I'm a fucking nerd.
Like I watched, I like watching the,

227
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:51,550
the rebuilding of a team
so you can be there.

228
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,430
I remember when they brought that
guy up, dude, I fucking called it.

229
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,070
How about the fucking filthy flyers?
They all in the capitals.

230
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,960
Hey,
capital fence,

231
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:07,500
you guys finally going to fucking push
through a you east coast San Jose Sharks.

232
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,330
Are you ever going to
make the fucking finals?

233
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:14,130
Can you do that for your God
damn fence? Huh? Um, all right,

234
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:18,960
let's look up the Bruins here. Scores,
news, video stats, standing schedules,

235
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:23,580
players Fucker, the teams teams.
There we go. Oh, by the way,

236
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:27,140
I've been going on at that French
site. I've been figuring shit out. Um,

237
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm sticking to what the dude, I'm
like 33 33 days in here. All right.

238
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,510
Watch episode 12 during
an off day in California.

239
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,500
Well, the hell is this
guy, frank Foote, tran

240
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,330
and the Bruins. Rookies explore La. Oh,

241
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:51,190
rough stretch of the ice improves
with a win over the leafs.

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
Why?
I don't understand.

243
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:56,890
Watching these fucking soap operas
about your God damn teams, you know,

244
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,560
behind enemy lines or whatever
the fuck they were always doing.

245
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,420
What do they do that in the NFL?

246
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,220
Okay.

247
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,310
You know, jock itch. What does
something like unnecessary roughness?

248
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,900
What do they call it?
What does that thing,

249
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,620
that fucking thing they do on
HBO where Rex Ryan's like, Hey,

250
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:15,140
we'll be any fucking team
and he's fucking league.

251
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,880
You know that he gets fired. Ah, fuck.

252
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,160
Our next game is tomorrow night
against the St Louis Blues

253
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,800
and then on Monday we play
the fucking black hawks.

254
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,870
Both of those are away games.

255
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,360
Yeah.

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,900
Then we have the hurricanes.

257
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,400
Then we have the red wings
and then we have Ottawa.

258
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,073
Fuck,

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,770
this is fucking unbelievable. Are We?
We are we going to blow this? Oh wait,

260
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,360
what the fuck was that story about?

261
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,870
Okay,

262
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,020
well got there.
What

263
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,060
we call here,
this is some rookie.

264
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,850
Why can't you fast forward
your way through the, God damn.

265
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,730
I don't want to watch the episode 12 of
rookie sitting on a fucking beach in La

266
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:07,230
talking about hockey. I
don't give a shit. Okay.

267
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,680
I thought they were showing me some new
prospect. That Bruins half God knows.

268
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:15,120
We'll bring them up. We could use
a ninth annual cuts for a cause.

269
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,000
Everybody gets say head shaved
and hopefully at least you know,

270
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,000
half of one half of 1% will actually
go to the fucking, because dude,

271
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:28,130
I'm so down on every goddamn charity now.
Every,

272
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,540
I mean I have to be honest with you.

273
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,700
I've done charities my
entire fucking career,

274
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:36,390
but I have never seen just the
sheer number of cherry. Ah,

275
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:39,930
there it is. High bail you out so
I could walk. All right, I got,

276
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm going to call you back.
Talk to you in a minute.

277
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay.

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,570
All right. I'm back. Just knocked
out another two and I am done.

279
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,060
Probably talk politics
too much on that last one.

280
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,890
Everybody wants to talk politics.

281
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,870
I got to sell you a bill yellow with all
this stuff. Let's go a lot of politics.

282
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:00,920
There's gonna be a great,
it's like, yeah, no,

283
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:04,130
it really isn't this one for some reason

284
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,250
it's depressed the shit out of me.
You know what I mean? Jesus Christ,

285
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,080
eh? It's just, you know, I'll tell you
right now, you can take that Donald Trump.

286
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,530
You can wire them up in a ball.
Okay? You stick and write up.

287
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:22,610
You know who's who ha your roll her down
the street into the fucking garbage bin.

288
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,140
All right? And then you fucking, then
you got to take Bernie Sanders, right?

289
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:30,380
And you've got to give him that gun.
Did fucking

290
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,220
Scarface had at the end
of the fucking movie.

291
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,260
And then you just got to send them in.
You know,

292
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,740
you got to send them into one of
those bank or fucking meetings.

293
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,490
And he just comes in when, if,
if, no, when they're doing the,

294
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,470
the annual international
bankers slash family picnic,

295
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,690
right? So you've got everybody
there, you've got the evil cuts,

296
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,190
and then you have the spawn of the evil
cots and you just got to go with there.

297
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,830
I mean, even then, right?
What are you going to do?

298
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,540
Let's just say we buy into the fairy tale
that everybody was super fucking rich

299
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,010
is fucking evil. And then regular
people were fucking good people,

300
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,550
you know?
Then we'll have their level of power,

301
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,300
then we move up and then we become
them, right? And then you know,

302
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,640
you know what's going to happen.
You're going to be a can have power.

303
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:23,880
You can have influence here
come though whores. Ah, right.

304
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,990
Did come the whores.
It comes to temptation.

305
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,530
There's the pile of gold you supposed
to be watching for everybody else.

306
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,271
You know,

307
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:36,050
you could do the right thing or you could
go out and get yourself your fucking

308
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,880
Bentley Lamborghini.

309
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,640
You could stay with your wife or you
could start bagging a 22 year old Victoria

310
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:46,850
secret model. You know, decisions. Yeah.

311
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:50,070
Becomes tough. You know, and then

312
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,620
it's like an earthquake when
the earth splits, right.

313
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:56,670
And your morals are on one side and
all the horrors and the gold are on the

314
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,520
other and it's very hard. You
know, you got to jump over early,

315
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,540
jump over early, Ra get you, you go,

316
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,930
you go too far down and then it's just,
isn't it? What can you tell? You're just,

317
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,840
you're caught up in it. You
fucking caught up in it, you know?

318
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,710
And that's when I actually
feel lucky to be a balding,

319
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,560
redheaded fuck because it
really keeps me in check.

320
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,070
So sad. Um, anyway, so let me do
a little fucking read here. Um,

321
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,900

balding red headed fuck, you know,

322
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,800
of any influence, you know,
I think it's high time.

323
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,930
A balding redheaded fuck. Got a chance to
drive the bus, Huh? All right, Larry, go.

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,260
Do you know he used to be a wolf and you
had to sleep outside trying to find a

00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,740
spot that didn't have acorns

Um,

367
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,070
I thought it had to go to the
bathroom. It doesn't, cause I actually,

368
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,670
during a radio interview I went outside
and she took a big dump in my backyard

369
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,030
that I now have to go pick up
with a plastic bag because that's,

370
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,850
that's what a man does.
And 20 fucking 16. Right?

371
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,920
So now I realize that she just wants to
come up on the couch. She's all a scared.

372
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,840
All right.
You know what?

373
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,780
I know there's so many fucking dog
lovers out there right now that you know

374
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,660
nothing would make you feel better
than if I fucking brought her up here.

375
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,140
All right, come on. [inaudible].
Come here. Come on buddy. Come here.

All right, good kid. Um,

379
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,960
anyways, yeah. Jesus Christ. I
saw people want to talk about,

380
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,000
they just want to fucking talk
about politics and I go, hey,

381
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:22,160
I don't want to talk politics. I'm
not paying attention. I don't want,

382
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,410
I'm talking about, I don't like, I don't
like any of them. And then everybody just,

383
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,010
I, you know. Yeah, but don't
you take it? Did you take,

384
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,230
it's all really just talking
about Trump and being like,

385
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:35,500
can you fucking believe this guy? He's
still doing it. Nobody Talks Hillary.

386
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:39,580
Nobody talks Bernie Sanders.
Huh? Is he related to the, uh,

387
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:40,690
the chicken guy there?

388
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:41,880
Okay.

389
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,270
He's Kinda got the same hair piece.
Either that or the fucking the oats guy.

390
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:48,480
Right. One of the other is that was
nice to fucking hacky references.

391
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:52,230
Did you enjoy those? No. Jesus,
I got to go to the airport.

392
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,020
I have not even packed and I still
have eight more fucking minutes.

393
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,510
I got a needy pit sitting
in my fucking lap.

394
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,190
I have to some out eat and not
become a fat fuck today. You know,

395
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:05,130
I think I'm going to do, I'm going to
pack a lunch like a goddamn second grader.

396
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,980
I'm going to make a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich with some cheese and

397
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,050
crackers and like an apple and you know,

398
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:15,051
and as much as all these fucking weird
looking shredded 50 year olds that are

399
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:18,060
spray tanned out there and all those
people and they've gotten their first

400
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:22,350
fucking uh, can you tuck the, uh, the
parachute under my Chin behind my years,

401
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:24,540
they've had that fucking procedure,
you know,

402
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,480
so they still have the heart
monitor forehead, you know,

403
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:31,890
with the lines going across it. But then
like they're fucking neck, you know,

404
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,740
they're looking like a WHO's
who is a classic fucking,

405
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,890
she's got a great dad and a Jesus Christ.
I don't know any of the fucking act,

406
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,970
you know, class of the actor
face. You know what I mean?

407
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,520
Joe Jetting out confidently,
you know the jet black fucking hair,

408
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,830
right? He used to dance in
the fountain on friends.

409
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,970
You know, now you're Ron Oj. My wife's
been watching the shit out of that thing.

410
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:59,840
Huh? I can't get into it. You know,

411
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,660
I can't get anyone to it cause I already
know what happens. It's like yes,

412
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,510
spoiler alert, he's,
he's found not guilty.

413
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,790
I watched the first one just cause I want
to see them dramatize whatever he was

414
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,350
doing in the back of the Bronco.

415
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,380
And I can't tell you as
much as the tragedy happens,

416
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:21,380
whenever I see clips of that, it
always makes me think like, dude,

417
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:26,240
I would love a white full size bronco.
That's such a bad ass vehicle.

418
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,240
It's big, it's safe. You know
what's great about those,

419
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:33,020
those full sized Broncos
back in the day was the, uh,

420
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,700
I've talked about this before.
What do you call,

421
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,460
they'll the middle area between the,

422
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,100
the front two bucket bucket
seats are captains chairs,

423
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:42,860
I believe they used to call them.
Um,

424
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,760
what I loved about the console there in
the middle, when you open that thing up,

425
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,100
that was big enough that
if you insulated it,

426
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,480
you could throw ice in there and have
a 12 pack of Budweiser. You know,

427
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,040
they make it so hard to drink
and drive and enjoy yourself.

428
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,380
You know, nowadays back in the day, if
you had a big truck like that, okay,

429
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:04,950
you know your,

430
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,640
your biggest problem was how am I gonna
What Am I going to pee it too while I

431
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:12,930
continue driving down the street,
taking everybody's life into my hands.

432
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,390
You know,
I shouldn't even say that.

433
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,580
A friend of mine got fucking hit
by a drunk driver. You and I do.

434
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:21,540
And like fucking 90 her damn car looked
like it was torn in half and I got to

435
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,150
tell you the way they make these
fucking cars nowadays, it's amazing.

436
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,950
Oh by the way. So I find more information
on the 27 Lincoln Continental.

437
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:33,780
Evidently it's going to start at like
like 45 grand or something like that.

438
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,100
They're trying to take out the Mercedes
Benz e class and rather than going

439
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:42,300
performance and that they're trying to
go elegance. Like we're a little more,

440
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,171
you know,

441
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:47,670
you're riding on a cloud over here
as opposed to though I have a fucking

442
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:52,520
Mercedes Benz. I don't know if
that's the right way to go. But, um,

443
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,990
I also talked to the guy who,

444
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,850
who rebuilt my truck, um,
and I, I called them up.

445
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,130
I said, hey, this is the prototype,

446
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
the concept card has the suicide
doors. He goes, oh my God,

447
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,930
that looks fucking sick and all
that type of shit. And I go,

448
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:13,000
they're not making them that
way. He goes, I was like,

449
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:15,430
can you do if I buy this
car and I ship it to you,

450
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:19,030
can you fucking put suicide doors
in it? He goes, I got it. You know,

451
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:23,800
he had to look it up. He said, basically,
you're making the car a lot more unsafe.

452
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:27,040
You're weakening the overall frame.
When you take out that middle piece,

453
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,730
that's between the front and the
second, uh, in the back door,

454
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,720
the be frame, fucking post,
whatever the fuck he called it.

455
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,590
Um, and I'm thinking like, you know
what? I haven't been in an accident.

456
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,660
Okay.

457
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,810
You know, I drive like a fucking
old man. I can take out the middle,

458
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,080
the be beam, post fucking thing,
whatever the fuck you call it. Right.

459
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,620
You know, I feel like it's like, you
know when you have to get a permit,

460
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,400
like you can knock down a wall yourself
in your house and interior wall as long

461
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,870
as it's not a load bearing wall.

462
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:01,500
I feel like that's what I would
be knocking out on my continental.

463
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:06,270
So then I would have like the suicide
doors led lights and things would look

464
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:10,350
fucking sick and then I would like rear
end a smartcar and I'd go through the

465
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:11,220
fucking windshield

466
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,670
or I'd just go into a spin and I'd
be objected out. Those two food,

467
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,870
those two like cool
doors. So, um, I dunno,

468
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,980
you would think this day and age if they,
if they want it to,

469
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:30,600
is that way suicide doors went away
where they considered not safe.

470
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I learned that doing the
Seinfeld comedians in cars
where I asked him two times,

471
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:41,040
like an idiot, I go, why can't they make
cars that look cool like this anymore?

472
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,520
And he basically answered saying,
because of the,

473
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,660
the safety regulations are so strict
that they're basically basically creating

474
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:52,680
in such a small space, all of them, um,

475
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,900
that they're all going
to kind of look the same.

476
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,860
And then we saw another car
and I said, look at that
thing. I mean, I was like, why?

477
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:03,600
Why can't they, why can't they make cars
like that anymore? And Jerry just went,

478
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,030
I already answered that question.
It felt like such a fucking dope.

479
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,750
Um, anyways, so, you know,

480
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:16,320
it's funny as I just talked to some people
on the radio in Saint Louis and I was

481
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,154
telling him how,

482
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,210
how much I was not looking forward to
watching my team having to try to get a

483
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:25,590
point or two off of them that's coming
up Friday. And uh, they were like, well,

484
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:27,540
you know,
who knows,

485
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,820
maybe when you come out here and
Saint Louis will be in the playoff,

486
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,890
she can go to a game.
And I was like,

487
00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:36,030
that was the one happy hockey
thought I've had in the last,

488
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,110
I'm not going to lie to you like I was,

489
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:40,140
I've been so busy that I didn't even
notice like the first three games that we

490
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:44,310
lost. Um, and also like I wasn't,

491
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:45,870
I'm not one of those guys
that looks at the standings.

492
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:49,200
I just knew we were three seats. I'm
like, all right, so we're in, I'll watch,

493
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,510
you know, as many games as they
can towards the end of the season.

494
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:54,570
And I'll enjoy is the first one in the
playoffs. I'm going to be sitting there,

495
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:59,160
right. My Budweiser, my little shorty
there a little fucking thing at Jamison.

496
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,090
I have one of those a period. Right? So by
the end of it, I'm either like, you know,

497
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,450
happy that we won or I just
passed out drunk. You know,

498
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,700
if we start to lose the game,
then I do two,

499
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,240
two Budweisers and to James since
in the third period, then you just,

500
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:15,510
you fall asleep and the next day you wake
up and you're still fucking hung over.

501
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,950
You don't give a shit that you lost.

502
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:20,130
You just trying to get yourself
physically back to where you need to be.

503
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,140
That's how I do it. That's the way an
alcoholic doesn't. I don't do that. Okay.

504
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,340
You fucking literal cuts. Why
would somebody do something
like that? So anyways,

505
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:33,450
I am going to be in wins tomorrow night.
Oh,

506
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:35,970
let me read the dates to wrap
up the podcast here. Well,

507
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:39,890
the first half of it before we then
listen to some Andrew assembled demo,

508
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:44,580
this mood music, and then we move
into some of the classic stuff, um,

509
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,030
from back in the day from podcasting.

510
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,330
Okay.

511
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,980
Back in yesteryear.
All right,

512
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:53,920
so I'm going to be at
the coliseum at Caesars.

513
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,110
Doesn't that sound impressive?
It's probably a 40 seat room. Um,

514
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,470
I'm going to be there tomorrow night,
April 1st.

515
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,980
April fool's April 2nd.

516
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,480
I'm going to be at the
Casino Roma in Rama, Ontario,

517
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,710
wherever the fuck that is.

518
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,420
Then I'm going to be at TD place
stadium in Ottawa, Ontario.

519
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,550
And then I'm doing the lol festival
in Sud, the Sudbury Arena Ontario,

520
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:26,200
which is actually a, uh, it's
a minor league hockey arena.

521
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,210
The way they, you know, they set it up
so you can still do standup in that too.

522
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm not like fucking center
rice. It's not get crazier. Huh.

523
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,680
And then later on this month,
the 22nd, 23rd and 24th of April,

524
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm going to be doing a run
St Louis, Missouri, Kansas
City, Missouri in Ames, Iowa.

525
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,170
I have not been to Iowa since I did the
rich bitch tour with Charlie Murphy and

526
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,000
Darnell Rawlings way back in the day.

527
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,800
And I believe we did one of the penguins
comedy clubs and that's the last time I

528
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:56,340
was there.
I am so excited to go to Iowa in April.

529
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,360
I've never,

530
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,350
the only time I've ever been to Iowa has
always been the dead of fucking winter

531
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,730
and all the crops are cut down and it's
like you're walking on the surface of

532
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,700
the moon,
it's overcast and all of that.

533
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,590
And I told you for the
longest time I was like,

534
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:15,430
how did slip not come from out
here? Like my idea, I should say,

535
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:18,460
of what Iowa was, you
know, just, you know.

536
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:19,650
Okay.

537
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,020
Beautiful Pony tailed girls
running through fucking yeah.

538
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,993
Uh,

539
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,570
fucking stalks of corn. You know, if their
flannel shirts tied off going, hey, oh,

540
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,290
you know, I'm just the girl next door,
except he's, they got a southern accent,

541
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,870
you know, apple pies in the window.
Like that's what I pictured.

542
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,360
And then you get there and you're like,
oh my God.

543
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:39,880
Okay,

544
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,560
this is what Armageddon looks like.

545
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,460
Going to fucking Iowa in the
middle of January and February.

546
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,530
I'm telling you, you've
never seen anything like it.
All the crops are cut down.

547
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:55,030
The gray sky meets the barren
earth and you're like, I get it.

548
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,310
I get slipknot,
I get meth.

549
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:58,620
Okay,

550
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,220
I understand madness. I get
this. This is fucking insane.

551
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,280
So I'm so excited to go there and
actually see it when it's lush.

552
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,330
And I watched like, wow, these people
feed the country. I want to see that.

553
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,330
All right. So anyways, looking
forward to that. Um, anyways,

554
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:17,130
so that is the podcast. Can I say
anyways, one more fucking time?

555
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,210
That is the podcast. Uh,
thank you guys for listening.

556
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,430
Have a wonderful weekend. You conch and
I will talk to you on Monday and um,

557
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,990
thank you to everybody that's going to
come out to the shows here in Canada.

558
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,230
Okay. All right. I'll see.

559
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,590
[inaudible]

560
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,500
who's that big going on in Minnesota
with that weird last name that has like

561
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,510
three letter bs and an end in it or some
shit. I don't fucking know. Anyways,

562
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,780
let's plow ahead with the podcast. This
is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

563
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:40,760
March 1st the antipasto and um,
yeah,

564
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:44,930
I had a hell of a fucking weekend
out there in Houston, Texas.

565
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:48,050
I want to thank everybody who
came out to the Improv and um,

566
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,160
I had great shows Friday night that led
into Saturday night and Saturday night.

567
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:56,750
I think I might've had two of the best
shows I've had in recent memory. Um,

568
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,690
they were just, uh,
everything sort of clicked.

569
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,730
I kind of sitting in
this restaurant, um, Eh,

570
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,970
this is, this is how
clean living I am. Okay.

571
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:12,490
It's right before 7:00 AM I having
a salad with fucking, uh, uh,

572
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,300
chicken breast in it, right.
I got my laptop, I'm typing
out this fucking script,

573
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,590
finishing it up, drinking a glass of
water, getting the shit out of the way.

574
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,500
And I just remember like,
just having this feeling like this,

575
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:28,040
this is what Tony Robbins does.
You know,

576
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,500
that's how he has that fucking psycho.

577
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,600
Terminally happy fucking smile
on his face, you know? And um,

578
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,380
I don't know. I realized some shit in
that moment. I brought it to stage.

579
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:43,070
I started riffing though fucking
thing worked and I recorded it. But

580
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,840
beautiful thing about the universities,
when you hit something great happens,

581
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,300
something else has to balance it out.

582
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:55,040
Like I skipped to see Peyton manning fuck
up the Superbowl and thus make me feel

583
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,350
vindicated.
And then two weeks later,

584
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,310
a crushing fucking overtime loss.
It wasn't crushing cause they used,

585
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:05,120
they used to beat us by fucking, these
will be just like seven to one. All right,

586
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:08,080
you got to admit, okay, you Canada fucks.

587
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,540
Remember that back in the day it was a
joke. Our hockey was a joke. First of all,

588
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,640
90% of the people in the
league were all from Canada.

589
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:17,240
Granted they were only six
fucking teams, but still, um,

590
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,530
and you guys used to crush us and now
we're breathing down your neck and you

591
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,840
better enjoy that gold medal because I
got a feeling that's the last one you're

592
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:27,410
going to be fucking having for
awhile. How do you like that? Huh? Ah,

593
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,270
you wait till fucking next year buddy.
Now can you guys handle that shit talking?

594
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,040
All right. Anyways, so twice this,

595
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,230
I had incidents with people in the crowd.
Um,

596
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,900
and both of them were women and a,

597
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:47,820
I'm the first to tell you that I do have
fucking issues with women, but the, uh,

598
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:52,320
the first night, um, I was on stage
and there was this woman right down,

599
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,860
I don't know if it's stage left to
stage right from where I'm fucking added

600
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:58,110
stage left.
All right?

601
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,930
So I think that's the proper terminology.

602
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,930
Why the fuck do you guys need
to know stage left stage, right?

603
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:08,190
You're in the crowd. You
know, I go down to Mitis.

604
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,830
Do I need to know what fucking wrench
they're going to use? I don't need, okay,

605
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:14,970
so stage left or right. I'm looking down
and uh, this fucking girl is, she's,

606
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,980
you know, she's talking, continue on with
my jokes. It look down, she still talking.

607
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,430
So finally I say, hey, it is sweet tits.

608
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,780
Why don't you, uh, what's the
problem? What are you talking about?

609
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:31,200
And then she does the usual,
you know,

610
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,560
I wouldn't say she was attractive
if she was in from a small town,

611
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:38,970
she be a Hottie, you know, just
out of percentages. But, um,

612
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,130
so she did the usual
like, what, what I have a,

613
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:45,360
I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
You know, 10 minutes later I looked back,

614
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:47,970
she's still fucking talking,
gets a little more heated.

615
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,200
I basically went to her table about six
times until I finally told her to shut

616
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:54,450
the fuck up and then a,

617
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,430
and aren't really even fucking
remember that all of a sudden,

618
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,121
next thing you know,

619
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:00,600
she's hammered and she's getting kicked
out when I got like five minutes left in

620
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:04,680
my show. So she threatened to sue the
place and all this type of shit. Now,

621
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,830
usually that's the end of the night.
You know,

622
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,820
the whole crowd is fucking clapping as
she's leaving because she's been fucking

623
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:15,840
annoying. Everybody around
them who paid to see the show.

624
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,240
All right. So, uh, usually that's the end
of it. But you know what this psycho did.

625
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:26,270
She actually sent a letter to the Improv
and she tried to pretend that that she

626
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:29,071
wasn't herself.

627
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:33,330
She tried to pretend that she was an
impartial member of the audience who

628
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:37,710
completely agreed with her and thought
that I was a fucking idiot. So, uh,

629
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,400
I want to read you a little bit
of this fucking letter here. Um,

630
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,870
to whom it may concern,

631
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,230
I attended bill burrs first
show on Friday the 26th,

632
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,050
and was utterly appalled by his
performance. I love comedy. Oh,

633
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:55,620
this is what you always have
to do whenever you bitch. Um,

634
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,180
and you're not there in person,

635
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,700
so they can't see what a
radiant human being you are.

636
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,070
You have to then after
you state your bitch,

637
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,760
you then have to fucking show how easy
going you are as a human being. So anyway,

638
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:10,620
she saw my show. She was utterly appalled
by by my performance, and then she goes,

639
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,280
I love comedy and I certainly
expect there to be rudeness,

640
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,580
crudity and what can be offensive topics.

641
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,980
That's what comedy is all about. It
makes it fun. That being said, okay,

642
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:26,850
now she's established how fucking cool
and laid back she is back to trash and

643
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,910
old fucking howdy duty. Here
she goes. That being said,

644
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:34,410
Bill Bird took it way too far and he was
quite unprofessional to say the least.

645
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,840
While there was indeed quite
a lot to laugh at. Yeah,

646
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,720
that was the part where you were sober.
You're fucking lightweight.

647
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,800
That was the beginning of the show
when you weren't fucking on your ninth

648
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:49,640
fucking drink and you were actually
paying attention to the show. So yeah,

649
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:54,050
initially there was indeed quite a lot
to laugh at us like as a person is trying

650
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:57,980
to write as if it's medieval times and
I should be like fucking holding this

651
00:38:57,981 --> 00:39:01,490
thing like a goddamn scroll. I know that
isn't medieval ish, but she's using,

652
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:02,720
she's doing that biblical thing,

653
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,260
which she's using extra fucking words
to try to sound intelligent. Well,

654
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:10,590
initially there was indeed quite a lot
to laugh at instead of being at first he

655
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:13,970
was funny. Um, anyways, the show ended up,

656
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:18,680
the show ended up being a complete
disappointment okay for it. Okay.

657
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:22,190
This is her complaint here for at
least 30 minutes. He blasts for me,

658
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:24,920
God and the name of Jesus Christ.

659
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,270
He outright degraded the
Catholic religion. All right.

660
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,360
Now that's complete bullshit.
I only blasphemy God,

661
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,260
the name of Jesus Christ and the Catholic
religion for about seven minutes.

662
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,190
30 minutes.
What am I fucking George Carlin.

663
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,020
I can't talk about
anything but 30 minutes.

664
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,170
Maybe you weren't so fucking
hammered. You dumb cunt. You know,

665
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:48,590
you'd have a better perception of,
of, of how much time had elapsed.

666
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,590
Okay.

667
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,820
Oh Jesus. All right, let's
continue. Although I'll get,

668
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,820
this isn't another thing. Nothing was
she's, she's pulling this move again.

669
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,160
He outright to graded
the Catholic religion,

670
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,330
although I do not belong to this religion.
So now you supposed to be like,

671
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,540
wow,
she's not even part of that religion.

672
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,290
And even she found it offensive.
Have you guys picked up on that?

673
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:15,630
On Youtube at all? Like when
someone wants to trash Obama, um,

674
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,180
they'll say like, Obama is the worst
president ever. And then they'll write,

675
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,960
and I'm a democrat. You don't
like, you can prove it either way.

676
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,200
Just trying to cut people off the
pass before they go, fuck you.

677
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,530
You fuck news watching right
wing, but whatever. You know,

678
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,830
women need to shut the fuck up. And
I'm a girl, that dumb shits. Okay.

679
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:37,770
So evidently she was,
she was offended and she's not even,

680
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,310
she's not even Catholic anyway, she said
it was offensive and what he said, uh,

681
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:47,280
went on and on again while this
type of thing should be except, uh,

682
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,114
expected.

683
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,160
He took it way too far and
there was a young lady who like,

684
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,000
I and my friends was becoming offended.
Yeah,

685
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,320
of course she was because she's you, you
fucking psycho. Can you believe that?

686
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:04,590
She thinks I'm this fucking stupid.
And I know what this point is.

687
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:07,740
Probably not obvious to you guys,
but wait till I finish the rest of this.

688
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:09,840
All right. I'm probably going
to sound like some maniac here,

689
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,640
but I don't give a fuck.
I said,

690
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:15,660
there was a young lady who liked I and
my friends was becoming offended and said

691
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:19,560
a few words. It's said a few
words to someone at our table,

692
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,660
you fucking lying sack
a twat. Anyways, uh,

693
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:28,560
she, she said, uh, when he
rudely addressed her, that's
when I said, Hey lady,

694
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,290
I guess lady his route.
Hey Lady,

695
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,520
could you do me a favor and maybe
look at the show at some point? Um,

696
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,960
he said when he really addressed her,
she told him that she was Catholic.

697
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,800
That never happened.
He had no apologies or considerations.

698
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,510
Just utter disrespect. Okay. First
of all, she never said that out.

699
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,090
She never said she was Catholic.
And if she did, she said,

700
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,250
it's so quietly that I couldn't hear it.

701
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,390
So how the fuck could this random fucking
woman in the crowd here what she said?

702
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,260
Okay.

703
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,220
Oh, this fucking thing. It's gonna make
me mad again. All right, let's continue.

704
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,040
After he finally got off that subject,
his show just got worse.

705
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,960
This is when she's on
about her six strength.

706
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,430
It appeared to my friends and I that he
may have been getting heat from some of

707
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:15,070
the audience and that
he felt uncomfortable.

708
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,450
This may very well be the reason why
he continued to pick on the lady,

709
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:24,500
the lady. This is why I'm
picking on her, not because I,

710
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,050
and as I'm doing my act,
by the way,

711
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:29,440
I keep looking down and she's getting
some sort of Martini thing that looks like

712
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:31,720
there's a beer in it.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

713
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,660
It's one of those chick fucking drinks,
you know?

714
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,990
Like what if we took root bear and
second fucking roofie in it, you know,

715
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:41,350
she was drinking those
things. Okay. And uh,

716
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,850
so now she goes from this
very male, uh, it goes,

717
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,540
this may very well be the reason why he
continued to pick on that lady even at

718
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:52,270
one point telling her to shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

719
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:56,170
I told you to shut the fuck up because
you were talking the entire time.

720
00:42:56,171 --> 00:43:01,060
You twat anyways. A, this is downright
on professional. Who said that?

721
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:04,060
Someone cannot say a few words
to people at their table.

722
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,520
Did you see how obvious this is that
this is this the actual fucking woman who

723
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:12,070
would give a fuck this much that
you would write three pages.

724
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,750
They were quietly speaking and not
making any noise whatsoever. Oh,

725
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:21,280
yet you heard her say that she was
Catholic on the other side of the stage.

726
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,840
There was another table talking quite a
bit more and they were louder due to the

727
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:28,930
drinks yet he did not pick on
them. Do you own it? You fucking

728
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,030
okay.

729
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,260
All right. Let me just fucking
relax. So this is even funny anymore.

730
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:35,750
Like I totally lost it. I've, I've
lost the whole humor and this,

731
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,810
this is fucking making me so mad.
They were more disruptive than anything,

732
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,240
although he of course made jokes about it.
All right.

733
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,880
There was this table next to me.
They were also drinking,

734
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,300
but they were more doing that church thing
where I would say something funny and

735
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:50,510
then there was sorta like
fucking repeating it. So
they were a little bit rowdy,

736
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,710
but they were acceptable.

737
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,490
This woman who was fucking out drinking
every one at the other table had

738
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:59,660
basically essentially her fucking back
to me to the point that if I fucking

739
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:03,230
punched her in the back of the head,
I woulda got two minutes for boarding pat.

740
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:06,860
Possibly a fucking game misconduct.
All right. There's something for you.

741
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:10,760
Olympic hockey, fucking people.
Anyways, let's, let's, let's
continue here. Actually,

742
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:11,720
that would be roughing,
wouldn't it?

743
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,050
Let's say I took the mic stand
and I turned it sideways.

744
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,560
I could across checked her on the
fucking neck. All right, here we go.

745
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,550
Now we are convinced that his wrong
demeanor was due to his discomfort.

746
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:26,510
After realizing that he had offended
some of the audience in order to justify

747
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:29,240
himself and ease any tension
coming from the audience member.

748
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,280
He said something along the lines,
don't listen to me.

749
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm just an idiot up here speaking.
Pray for me please.

750
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,940
That was obviously a demonstration
of his uneasiness that this is,

751
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,990
this is how drunk she was.
What I was doing was I was,

752
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,730
I was telling people in the crowd that
if they were religious that I respected

753
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,140
their religion. All right. I just had,

754
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,970
I just personally don't buy into it.
Okay.

755
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,380
So I'm only stopping right now to
say this because I know some of you,

756
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,710
you get so religious,
you get so into it that you can add,

757
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,920
you get so holy that you
can actually commit murder.

758
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:07,150
Okay.

759
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:10,900
You know, God's usually Angela
tool a row, you know, vengeance.

760
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:15,640
I think that was the line I used. I said,
okay, you shouldn't be getting mad at me.

761
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,040
You should pray for me
to help me see the light.

762
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,880
And everyone got a huge fucking
laugh at it about it. Okay.

763
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:26,500
And this lady is basically us.
I can't wait to email her back.

764
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:29,410
I don't know. I, I've, I've flipped
flopped a hundred times in my head.

765
00:45:29,411 --> 00:45:30,250
What I was going to say.

766
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,810
Okay.

767
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,730
You know, I just can't wait to, uh,

768
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,170
I think I'm just gonna write back
something really quickly. Like, Ruth,

769
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:42,520
you actually pretending to not be the
dumb drunk bitch in the crowd is one of

770
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:44,560
the funniest things I've ever read.
Something to that effect.

771
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:47,440
Basically let her know that I know that
it's her and I'll see you next year.

772
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:51,370
At the Improv. You can't. Um, anyways,
I'm very supplies prize at your,

773
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,190
this is where she tries to,
um,

774
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,080
this is what she tries to
get me banned from the club.

775
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:58,900
I'm very surprised that uh,
your club hosted this comedian.

776
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:00,460
It was a true disappointment.

777
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:03,580
I am embarrassed as I was the
one who suggested the Improv.

778
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,250
When my friends and I were planning
to on seeing a comedy show,

779
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,260
I do hope that you will consider not
having this comedian back as he gives your

780
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,710
club a bad name. If this is a, this
had been my first time to the Improv,

781
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,370
I never would have returned. You might
consider hiring some local talent.

782
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:20,170
There are several good
comedians in the area.

783
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,420
We are good friends with one of them.
If you like his name,

784
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:25,270
I'll be happy to give it a
bit bit, bit, bit. All right.

785
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,030
As for the lady who we picked on,
she and her table,

786
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:30,250
we're unjustifiably asked to leave.

787
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,940
There was no grounds on having them
escorted from the show right in the middle

788
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:35,500
of it.
That's how drunk she was.

789
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:40,120
She got escorted out 50 minutes
into my one hour set and she's like,

790
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:41,890
she was escorted out in the middle of it.

791
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,930
Do you understand how drunk this one was?

792
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,740
I taught for Geez about Jesus for 30
minutes. No actually it was seven minutes.

793
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,840
I was escorted out in the middle.
No,

794
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:53,290
you were actually escorted out 50 minutes
into the show when you were on your

795
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,200
fucking six drink.
You're drunk content.

796
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,840
There were no grounds of on
having them escorted from uh,

797
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,910
from the show right in the middle of it.
Again,

798
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:03,760
they were not being
disruptive at all. This, this,

799
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:07,300
this impartial person just wants to keep
talking about how innocent this fucking

800
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:10,780
lady is that she never met. If it hadn't
been for bill burr picking on them,

801
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,200
no one would even notice them kick
the kid you tell. This is just the,

802
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:18,040
the fucking drunk argument they had and
the crowd and the car on the ride home,

803
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,391
the loud table.

804
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:23,170
And the other side though is the one
that took away attention from his show.

805
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,320
I do understand that it is private
property and that anyone can be asked to

806
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:29,740
leave at any time, but this was wrong
to do. This is a wrong to do it.

807
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,460
I personally believe that she should
receive an apology from the Improv,

808
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,300
but mostly from bill burr. That's
clearly not my call. Just a thought.

809
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:41,210
What a fucking, uh, I don't know.

810
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:43,820
Did I take too long reading that
fucking thing. There you go.

811
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:45,140
You want to be a standup comedian?

812
00:47:45,141 --> 00:47:46,640
That's what the fuck are
you have to deal with?

813
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,030
She's actually like a total
fucking control freak.

814
00:47:50,031 --> 00:47:55,031
And what happened that night was
she completely lost on all levels.

815
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:56,880
Yeah.

816
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,631
You know it's weird.

817
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:01,020
You become like a part time psychologist
as you're breaking down the crowd as a

818
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:05,610
comedian and she sat at the power
position at the table. The table.

819
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:09,510
Is that like a fucking, we'll say like
a 30 degree angle coming in stage left.

820
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:13,350
This is going to get technical, right? You
fucks. Don't, don't, don't leave me here.

821
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,250
She, you know, she didn't sit
at the chair furthest away.

822
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,960
If you sit furthest away,

823
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,590
everybody you're at the table with
has the back of their head to you.

824
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:25,650
So then when you want to fucking
talk it's, it's a difficult time.

825
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,950
What she did was not only did
she sit in the first chair,

826
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,480
she sat on the first chair closest to me,
so the,

827
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,000
so all she had to do was turn around.

828
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,200
She had the whole fucking tables
attention and when she stood up,

829
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,920
when she went to leave her whole table
stood up like a bunch of fucking minions.

830
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,900
You know,
like you remember that dude,

831
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:46,380
he used to carry the fucking umbrella
for puffy. That's how they all got up.

832
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,214
It was pathetic.

833
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:51,660
And people like that surround themselves
with fucking weak people like that

834
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,900
because any normal people, person,
you know, think about that.

835
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,250
All you guys listening to right now,
if your,

836
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,100
if your body was being a drunk fucking
asshole and got booted from the club,

837
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,430
would you get up and leave immediately?

838
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:07,110
Stand up like the fucking general just
got up. I mean, I guess maybe you would,

839
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,190
could you be [inaudible] drunk?

840
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:11,160
Maybe he's going to go fucking walk
out and pee on a cop or something.

841
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:15,480
I guess maybe, I dunno. Anyways,
you know, before I emailed her back,

842
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:17,880
what do you guys think I should write
back and come up with something clever

843
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:20,540
other than calling her a cunt
like I did. I think I'm just, I'm,

844
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,280
I'm going to write back something to the
effect that I realized that it was her

845
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,140
and um, I dunno. I don't fucking know.
Was that just a big waste of time?

846
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:32,010
Should I not have been bothered
with all of that? You know,

847
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,110
I dunno then and I had another
incident with another fucking person.

848
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:42,090
I don't know. I have issues with,
with a beautiful women. I really do.

849
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,730
This is actually a bit I want to
do on stage and I'll just, I'll,

850
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,390
maybe I'll do part of it for you
here at bay. The basic idea, I just,

851
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,600
I don't respect them on a certain level.

852
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,230
I feel like I had to do something.

853
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:56,850
Okay

854
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,290
to achieve in life. All they had to do
was basically they were born beautiful.

855
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,810
This is really not an accomplishment
I guess. You go to the gym,

856
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:07,620
you stay beautiful past a certain age.
It is an accomplishment I guess. But,

857
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:08,454
you know,

858
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,060
yeah,

859
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,610
I dunno. For an order as a guide
to get around beautiful women,

860
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:16,780
you have to accomplish all this shit in
life and all they have to do to get to

861
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:20,920
where the fuck you're at
after accomplishing all this
shit is basically take a

862
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:24,790
shower and feather the hair back like
Farrah Fawcett and they're in the fucking

863
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:28,740
VIP. You know? I also
don't like him because, uh,

864
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,280
I dunno. I Dunno if they're
smart, if they're smart.

865
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:35,220
They're absolutely stunning though.
I have to admit that. But you know,

866
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,130
okay.

867
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,690
If they're, if they're dumb, that's like,

868
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,870
it's like he got a Lamborghini but you
find out it has a four cylinder in it,

869
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,880
or even worse. My fucking hybrid. Did
that make any fucking sense? You know,

870
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,850
they have that one default emotion.
Oh my God.

871
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,810
And they give 58 different reads.
You know,

872
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:56,560
if they see something cute like a
little puppy, they're like, oh, Mike.

873
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,483
Yeah.

874
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,400
You know, if you do something
sweet from, Oh my God,

875
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:03,840
okay,

876
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,540
they, you know, you do something
that they fucking hate. Oh my God,

877
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,350
fucking idiots.
They got three words floating around

878
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,830
there and there were in VIP,
you know,

879
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,710
he

880
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,210
said, uh, was actually saying like,

881
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,210
I was trying to figure out why I was
finding these fucking women so attractive

882
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:02,840
other than the obvious that they were good
looking women. This guy actually said,

883
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:07,280
hey, bill, uh, beside the obvious hot
women vigorously scrubbing the floor,

884
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,730
I really set that up bad.
He's saying,

885
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:15,440
this is why men find women curlers
attractive. I just blew that joke.

886
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:20,420
He said, besides the obvious hot
women vigorously scrubbing the floor,

887
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,830
I have to do you,

888
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,710
are you so deserved a huge laugh on
that and I just fucked you out of it.

889
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,710
I'm sorry about that.
Um, anyways, he says,

890
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:32,090
I figured out why we love watching this
so much. When they released that stone,

891
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:37,430
the way they let it slide it out of their
hand is reminiscent of the way a skill

892
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:42,431
for woman releases your cock after
delivering a massive hand job.

893
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,481
First of all,

894
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:49,481
I hope you're a surfer cause that's the
only reason why to the massive head job,

895
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:55,460
Bruh. I'm fucking massive change up.

896
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:59,060
Or maybe you just have a fucking bit,
oh maybe I'll just, you have a fat cock.

897
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,740
I Dunno. So anyways, she goes, uh,
they don't drop it. Don't push it.

898
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:08,741
Just let it slide out naturally as I go
to sleep with my boxes around my ankles.

899
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,470
Oh, I forgot. That was
creepy. I know, I read it.

900
00:53:12,471 --> 00:53:15,260
I was supposed to just read the beginning
joke cause I thought the joke was

901
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:17,300
fucking great. I forgot the
fucking picture. And his

902
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,760
guys with those fucking insect
looking legs on guy's legs.

903
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:27,761
Look like insects with that fucking
hair all over skinny fucking legs were a

904
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:33,200
mess. Fucking mess. I'm
like praying mantis legs.

905
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,680
Anyways, I'm a long time ago. I talked
about unacceptable. This is when,

906
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:40,160
you know the podcast sucks and I'm just
plowing from fucking topic to topic and

907
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:45,161
there's just no sort of a no
segue other than dead silence.

908
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,890
[inaudible]

909
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,080
in some somebody to do a Bob
Dole impression. Like I had a,

910
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,610
can I tap out at this fucking point
37 minutes in a bad wedding stories.

911
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,240
Um, hey bill, I haven't listened to
your podcast since the beginning.

912
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:34,450
Decided it was about time they emailed
you and told you how much I enjoy it.

913
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,650
Thank you very much. Uh, the, okay,

914
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:42,820
let's get to the, uh, let's
get to the marriage thing.

915
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,300
Um,
okay.

916
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:51,190
I got a marriage story when I was 23.
I was dating a girl and she got pregnant.

917
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,590
Uh, dude. Okay. Uh, so we
decided to get married.

918
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,590
Okay. Stupid. Fucking move number two,

919
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,060
even though a month before this I
was thinking about dumping her ass.

920
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,740
Stupid mistake number three. Actually
that was the smart move. That was,

921
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,680
that was the three card Monte right there.
Don't knock her up.

922
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:16,810
Don't fucking merrier. White. Knock
her up. Mary, her dump her ass.

923
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,100
You know which one had the
marble? You fucked up. All right,

924
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,820
so all the plans are made, our families
meet each other. Okay. Just cause I,

925
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,091
you know,

926
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:28,240
had to do that stupid three card Monte
joke in a desperate attempt to try to be

927
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,940
remotely funny at this point.
You know what it was.

928
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:33,370
I have a blue wind screen this week.
I'm going to blow that. I'm going to,

929
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:37,040
I'm going to blame it on that one. You
know my fucking dog ate the orange one,

930
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:41,380
so I'm going to blame it on the blue
wind screen. Anyway. So basically,

931
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,080
sky's 23 years old.
He knocks up this fucking girl.

932
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:46,170
He decides to get married
even though he just,

933
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,390
he thought about dumping our
a month before. So anyways,

934
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:51,220
so all the plans are made.
Um,

935
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,870
families meet each other, invitations
are sent out, all that bullshit.

936
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,460
So three days before the wedding,

937
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:02,320
I'm watching some stupid movie where
this guy tells his other guy that his dad

938
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:06,070
told him before his wedding,
it's never too late to change your mind,

939
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:11,530
to which his friends says, but
you're not married. And I guess it,

940
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:13,420
there's, that's a lap. So anyways, uh,

941
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:18,370
so taking this as a sign from God that I
just happened to be watching this movie.

942
00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:23,110
I canceled the wedding.
Great. Fucking move.

943
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:28,690
All right. Which suffice to say,
brought a shitstorm into my life.

944
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:33,520
The worst part is that I actually
felt so bad. I marry the chick.

945
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:36,040
Three months later I'll,
dude, you were out.

946
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,770
You were fucking out.
So basically I was a pussy.

947
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,210
Yeah. Yeah. But two, that's a hard than
you were dealing with a lot of shit at 23.

948
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:49,780
Your parents were crying.
She was knocked up. Yeah.

949
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,950
I would say you were pussy. You
gave into peer pressure. Anyways,

950
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:59,080
we were married for seven years with every
year being worse than the year before.

951
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:02,020
So we're divorced,
so we're divorced now.

952
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,260
So I guess I should have gone
with my gut to wrap this up,

953
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,960
I got a little gripe with,
with chicks.

954
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,610
My ex used to ask me when the marriage
was going down, if I could go back,

955
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,180
would I not meet her? Which
I would say, fuck yeah,

956
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,250
I would avoid you like the
plague. Which she would say, uh,

957
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,000
but at which point she would say,
but you wouldn't have our two kids.

958
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:29,650
Don't you love them? And then he
would say, yeah, but then I'd say,

959
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:32,860
but I would never have met you.
So I would have never had the kids.

960
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,590
So in that scenario,
the kids aren't even a thought.

961
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,240
This of course would lead to a
huge fight about my lack of caring,

962
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:45,700
a moral to the story. Don't use logic
when talking to chicks. All right?

963
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,810
That's actually not the moral
to the story. What it is,

964
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:54,520
is you got to think how women think, you
know, which you know, if you're lucky,

965
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,800
at some point when you're 90,
you'll know,

966
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:01,720
you'll understand 10% of what the
fuck is going on in that brain. Um,

967
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,830
basically when she's asking you that,
she was asking that,

968
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,170
I would guess one of two reasons.
One, she was insecure that, you know,

969
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:15,110
you knocked her up and then you married
her and you know that you were Gunna

970
00:58:15,111 --> 00:58:18,910
merrier. Then you broke it off and
then you fucking married her. Uh,

971
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,970
believe it or not, I'm sure that's not
how she dreamed of getting married.

972
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:25,960
She probably dreamed of
meeting her soulmate and they
was so hopelessly in love

973
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:29,710
that everyone in the crowd had tears in
their lives for, they never found a love.

974
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,400
So as great as theirs,

975
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:37,350
she could have been thinking that and
she wanted you to reassure her or she

976
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:42,160
probably was just banging you,
you know,

977
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,920
it didn't want to fucking marry you
and didn't think that you were the one

978
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,251
either.

979
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:50,251
And all of a sudden she got knocked up
and she's probably sitting there looking

980
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:54,190
at the side of your fucking head.
One morning you're eating pancakes,

981
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,750
trying to find where in
the world she loves you.

982
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,800
You know, on what fucking level. You know,

983
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:05,350
just watching your temples going
in and out as you're chewing,

984
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:10,240
just fighting that fucking urge to
slam a toaster over your fucking head.

985
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,620
You know, just wondering how the hell
did I ended up with this fucking guy?

986
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,660
Why did I say Yes to this guy?

987
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,100
Why did I let him fucking drop a fucking
load in me? What is wrong with me?

988
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,580
And just trying to make the fact
that you had these two kids,

989
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:29,560
just a justice enough, you know, that's
what the fuck was probably going on.

990
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,720
But, uh, I dunno, dude,

991
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:35,890
you didn't really talk about how much
of a nightmare the wedding was that that

992
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:39,430
was the meat of the story there.
I think you at the beginning and the end,

993
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:41,710
but what are you thinking is
she's coming down the aisle.

994
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,230
Okay.

995
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,520
What is your family thinking?

996
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:48,030
You're knocked her up and then you
dumped her and yet, and you're like, oh,

997
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:50,580
fuck it. I'll marry, or
anyways, and you're only 23.

998
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,170
They know you don't want to do it.

999
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,300
Okay.

1000
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,490
Those weren't tears of
joy, my friend. You know?

1001
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,460
What are you thinking is you're up there,
you know,

1002
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,320
was your Cumber Bun like wringing wet
with flop sweat as you were standing out?

1003
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:07,310
I can't imagine that.

1004
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,013
Ah,

1005
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,880
has anybody ever just ran out the side
door? Because I can definitely see like,

1006
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:18,070
oh my God, I don't know what to
say. How do I get out of this shit?

1007
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,650
And then just in a
panic when they started,

1008
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:26,080
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

1009
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,350
Eh,
Eh,

1010
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,250
turn around looking, where is she? Oh,

1011
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:34,630
why the fuck didn't I have some wedding
music underneath this would've would've

1012
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:39,400
been hilarious if I fucking prepared.
You know, you're looking for the bitch,

1013
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:40,270
where the fuck is he?

1014
01:00:40,271 --> 01:00:43,660
And then she comes around the corner
and you're trying to make yourself lover

1015
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:48,430
and she comes around the corner and you
just see that fucking face and you see

1016
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:49,630
those eyebrows at,
you know,

1017
01:00:49,631 --> 01:00:54,520
we're going to be touching by the time
she's 40 and you just fucking run out the

1018
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:57,730
side door in those cheap
tuxedo bowling shoes

1019
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,240
and you know what I mean? And you're
in such a fucking panic, you know,

1020
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,410
there's no way

1021
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,790
you're going to be able to get your car
keys out in time, get them into the door,

1022
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,610
open the door,
lock the door and get in there.

1023
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:15,380
And it's like people are
going to be coming out,

1024
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,430
running out of the church like
some fucking Zombie movie is,

1025
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:23,880
you're trying to get your car started.
I made the move there. Is She,

1026
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,170
if anybody does that, don't go
to your car. You keep running.

1027
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,450
Okay.

1028
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,730
Okay.
Most people get married in the suburbs,

1029
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:35,320
so headed head for a wooded
area. All right? Go Online.

1030
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,230
Learn how to turn your fucking
cumber bun and do a tent.

1031
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:43,090
Hang out there for a couple of days.
Let's shit cool off. Grow a beard,

1032
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,650
come back to town, get some provisions.
That point you'll be so fucking filthy.

1033
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,800
You just another homeless guy
wearing a suit. You know what I mean?

1034
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,040
Just let her forget all about you.

1035
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,670
Then maybe they'll think that you're
mentally ill and then uh, you know,

1036
01:01:57,671 --> 01:02:00,400
one day you just show up on your
mother's front steps and she faints.

1037
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,480
Her Dad catches you and punches you in
the face cause he's a former marine.

1038
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,140
You know, haven't we all seen
this movie? I'm trying to say.

1039
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,490
Run out the fucking door.

1040
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:11,200
Okay.

1041
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,920
I run out the fucking door. If you're in
that situation, during that situation.

1042
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,280
All right. Uh, Bill, longtime
listener, first time writer.

1043
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,960
I got a winning story to tell you.
I'm 23 years old now.

1044
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:25,050
The 23 year old I had been,
uh, here's one for Ya. Uh,

1045
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:27,300
don't go to a wedding or
getting married at 23.

1046
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,490
They all seem to have bad stories.
Um,

1047
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:33,360
I've been to a few weddings and let
me start by saying in this story,

1048
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:37,110
it wasn't actually a wedding I witnessed.
It was a wicking,

1049
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:41,670
a Wiccan hand fastening. Okay. Now though,

1050
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,790
for those of you not familiar
with the wicked religion, uh,

1051
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:48,780
I just want to state at this
point, neither am I. Um,

1052
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:54,950
I can't remember if that's the one that
actually has all those pagan symbols

1053
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,571
that,
you know,

1054
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:02,571
the Catholic Church then said that
they were devil signs according to the

1055
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,240
fucking Rosetta Stone or whatever that
fucking movie was. I read the book too.

1056
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,740
What the fuck is the name of that
Davinci Code? Um, whatever it was called,

1057
01:03:10,741 --> 01:03:12,030
a Wiccan hand.
Fascinating.

1058
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:15,720
And I know that because my sister
didn't invite people to our wedding,

1059
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,330
she invited them to her hand.
Fascinating.

1060
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,940
That's why he knew it was a Wiccan hand.
Fascinating.

1061
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,760
And not a wedding because she said,

1062
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:28,110
I'd like to invite you to my
hand fastening Jesus Christ.

1063
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,290
Um, he said, if you're 41,

1064
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:34,320
you still don't know when a hand
fascinating is congratulations. Thank you.

1065
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:38,910
Because I didn't, so anyways, he goes,
I'm 17 at the time, my sister's 23 or 24.

1066
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:42,360
We both still live with our parents
or boyfriend and unemployed,

1067
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:47,040
alcoholic living off money. His
mom left him when she died. Ah,

1068
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,410
there you go ladies.
There you go.

1069
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:54,390
You don't have to settle for less when
this guys like him out there. Um, anyways,

1070
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,960
um,
the fuck am I,

1071
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:03,000
why didn't I make this type bigger? Jesus.
What a flop this podcast is. So anyways,

1072
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,520
so this fucking alcoholic was
over for dinner one night.

1073
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:09,660
He tapped his fork on the glass a few
times to get everyone's attention.

1074
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,880
We were three feet from him
and immediately my stomach
knotted up because I knew

1075
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:18,900
this moron was about to say something
stupid. You got, I got to meet you.

1076
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:22,740
You guys are fucking funny writers,
man. Some really talented people.

1077
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:25,980
Listen to this fucking podcast. You
guys write better than I do. Anyways.

1078
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:30,540
Basically he announced his engagement
to my sister in front of my mom and dad

1079
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,430
pulled out to onyx rings and they put
them on each other's middle fingers.

1080
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,220
You know, I went to the Onyx Strip
club and the Houston last night.

1081
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:42,440
How funny is that? Anyways,
it was dead silent and um,

1082
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:47,130
the look of a repressed horror on
my mom's face was unmistakable.

1083
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,050
It was so awkward.

1084
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:52,740
So I just started clapping going Yay.

1085
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,380
Quietly because nobody else joined in.

1086
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,920
Oh, that's great. Is that
your role in the family?

1087
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:05,280
You're the person who always tries to
make it better. Uh, God bless Ya. Anyways,

1088
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:09,090
it was just dead silence and my sister
and her boyfriend kissing each other like

1089
01:05:09,091 --> 01:05:10,260
everything was fine.

1090
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,690
A few months later I found out they were
financing those rings and going into

1091
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:16,680
payments on them.

1092
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:21,670
Every week my sister's collecting child
support and neither of them have a job

1093
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:25,450
and they are financing onyx hand.
Fascinating rinks.

1094
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,460
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

1095
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:33,010
I can't believe there's more to
this story. All right, here we go.

1096
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:38,020
Fucking knee deep. I got to go the rest of
the way. All right. Anyway, so I finally,

1097
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:38,411
uh,

1098
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:43,300
it finally gets to their hand fastening
day and they're doing the ceremony right

1099
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:47,050
on Newport beach.
It's in the middle of the day on a,

1100
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:51,770
on Sunday in the summer,
they didn't have, oh,

1101
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,230
they didn't reserve a piece of beach or
anything. They just showed up and go, hey,

1102
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:59,200
let's have the wedding here.
Um,

1103
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:03,850
the family we had, ah, fuck, I got
to sit close to the damn screen.

1104
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:07,690
I can't read anymore. The family we have
near the beach mostly all showed up.

1105
01:06:07,691 --> 01:06:10,210
All the people who lived near
the beach mostly showed all, uh,

1106
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,360
there were about 30 or 40 of us.
None of us,

1107
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:17,200
none of us are dressed in beach close.
Half of them are in suits and dresses.

1108
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,840
There are no chairs.
There's not even an altar.

1109
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:23,890
Everybody's just standing around hot and
they can't sit down because there's no

1110
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:26,320
chairs and they don't,
they don't want to ruin their clothes.

1111
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,740
My sister shows up in an all
black gown with the veil.

1112
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:34,330
The boyfriend is wearing like a Tux
with his face painted like one of the

1113
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:39,190
misfits, kind of like a
skeleton face. Jesus Christ.

1114
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,120
It sounds like the episode of the office.
Anyways,

1115
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:45,160
they don't do any
traditional wedding stuff.

1116
01:06:45,161 --> 01:06:49,300
They just go right up front of the crowd
with their Wiccan priest or whatever.

1117
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,120
The wicked priest is basically
just a friend of theirs.

1118
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:56,800
He reads a bunch of a bunch of stuff
from a book in some other language.

1119
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,740
My sister and the boyfriend and
responding in some of their language.

1120
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,660
Nobody has any idea what's going on.

1121
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:06,661
Then all of a sudden the boyfriend pulls
out this crazy looking knife with a

1122
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:12,100
what? A hilt. I don't know what that
is. Uses it to cut my sister's veil.

1123
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:16,330
Then pokes the end of it into
his finger until he's bleeding.

1124
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:21,130
He sticks the knife into the sand and
wraps his bloody hand around my sister's

1125
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:24,730
neck while they kiss the stone.

1126
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:28,840
Hippie priest holds up his book and
said something loud in that different

1127
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:29,674
language.

1128
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:34,720
I assume it was he equivalent equivalent
of I now pronounce you husband and

1129
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:37,060
wife.
I'm sure being comedian.

1130
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:40,480
You've heard the sound of 50
people gasping simultaneously.

1131
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,710
Family members in suits and dresses
are just walking away at this point.

1132
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,720
A lifeguard saw what the boyfriend did
with the knife called the cop and the day

1133
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:53,800
ended prematurely with him getting cuffed
and driven away in a police cruiser.

1134
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,270
Jesus Christ. Anyways, thanks
for the podcast. They really
enjoy it. Jesus Christ.

1135
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:01,540
How about a fucking round of
applause for that story? All right.

1136
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,830
I think I have to read up on
the a Wiccan religion. You know,

1137
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,090
one thing I did like about that,

1138
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:10,630
I did like the fact that they just showed
up and just decided to have a wedding

1139
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:14,260
and they avoided all those other costs.
Um,

1140
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,150
cause wanted to say halfway

1141
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,740
through that like, you
know, they didn't have,

1142
01:08:17,741 --> 01:08:21,520
they didn't reserve that piece of the
beach or anything and I was thinking like,

1143
01:08:21,521 --> 01:08:25,030
well he never had to back in the day,
you know what I mean?

1144
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,610
He just fucking had a wedding.
There was,

1145
01:08:27,611 --> 01:08:30,730
it wasn't like nine zillion fucking
dollars. It didn't matter where you were.

1146
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:35,560
But I guess you have to do that now
because there's nine zillion people.

1147
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:40,240
And a bankers run the fucking world.
Hey, speaking of that, did you get,

1148
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,630
somebody sent me an email the other day,
evidently Europe elected a president.

1149
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:49,390
Do you hear that? Europe elected a
president, not England, not France.

1150
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:53,530
Europe. The entire continent
now has a fucking president,

1151
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,840
has one guy in charge of all of them.

1152
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,090
See that just like those three d
TVs that are only a few months away,

1153
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:05,120
that new world daughter is going to be
available right down at the best coming,

1154
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:10,030
sewed, come and fucking soon. If you go
on to read about the uh, the bailout,

1155
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,360
uh,
rolling stone has a great article and a,

1156
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:17,860
usually I try to stay away from their
politics because there's so brutally to

1157
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:22,060
the left. It's fucking
ridiculous. Um, you know,

1158
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:26,590
they never trashed Democrats or when
they do, it's so like light hand.

1159
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,860
They just doing it just because
they trashed a republican so bad.

1160
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:33,250
They're trying to show that they're fair
and balanced like those other fucking

1161
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:38,200
maniacs. Um, Fox News actually has a
store now when you go through the airport,

1162
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:42,510
which I think is hilarious. They sell
water and that type of shit. So I dunno.

1163
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,870
It's going to be,
this will be one fucking news channel.

1164
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:47,650
This is going to be one president
and one fucking currency of muddy,

1165
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:48,970
and you better do what they say.

1166
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,250
That's going to be the end of it,
my friends.

1167
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:09,243
Okay.

1168
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
[inaudible].
