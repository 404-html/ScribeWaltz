1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:09,420
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. And I am just checking in on you.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,090
Okay. This is a very somber podcast.
I'm fucking you. It's not somber.

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:18,720
I just have to go do a show and I don't
wanna fuck up my voice before I even go

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,280
out there screaming like an idiot.
Um, I am in clear Lake Iowa right now.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm about to do the surf ball room,
the site of the,

7
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:32,720
the final buddy Holly big Bopper,
uh,

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,590
Richie valance shell.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,590
I just landed in the airport that
they took off from there. Uh,

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,010
subsequently died.
I don't know if you heard about that.

11
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,040
They died along with some music I believe.
And um,

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,730
yeah, I told a lot of people that was
flying into there. It was like, dude,

13
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:53,260
what are you Outta your mind?
Well, good luck dude. Good
luck. You know what I mean?

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,450
You, they don't say that when
you fly out of lax. Right.

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,570
Some fucking more on, flew his plane
into a commercial airliner at Elliot,

16
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,260
you know, when the guy
was on finals. So, I mean,

17
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:09,640
I don't understand what the deal is.

18
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:12,250
The reason why they are plane crashes
because they didn't have the technology

19
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:16,570
back then. There was a, they
had ice on the wing. Okay.

20
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:18,430
Not only adding weight to the aircraft,

21
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:21,910
it changes the shape of the fucking wing
so it doesn't produce the lift you need.

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,650
And then you got the big bopper in
there. But he's a big guy, a Da.

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,590
You got yourself a problem. All
right? No, we all know that.

24
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:32,770
I've been off the booze, I've been
losing weight. So I'm flying in,

25
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,671
I'm not flying in,

26
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:37,660
I'm riding in and I'm in a prop
plane coming down from Minneapolis.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,940
And of course, you know, when
you're flying commercial,

28
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:44,680
you look at a prop plane like, dude,
what the fuck? You know? But uh,

29
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:47,950
if you just knew how much
the plane probably costs,
I don't know. Probably too,

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,300
it's probably a $2 million plane.

31
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,120
All right. They can seat 10 people.
Now if you just look at that,

33
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:59,290
like what if I owned that? What
if I own one of those? I have,

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,820
if you had a 10 passenger fucking plane,
you are the shit.

35
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,970
Everybody's like this guy, he's dude,
he's to fucking play. He's got a plane.

36
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:12,280
What does it hold? 10 people get the
fuck out of you. That guy's crushing it.

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,600
But the second you fly
commercial and it's a 10 seater,

38
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,560
everybody gets all fucking freaked out.

39
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,930
Like I'm not getting
in that piece of shit.

40
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,500
The exact same plane that if your buddy
down the street went and bought it, you,

41
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,930
you,
you would think that he hit the lottery.

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,130
Okay.

43
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,580
All right.
A lot less mute moving fucking parts.

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,160
So I get on the thing and I immediately
texted a buddy of mine who's fucking

45
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,180
terrified of flying just
to watch. You know, I was,

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,370
I really wished that he was there,
a buddy of mine outside of comedy.

47
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:46,290
So I'm taking the picture as the lady
who's going to fly it is doing the, uh,

48
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:51,120
the announcements, telling us basically
what not to do. And uh, he goes,

49
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,280
dude, there's no fucking way
I would be on that plane.

50
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,000
And then he saw the woman's face. He
goes, is that the pilot? And I go, yeah.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,290
And he goes, no, no way.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,870
He said,
not for females.

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,360
Fucking unbelievable.
What do you mean not for females?

54
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:15,130
And she doesn't have to bench press it.
It's a fucking machine. Jesus Christ.

55
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,060
And because of guys like you,

56
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,850
she probably went to extra
bullshit to become a pilot.

57
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,610
I think she's going to be fun.
She crushed it. Of course.

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,050
Not for females. Um, I dunno.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
I'm sure some women will
be offended by that,

60
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,250
but it really just had to do with
this person's fear of flying.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,350
You know what I mean? He wants, you
know, he basically wants to pilot that.

62
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:39,820
I don't know what to look like to look
like fucking Lee majors of some shit. Um,

63
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,901
and to be honest with you,

64
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,160
most of them don't because they set up
in an uncomfortable chair their whole

65
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,650
life and they got a quick turn around.

66
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,150
So they run in the eat airport food and
a lot of them, the lot of them look like,

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,470
you know, if they didn't have like
that, uh, it actually, you know what,

68
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,970
if you went to a buffalo wild wings
and you took the average football fan,

69
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,230
you know, draft kings,
fucking Jalapeno poppers,

70
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:10,231
fucking loud moron and you took that
fat fucks Jersey off and you put on a

71
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:14,350
pilot, you put them in a pilot uniform
and he told you flew for America and you'd

72
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,210
believe it.
You know,

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,300
not saying that the average pilot is as
dumb as the average dope that goes to a

74
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,380
fucking sports bar,
myself included.

75
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,630
I'm saying that they have the same
body type. That's all I'm saying.

76
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,130
All right. So anyways, you know, one
thing that was fucked up is that, um,

77
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,880
I guess it's probably a numbers thing.
There was only 10 of us,

78
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,810
including the pilot and it was one
of those flights where, you know,

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,910
they got to like weigh your bags, all of
that shit. They tell you where to sit,

80
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,440
you know,
the whole weight and balance thing.

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,890
And then one of the passengers
gets to sit up in the copilot seat.

82
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,090
And I was just thinking like,

83
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,780
that's the only part about this that I
don't like that there's only one pilot

84
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,400
here. Uh, you know,

85
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:00,130
flying commercial and it should be two
people in case somebody has some sort of

86
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:02,920
cardiac episode or a or whatever.
Right.

87
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,280
That was the only thing I was
concerned about, but it was a course.

88
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:11,200
It was a cloudy day and all that
shit. Um, but, uh, it was incredible.

89
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,220
So anyways,
um,

90
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,110
I think I might do this podcast in
two parts because I'm so excited to be

91
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:20,350
playing this venue here tonight. I'm
here with Dean del Ray were freaking out.

92
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,060
They were going to get to play this
place and it's still the original stage.

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,610
Uh,
most of these places,

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,620
they don't have the original stage
because whoever was legendary who played

95
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,280
there didn't immediately go out,
get on a plane, and then died.

96
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,430
So immediately that place became
like this shrine. So they,

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,260
they've added to the stage, but the
wood flooring is the same. And like,

98
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,030
we're going to stand on
the same fucking word.

99
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:50,650
I don't know if you're into that type
of stuff. Um, I am. So I'm very excited.

100
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,110
I guess everybody's ever played there,
assigned the wall.

101
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,340
I'm going to try and take pictures
that they let us know. So, um,

102
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,630
but either way I'm to come back and,
um,

103
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,000
finish out this podcast after
I do the show. Um, by the way,

104
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,410
um, I hope you guys enjoyed that
live podcast as much as I did. Uh,

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,570
I got a bunch of compliments.
People really liked it.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,370
I definitely want to do
another one. Um, it was weird.

107
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,820
I felt like I was doing standup,

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,710
but I was just sort of sitting
down on the couch and, um,

109
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,060
and I was also like amazed
at what people laugh at.

110
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,860
You know, I had, you know,
I just spent doing it,

111
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,900
talking to myself like
I am right now forever.

112
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,760
I have an idea what you laughing at,

113
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,650
but I had no idea how much you guys
laughed when people wrote in and shit all

114
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,170
over me. Um, when they,

115
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:45,560
when they ask advice and um,

116
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,450
and then the level of crazy shit that I
say on here, just being a fucking moron.

117
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,440
I had no idea that people laughed at
that. I just pictured, I always pictured,

118
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,330
I always picture guys snickering and
then their wives shaking their heads

119
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:03,530
walking out of the room. That's what I
picture when people listen to my podcast.

120
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,840
I didn't realize, you know, we had,
we had a nice mix of people there,

121
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,330
although they, oh my God,
if I have to tell you this,

122
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,140
there was this one group of ladies who
went to the show that were just hell bent

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,790
on, let me know that their friend
didn't laughed once. Right?

124
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,690
Oh, how did I, is a great story. So I'm
standing there and taking pictures, right?

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,380
Fucking, uh, you know,

126
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,340
signing in the posters and all that
shit for everybody who came out to the

127
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:31,790
podcast. I'll be in a great guy. I'm
a made guy and being a great guy,

128
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,320
I could have just done the fucking show
and I could have hidden the green room

129
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:40,610
afterwards being like, I'm
too tired. I don't want to
meet people, blah, blah, blah,

130
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,450
blah, blah, blah.

131
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,800
I don't want to do it because I was in
Reno and that guy reached in for is a

132
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,310
camera that time and the loaded glock
fell on the floor that he said, oh shit.

133
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:53,120
Quickly picked up and ran out
of the fucking place. I did.

134
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,230
I walked out there and I was being
a good guy. Right. So these, uh,

135
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,280
these older ladies, right.
Um, all their meeting,

136
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:06,020
they're probably about a year younger
than me, a year or two younger than me.

137
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,310
You never know. It's very hard to guess
a woman's age or white woman's age,

138
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,410
you know, you can't tell.
You know what I mean?

139
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,790
Because they're not big on using lotion
and FTF a kid like that does something

140
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,760
to you, you know, see, you know,

141
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,520
as a guy it's hard because as
long as we take care of ourselves,

142
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:26,240
we don't have to go through giving birth.
You know what I mean?

143
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,480
Although we do have to live with women,
I made me,

144
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,610
maybe it just all kind of
washes out. I Dunno. Anyways,

145
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,880
I think they will roughly my age.
Um,

146
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,750
and also I wasn't in like a,
I was in Phoenix.

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,020
Uh, Phoenix is a, yeah,

148
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,230
there's enough plastic surgery there that
people give a shit what they look like.

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,690
Some of these cities should
go to like they, you know,

150
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,810
like do you ever like watch old movies
or old TV shows in the 70s and you'll see

151
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,350
somebody or you look at a picture,

152
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,260
what are your favorite actors
when they're 25 it's like, dude,

153
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,760
that guy looks like a 40 year old.

154
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,320
Like what 25 used to look like
compared to the way it does now? Well,

155
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:08,700
when you go to smaller towns, those
people age, the way people use to age,

156
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,840
like Lucille Ball going from
I love Lucy to the Lucy show.

157
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,990
She looked like she did it 40 years later.

158
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,710
She went from having this really nice
voice and be like, Ah, myth demoed a,

159
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,610
I like fucking smoking camel on filters.
Whatever the hell she did.

160
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,793
Um,

161
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,213
I dunno,

162
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,840
but anyways, what the fuck is my point
is that these ladies come walking up.

163
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,970
All right. I could have just said
they were about my age. Right.

164
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:40,800
Which means to fucking old.
So they would just say, hey,

165
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,560
you know, you said in that question
you, you, you know you wanted,

166
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,920
I was saying guys, you need to be
honest. And they was, I think they,

167
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,540
I think what happened was I think that
they didn't like what I said about the

168
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,480
woman that found out she was banging
this guy who had a wife and family.

169
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,230
I don't think that they, I don't think
they'd like the response to that.

170
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:02,730
So they came up cause they seem
like they wanted to make me upset

171
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,780
cause they came up and they will go
like, yeah, just to let you know,

172
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,200
just to let you know, she,
she didn't laugh once.

173
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,230
She didn't laugh once and I
laughed because that's funny,
right. I was just like,

174
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,520
ah, I'm sorry. Right. And she goes, yeah,
I liked you to stand up but that podcast,

175
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,690
live podcast, I don't know about
that. And I went like, oh all right.

176
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,520
And she goes, yeah, cause like I didn't
laugh once and I was like, all right.

177
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,880
And then they were going like,
yeah, and you said to be honest.

178
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,610
And she didn't laugh once. I
was just like, all right, cool.

179
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,520
So I mean, what do you
want me to do? I mean,

180
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:43,540
I had an hour and 20 minutes to make you
laugh. I didn't make you laugh. I mean,

181
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,550
I'm sure as hell not going
to do it standing there.

182
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,080
So I don't know what
they were looking for.

183
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:51,790
And they just kept hammering that
fucking point going, you said,

184
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,910
he said, you want an honest, we're just
being honest. I said, I appreciate it.

185
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,530
It's fine. You know? And then I
finally just said, look ladies,

186
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,220
like everyone else was laughing and
then I kind of made a motion around the

187
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:09,870
woman who wasn't laughing. I was like, I
can survive this. And they all went ooh.

188
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,950
And I was like,
I wasn't shitting on her.

189
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,300
I just always look at it like the
president of the United States. Okay.

190
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,960
Like I went in there,
there was like four or 500 people there.

191
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,570
One person came up and said
that they didn't like it.

192
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,670
So just to make round numbers,

193
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:30,600
we'll say 399 out of
400 people enjoyed it.

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,150
Okay. If a president or a senator
had that level of approval rating,

195
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,280
I mean it would be unheard
of on fucking heard of.

196
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:46,260
So I'm going to walk away
thinking that was a win. And um,

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,730
you know, I dunno, they just, oh,
they just kept coming over and be,

198
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:53,260
she didn't like it.
She did not like it.

199
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,240
And that's the greatest thing you can
ever do when anybody criticized you,

200
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,180
just be like,
hi.

201
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,330
Okay,

202
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,080
no wait. I want you to feel
the weight of me not liking it.

203
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,790
Um, I should have asked,
just giving her a refund.

204
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,930
Why would you pay for the ticket
sweetheart? All right. Tell you what,

205
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:14,710
I'll make a deal.

206
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,120
I will give you that money
back and whatever else it
takes to get these fucking

207
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,610
hands away from me. Good Lord.
I'll, I was trying to think,

208
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,300
what did I say that made
them take it to that level?

209
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:32,640
Because there's no way if they were with
some guys, I would think, all right.

210
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,490
They got dragged to the show and they
were like, who is this fucking animal now?

211
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,850
That's happened to me a million times.
And then I sheepishly apologizing.

212
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:42,900
It's like, sorry, I'm a moron. Um,
but they came there by themselves,

213
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,970
which means they liked me
before they went there.

214
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,340
So either she truly,

215
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:51,640
yeah,

216
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,840
didn't laugh once,

217
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:57,841
truly did not like it because she just
didn't think I was funny or somewhere in

218
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,990
there. I pissed her off. I think
it might've been that, you know,

219
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,560
I'm going to say, uh, it was
either the married woman thing,

220
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,170
the ovarian cancer,

221
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,950
the dead first wives
in the snow and Aspen,

222
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,230
I'm going to say somewhere in there,
she decided that she needed to tell me

223
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,180
that she didn't last once. Didn't
laugh once. I have to do tell you,

224
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,450
it kind of made my fucking night though.
Um,

225
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,010
every once, and I can't say
every once in a while. Well,

226
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,920
it is every once in a while now because
I don't go out there, but man, I, oh, oh,

227
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,830
okay.

228
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,290
Oh God. I had some fucking,
I can't, I'm so old.

229
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,690
I can't even remember the
amount of fucking times.

230
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,810
Especially a lot of women too cause
I went to a bad period but a good,

231
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,883
I dunno,

232
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I'd say like 12 year period out of my
25 just really trash and women and that

233
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:03,160
just really was just my fucking issues.
Um,

234
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,650
I'm trying to think what the fuck.

235
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,320
I didn't vaguely remember
being in North Carolina

236
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,970
and this woman was walking up to the
table and it was fucking hilarious or

237
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,460
boyfriend or husband was like
holding her back. He lived,

238
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:19,970
he was water skiing behind her.
She was drunk or whatever.

239
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:22,700
I can't remember what the fuck she was
saying cause it was such a spectacle

240
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:27,440
watching that guy trying to hold her
back and she was like climbing forward.

241
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,530
Okay.

242
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,970
It, you know what it looked
like. It looked like, you know,

243
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,940
like wartime footage when
they like split up families.

244
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,720
It looked like she was trying to
get back to her child. Like, that's,

245
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,750
that was the level of effort that she
was making just to come up to me to tell

246
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:44,340
me how much of a fucking
moron moron she thought I was.

247
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,170
And, uh, that was a good
night's comedy club.

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,590
I do remember that. I just don't
remember what I said or what she said.

249
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,100
I had that one, this is weird. They're
all coming to their like, faceless,

250
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,110
like they're like, you know,
like when you watch like psycho,

251
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:09,580
when he comes in with the knife and
you can't see his face, spoiler alert,

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,260
he can't see his face. Um, that's what
they kind of looked like to me anyways.

253
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,900
I don't want to dwell on this
shit any longer, but, uh, anyways,

254
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:17,980
if for whatever reason,

255
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,150
if that woman who didn't laugh once
is still listening to this, uh,

256
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,220
I dunno. I Dunno what you want from
me. I would, you know something,

257
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:30,250
I would go to the all things comedy
network. We have plenty of podcast.

258
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:33,130
I'm sure there's something else that
you could find there. By the way,

259
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,420
the podcast network, uh, the all
things comedy podcast network, uh,

260
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,610
the first annual,
um,

261
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,460
podcast festival was a smashing success.

262
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:45,640
We got rave reviews from everybody came
out. I really want to thank everybody.

263
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,910
And then also Ari Shaffir who was just
sort of the mayor of the podcast festival

264
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:55,390
where he got in Thursday, he jumped
on everybody's podcast. He just,

265
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,200
was he just the fucking greatest guy ever.
Um,

266
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,120
so anyways,
with that,

267
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,150
how can I go this far into my podcast
and not mention the first world

268
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:11,560
championship ever by the Houston Astros?
How great is that?

269
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,360
That was such a great thing. That was as
great to see as it was sad for la. Yeah.

270
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,130
I'm telling you, you got to hate that
somebody has to lose a game seven.

271
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:21,964
It's just brutal.

272
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,270
I was actually sitting there thinking how
cool it would be to actually see magic

273
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:29,860
Johnson. He's got an NBA NBA ring
and a world series ring. This eight.

274
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,990
Does anybody a sports nerds?

275
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,380
Anybody know anybody out
there on both of those rinks?

276
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,080
I'm thinking back in the
day, maybe somebody won the
football and the baseball,

277
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:44,500
that was like a big thing for you or two
sport guy in those sports didn't really

278
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:48,790
overlap that you could
possibly win two titles. Um,

279
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,190
but uh, I don't know about a
fucking stomach is growling,

280
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,640
trying to stay in shape, but like a
three more days in this fucking movie.

281
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,310
So you want to fucking days. I actually,
I if she brought in a Caesar Salad,

282
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm going to say that one more
time. A Caesar's salad. Okay.

283
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:12,010
And I always want to do that because I
love when people start yelling at you

284
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:16,330
about the amount of calories and the
dressing and the crew tones and Yada Yada

285
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:21,160
and all of that fucking Shit and how
you might as well have had a steak. Um,

286
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,590
I think all of that is bullshit

287
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,780
cause you still have the lettuce
with all the fucking, you know,

288
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,600
pesticides on it,
you know,

289
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,210
I mean that's a decision
you have to make right now.

290
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,420
Do I want to eat a cow
that ate another cow,

291
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,200
was with hormones in it or do I want to
eat this thing that was sprayed by DDT

292
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,470
or whatever the fuck is in this
shit. Um, the end of the day,

293
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,480
if you're gonna eat bad,
if there's a fucking salad,

294
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,920
I mean I'll go with the,

295
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,680
the cancer has pesticides as probably
worse to eat one of those things.

296
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,460
But I don't want to hear this shit about
the fucking dressing. I didn't want,

297
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,560
I didn't want to fuck, I don't
hear a word about that. Okay.

298
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:08,730
Cause I know I feel after I eat as fucking
Caesar Salad versus how I feel if I

299
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:13,530
eat a steak, you know, with a couple
of sides, the fuck Outta here.

300
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,710
That's it. That is it. I'm fucking
grabbing at my pants. Like Matt Foley

301
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,700
and I, I'm, I have a gut for
like three days after that.

302
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,600
Um, I know it's all fucking
bad for you. It gives a shit.

303
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,910
I just need to hit the elliptical.
Um,

304
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,880
I started my physical
therapy for my rotator cuff,

305
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,640
a injury finally. I don't know why it took
so long. Like how long have I do that?

306
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,040
Goes through these exercise three
times a day. I go, when should, when,

307
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,100
how long should it say skies? When I
was six weeks typical German, Irish,

308
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:50,490
stupid freckled cont I've been dealing
with this for a year and a half.

309
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,580
Like an asshole.
I could've just gone to somebody,

310
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,440
a goddamn physical therapist. This says,
yes, we deal with this all the time.

311
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,670
This is what works.
Do this see in a week.

312
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,870
So I'm very excited. My shoulder
actually feels a little bit better. Um,

313
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,340
although being out in this Iowa,
whether, fortunately I checked, um,

314
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,300
I check the weather before it came
out here, cause I wouldn't, you know,

315
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,360
live in La. You don't think
it's just endless summer out.

316
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,070
They sometimes you forget
what time of year it is.

317
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,550
I actually brought a peacoat out here
and I gotta tell you it's fucking killing

318
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,390
my shoulder to put it on and off.
Um,

319
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,810
had to have dean helped me put my coat
back on after we ate the worst fucking,

320
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,160
the worst fucking meal I've had since I
was with Dean del Rey again when I was

321
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:38,880
in Wyoming and we ate and this little
diner and I think though the short order

322
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:42,210
cook wasn't there that day and I
ordered two eggs over easy. They can't,

323
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,230
they were like clear.

324
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,630
It looked like fucking breast implants
with Yolk in the middle of it. What?

325
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,850
This fucking Guy Brian.
I still ate him cause I was hungry.

326
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,510
I remember the waitress came by, she
was just like, was, was that all right?

327
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,560
But I was just like,
yeah, it's fine. And um,

328
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,210
this time we were walking a,
I can't even tell you

329
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,020
the name of the airline that
we fucking took in here.

330
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:10,930
I don't even know the name of it.
It was,

331
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,960
it was a play on like Air Force One,
like the president.

332
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:21,820
Hang on one second. Let me see if
I can find this shit. Ah, fuck you.

333
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,510
Pod. All right. Hey, we go,

334
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:29,830
here we go. And if the,
what the fuck is it?

335
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,200
What the fuck is my, you don't
want, I didn't want us on the plane.

336
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:39,990
I deleted like a hundred fucking text
messages, you know he had that thing like,

337
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,230
oh my God,
I can't delete it.

338
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,060
If I delete it then I don't have the
thread like you're trying some case.

339
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,170
I just started deleting a of them, you
know, it felt good. All right, here we go.

340
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:54,070
What is the name of this fucking thing?
Air Choice One.

341
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,920
You know, we couldn't even
pre check in for this thing.

342
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:01,260
He had to walk to the gate. We were
in Minneapolis and it was just like,

343
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,690
we just kept walking.

344
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,820
And why don't know why we didn't
take the little monorail thing.

345
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:09,570
We just kept walking and
walking it in like concourse B,

346
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,070
which was like you went down some
stairs and walked underneath the fucking

347
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,320
tarmac or some shit.

348
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,613
Yeah,

349
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,280
take it over to this other side. And
uh, but it was still cool as shit.

350
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,280
And then when we landed in
like the mid city airport,

351
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,940
I think that's what it's called.
I don't know what the fuck it's called,

352
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:32,600
but it was a coolest Shit airport.

353
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,320
You just walk right in to gate agents.

354
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,340
This like 12 chairs down
near the baggage claims.

355
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:45,120
I love little airports. Um, anyway,

356
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:48,740
so we were, we were on our way over
there and I had the worst fucking

357
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,940
food that I've had since when
I was in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

358
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,540
And I know that place is better than what
it was. I just went there on a bad day.

359
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm not shitting on Wyoming. I'm
not shitting on Cheyenne. Alright.

360
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,020
Um, I got the meatloaf
with the mashed potatoes.

361
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,920
All right. And Spinach
and a, and I went here,

362
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,920
we talk about red meat and
starch. Everybody knows it.
Shut the fuck up. All right.

363
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,020
I like potatoes with the meat.
I don't give a shit.

364
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,940
So they put this mushroom gravy on
top of it. I swear to God it tastes,

365
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,833
I don't know,

366
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,580
it tastes like somebody just took
an aerosol can in sprayed it.

367
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,910
It had like a chemical taste to it.
It was so fucking bad. I was like,

368
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:37,140
Dean tastes tastes. It seems
just, you know, just like,
what the fuck? I was like,

369
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:40,770
I know.
Then you know what fixes everything.

370
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,760
What is the duct tape of food?
Huh?

371
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,120
They give you are in construction, right?
If you have a problem Ducky, right?

372
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,070
You take out the duct tape,
you fucking, you know,

373
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:53,670
wrap it around a few times and you're
fine. What is the duck tape of food?

374
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:57,750
Everybody, we all know
it. We all love it. Salt,

375
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,800
salted the shit out of it.
Salt couldn't even help it.

376
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,790
I had to go for ketchup.
I had to put salt and up on this fuck,

377
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,640
I just finally had a tap
out. Um, and I always,

378
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:15,150
whenever the waitress comes over says,
how was the food? Even if it sucks, I say,

379
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:18,120
how are you going? He was, see, she,
I always at, I always say it was good.

380
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,340
It was good. Thank you. Um,

381
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,020
I even said it was good when I had the
breast implant fucking eggs over easy.

382
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:28,290
Right? And this was the
time I was going to be like,

383
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,090
if she asked me how this is,
I'm going to say this is,

384
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm just going to say this tastes
like this is like, I dunno what,

385
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,750
like like homeless, like some
homeless guy soaked his feet in it.

386
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,940
Like I was actually, she's sitting
there waiting for the waitress to come

387
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,970
thinking, how can I accurately
describe how fucking horrific this.

388
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,620
And if you're in Minneapolis
in Minneapolis and you're
going to take air choice

389
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:58,400
one airlines, there's a fucking
restaurant right to the left,

390
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:02,810
right before you go down the escalators
of don't get the meatloaf with the gravy.

391
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,590
All right,
spoiler alert.

392
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,413
Okay.

393
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,200
Oh my God. What was it? Chemical is the
only way to describe it. It wasn't like,

394
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:18,210
what is that ingredient?
You're like truffle oil.

395
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,020
Truffle oil is fucking obnoxious.
It just,

396
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,270
it just overwhelms anything that it's on.
It's never always there.

397
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:29,110
Truffle oil in here. It's how much
truffle oil is in this fucking thing.

398
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,990
It's undeniable. This
taste. I, I, you know,

399
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,990
I wish I could've brought it to one
of those cooking shows. You know,

400
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,030
all those fucking guys would like a,
and when and women,

401
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:42,710
they got like those pallets
go. Okay. Okay. Um, I'm
tasting a little Oregano. Um,

402
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,490
uh,

403
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,490
there's chocolates or like those obnoxious
cigar videos with those Douche bags,

404
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,070
those fucking Douche bags

405
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,160
sit there smoking a cigar. That
is one of the most like, ah,

406
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,940
the morning most ignatia stinks you
will ever see put on a youtube video and

407
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:03,910
watch a guy do a review
of a fucking cigar.

408
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,280
I fucking hate. I hate when they see
there's Cha, I'm tasting chocolate.

409
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,880
It tastes like chocolate in the smoky fat.
Fuck.

410
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,630
What did you just go to friendlies?
You need a Jim Dandy.

411
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:19,660
Who the fuck tastes chocolate?
What do you,

412
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,800
you fucking smoking one of those cigars
that they have dipped in like that

413
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:25,260
sugary shit you've ever had.

414
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,030
Some fucking guy with his sweet
tooth gives you a goddamn cigar.

415
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,390
Okay.

416
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,230
You gotta go like the dentist
the next day. All right.

417
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,260
I gotta I gotta pick this up. I gotta go.
I'm actually a couple of minutes later,

418
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:39,480
I gotta go. Um, when I, when I returned,

419
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,320
I will tell you what it was like to
perform at the legendary surf ballroom for

420
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:47,020
me. It's going to be an hour and a half
for you. It's going to be a mere second

421
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,840
and a bag just like dead,
just like that. Two seconds.

422
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:58,300
So your life a good fucking uh, I
don't know what that was. Three,

423
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:03,130
four hours of my life. I just performed
at the serve ballroom, clear lake,

424
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:07,450
Iowa. Um, unbelievable.

425
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,480
One of the coolest and and also like
a spooky spookiest places I've ever

426
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:14,890
performed at a,

427
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,700
okay,

428
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,240
so here's the deal. You draft
your pull up, it looks like,

429
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:27,270
it looks like it's front of the 1950s
you walk in the exact same door.

430
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:31,330
They all walked in and there
was this little green room area.

431
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,940
It looks like they used to
be a bathroom back there too.

432
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:38,050
They kind of just got rid of that
and they had a couple of sinks,

433
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,060
I guess that they use to some shit.
And everybody's autograph these walls.

434
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:42,950
And I'm sure that that's,

435
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,990
this is like the fifth time they probably
painted over and probably paying over

436
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:49,380
like once every decade.
And they just keep like these big people,

437
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,830
like a Willie Nelson,
Merle haggard,

438
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,810
Waylon Jennings of course. And then
all these other people I saw, you know,

439
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,760
all the guys from like skid row,

440
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,290
bunch of bands that I knew from the
eighties and nineties, early nineties,

441
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,820
that I used to listen to faster
pussycat, all of them. Uh, who else?

442
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,630
Just a whole bunch of people.
So anyways,

443
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,320
you go out there and I'm telling
you, man, it's like this giant,

444
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,030
it looks like it's not a happy days.

445
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,080
And what they did is they had
the original stage and then, uh,

446
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,440
they built out from the original stage.

447
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:32,240
But some woman a number of
years ago actually had photos
from that night and she

448
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:34,970
found them all these years later. So you
can actually tell where the stage was.

449
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:38,360
So I made sure when I was up there and
I walked all the way back to what they

450
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:38,511
have,

451
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:43,511
like the phone where Richie Valens and
buddy Holly made their last phone calls.

452
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:48,950
It's really, I mean it's, it's,
it's, it's this weird thing of like,

453
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,830
like,
uh,

454
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,500
an incredible part of history
and like really morbid.

455
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,463
MMM.

456
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,010
I Dunno. And I'm always interested in that
type of shit. And then it's also weird,

457
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,440
like I went to Elvis's house
and I remember going in there,

458
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I was a young comic and I wanted
to go in and laugh like, yeah,

459
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,440
look at his shag carpet.
What the fuck's up with Elvis?

460
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,320
And it went in there and I actually felt
bad after awhile. I was like, I mean,

461
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:16,830
I mean this guy's house, this is what
this guy used to chill out and shit.

462
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,310
I feel like,

463
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,210
you know,
this is a,

464
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,220
yeah.

465
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,980
You know, and then the end, you're
walking by his grave and shit. It's like,

466
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,140
can we just leave this guy alone already?
Cause they haven't,

467
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:29,050
they made enough fucking money.
And then you go across the street,

468
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:31,850
there's a gift shop. They literally
made a cuckoo clock, you know,

469
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,820
said it looked like his, his
hips will move it and shit. Um,

470
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,620
but the way they did it here, it
was very like respectful, but um,

471
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,290
it's Kinda hard to not feel like a
little bit of a ghoul when you go there.

472
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,730
I'm a little bit of a go. I don't, but
death is, is interesting. You know,

473
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,700
dead rockstars are interesting. They're
all right. And I was interested in,

474
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:55,670
I went and I got to perform
there and stand on the stage.
It was fucking amazing.

475
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,070
And uh, everybody coming out in the
show was fucking crowd was awesome.

476
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:05,780
I'm telling you all you fucking elitist
liberal cons, who live near an ocean,

477
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:10,190
you'd think you're fucking, I dunno
what you really missing out. All right.

478
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,300
And all you redneck fucking,
uh,

479
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,060
my pig one first fucking blue ribbon and
the fucking who gives a shit contest.

480
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,640
You're missing out by not
going out into the coasts.

481
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:23,480
The rights everybody fucking grow up
cause there's fun to be had out there.

482
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:24,314
You know what I mean?

483
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,543
MMM.

484
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,800
You know, it was funny when I was on
the plane ride over, this woman's going,

485
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,490
I was like, she's like, it's one
of the most friendliest places.

486
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:34,250
Everybody waves alone and everybody's
just really friendly out here, you know,

487
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:35,750
of course my head, I'm
thinking, yeah, if you're white,

488
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,190
I'm not seeing

489
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,960
a black guy can't come out here. But if
a certain amount came out here, you know,

490
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,620
and they weren't going to fucking
play for Iowa or Iowa state,

491
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:55,540
that'd be some issues. Um, you know,

492
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,280
it's, I don't know why, but that's the
way the world is. All right, let's, uh,

493
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,750
let's do a little, uh, oh yeah.

494
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:06,340
And then we came back to the hotel and
ran into this fucking guy and he came up

495
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,340
to me, he's going to let
people keep saying that. You
know, I look at, look like it,

496
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:13,480
I above me and he's fucking shit faced.
And I was just like,

497
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,040
I would take that as an insult.
I go,

498
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:19,740
you're a better looking version
of make it just, you know, big,

499
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:23,720
tall drunk guy. He just compliment
just fucking whatever he wants to hear.

500
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,870
Get him the fuck away from me. Right.
But he's still a funny guy and he just,

501
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,110
he was very like a talk
with his hands and shit.

502
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,700
He was just this giant 20
years younger me with hair.

503
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,823
And

504
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,820
I finally just, I couldn't
take it anymore. I finally
just said to him, I said,

505
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:46,740
dude, you're hammered. He goes,
what? I go, you're hammered.
He goes, hammered. I go,

506
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,940
hammered.
Cause I'm sorry.

507
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,680
And he walked away.

508
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,970
Oh, what a great, oh, what
a great bar. It was. Oh,

509
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:03,090
would I have loved to sat down and had
a couple of SAS Barilla's but I didn't.

518
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,360
I got from my dollar shave club razor,

519

that drivers are happy on every trip.

563
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,820
Lyft is the ride sharing company that
believes in treating its people better.

564
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,900
I believe if elected lift believes that
being there was a lot of beliefs here.

565
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,290
Believes in being a ride,
sharing dry, that being a ride,

566
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,770
sharing drivers should be fun.
If you're having a good time.

567
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,820
So are the passengers. Wait, don't
enjoy yourself too much then,

568
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:34,920
but he got my life in your hands.
Okay, now for the jokes, turn around.

569
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,510
Look at the fucking road here.
Lyft was the first to offer in ad.

570
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:42,830
Typically when you drive for Lyft,
you keep 100% of the tips.

571
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,700
Drivers have been paid over $200
million in tips since the feature was

572
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,630
introduced.

573
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,970
Express pay lets drivers get paid almost
instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

574
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:55,280
Lyft has even taken the
guesswork out of pickups.

575
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,900
The new amp device uses color coding
to help pass. Just find the drivers.

576
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:03,590
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week
plus tips one her and more money drive

577
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:07,250
more. It's never been easier to give
yourself a raise. It's a simple formula.

578
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,290
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

579
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:13,610
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft
riders get a perfect five star rating.

580
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Plus people usually to mean
to say that they stunk.

581
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,000
Kind of like how you know I was finally
going to say something about that

582
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:24,410
fucking meatloaf with
the mosquito spray on it.

583
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,570
So joining the ride sharing cups.

584
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,630
So join the ride sharing company that
believes in treating people at treating

585
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:30,464
gets people better.

00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,510

how fucking long can these be?

589
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,340
Even he at least had a little overtures,
some shit in the middle, right?

590
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,520
Or did that begin? I Dunno. Pro Flowers.

591
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,200
Okay.

592
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,320
Do you have any of those people who are,

593
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,390
if you know any of those people
who were obsessed with fall,

594
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:00,630
things like pumpkin spice
lattes and scented candles.

595

Bestselling cinnamon theater.

598
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,610

an anniversary or any fall occasion or
go with one of the classics like 100

606
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:55,250
Just going to pause here cause I don't
think they ever really listened. Uh,

607
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,960
why would you have autumn?
This is off the record here.

608
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,520
If I can just speak off the record here.

609
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,600
Why the fuck would you have
an autumn theme with flowers?

610
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:08,690
That's when everything fucking dies,
right? It doesn't make any fucking sense.

611
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,030
All right?
He likes everybody Hallux.

612
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,050
There are a ton of online mattress
retailers popping up these days.

613
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,370
All with a one size fits all solution
to a better sleep. Well guess what?

614
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,760
One size fits all doesn't fucking work.

615
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,710
All right? I don't give a shit what
those other mattress companies tell you.

616
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:31,040
K He likes Helux. They know what they're
talking about. He likes sleep operas,

617
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,520
something that doesn't
exist anywhere else. Um,

618
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:38,290
mattress personalized to your unique
preferences and sleeping style that won't

619
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,120
set you back.
Thousands of dollars.

620
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,020
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash
burr where your junk fine,

621
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:46,090
which way it swings
when you go to rollover.

622
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,650
And they'll have a little fucking pillow
that sewn into the mattress to catch it.

623
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,840
Sorry.
A mattress.

624
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,890
Personalized your unique preferences and
sleeping style that won't set you back.

625
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:05,000
Thousands of dollars. Go
to a helix, sleep.com/burr.

626
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,890
Take their simple two to three minutes
sleep quiz of somebody had the right that

627
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,220
why don't we do a benefit
for that fucking person?

628
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:14,780
They're always talking about
people that have diseases.

629
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,540
What about the person has to sit down
and come up with a fucking quiz about a

630
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:21,800
mattress? There's one who went to college
for this is why I'm buried in debt.

631
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,510
They'll build a custom met despite people
drink, they build a custom mattress.

632
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:29,450
That will be the best thing
you've ever slept on for couples.

633
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,840
They even personalize
each side of the mattress,

634
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,820
which we all know is the beginning
of the end of the fucking.

635
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,320
I just feel like we're not connecting
everyone from Gq to cosmopolitan to New

636
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,860
York Times. We're all talking about
helix and once you try it out,

637
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:49,330
you'll know why your customer mattress
arrives direct to your door in a week and

638
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:53,410
shipping is completely free. Uh, just make
sure you're home when they deliver it,

639
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:55,870
so someone else's and sleeping on it.
In this fucking economy.

640
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,690
Try it for a hundred nights.
If you don't love it,

641
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:01,840

They'll pick it up,

642
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,240
gross and refund you in full.
A CTA must read.

643
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,200
Oh, let's call to action in the
advertising world. Uh, go to helix,

You can fucking put a piece,

650
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:37,434
a little thing on there.

651
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,960
And then the person with the little blue
shorts shows up and they take it, um,

652
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,620
which you make. Okay. Which you
can use to grow your business.

653
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,120
I can mail any letter,

654
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,860
any package using just to my computer
and my printer and mail them.

655
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,100
And the mail man picks it up.
The mail man picks it up, right?

656
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,810
Mayor Lady shows up in a little fan,

657
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,810
all dainty ride sidesaddle avoid,

00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:05,560
pushing the fucking gas and the brake
with little selfie stick. Sorry,

659
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:06,820
I live in La.
That's how it's done.

660
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:11,050
Avoid the hassle of the post office man
and mail everything from postcards to

661
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:13,570
envelopes to packages,

What was that Jif?

676
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,650
Remember that something, uh, what you,

677
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,350
you know when the woman's sake,
where is this relationship going to?

diddy song. We a go where? No,

679
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:19,560
where we a go.
No Web.

680
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,290
Um, that's it. All right.
I think that's the podcast.

681
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,030
I had such a great time and uh,

682
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:27,610
I came in and got to meet a bunch of
people afterwards. A lot of people,

683
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,200
some people came in from Colorado,
people came in from all around. Um,

684
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,700
just to check out the venue. That's
what I liked about the show tonight.

685
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,980
I had a great time and I also feel there
was a bunch of people that had never

686
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:41,610
been to that venue venue before.
So they got more than a show.

687
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:45,600
They also got to see that part
of rock and roll history. Uh,

688
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,470
I mean in the pictures in there, the
people that have played there, it's,

689
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,510
it's unbelievable. Before,
you know, all of those guys,

690
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,200
Ritchie Valens it, all those guys
play. They're like Duke Ellington.

691
00:41:58,201 --> 00:42:03,000
They have a piano that Duke Ellington
played, like sitting in the fucking lobby.

692
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,213
MMM.

693
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,110
It's incredible. And it's beautiful
out here. And, uh, and that's it.

694
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,790
I feel like I, I brought America
together with this show. You know,

695
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,520
I live out in liberal Hollywood where,
you know,

696
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,660
we believe and we know that we are
better than anybody else in this country

697
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:30,540
because we live near an ocean and we
make movies about social issues to show

698
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:35,800
that we care before returning
back to our gated communities,

699
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,290
you know, and we only wished that the rest
of the country would catch up with us.

700
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,490
I'm fucking with you anyways. That's
it. I'm on my way til two, uh,

701
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,620
Milwaukee,
Wisconsin tomorrow.

702
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,110
MMM.

703
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,580
One of my favorite fucking cities. And uh,
I'll tell you all about that on Monday.

704
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:59,260
And then I'm going up to green bay now.

705
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:03,670
I was supposed to hang around and go to
the bump up Monday night football game.

706
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,710
That's why we booked that one.

707
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,553
MMM.

708
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,480
But UNF, well, actually it's a good
thing. I mean, I got an acting Gig,

709
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:14,320
so I have to leave after the show to
do my last three days on a movie called

710
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:18,310
front runner starring Hugh Jackman.
It's the Gary Hart's Story. Uh,

711
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:21,610
it's directed by Jason Reitman.
I'm already promoting it.

712
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:23,650
They're not even done shooting
and I'm already promoting it.

713
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:27,070
That's how great of employee am a,
it's going to come out next year.

714
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:31,030
I've already seen like the dailies. It
looks, it looks freaking amazing. Um,

715
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:32,780
so I'm not gonna be able to
get to go to the game, but, uh,

716
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,150
Aaron Rodgers has hurt anyways,

717
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:38,200
but I've only been to Lambeau field
and went there a long time ago.

718
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,660
It was actually, you have explained the
skyline cafe in Appleton, Wisconsin and

719
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,920
Green Bay had a preseason game against
the Cleveland browns and Brett Farve was

720
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:53,960
still there.
That's how long ago this was.

721
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:56,930
Brett Farve was still there and
nobody was talking about him retiring.

722
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,900
It was Brett Farve. And, uh,

723
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,680
he played like the first quarter,
maybe into the second quarter.

724
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,130
So I got to see him play a little bit
there. I know it was just pretty seasoned,

725
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:10,310
so I kind of wanted to go back
there for a legit game, but, uh,

726
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:13,070
it didn't work out on this trip,
but, uh, it's already been awesome,

727
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:17,230
so thank you to everybody came up,
enjoy the music. Uh, and with them.

728
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:20,150
List the producer of the Monday
morning podcast and Thursday afternoon,

729
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,530
just portrait Friday.
Many more deposits.

730
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,270
Sometimes I don't want to
say the whole thing. Um,

731
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,470
he's gonna play some music here and
then we'll listen. Do you listen to a,

732
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,060
an old podcasts from a Thursday,

733
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:32,280
from a year gone by or possibly earlier
this year and I'm done talking and go

734
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:36,060
fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend.
You cuts and I'll talk to you on Monday.

735
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,910
His wife, what's her name
there? Heather Mills.

736
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,130
I'll read this real fast as short a wife
to serve Pol Pot or may listen to this

737
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:54,260
or me. Heather Mills said she gave Sir
Paul Mccartney a strict ultimatum as the

738
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:57,650
relationship blossomed. Quit
smoking marijuana. Marijuana.

739
00:45:57,651 --> 00:46:01,150
Excuse me or forget walking
down the aisle. Huh?

740
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,180
I told him I would not get married to
him if he was taking drugs. I hate it.

741
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:08,360
Heather.
37 told London's Observer newspaper.

742
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:13,190
I could not have him lying to our child
about not taking drugs and then going

743
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:16,670
out for a sneaky puff.
He says he had a good incentive,

744
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,750
a good incentive to stop smoking
pot. Her ultimatum. Yeah.

745
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,280
You don't give a bill and I'll fix.
Excuse me yet.

746
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,980
Do you think John Lennon
would have taken that? No.

747
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,000
Balcony? Yeah, with the
one leg. One leg. Yeah.

748
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,940
It's Paul Mccartney.

749
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,950
He obviously didn't sign a prenup
because there's not a way to take that.

750
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,010
She wouldn't even brought it up.
This was before they got married.

751
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,260
She wanted him to stop smoking pot.

752
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,210
There is no way Paul Mccartney should
be taking an ultimatum from anybody.

753
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,990
That's what, one foot, the second wife,

754
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,640
not even at the one he wanted
the one he wanted and Mary died.

755
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:04,270
She's like the standard for
like for fucking decades.

756
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,190
Yeah. Yeah. Somebody
needs to help that guy.

757
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,910
He sat there and let
Linda Sing on those songs.

758
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:16,390
Where she is just making an abortion
of of a classic Beatles songs.

759
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:23,720
Just an open book and I
said live and let live.

760
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:31,630
Oh, he's playing. Hey Jude is,

761
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,810
oh my God.

762
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,380
Ah Dude.

763
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,850
She has such a bad singing voice that
the engineer's finally decided to just

764
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:45,800
isolate her mic and hit record because
you know real audio from a Paul Mccartney

765
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:48,110
concert where she was
singing background vocals.

766
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,110
I guess they turned her down in the mix,
but this guy said this is way too good.

767
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:55,590
I got share this with others. So he a
taped just her microphone. I'm guys,

768
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,020
hey Jude is be in a song.

769
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,990
I'm guessing she was probably kind of
concede to the guy and started actually

770
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:02,960
thinking that she was actually a music
and probably was just like out of the

771
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:07,290
band. Hi Bitch. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm
sure she probably, you know, they,

772
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,400
they knew she stunk and I get
more base and my monitor athletes

773
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,040
Shao
can hear what the fuck fucking playing.

774
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,370
She's the one every time
looking at the south point,

775
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,470
pointing at her ear and putting
our thumb up like more monitor.

776
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,930
I can't hear me louder in the mix.
You are loud.

777
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,190
Air phones that
tone and holds it.

778
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,320
This is the real deal.
Listen to it.

779
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,400
This is actually Linda Mccartney.
You'll think this is a joke. This is so,

780
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,970
this is the real deal.
Listen to this.

781
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,133
Yeah.

782
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,780
Hi Selena.

783
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,200
I'm hitting a leg every time

784
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,163
really bad right here.

785
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,250
What classic classic song.

786
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:52,900
This song is almost sacred.
They broke up.

787
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,450
We should have put it in a shower.

788
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,860
So,
so

789
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,390
what that visitor shower.

790
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,180
We got a square back then

791
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,960
when the saints come marching it.
Hey,

792
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,800
we got bonded. Look and
listen to little rock.

793
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:37,700
Listen to a role isn't to the golden smog.

794
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,490
Wow. Opinion Mirror. Well, grandma

795
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,000
bird
is

796
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,750
wailing his legs, so not a nothing
like bread. We also have a yoga.

797
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:04,400
His legs would be doing like the plaid
button down. I'll go, go, go, go.

798
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,500
She's dog.
He'll

799
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:14,700
Yoko Ono. No, go on.

800
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,250
It wasn't much better.
Do you ever see rock and roll circus?

801
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,110
The documentary is known
as she can't sing. No. I've
never heard any of this shit,

802
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,780
but she's more turned us on to this man.

803
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,680
You had like an all star band on
stage at John Lennon help me out.

804
00:51:28,681 --> 00:51:33,540
And who was on? I'll make Ringo. Ringo
was the king of the all star band. No,

805
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:36,510
but this was nine drummers. Someone's
got to help us out here. No,

806
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,640
this was the finale finale.

807
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:42,060
So it was a John Lennon
I stage with Mick Jagger.

808
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:46,830
Eric Clapton aren't guitar. Jimmy Hendrix
guitars. Yes. Back had to be there. No,

809
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:50,490
that's it right there.
What about the Ho no,

810
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:54,000
that was part of the whole part of the
show. But if this one alley was alive,

811
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,100
this is, this is where they pretty much
like just a, did a lot, wants to rugs,

812
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,320
got together and just jams. But the
final song is what I'm getting at. Yeah.

813
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,350
It was lending on stage with Mick Jagger,
Eric Clapton,

814
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:08,070
our guitar and Hendrick's
guitars and they just,

815
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,300
how can you fuck that?
Fuck that legends.

816
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,540
So listen to Yoko Ono rectus
thing. It was the, uh,

817
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,670
the final song of this rock and roll
circus. That documentary, who has a,

818
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:22,980
Derrick has it. Did you fast forward
a little bit or, okay, listen to this.

819
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,740
So they're just jamming away,
right?

820
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Like hope you guys,
that is a both. The guys

821
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,090
was like,
there's an app on her foot,

822
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,710
like he'll make,
can't make that sound.

823
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,790
Jimi Hendrix still playing like he
wouldn't stop and go, uh, looking at, uh,

824
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,460
did you think of Lennon but your
hundred spaces or something.

825
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,540
But one of them know like slapping should
have just turned around and gone to

826
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:14,520
John. You'll fucking lies.
How old's the floppy mark?

827
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,060
I'm going to whine about it. Hit her
over the head with a guitar. It's awful.

828
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,070
I know I'm not, I'm not available
harder this whole thing, but do,

829
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,980
do know she is school awful man.
Don't drug

830
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,960
program. What is this dog shit, man?

831
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:35,730
I don't know what it's a little known
fact that took Eric Clapton nine years to

832
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:39,210
tell his friend John Lennon that
he was in a disastrous marriage.

833
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,270
Yeah, exactly. Like it sounds like.
I don't know how to bring the head.

834
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,140
I just don't know how to bring it up.

835
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,230
We're doing a little call back though,

836
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,510
walking. Anybody who's helped me
before I got divorced that she stunk

837
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,280
your fucking life.
Miserable human being.

838
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,440
When I used to get together
songs at the local pub,

839
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,650
she sounds like it. This sounds like a
napalm strike on the Holcim in Israel.

840
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,090
That's what it sounds like.
Just screaming Vietnamese children.

841
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:26,280
I taught David, Texas.

842
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,860
Hey
Brad.

843
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,110
Well, Linda Mccartney, what a
page. I'm on tour with an a.

844
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,200
She was walking around
the parking lot one day.

845
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,960
She saw this truck driver had a
McDonald's bag on the floor of his trucks.

846
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,850
Fired his ass on the spot

847
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,940
for eating McDonald's.
Well,

848
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,310
can we can do it, dude. I mean there
was no, no meat whatsoever again.

849
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,260
She walked out there and fucking
started. His door was open. You know,

850
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:58,450
we're all standing there. She like, who's
truck is this that you're fucking gone.

851
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,360
Oh no shit.
Unbelievable a page.

852
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,490
I told you I love you guys are listened
to all every morning out here on tour.

853
00:55:04,491 --> 00:55:07,760
I'm punching out. All right, let's
go to Randy in New York. Red Day. Yo,

854
00:55:07,761 --> 00:55:10,340
what's up guys? Hey, y'all
going a little back before.

855
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:13,480
Do you think Paul Mccartney who is
using a, her leg is a bond at all.

856
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,620
Oh, smoking the other
pos. That's how the star,

857
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,970
that's where the ultimatum was to
stop smoking out of, out of my leg.

858
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:25,450
Mills is telling a beetle pot where me,
how bout uh,

859
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,480
me smoking pot or you give up your ass
outta here and try to find another beetle

860
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,070
who's been lottery. Saint does
one left regarding go you idiot.

861
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:38,020
So it wasn't for drugs.

862
00:55:38,021 --> 00:55:41,500
We wouldn't have had the second half
of the Beatles' sergeant pepper's,

863
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:42,850
all of that. Right. It was drugs.

864
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,720
It was drugs that did that thank God in
earlier a girlfriend and give the same

865
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:49,230
ultimate and we wouldn't have all
that that came out. You wear a hat.

866
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,560
I want to hold your hand. The
Beatles. What you think it would,

867
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,580
they would have been like, like wouldn't
have gone down in history as, yeah,

868
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,790
they would have sounded like the Hanson
brothers had started smoking time to be

869
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:08,290
wasted and put here that those satin
major Rhett fucking outfits on.

870
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,110
So they sang a song called
the yellow submarine.

871
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,840
Pre drugs though, isn't it? No, no, no.

872
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,140
There is a definite line when they
discovered drugs and it is so apparent and

873
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:25,990
now someone is telling Paul
Mccartney to lay off the pot. Yeah,

874
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:26,960
I'd still have a a,

875
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,670
some of this and I'm still one little
puff and all of a sudden a brain cell gets

876
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:34,180
hit and it's a brilliant song
coming out. Remember me? Yeah.

877
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,800
Smoke your pot.
If you're hot.

878
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,630
She's pitching at him. Find
another beetle. Go ahead.
Go ahead. That's amazing.

879
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:48,100
I wonder why he, he is he too pussy to go?
Um, let's, let's, let's, let's be honest.

880
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:51,040
He has see this house you're living in
and that was because I was smoking pot

881
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:55,240
with my pals, smoking pot and doing a lot
more. I would just leave me, I came down,

882
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,680
I would just be, I'll be in the
house and go off and answer.

883
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,860
Let me show you something. Echo.
Echo. Okay. You see that shit.

884
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:06,730
That's the living room.
I will do whatever the fuck I want to do.

885
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,150
I just pointed a leg just,
I'd be like, listen, Ahab,

886
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,190
Ahab, fucking captain Ahab and
given you a lot of money. Look,

887
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,950
I'm just constantly pointed her foot.
Nobody,

888
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:25,610
no one's hot enough to be missing a
limb when I'm, I'm, I can get, I can he,

889
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:30,460
I bet you Paul Mccartney could
get a 21 year old dude that you

890
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:36,190
buy South beach. This isn't even
an issue that you have to say.

891
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:40,960
I bet you he can.
This Paul Mccartney,

892
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,180
the Beatles, this, these,
there's only two left.

893
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,600
They just sit there right when she's,
when she's talking shit to you, you just,

894
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,680
you just shake your head back and
forth like, hmm. And you just look,

895
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,830
keep looking at her until she said so.
And she and you just keep doing this.

896
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:54,760
You'd shake her head and look at it.

897
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:59,290
I didn't look at a foot once
again for Theresa. Just something.

898
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:02,150
She can't sit up.
He's looking to go and

899
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,100
which one is it again in a second.

900
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,640
Then knowing it and then knocking
on the fake one. I'm, hello.

901
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,200
I'm a Beatle. Bitch. Who fills
your closet with left shoes?

902
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:22,420
Paul? My fucking car. Fucking tiny. Maybe

903
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:28,410
that's your last name. Bitch.
How about the, and you know what,

904
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,640
I'm going to give you a new one of those
new wooden leg in a shape of a joint

905
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,080
with a foot in it just

906
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,510
painted ashy like it was fucking

907
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,990
one end. Somebody sucking on it. Paul.

908
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,070
I'm a fucking Cantonese
joint on the side of it.

909
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,150
Let's get a Frankie.

910
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,093
Okay.

911
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,940
Paul made a mistake. Uh, uh,

912
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,670
an album called rubber soul had my nails
be about an album called the rubber sole

913
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,630
and I'll hold your hand.

914
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:24,230
I never thought that in my life
that she loves you. Yay. Yay.

915
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,850
Yay Paul from a in it, but wasn't
that part of their greatness shit.

916
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,200
Hind hindsight looking at where they went.

917
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,890
They came up with that as like they
came out, they were like in sync,

918
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,830
but they rise.
They were the boy band of Liverpool.

919
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:44,120
Bigger than one hit wonders when
that fucking came out though.

920
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:48,890
They were super famous.
They would done.

921
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,990
Yeah. That stuff was, if they didn't,

922
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,320
if they didn't listen to Peter Noone
listened to Peter Noone stuff who didn't

923
00:59:57,261 --> 01:00:01,440
progress on Tuesday. Um, Henry
the eighth and the eighth.

924
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,470
He was. He just dumb. He might've been
addressed as, he's like second verse,

925
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,910
same time and Ray, the
ACI am, it's just like

926
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,860
[inaudible] midnight runners should
have spoken for men to something.

927
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,710
Go.
That guy

928
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:28,820
walking around. One guy's a
thousand of those guys bands, guys,

929
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,300
but they never went on to smoke pot
and taking LSD and sit down with the

930
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:38,990
Maharishi and fucking get hammered
even phone. That shit, man.

931
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:41,750
Of course. Let's go to Paul
Jersey. He's got so much Paul.

932
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:47,450
Hey,
term pregnancy.

933
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,870
Whoa, whoa. Oh Wow.

934
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,370
Wow. Oh my goodness. Look at Eric Smith.

935
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,940
Erin Smith in the 70s completely wasted
that said best fucking music. Best Shit.

936
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,520
Then they get cleaned up and you get love
in an elevator. You got, you got there.

937
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:12,100
Most commercial success though,
after they got off the drugs,

938
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:14,370
let's go to which is weird.
Know Man.

939
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:19,260
Stick with the pro drug fucking slant
or the show that is for the instant

940
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:23,360
feedback bit ruining your dead. What did
I do say ruined your Beth. That's right.

941
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,260
Oh, we don't forget. We
don't forget Tonio and

942
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:37,130
broke my heart. Sicily. He
is the way that you open.

943
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,560
Hey Dro, let's go. You
killed my father drove.

944
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,670
Go. Amen. Two weeks ago,

945
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:51,130
but potter me, but you're
not a beetle. Yeah.

946
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:53,920
So you're not smoking.
Not Anymore.

947
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,103
Sure.

948
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:02,000
There you go. And blow and
blow. We'd rings and a face.

949
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,250
It sounds like he's on part right now.
We're talking a Beatle.

950
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:06,800
He should be able to take her leg off
and beat her over the head with it.

951
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,190
And she should still come back with a
loving smile or turn it into an instrument

952
01:02:10,191 --> 01:02:12,810
like the, yeah, the, the thing
that you do, fucking trombone.

953
01:02:12,811 --> 01:02:14,180
If you had to come home and

954
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:23,040
watch this bitch, I'm a, I'm a car holes
in it. I'm gonna turn this to a big flute.

955
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,390
You're leg is a giant
playing and her leg.

956
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,610
I want you to play your leg.

957
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:33,120
If something smoking to enhance
my high and seeing the back.

958
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,600
I want you sing the chorus, the yellow
submarine base. That's why I smoke weed.

959
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:39,510
All your legs. We, oh, it's so good.

960
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,243
Hello.

961
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,740
Hey,
what's going on?

962
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,760
It's Belper and it's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

963
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:41,780
November 2nd,

964
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,860
2009 can you believe that?
It's November. Oh my God.

965
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:48,740
Where's this year? God, Jesus.

966
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:53,300
Every year it goes by faster.
I know. I always do that joke,

967
01:03:53,301 --> 01:03:57,680
but that's what everybody says.
Can you believe it's November? Yes,

968
01:03:57,681 --> 01:04:01,130
I can. You know what
gave it away? October.

969
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,020
That was the big hint that
fucking November was coming up.

970
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:10,130
You know Halloween. I remember
that. I know that's on the 31st

971
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:14,720
so yes, I can believe and yes,
yes, it does go by quicker.

972
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:18,020
Obviously it goes by quick.
I think about it when you were a child,

973
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,940
you know if you were four years old,
if a year went by,

974
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:26,480
that was 25% of your life. Yes.
So it definitely dragged on.

975
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:31,481
Plus you had two giants telling you what
the fuck to do all day and what to eat

976
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:35,870
right? Well, when you're 41
years old, a year goes by.

977
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:39,350
That's like a, it's kind of math. I
can't do, I don't know what that is.

978
01:04:39,351 --> 01:04:43,820
What does that one, one 80th of
my life. You know, it's funny,

979
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:47,410
it's actually Sunday night right now and
I just settled down to do the podcast.

980
01:04:47,411 --> 01:04:49,460
I had the apartment to
myself and I'm thinking,

981
01:04:49,461 --> 01:04:53,870
all right can bang out a nice hour and
all of a sudden the windows open and I

982
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:56,720
hear somebody driving by
listening to this song.

983
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:01,700
This is how we do it. It's Friday night,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

984
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:05,960
I'm like, who the fuck would
still be listening to that music?

985
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:10,790
And Lo and behold, it's the woman
I share my life with polling in,

986
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,840
listen to a song that
sucked when it came up.

987
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,760
Bullshit you to that station all the time.

988
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,670
All I want to do with chromosomes.
Yeah.

989
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:29,310
See he listened. He listened to all of
that shit. Listen, I'm going to punt.

990
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,160
I'm going to get satellite radio so I
can listen to really bad hair metal and

991
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:34,900
you can know what the
fuck I was listening to.

992
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,370
You know what you smell like right now?

993
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:40,060
You smell like that overpowering air
freshener that you put in the fucking car.

994
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:45,650
I smile. It's something different.
What do you smell like? Huh?

995
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:49,460
It's, it's, I dunno what it smell it get
away from me. I've got to do a podcast.

996
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:53,750
I can't be smelling smells. What
is it? What's the name of it? What?

997
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:58,160
Exotic fragrance and get
away from me. I said, okay,

998
01:05:58,161 --> 01:05:59,120
well then I'm going to stick with that.

999
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:03,050
Then gather your belongings and
get out of the room. So you guys,

1000
01:06:03,051 --> 01:06:05,480
this is how you handle a little more
and they deliberately act moody.

1001
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,500
You just said get away from me and
I'm really, really wet. No, I didn't.

1002
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:10,460
I sit in a comical way.

1003
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:14,430
If I see if I'm holding a microphone
with an orange fucking wind screen,

1004
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,210
you can't take it seriously.
You can not take it seriously.

1005
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,490
It was being an asshole. Yeah, I do. I
get away with it. What I would want to,

1006
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:23,210
because I'm running shit. Get out
woman. Go make me. You see here,

1007
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:27,470
which will make me see
which, oh, beat it. Come on.

1008
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:31,590
I want to talk about Halloween and how
I thought we had the fucking the best

1009
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:35,040
shit on the block.
But yeah,

1010
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:38,400
he's fucking assholes up the street.
All right, let me back up near.

1011
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:40,680
You need to walk so I can tell this story.
All right.

1012
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:44,460
You and your fragrance need to get out
of the room here for a second. Okay.

1013
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,860
She just smelled her rest. And
guys, I like it. I had Jaya as in,

1014
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:03,540
oh, that's how you keep it fresh
people. It's the fights and then the,

1015
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:08,300
the making up and whatnot.
Um, why did I just do that to,

1016
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:10,330
cause I was annoyed.
I thought he had the apartment to myself,

1017
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:14,410
so I just decided to be a Douche. So
there you go. I'm Douche bag of the week.

1018
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:19,120
Um, I pulled it out the
last seconds. Um, anyways,

1019
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,350
so for Halloween,

1020
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,960
and those of you who are longtime
listeners of the podcast know that I, I'm,

1021
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:27,880
I'm kind of into Halloween.
I like it.

1022
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,060
I decided to embrace the
holidays a couple of years ago,

1023
01:07:31,061 --> 01:07:33,760
rather than just being like,
dude, this is fucking bullshit.

1024
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:38,980
It's just to know the core be fucking
strategy. Gimmes Buma fuck Molly. Um,

1025
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:43,540
I find just said, you know what?
Fuck it. So, um, you know, last year,

1026
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:47,410
if you guys are on my myspace page,
so I'm sticking it out there.

1027
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,430
I have pictures of the Pumpkin I carve
last year at carved an ACDC pumpkin.

1028
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:54,580
That was this shit.
Okay.

1029
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,640
It was the shit and this year as
like, how do I top this? And, um,

1030
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:03,700
I was trying to think of the scariest
thing I could think of to carve into a

1031
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:08,410
pumpkin. And I ended up carving
the, uh, the Federal Reserve Bank.

1032
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:15,080
I know I'm going crazy.
I can still smell that fucking fragrance.

1033
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:19,430
It's overpowering, whatever
it is. Oh God. It's awful.

1034
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,880
Jesus smells like flowers and
soap all at the same time.

1035
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,270
You know, one of those things
individually, they're good, you know,

1036
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:33,620
like brushing your teeth and orange
juice, but if you put them together, um,

1037
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:38,150
so anyways, yeah, carved the
Federal Reserve Bank. It's
the fucking shit. All right.

1038
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:41,480
Uh, go on to my myspace page. I've
got a whole picture of it, you know,

1039
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:46,570
and then I fucking made pumpkin bread
afterwards and I fucking toasted the

1040
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:50,180
seeds. I was like a
native American, you know,

1041
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,710
after I killed the Pumpkin,
I used all the parts.

1042
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:59,720
I took out the Pumpkin's Achilles tendons.
I made a fucking jump rope out of it,

1043
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,330
you know,
and I looked out the window,

1044
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:05,420
I saw some trash and I
got a little teary eyed.

1045
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:09,770
And that's what I did that I just used
the crying Indian hacky reference.

1046
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:13,850
That was funny. Way Back on
VH one. Standup spotlight.

1047
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,160
Do you guys ever used to watch that?
And the old people out there,

1048
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:19,880
the standup spotlights when they were
just scraping the bottom of the barrel of

1049
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:21,200
anybody remotely left.

1050
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:26,201
Funny from the 1980s half the people
on there were like substitute teachers.

1051
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:31,220
They had chalk on the back of their
pants come in a little so deal. Ooh,

1052
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,820
fucking a racers and they'd
some hour making money.

1053
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,270
You know, what am I
talking about? So anyway,

1054
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:42,290
so not only do I have the Federal Reserve
pumpkin cause I figured, you know what?

1055
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,700
Anybody can try and scare
the kids. You know who, who,

1056
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,580
whoever tries to scare the parents.
That's what I,

1057
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:51,260
that's why I decided to carve the Federal
Reserve Bank and did it fucking three

1058
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:52,094
d style.

1059
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:56,630
It's the Shit I had flames behind
it actually tried to carve.

1060
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:01,040
We own you in reverse writing.
So it would come up against the wall.

1061
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:05,420
But I failed just because I don't have,
I don't have the tools. All right?

1062
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:08,390
All these assholes who are making
these fucking insane pumpkin's.

1063
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:10,490
Half of these comments,
they just go,

1064
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:12,500
you go on a website and
you just buy something.

1065
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:14,660
You just trace it and
it tells you what to do.

1066
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:17,690
You don't have fucking third
grader could do it, you know?

1067
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:18,501
And then you get all these,

1068
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:22,340
all these little double edged
knives and all his shit. I had a,

1069
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:26,420
I had a fucking paring knife,
the same knife.

1070
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:28,490
I used to cut up an apple.

1071
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,870
I carved in the Federal Reserve Bank.
Okay. And I was going to have, we own you,

1072
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:36,590
but that part fail. But whatever.
So I had that. And then I also had,

1073
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:39,650
I had full size candy bars.
You had your choice.

1074
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,630
If you came to my house on Halloween,

1075
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:46,250
you had your fucking choice
of a Hershey bar without nuts.

1076
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,990
Cause God knows all these fucking pussy
kids are allergic to everything he can't

1077
01:10:50,991 --> 01:10:52,730
have all month.
He has almonds.

1078
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:57,970
It countered back balances his Prozac
and then it's just crazy until Wednesday

1079
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:03,980
really, lady, did you ever think you
should have died and not had a kid?

1080
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,060
Wow. Wow. That was mean. It's not
what I was trying to say, but I was,

1081
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,050
I was trying to, Sam's talking about
natural selection there that uh,

1082
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:16,470
whatever's in you was so fucking weak
that your kid can't even have nuts.

1083
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,030
You know what I mean? I mean, every,

1084
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,310
everybody's allergic to getting fucking
stabbed. But when you're like allergic,

1085
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:28,050
I can't have food. You shouldn't
be alive. All these fucking people,

1086
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:32,820
all these lactose intolerant fucking
people clogging up the highways.

1087
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,070
All of you.
You should not be alive.

1088
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:39,930
You're only alive
because, uh, Jesus Christ,

1089
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:42,480
I already talked myself into a
corner. Why Bill? Why are they alive?

1090
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:47,040
Because of modern medicine. They're just
using you as a fucking revenue stream.

1091
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,400
All right. Who's kidding? Who? I
would've been dead a hundred years ago.

1092
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,400
I would've been,
I had a ruptured appendix in sixth grade.

1093
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:56,490
That would have been if I would've been
on like a little house in the prairie,

1094
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,350
just laying there sweating under fucking
58 blankets in an outhouse is not what

1095
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:04,050
they did with their sick.
You should just stick them under blankets.

1096
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:08,970
Start dabbing at their forehead.
Does this make it better? No,

1097
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:10,080
it doesn't. No, it does.

1098
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:14,520
It's something inside of me exploded
and now the poison is a having a party

1099
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,890
and he should take me out back and
shoot me like old yeller. So anyways,

1100
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:23,880
I got this fucking insane fucking pumpkin.
All right.

1101
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,550
Okay. Anybody can, can, can, can
carve in some shit that doesn't exist.

1102
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,900
That'll scare the fuck out of you.

1103
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,890
This actually exists and is actually was
actually fucking everyone who's walking

1104
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:38,550
up the stairs, all of them. All of
them should have been like, Holy Shit.

1105
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,420
That's it right there. That is the
devil. That is the fucking devil.

1106
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,310
I love that Pumpkin.
It looks great.

1107
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:47,370
It's saying something and it's
scaring the shit out of me.

1108
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:50,850
It's working on all three levels.
It is a fucking triple threat. Like,

1109
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:54,900
like the way people used to be in show
business back in the day where they could

1110
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,880
sing and they could dance
and they could tell jokes.

1111
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,140
That's what that Pumpkin Pumpkin is,
you know, that's the, I, you know,

1112
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,480
whether all that was, is what I was
hoping they would think. But they didn't,

1113
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:07,770
I didn't get one comment. Why did
he carve a building into a pumpkin?

1114
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:12,270
I don't understand. Is that a Walmart?
Oh, make good. Walmart's fucking scary.

1115
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,830
You know,
if somebody came with the stairs,

1116
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:16,590
who fucking actually tried to
start a hardware store anyways,

1117
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,400
so I had fired this fucking
insane pumpkin. All right. Um,

1118
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:23,950
had my fucking door all lit up and all
that type of shit and I got full size

1119
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:28,020
fucking candy bars. Okay. For all these
cute little kids coming up. All right.

1120
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,290
But uh, something, and this is going
to be at, word's going to get out.

1121
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,660
This dude's got a fucking, you know, he,

1122
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:37,380
he carved a library into a pumpkin
and he's got, who gives a fuck?

1123
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,251
The guy's a Weirdo,

1124
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:42,240
but he's got full sized fucker candy bars
and the candy bars that we recognize.

1125
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:46,830
Kit Kat, who? Reese's peanut
butter cups or fucking or Hershey,

1126
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,230
what is it? Not Hershey but Hershey milk
chocolate. Okay. Those were all fucking,

1127
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,710
we know what those are. So even
though he's a Weirdo, it's wrapped.

1128
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,210
We understand that there's no poison it.

1129
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:58,500
So I'm thinking I'm going to be the shit.

1130
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,590
These kids are going to be clamoring
around me like I'm fucking Dick Clark in

1131
01:14:01,591 --> 01:14:03,930
1965. Right. But no,

1132
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,820
I got fucked because the people up the
street, they were, they went all out.

1133
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:14,440
This dude up the street, his
son and daughter, his son,

1134
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,560
fuck head that he is now his son
and his daughter put on a show like,

1135
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:21,520
uh,
like Michael Jackson.

1136
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:25,540
They were doing a tribute to Michael
Jackson and it was fucking insane.

1137
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,110
They had a stage,
they had like monitors.

1138
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,440
It looked like a fucking rock show was
going to happen and they had a show like

1139
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:36,370
every 20 minutes or every half hour
and a whole crowd would gather.

1140
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,300
I didn't even get to see it. I was down
the street with my full size candy bar.

1141
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,980
Am I fucking new world order pumpkin
going? Where is everybody? You know,

1142
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:48,850
I've got a fucking seven 11 here,
sort of. This is my fucking kitchen.

1143
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,360
Looked like literally like I robbed
the seven 11 and rather than taking the

1144
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:55,690
money I took all the candy out of it.
That's what the fuck it looked like.

1145
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,850
I and I can't get a God damn fuck.

1146
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:01,270
I can't get anybody to come because
everybody's running up the street cause

1147
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:03,440
these kids were killing it.
You know,

1148
01:15:03,441 --> 01:15:05,410
Neil went up there with
their mom and they came back.

1149
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,090
Oh my God.
It was awesome.

1150
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:12,450
They even had the car from the fucking
whatever video and he literally got in it,

1151
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,480
Blah Blah Blah.
Right.

1152
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:18,320
Just wanted to fucking slap both of
them. Um, no I didn't. I want to,

1153
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,220
I was fucking pissed.

1154
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,440
I was literally reduced to yelling
off of my balcony going as people were

1155
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:28,180
walking, did go up to go see the
Michael Jackson thing. I was going, Hey,

1156
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:31,690
we got candy up here. We
got candy up here. Right?

1157
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,460
Think about the 41 year old white male
yelling down to children that he's got

1158
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:40,940
candy. It was really, it
was really bad. But, uh,

1159
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,600
eventually I get got rid of all of it.
And uh,

1160
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:48,070
I discovered a new pet peeve that I have.

1161
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:53,260
Um, I don't like trick or treaters who
look like they're fucking 26. All right.

1162
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:57,950
You know who you are. You're too fucking
old. It's not cute anymore. You know,

1163
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,550
you're a Douche. And um, the last group
of people came up as was fucking unreal.

1164
01:16:02,551 --> 01:16:05,600
His kid had a better mustache
then I could grow. You know,

1165
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:08,450
he didn't have a mustache. We know what
I'm saying. If you're too fucking old.

1166
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,870
And he was actually saying she fucking
hates them too when she wanted to do was

1167
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:15,950
have a bag of apples. And when people
came up and they would do it too old,

1168
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:20,030
she wanted to give them apples instead
of candy. I'm like, yeah, that's great.

1169
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:22,010
And then they get down to the front
yard and they'd throw it through your

1170
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:24,140
fucking window.
Why don't we just hand out baseballs?

1171
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,480
But I understood what she
was talking about. You know,

1172
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,440
the fuck is wrong with
you. How old are you? Okay.

1173
01:16:31,441 --> 01:16:35,940
You should be going to a Halloween party
trying to fuck somebody dressed like a

1174
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:38,430
tube of toothpaste or whatever it is.
That's what you supposed to be doing.

1175
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:42,390
You're not supposed to be coming to
my door. Fucking Yo. It was annoying.

1176
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:46,020
I should have had a little bite size ones.
Anyways,

1177
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:48,750
so I actually was walking my dog this
morning and I was seeing all like the

1178
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:52,470
candy wrappers on the ground and all
the fat kids that couldn't wait til they

1179
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:53,940
got home.
And um,

1180
01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:00,610
and um, I dunno, they will all bite size.

1181
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,030
None of them were full size.

1182
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:07,031
I had the best candy on the fucking block
and I got trumped by this Vegas show

1183
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:08,990
up the fucking street.
Really? I don't know,

1184
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,630
just annoying noise the shit out of me.

1185
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,030
And I also to walk my dog, I actually, I,

1186
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,520
I pick up litter because a,

1187
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:22,310
I think I live in a nice neighborhood and
I don't like when fucking people throw

1188
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:23,180
shit on the ground.

1189
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,870
So I'm sitting there picking up these
little candy wrappers with my God damn dog

1190
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:32,270
and uh, came across a milky
way that that bugged me.

1191
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:36,400
You know,
we do,

1192
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:39,530
you know why even give out candy
if he'd given out a milky way,

1193
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:44,240
that's such a fucking cop
out. It's like, uh, I can't,

1194
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:46,970
I can't even fucking give a fuck
about hauling. You don't Milky Way.

1195
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:49,070
The Milky Way is like,
it's like

1196
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:54,620
if John Oates was a candy bar, he
be, he'd be a fucking Milky Way.

1197
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:56,930
That's what I'm trying to say.
All right.

1198
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,590
If you don't listen to fucking hall and
I'll cheat and you don't get the joker,

1199
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,220
right. He, it's, it's something,

1200
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,750
it nugget new is John Oates.
Okay.

1201
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:11,300
New get need some sort of, it needs
something with it. You know what I mean?

1202
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:16,330
It's like a Andrew Ridgeley who some of
the other famous duos that broke off and

1203
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:23,450
one guy just totally fucking made it
and the other guy was the human fucking

1204
01:18:23,451 --> 01:18:27,290
version of, of new get with nothing
in it. Can you think of anybody else?

1205
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:33,070
I know fucking insync Justin
Timberlake was the almonds.

1206
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,860
Those other four mother fuckers.
That's what they were.

1207
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:45,130
When Justin was in there, it was
a snickers bar. You took them out.

1208
01:18:45,131 --> 01:18:48,020
It was a Milky Way and nobody fucking
gave a shit. And that was the end of them.

1209
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,130
That was the fucking end of him.
Who gives out Milky Way. You know,

1210
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:55,520
fucking, you're not even
trying. Not even fuck.

1211
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:57,680
I had full sized fucking
candy bar and I was,

1212
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:01,670
I was hanging out screaming at people
trying to get them to come up to my

1213
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:04,970
fucking place. It was pathetic.
But I'll tell you right now,

1214
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:08,200
the pumpkin bread was to shit.
All right, let's move on here. Um,

1215
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:11,530
let's talk about my life.
What I have going on. Um,

1216
01:19:11,531 --> 01:19:16,250
I'm trying to hype shit that I have
going on, um, earlier in the podcast.

1217
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:21,500
So here goes this week. I'm going
to be a town hall in New York City.

1218
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,790
I'm not the town hall, the
town hall theater. And uh,

1219
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,760
I don't even know if
there's any tickets left,

1220
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:32,330
but I just like saying I'm going to
be doing a theater in New York City.

1221
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:36,200
Do you realize that? You realize
how huge that is for me. You know,

1222
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:40,340
way back in the day when I was
a youngster with a big Red Afro,

1223
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:44,120
wondering if I'd ever get on stage in
New York City just to do five fucking

1224
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:48,380
minutes at one o'clock in the morning,
you know,

1225
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,190
and here it is,
38 years later,

1226
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:56,800
I'm finally getting to do a theater.
Now I'm actually really excited and um,

1227
01:19:56,850 --> 01:20:00,950
I'm doing my special next month and um,

1228
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,440
you know, this is going to be, you know,

1229
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:06,290
weren't basically if you go to that
show or you're going to see basically my

1230
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:10,590
special essentially.
So I got that going on and a,

1231
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:13,830
that's November 6th, November
7th, I'm going to be doing comics,

1232
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:17,850
come home with Denis leary,
the 15th anniversary.

1233
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,590
It's for the Cam Neely, um, the Cam
Nealy House that helps families,

1234
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,483
um,

1235
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:27,000
of people stricken with cancer gives them
a place to stay rather than sitting in

1236
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:29,960
some awful hospital.
They actually get a nice home to stay in.

1237
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:33,720
So that's a wonderful cause that will
be at a guidance arena with the BU

1238
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:38,640
terriers play. And, uh, I believe there's
only a few tickets left for that one.

1239
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:42,870
So that's what I got going on. And later
on the month I'll be in Tempe, Arizona.

1240
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:46,080
Really looking forward to that Gig and uh,

1241
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:49,890
and the rest you can go to [inaudible]
dot com borr for uh, for date. See,

1242
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:52,860
and that's why I don't hype shit in
the middle because it's not funny.

1243
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:57,690
It's not fucking interesting. And uh,
then what happens? You're like, what?

1244
01:20:57,691 --> 01:21:00,840
This guy's going to riff about fucking
candy bars and musicians I don't give a

1245
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:03,300
fuck about and then tell me
where he's going to be at.

1246
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,310
Let me tell you guys a story. The
other day I decided, you know,

1247
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,880
I really need to get my ass in shape
so I don't look like a fat fuck on TV

1248
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:14,780
during my special.
So I'm,

1249
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,820
I have problems with joining gyms
because I'm always on the road.

1250
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,580
I have to freeze my membership and
all that type of shit and he's,

1251
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:21,660
I just throw the money away.

1252
01:21:21,661 --> 01:21:26,250
So I had been working out outside
basically in my apartment.

1253
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:31,251
And then I do cardio outside just like
that fucking guy with all the Matthew

1254
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:34,110
mcconaughey. There you go. You know,

1255
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,800
I do keep my shirt on and I don't run
down the street with fucking palm tree

1256
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:42,750
leaves. Like I'm trying to fly and it's
1898. I don't do that shit. All right.

1257
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,090
But I've definitely been going on hikes.

1258
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:49,800
So I found this hill out here and uh,
being a big football fan,

1259
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:53,460
I remember how Jerry Rice used to
run up this fucking hill, you know,

1260
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:56,790
to get in training for
the, uh, the NFL season.

1261
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,700
And I found a hill and I've been
running up this fucking thing and uh,

1262
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:04,320
I've been loving every
minute of it. And, um,

1263
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:09,840
I went up to go do it and I came home
and my fucking, I couldn't find my keys

1264
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,420
like an asshole. I left the, uh,

1265
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,330
my pocket open on my sweatpants and
because I'm old and when I run down the

1266
01:22:18,331 --> 01:22:21,360
hill, I can't run down the
hill. I have to sort of, Gallup,

1267
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:26,130
that's fucking pathetic.
And a,

1268
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:29,250
I was going really fast and I guess it
kind of flew out a fucking rattlesnake

1269
01:22:29,251 --> 01:22:30,330
took it.
I don't know what happened,

1270
01:22:30,331 --> 01:22:33,150
but I went back up to it or try and
find them and I don't have them.

1271
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:38,610
And you're like, wow, what's the big
fucking deal? You know? Why don't you,

1272
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:43,620
Oh shit. Did I just fucking
knock something out here?
What the hell just happened?

1273
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:47,640
Hello. Test one, two. I know you can
hear this, but I can't hear myself.

1274
01:22:47,641 --> 01:22:52,020
What the fuck is going on? Hold on. Hello.

1275
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:57,030
I know it's recording. What the fuck
is the problem line in? That's good.

1276
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:02,520
Your phones. That's fine. Hello? Test.
There we go. I got it back. Sorry.

1277
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,060
Jesus Christ. You know what is my
fucking rooms getting so God damn hot,

1278
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:10,450
I have to turn on the fucking ceiling fan.
Hang on a second.

1279
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:11,790
I can't do this all once.

1280
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,020
You know, if at any sort of class, I'd
edit that part out, but I'm not going to.

1281
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:28,810
So anyways, yeah. So I lost my
fucking keys. And like anyone,

1282
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,530
any normal person, if I had a normal
fucking car, oh, that's what I did.

1283
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:37,030
I turned this thing down. That's
what happened. Ah, there we go.

1284
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,120
Hello. Test one, two. Wow.

1285
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,810
Just when you thought it couldn't get
any worse. This is why it's free folks.

1286
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:48,040
This is why it is fucking free.
Like a one man band here.

1287
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,110
I shouldn't have like
symbols between my legs.

1288
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:54,800
How fucking easy was it to be a goddamn
entertainer back in the day that, that,

1289
01:23:54,801 --> 01:23:57,640
that that's what you could have you ever
seen one of those one man band guys.

1290
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,930
It's never good.

1291
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:03,130
It's never fucking good when somebody
does like a throwback to that shit and

1292
01:24:03,131 --> 01:24:07,580
they get symbols between their legs and
a base drum behind their back. Great.

1293
01:24:07,581 --> 01:24:11,750
And it turned the fan on too high and
I'm blowing shit off my fucking desk. Um,

1294
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:17,230
anyways. Yeah. So I can't find
my keys. And um, you know,

1295
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:18,460
the house keys,
no big deal.

1296
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:23,461
But the problem was was it was also the
key to my car and I drive a hybrid and

1297
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:28,020
it's this special fucking key.
It's a special key people.

1298
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,520
They couldn't just give me a regular
key where you stick it in the door and

1299
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:31,660
shove it in the ignition.

1300
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,560
This is like one of these keys where
you can have it in your pocket and you

1301
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:39,070
don't need to take it out and then you
just fucking reach and touch the door and

1302
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:44,071
it magically unlocks because some sort
of wave is coming out of the pocket,

1303
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,120
going to the door lock,

1304
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,070
bouncing back off and putting cancer
into your testicles. You know?

1305
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:54,130
That's what I'm basically doing
what I'm risking ball cancer,

1306
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:58,240
so I don't have to fucking unlock
my door the conventional way.

1307
01:24:58,241 --> 01:25:00,670
But the bottom line is you want to be,
you're probably wondering, well bill,

1308
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:05,650
how much does this pocket ball
cancer fucking Karachi cost?

1309
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,410
Evidently it's between two and 300 bucks.
I remember when I bought the car,

1310
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,220
make sure you don't lose this merch.
Shoot all losers cruise, of course,

1311
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:17,320
the to $224 to poker and blah, blah,
blah. I was thinking in my head, wow,

1312
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:21,460
that sounds like a fucking rip off to
me. Really, that little plastic thing.

1313
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,180
So,
I don't know.

1314
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:27,070
I went back up the hill and I tried to
find the fucking thing and I couldn't,

1315
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:32,050
once again, you know, I went up
there and it's actually really these,

1316
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:35,410
these unbelievable houses like um,

1317
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:39,670
like rich people, but like
classy rich, not like, uh,

1318
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,280
not Jerry Jones rich, you know what I
mean? Classy, tasteful, rich, you know,

1319
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,690
and I was walking down the hill and I
was looking for the keys and I came down

1320
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:54,691
and this is fucking old guy is walking
up the street and right as I was about

1321
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:59,230
ready to say hello to him, you
know, rich people are so, like they,

1322
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:00,540
some of them just have,
they,

1323
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:05,000
they have an inability to
like just have a conversation.

1324
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,360
It's like I'm walking down the street,
he's coming up the hill,

1325
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:12,950
he sees me and I'm just be like, hey,
how are you? That's all I'm going to say.

1326
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:16,010
He just, this is what, this is
how he greets me. He just goes,

1327
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,760
beautiful fall after noon.

1328
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:24,940
I didn't know what the
fuck to say to that.

1329
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:29,941
And he said it that loud and it took
him that like he drew out the words

1330
01:26:30,611 --> 01:26:33,880
beautiful fall after noon.

1331
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,930
You don't, what should have happened right
after he said that, you know, and those,

1332
01:26:37,931 --> 01:26:40,750
the original monster movies of Hollywood,
you know,

1333
01:26:40,751 --> 01:26:44,890
that church organ that they, you
know, and then the lightening strikes,

1334
01:26:44,891 --> 01:26:47,960
that's what the fuck should happen.
After that guy talked, it's like, Whoa,

1335
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,830
what are you just naming
shit that you like?

1336
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,810
Like I didn't know socially what I was
supposed to say after beautiful fall

1337
01:26:55,811 --> 01:27:00,290
after noon,
um,

1338
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:04,430
half off Budweiser's at a teddy bar.

1339
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:10,280
What do you say to that? I don't know
how the fuck to say to the guy and I,

1340
01:27:10,281 --> 01:27:14,990
I just sort of went, yeah, yeah, it is.

1341
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,520
It's a nice one.
Just kept fucking walk.

1342
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,633
Ah,

1343
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:27,040
with the fire, it was like, I was trying
to think like, what question I could have.

1344
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,990
I don't think it was playing
a board game in his head

1345
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:35,110
or he played the first five notes,
so to a song and I said, ah,

1346
01:27:35,111 --> 01:27:37,600
what is the name of that
song? Uh, tell me what is it?

1347
01:27:37,601 --> 01:27:41,960
It's called beautiful fall afternoon.
That's what it's called. Um, anyway,

1348
01:27:41,961 --> 01:27:45,230
so I walked back up there and I just kept
saying to people, edge a JD as you've,

1349
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:49,690
as you having to she a shed a
quiche. And they'd be like, no, no,

1350
01:27:49,691 --> 01:27:54,250
I didn't. Um, but if I find them I will,

1351
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:58,870
ah, and I had no information to
give them and I was just like, yeah,

1352
01:27:58,871 --> 01:28:02,170
just sort of stick them
on a rock stick on a rock.

1353
01:28:02,171 --> 01:28:05,740
And maybe I'll come walking by and I'll
fucking, you know, but I held out hope.

1354
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,490
I was like, you know what, it's
a park. There's a lost and found.

1355
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,950
I'll go there tomorrow in
the lost and found is open.

1356
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:17,280
And I went there hoping against hope
that for once in my life I lost something

1357
01:28:17,351 --> 01:28:20,500
in public and somebody
actually returned it, you know?

1358
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,990
Do you remember that from back in
the day when I lost my cell phone,

1359
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:26,500
my girlfriend since I been with her
has probably lost three cell phones and

1360
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:29,920
anytime she loses his cell phone,
all she does is call it.

1361
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,870
She calls it. And not only does
somebody pick it up, it is the greatest

1362
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:40,970
person on the planet. You know, I should
just call up and I'm thinking my head.

1363
01:28:40,971 --> 01:28:44,060
Then I was going to answer this shit.
It's gone. Just like mine is always gone.

1364
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:48,410
And then she calls, you know,
one and a half ring. Somebody
just picks it up. Hello.

1365
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:52,460
Well, yes I do. Absolutely. Come
on over. I'll give it to you.

1366
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,860
I actually just bake some cookies.
Come on over.

1367
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:58,100
I'll give you a fresh cookies and your
fucking cell phone back because that's

1368
01:28:58,101 --> 01:28:59,810
how your life works,
right?

1369
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:05,880
I lose my mind in the back of a fucking
car is fucking douchebag is driving me

1370
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:08,340
to the airport.
I realize it like a half hour later.

1371
01:29:08,341 --> 01:29:12,860
I know we still working and the phone is
on and it's ringing in his fucking back

1372
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:14,310
seat and the cont doesn't answer it.

1373
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,780
So that has been my experience.

1374
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:21,360
So I go over to the little ranger
Rick thing going, oh please.

1375
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,790
Then maybe this is the one time,
keep a positive attitude,

1376
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:24,960
put it out to the universe.

1377
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:28,770
I'm going to get my $200 set of keys
back and of course I show up and they're

1378
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:32,610
like, uh, no. Nobody has
returned any keys. You,

1379
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:35,880
if you want to check back later
and get giggly, it really, really,

1380
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:38,490
am I really going to come back later? You
know, I'm not going to come back later,

1381
01:29:38,491 --> 01:29:39,960
so just spare me this speech or right.

1382
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:45,720
Just go fucking change the
chances of fire sign out there.

1383
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:48,420
Why don't you just go fucking do that?
You're like, oh man. At the Park Ranger,

1384
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:53,550
because I've ran with my AMF
fucking sweatpants with the sides.

1385
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:58,470
Unzipped like an asshole, like
a fucking asshole. All right.

1386
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:01,770
Last week I talked about
this guy who I wanted to uh,

1387
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,400
flatten his nose while I,

1388
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:09,030
I sent my fist all the way to the back
of his fucking cranium stopping just

1389
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:14,031
short of the hypothalamus and I was
talking about fights and I'm just how when

1390
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:18,110
you get older you have to walk away from
fights because there's no winning them.

1391
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:23,130
There really isn't. When you get
old, it's just like, okay, either a,

1392
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:27,600
I get out of the car and I get the
living shit kicked out of me. Right.

1393
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,730
Or B I win and then I get sued.
Right.

1394
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:38,190
And the older you get the,
the the greater chance of the first one,

1395
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,220
which is w I dunno. What do you think's
worse getting the shit kicked out of you?

1396
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:43,590
I think getting sued is worse,

1397
01:30:43,591 --> 01:30:45,870
but as long as it depends
on the level of ass kicking.

1398
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:48,090
I don't want to lose a tooth, but you
know, if you want to beat me down,

1399
01:30:48,091 --> 01:30:49,320
I have a headache for three days.

1400
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,740
I'd rather have that than deal with you
fucking taking my money. So anyways.

1401
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,690
Um,

1402
01:30:55,140 --> 01:31:00,090
so a lot of people sent me
in some unbelievable stories
about fights that either

1403
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:03,060
they walked away from
or that they got into.

1404
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:07,320
One of them is actually a case pending,
so I'm not allowed to talk about it.

1405
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:08,430
So I'll basically,

1406
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:13,910
I'll skim over it is basically a kid is
walking down the street and three drunk

1407
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:20,100
guys start giving him shit. He gives him
shit back. They give him some more shit.

1408
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:22,530
And he says, Oh yeah, the guys
are real tough with three.

1409
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:26,340
None of you would fight me one on
one and this one kid goes, all right,

1410
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:29,730
I'll fight you. So they square
off, they'd throw a few.

1411
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:32,740
And the though the kid who
was just part, you know, the,

1412
01:31:32,741 --> 01:31:36,180
the innocent kid connected hit the kid.

1413
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:39,810
The kid falls down and hits the back of
his head on the pavement. He, you know,

1414
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,890
and he's not fucking moving. And the
kid's like, holy fuck, what did I do?

1415
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:46,470
So he's kind of walking away,
but he's also concerned,

1416
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:49,860
his big fucking mistake was
he actually gave a shit.

1417
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:55,770
And uh, then the cops showed up. He was
still in sight and he got fucking, uh, uh,

1418
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:00,850
did they arrest him? I can't remember.
All I know was in the end of it, this,

1419
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,280
there's three of them and only one of him.

1420
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:08,281
And he ended up getting sued and lost
something about a preemptive strike.

1421
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,480
Can you fucking believe that? I was like,
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to let, uh,

1422
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:15,280
the one guy with the two other friends,

1423
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:18,730
he hit me a couple times and then I
was supposed to punch back is fucking

1424
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:23,440
unbelievable. It's
unbelievable. Just A, I dunno.

1425
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:26,260
So there was a lot of people going like,
I want to kick the shit out of this guy.

1426
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:28,870
What should I do? You know what he should
do? He should just fucking walk away.

1427
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,280
Just walk away and just forget
about the whole fucking thing.

1428
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:37,090
And don't even tell yourself that lie
that he'll get his, he'll get his,

1429
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:39,490
cause you know what, they
don't, they don't get there.

1430
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:42,100
So you know what they do is
they get punched in the face.

1431
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:46,690
Maybe in the worst case scenario
is they win 10 grant. Um,

1432
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:50,590
they don't, they don't. I, I've lived
long enough to realize that, you know,

1433
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:54,580
when the bad guy gets his in the
movies, that's when it happens. Okay.

1434
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:58,390
The rest of them go on to
live very successful lives.

1435
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,120
They have great looking girlfriends.

1436
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:07,840
They a porous raw sewage into drinking
water and they find some other Dick to

1437
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:08,920
take the fall for it.

1438
01:33:08,921 --> 01:33:13,270
And then they buy land in South America
and they leave the country and they're

1439
01:33:13,271 --> 01:33:16,390
fine. They're fucking fides. So, uh,

1440
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,000
you're better to just just walk away.

1441
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:22,110
Somebody gave me some great
advice saying that, uh, the,

1442
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,690
he used to get into fights all the time.
This is so simple.

1443
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:26,770
I never even thought of it.

1444
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:31,420
He just bought a heavy bag and he would
come home and he would just beat the

1445
01:33:31,421 --> 01:33:35,170
shit out of the bag and he felt way
better and there was no lawsuits.

1446
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:38,200
And then certain days when
he wanted to murder somebody,

1447
01:33:38,201 --> 01:33:41,710
he would take a baseball bat and
just slam it into the heavy bag.

1448
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:46,510
And he would feel phenomenal
afterwards. And, uh,

1449
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:52,570
I, I liked, I want to, I want
to believe that that works.

1450
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,320
I don't know. I have an insane
temper. I take it to the point of,

1451
01:33:57,321 --> 01:34:01,870
I want to feel that other guy quit.
That's how mad I am.

1452
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,990
I want to beat the fuck out of you.
I want you to fight back,

1453
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:09,310
but I want to feel the moment where you
fucking quit. You know how sick is that?

1454
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,241
That's how mad,

1455
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:15,160
I just can't see that getting that out
with the fucking heavy bag. All right,

1456
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:17,770
so let's read a couple of stories here.
These were very long.

1457
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:21,760
This was a very passionate subject.
Um,

1458
01:34:21,761 --> 01:34:24,430
so forgive me with my awful reading.
Here it goes.

1459
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:29,110
I'm gonna read a couple of
these. Um, all right. Uh,

1460
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:32,020
here's,
here's the classic like this.

1461
01:34:32,021 --> 01:34:35,200
This is like anger that will come
out of you 20 years from now.

1462
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:39,520
Here's a great story here.
A bill, I sympathize about
the whole fight thing. Um,

1463
01:34:39,521 --> 01:34:43,360
it seems like anytime some asshole
decides to start shit with me,

1464
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:48,370
it will happen in a war in a way that I
can't retaliate without either getting

1465
01:34:48,371 --> 01:34:52,390
arrested or sued. Literally what I was
just talking about. He goes, so anyways,

1466
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,600
I was at a packed bar with some
friends the other night and uh,

1467
01:34:55,630 --> 01:35:00,260
we had gotten there about a half prior
and I had about a one beer in me,

1468
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:04,670
so I wasn't even remotely drunk. Um, I
guess the place was packed. So anyways,

1469
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:05,880
he's a I, she says, I'm,

1470
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:09,770
I was making my way through the crowd
with a pint glass in my hand trying to

1471
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:12,200
navigate to the bathroom along the way,

1472
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:17,180
some scrawny little cunt who apparently
has had way too much to drink,

1473
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:22,390
backs into me and spills half my beer
and make a habit out of quickly saying,

1474
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:26,990
excuse me, and thank you
whenever I walk through a crowd,

1475
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:31,040
because I figure people are more apt to
let you through if you're polite about

1476
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:34,410
things. This prick turns around
and says, this is the guy who,

1477
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,830
who bumps into him and spills
half his, his beer. He said,

1478
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:39,620
this prick turns around and says,
what the fuck is your problem?

1479
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,620
And knocks my drink out of my hand.

1480
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,900
Jesus Christ. You gotta be able to take
a fucking wrench to that guy's head.

1481
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:51,080
Um,
he said at this point,

1482
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:55,910
one of his friends jumps on him trying
to break it up while the little bitch

1483
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:59,270
keeps talking shit.
So I tell him to go fuck himself.

1484
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:03,290
It was going to talk shit till the
prick would, uh, would throw a punch.

1485
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,850
But just at that moment,

1486
01:36:04,851 --> 01:36:09,851
a guy standing next to us wearing a
blazer but with some kind of shirt sweater

1487
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:13,880
that was,
that wasn't buttoned down,

1488
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:16,460
tells me forcefully keep walking.

1489
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:21,620
At that moment I figured it was one of
the bouncers pissed off over having lost

1490
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:26,420
the drink and being insulted. Uh, I head
to the bathroom, my window to fight.

1491
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:29,600
That shit had open and close so quickly
that I didn't get a chance at any

1492
01:36:29,601 --> 01:36:31,700
vindication.
When it got to the bathroom,

1493
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:36,410
I noticed that the guy who I thought
was a bouncer wasn't, maybe he was,

1494
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:40,430
maybe he was this little clowns,
a bodyguard, but I couldn't tell.

1495
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:42,170
He didn't seem like one,

1496
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:45,410
it didn't seem like one of his friends
because the little con in his friends

1497
01:36:45,411 --> 01:36:49,310
were all dressed the same way with
designer ripped jeans and open button down

1498
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:50,900
shirts with necklaces and shit.

1499
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:54,710
Basically they all look like they were
members of some eighties rock band that

1500
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:59,360
was still touring but couldn't get but
could only get gigs in a dive bar. Um,

1501
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:03,980
now my chant, my choices are either, okay,
now he's in the bathroom. Uh, he says,

1502
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:07,760
now my choices are either walk
back to my group without a beer

1503
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:14,060
or a the bitch move of telling one of
the bouncers and seeing if I can get that

1504
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:18,110
prick tossed out. Um, I could
also go and confront them,

1505
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:22,940
but even if I could take the bodyguard,
um,

1506
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,720
what kind of person goes to a bar dressed
with that ed hardy clothing with a

1507
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,750
Bodeger. What did I just miss here? Sorry.

1508
01:37:29,751 --> 01:37:33,400
This is really fucking long
and I'm seeing double here. Uh,

1509
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:37,720
fuck you just killed the whole story bell.
What is wrong with you? Confront him.

1510
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:39,020
Uh,
which from his size,

1511
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:42,540
I think I stood a good chance as
long he was an MMA fighter. Uh,

1512
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,080
this was in New Jersey.
Mind you. So I thought, uh,

1513
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:49,430
I thought considering he was Italian
looking and had a girl that was way out of

1514
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:53,080
his league, maybe he was connected
to some bullshit like that. Maybe a,

1515
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:56,460
the little pricky even had a gun or a
knife on him because stupid shit like that

1516
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:59,700
is happening thing.
I didn't want to take any shit from him,

1517
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:04,280
but I'm not about to get shot
over a beer. Um, anyways, it's,

1518
01:38:04,281 --> 01:38:05,430
so that's what he ends up doing.
He goes,

1519
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:08,850
I ended up walking back to my group
without a beer and hiding my bad mood for

1520
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:12,300
the rest of the night.
One on one with either one of those cons,

1521
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,710
I would have been fine.
I'm five,

1522
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:18,150
1,195 pounds and mostly muscle and
I've never lost a fight. Then again,

1523
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:21,570
I've only been in a few. I'll
spare the rest of this shit. Um,

1524
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,510
I don't know if he's asking me
what I can't even remember. I just,

1525
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,740
I get a headache when I have to read
that much. So you know what I mean?

1526
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,110
It's like,
and do you think that little,

1527
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,620
maybe that little fuck we'll get his
because he's so like I could see knocking

1528
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:36,150
it over and be like, dude,
what the fuck's your problem?

1529
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:39,780
That's sort of your average asshole and
a Barbara to then slap it out of your

1530
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:44,700
hand. He's got that Napoleon thing where
he's got something to prove, I guess.

1531
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:48,840
Um, I dunno, my question is,
what do you do with that anger?

1532
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:54,700
What do you do with that fucking
anger? Anyways, his and Alon, Bill, uh,

1533
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,600
you were talking about this week about
nearly getting into a fight with dead

1534
01:38:57,601 --> 01:38:58,930
Dick and the green sedan.
Well,

1535
01:38:58,931 --> 01:39:01,530
I admit that this wasn't
anywhere close to me fighting.

1536
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,120
It was still a fucking horror
story while it happened. All right,

1537
01:39:06,121 --> 01:39:09,860
here's one here that will leave
you with a lot of anger. Uh,

1538
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:13,000
I was about six months into my standup
career and a friend of mine asked me to

1539
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:17,820
do a show with him at this bar that
paid him a, that pay would pay $20.

1540
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,640
I was psyched because it
would be my first page show.

1541
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,400
I did the show and got a
decent amount of laughs.

1542
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:25,770
I thought I did fucking horribly,
but uh,

1543
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:29,310
if they left then I'm not going to
complain. So he gets paid his money.

1544
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,330
The next day I'm walking,

1545
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:35,070
I'm walking home from school
and I'm cutting through
the basketball courts where

1546
01:39:35,071 --> 01:39:35,881
a drug dealer,

1547
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:39,600
I know we'll call him drug dealer number
one is sitting there with one of his

1548
01:39:39,601 --> 01:39:43,470
friends, the friends he was sitting with
kind of look like ghost face killer,

1549
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:47,790
but he had a stare of a potential rapist.
Next thing I know,

1550
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:49,620
I'm passing this guy and he stops me.

1551
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:53,130
He tells me that if I don't give
him my wallet, which is visible,

1552
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:56,430
which was visibly in my front pocket,

1553
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:00,990
he was going to just stop me and take it.
He takes it and empties my lunch money.

1554
01:40:00,991 --> 01:40:05,670
Luckily, or I thought, luckily I kept a
special 20 and a different compartment.

1555
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:09,490
Now, this is a lot of things a lot of
comedians do, or people who when they,

1556
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:12,420
they set off on a dream,
the first amount of money they get,

1557
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:13,680
it's usually not a lot of money.

1558
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:17,660
So they either frame the
check or they save the dollar,

1559
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:18,870
the five bucks of the 20.

1560
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:22,140
So I'm imagining that this is what
this young comic was trying to do.

1561
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:26,730
So he kept a $20 in the, in a
different compartment. I said, well,

1562
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:31,200
he rummaged through the entire wallet,
put back my large library card,

1563
01:40:31,201 --> 01:40:34,890
the illiterate cunt,
and eventually found the $20 bill.

1564
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:39,900
He threw the wallet my chest and asked
me why I lied to him when he asked me if

1565
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:42,690
I had any other money than any
other money than the lunch money.

1566
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:43,810
I actually told the,

1567
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:48,990
the guy mugging me the history of
this hidden $20 bill as he goes.

1568
01:40:49,441 --> 01:40:51,960
As I just typed that last sentence,

1569
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:56,350
I just imagined my head slamming into
the keyboard. Um, he says, what a,

1570
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,720
what a fag. I was, um, so anyways,

1571
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:02,260
this motherfucker told me that
if I told him a good joke,

1572
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,540
maybe I'd get the $20 back.

1573
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:08,110
This is really your inexperience as a
comedian because there's no joke you're

1574
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:10,420
going to be able to tell. So
anyways, here we go. He said, well,

1575
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:14,230
I used to tell these off of one liners
when I first started because my self

1576
01:41:14,231 --> 01:41:18,580
confidence would dwindle left at 10
to 15 seconds. So I stammered out,

1577
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:21,580
stammered out.
I knew this girl is so stupid.

1578
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:25,240
The only reason why she knew her
ABC's was because of hepatitis.

1579
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:30,070
So then the drug dealer,
he faked laughed like a fucking maniac,

1580
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:34,420
straightened up into a serious face and
was just like, get the fuck Outta here.

1581
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:42,460
Wow. Ah, Jesus.

1582
01:41:42,461 --> 01:41:45,730
That'll age you about fucking eight
years. Anyways, the rest of it,

1583
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:47,620
needless to say,
I took it like a bitch,

1584
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:51,460
but if this story didn't have a punchline
in and of itself, here's the kicker.

1585
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,660
Literally less than a week later after
this incident, this drug dealer from,

1586
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:59,350
from my school, big black kid
with a voice like Mickey Mouse,

1587
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,300
it's a fucking spectacle.

1588
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:05,800
Tells me that drug dealer number one stop
hanging out with the ghost face killer

1589
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:09,250
guy because he's an
undercover fucking cop.

1590
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:13,630
So this dude got mugged by
an undercover fucking cop.

1591
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,920
So for all you, for all your talk
about getting screwed by corporations,

1592
01:42:17,921 --> 01:42:22,921
that's the worst case of being deep dick
by the man that's ever happened to me.

1593
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,120
And then I realized in retrospect that
even though I lost the first remanence of

1594
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:30,820
what I'd hope B would
be a successful career,

1595
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:33,940
the losing of my first $20
was well worth the story.

1596
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:36,880
I still hope that cop is
shot in the line of duty,

1597
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:41,050
in skull fucked by a gang of junkies.
See that? That's the fucking anger.

1598
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:45,460
That is the anger. Um, I dunno,

1599
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:49,240
I dunno how many listeners I have at
this point cause I don't really hype this

1600
01:42:49,241 --> 01:42:51,910
fucking thing and I never bring
it up at shows. Are there any, uh,

1601
01:42:51,911 --> 01:42:56,470
psychologists out there?
You know, psychologists,

1602
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:57,820
like they know what to do with anger.

1603
01:42:57,930 --> 01:43:01,990
It's fucking sweater wearing douche bags
just sitting there. They're loafers.

1604
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:06,130
He ever go to therapy. He's to fucking
tell him shit. And then just like, Whoa,

1605
01:43:06,131 --> 01:43:07,300
what do you think?
You think that,

1606
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:12,610
what would happen if you would do
something like that? It's just like,

1607
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:15,850
it really is. That's
all you got. You know,

1608
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:21,160
they just basically get you to pour out
all your shit and then you've got to

1609
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:25,030
sort of figure it out. I don't even what
the f you know, it's fucking hilarious.

1610
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:28,720
Had been in therapy for a while now
obviously it's not fucking working.

1611
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:31,780
I'm anyways, this plow ahead here. Um,

1612
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:38,200
did I talk about this last week?
Somebody sent me a, uh, somebody sent,

1613
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:43,180
oh, somebody sent me a, an
email and was talking about my,

1614
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:47,410
um, why are they like now? I hope it's,
this podcast has been loud enough.

1615
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:49,090
I think it is.
Um,

1616
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:53,790
somebody sent me an email talking about
some new movie coming out and in this

1617
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:56,990
subject, the thing, the,
the line in the movie,

1618
01:43:57,030 --> 01:44:02,030
the lion on the subject line said another
save the black kid movie and it said

1619
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,240
bill from various clips on Youtube.

1620
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:09,170
I know you have some disdain for
racist movies. I was just wondering,

1621
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:13,760
what's your feeling on the new one
coming out with Sandra Bullock called the

1622
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:14,690
blind side?

1623
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,240
Yeah,

1624
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,210
I guess it's about her helping some,
a black kid. All right. First of all,

1625
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:22,900
this is what I love about this email is,
um,

1626
01:44:22,901 --> 01:44:25,600
and this was something that I've learned
in standup comedy is you ha you can't

1627
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:28,570
control how people process what you say.
Um,

1628
01:44:28,571 --> 01:44:32,500
I've never done a bit about another
about save a black kid movies.

1629
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:36,970
The name of the bit was, uh,
white people are evil movies.

1630
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:41,590
That's what it is. And I don't have,

1631
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,840
obviously I have disdained
for racist movies,

1632
01:44:43,841 --> 01:44:48,130
but like what the fuck movie was I
talking about in my last special,

1633
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:53,140
that one about the black swim team.
Uh, what the fuck was it called?

1634
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:55,030
Poolside.
I can't ever remember.

1635
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:58,600
What was it called against the tide?

1636
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:01,330
The fuck was that movie called whatever.

1637
01:45:01,331 --> 01:45:05,920
Whatever that fucking movie was
called chlorine. What was it called?

1638
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:09,610
I did that job for like
fucking a year on stage.

1639
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,750
If you guys seen that new movie came
out, labile blots. I can't, yeah.

1640
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:17,320
Trying to jog if my, I have
no memory. But anyways,

1641
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:22,560
that movie is not an example of a
racist movie that's a movie about race.

1642
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:24,920
Okay.

1643
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,760
And, uh, you know, this is just a podcast
listener. So what the food, you know,

1644
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:32,870
I'm not really going to give
this guy shit about that,

1645
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:37,871
but I've actually had people write
reviews about my act and says,

1646
01:45:38,211 --> 01:45:41,490
and was describing some of the stuff I
talked to be talks about the difference

1647
01:45:41,491 --> 01:45:45,770
between men and women. Uh, he
does racist jokes. He does.

1648
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:46,910
Bababa it's like,

1649
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:51,911
I don't do I do racial jokes
about race are racial jokes.

1650
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:53,490
Okay.

1651
01:45:53,490 --> 01:45:57,750
A movie about race is a,
is a, you could say it's a,

1652
01:45:57,751 --> 01:46:01,380
I guess a racial movie or, yeah.
You'd say that it's not racist.

1653
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:06,350
A racist movie would be, um, I dunno,

1654
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:11,060
that's a fucking good example of
it. What does it good? I mean,

1655
01:46:11,061 --> 01:46:14,690
Mississippi burning is not a racist movie.
It's a movie about racist,

1656
01:46:14,691 --> 01:46:16,880
but the movie itself is not racist.

1657
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:18,280
Okay.

1658
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:22,710
It's about race relations. Right. My
out of my fucking mind here. That.

1659
01:46:22,711 --> 01:46:26,250
What's that fucking one of the original
Hollywood movies where they have white

1660
01:46:26,251 --> 01:46:31,170
dudes dressed up in black face and then
make it black people look stupid and

1661
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:35,220
that is the message of the movie.
They're not, they're not doing a movie.

1662
01:46:35,221 --> 01:46:39,540
They're making fun of white people who
do that or talking about white people who

1663
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:42,960
do that. They are. That is
the message of the movie.

1664
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,000
Yeah,

1665
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,720
that black people are stupid.
That is a fucking racist movie.

1666
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:51,690
See the difference?
What the fuck is the name of that movie?

1667
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,290
What the fuck is the name of that movie?

1668
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:03,860
Did you begin with an h? I have no
fucking stop talking on my cell phone.

1669
01:47:03,861 --> 01:47:06,320
I'm getting, you know what I'm not
doing. I'm fuck my cell phone. That's it.

1670
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:08,270
It's over.
All right.

1671
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:14,540
The fuck is the name of that movie.
All right. Forget it. Forget it.

1672
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,540
I fucking give up.
I have to fucking,

1673
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:21,960
I got to look it up now guys, this is
something, if you can hear it, my voice,

1674
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:25,980
this is actually something that's fucking
scare in me is that I'm starting to

1675
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:29,060
lose my God damn memory.
Somebody actually made a

1676
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:34,200
the fuck is it?
Okay now

1677
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:40,370
you know what,
with a fuck is it?

1678
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,593
Yeah,

1679
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,000
I really should edit all this out,
but I'm not going to do it.

1680
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:45,900
I'm not going to do it.

1681
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:47,550
Okay.

1682
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:50,370
Why am I saying everything twice?
You know why?

1683
01:47:50,371 --> 01:47:53,780
Because I'm trying to find something
that somebody sent me. Okay.

1684
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:54,970
Okay.

1685
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:59,970
They sent me a nice little MP3 remix of
the thing and I had it all queued up and

1686
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:05,350
I can't fucking find it.
You fucking asshole bill.

1687
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:07,600
You really are an asshole.
You fucking worthless.

1688
01:48:08,170 --> 01:48:11,980
And this is why you have to fly out to
fucking Omaha at some point and tell some

1689
01:48:11,981 --> 01:48:12,970
jokes.
You know what I had last week,

1690
01:48:12,971 --> 01:48:16,360
I made fun of Omaha saying how I
wasn't going to do a show in Omaha.

1691
01:48:16,361 --> 01:48:20,960
And people were like, you know,
I said eventually I would do one,

1692
01:48:20,961 --> 01:48:23,840
but I was making fun of how many fucking
airplanes I would have to take to get

1693
01:48:23,841 --> 01:48:27,500
there. And I got like five
emails from people. Actually,

1694
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,900
there's a direct flight from
fucking Gig or Duke or do you?

1695
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,680
You're gonna land in a fucking cornfield
and you can just say it up fucking

1696
01:48:33,681 --> 01:48:37,730
stage right? But in their bill,
people in Omaha don't talk like that.

1697
01:48:37,731 --> 01:48:41,420
I don't give a shit. I know
they don't. Johnny Carson
was from Nebraska, wasn't he?

1698
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:45,440
All I even remember about Nebraska was
doing college gigs out there and you

1699
01:48:45,441 --> 01:48:49,040
drive halfway across the state
in, in, in you driving across 80,

1700
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:54,710
which goes the length of this, uh, east
west. Here's something that truckers know.

1701
01:48:54,711 --> 01:48:59,120
Do you guys know this shit? You know, if
you're on an, an even numbered highway,

1702
01:48:59,121 --> 01:49:03,320
that means it goes east,
west. And if you're on a odd
one, that means it's north.

1703
01:49:03,321 --> 01:49:06,580
South. Did you know that? Huh?

1704
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:09,380
I'm talking about highways.
So don't even hit me with though.

1705
01:49:09,381 --> 01:49:13,100
We'll route one goes away. Shut
up. Not talking about roots.

1706
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:16,760
I'm talking about highways isn't
another thing. If you're on,

1707
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:18,410
if you're on a highway,
right?

1708
01:49:18,411 --> 01:49:23,411
Let's just say it's 95 and you
don't have a map all right in your,

1709
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:27,920
and you see all of a sudden
there's a four 95 or eight to 95.

1710
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:32,921
What that means is you are coming towards
a congested area and if it's during

1711
01:49:33,141 --> 01:49:33,771
rush hour,

1712
01:49:33,771 --> 01:49:38,771
you can jump on the two 95 of the four
95 and it will basically eventually re

1713
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:41,750
hookup with the highway.

1714
01:49:41,751 --> 01:49:45,650
You're on 95 when you can avoid
the traffic and not add to it.

1715
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:49,360
They did that one truckers.
Um,

1716
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:52,780
it's like an la the four or five you got
the five goes right through the heart

1717
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:55,930
of La, the four oh five when it
goes out around Santa Monica.

1718
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,130
But there's so many fucking people,

1719
01:49:57,131 --> 01:50:00,760
it doesn't make a difference out here
cause they're all jammed. All right?

1720
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,570
That's how much I know this fuck.
That's how much road work I've done.

1721
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:09,930
So you get on the fucking 80 and you
get about halfway across Nebraska.

1722
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:11,351
And if you're like me,

1723
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:13,450
you're doing a college gig in
the middle of the winter time.

1724
01:50:13,451 --> 01:50:16,360
So all the crops are cut down.
All right?

1725
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:19,570
And you can't tell where the
fucking dirt ends in the sky begins.

1726
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,280
It's just all fucking gray.

1727
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:26,740
And all of a sudden out of nowhere there's
like this wooden bridge footbridge or

1728
01:50:26,741 --> 01:50:29,560
some native American Indian shit.

1729
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,470
You know, I just, you know, many
times I drove underneath that,

1730
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:38,820
I don't know what the fuck it is racing
back to either flying out of Lincoln or

1731
01:50:38,821 --> 01:50:43,821
Omaha trying to get back to catch my
early flight and I would literally be

1732
01:50:44,431 --> 01:50:47,070
driving like a maniac and I be looking
out to the right and there would

1733
01:50:47,071 --> 01:50:50,460
literally be like a
flock of geese in that V,

1734
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:55,590
that v formation. You know the one
that daffy duck was like, fuck this.

1735
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:59,160
I'm not going snow flies. Don't
bother me. You remember that one?

1736
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,140
I'd be seeing that shit.

1737
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:08,980
I drove 80 I believe I drove 80 in
Wyoming and I saw a kind of antelope,

1738
01:51:09,021 --> 01:51:13,490
I don't even know what the fuck it was.
I had no idea what the fuck it was.

1739
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:17,570
Just saw like species of animals that I
didn't even know fucking existed in this

1740
01:51:17,571 --> 01:51:22,220
country.
70 I remember 70 I've drove.

1741
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:26,120
I've driven that one all the way from
la all the way right into New York City.

1742
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:29,360
You get it all the way to about Jersey
and then you've got to fucking switch it

1743
01:51:29,361 --> 01:51:33,440
up. It's fucking brutal.
Ben, on all of them,

1744
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:37,840
90 95
I think.

1745
01:51:37,841 --> 01:51:41,500
What is 35 go from Houston right
up to Dallas in the fucking insane.

1746
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:45,940
Then all of a sudden, the years later I'd
be up in IB in, in like Iowa gone out.

1747
01:51:45,941 --> 01:51:49,720
It's just the same fucking highway and
you take from fucking Houston to Dallas

1748
01:51:49,721 --> 01:51:51,430
and it goes right up the
heart of this fucking country.

1749
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:56,260
Isn't that fucking interesting? Um, yeah.

1750
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,460
A lot of fucking roadwork.

1751
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:00,340
I was supposed to be searching for
the email and actually just lean back

1752
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:05,110
thinking about those fucking
days being out, you know,

1753
01:52:05,111 --> 01:52:09,760
many times I did Coosbay Oregon I
think like three or four fucking times.

1754
01:52:09,761 --> 01:52:12,550
Every time I went down there that God
damn seals whenever out they had this

1755
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:15,430
thing where you could actually
see the seals sunning themselves,

1756
01:52:15,431 --> 01:52:18,180
which was fucking amazing to me at
that point because I lived on the,

1757
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,830
I lived on the east coast,
you know,

1758
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:25,450
when the fuck do you get a chance to
see that? You know, I just cannot,

1759
01:52:25,451 --> 01:52:29,620
I cannot find this fucking thing. I
have to find you. This, this clip,

1760
01:52:29,621 --> 01:52:34,621
this person send this MP three
he did a remix to a song.

1761
01:52:35,410 --> 01:52:40,330
I'm trying to kill time because I
can't fucking find it. Hey Bill.

1762
01:52:40,331 --> 01:52:44,770
Hey Bill. Go Fuck Yourself.
Read this. She can't.

1763
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:49,340
This is what, these are the emails
I get from you guys. That's not it.

1764
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:55,370
File recommendation,
Shithead Bar, fight story.

1765
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,400
Uh, it's a, it's a mission. Now

1766
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:05,530
give me something else to talk about.
You got anything? Any questions?

1767
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:08,980
This is when I, it, it kills
me that I, that I don't,

1768
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,450
I don't have any callers because
this is what the fuck happened.

1769
01:53:13,451 --> 01:53:15,880
I'm quitting after two more
emails I have, you know, it's not,

1770
01:53:15,881 --> 01:53:18,430
I'm going to be worth it by the
time I find it isn't the payoff.

1771
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:21,820
It's not going to be worth it.
Hey, did the Phillies win tonight?

1772
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:26,230
Please tell me they won. I've never given
a fuck about the Phillies until now.

1773
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:30,730
I just can't stomach the fucking Lakers
and the Yankees are going to win it this

1774
01:53:30,730 --> 01:53:31,563
year.
You know what I mean?

1775
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:32,940
Yeah.

1776
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:36,990
Jesus Christ. To fucking Yankees.
What a team, Huh? What a fucking team.

1777
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:43,410
What a fucking team. A Rod,
Rodney third [inaudible].

1778
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:46,380
Jesus Christ.

1779
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:52,400
Jesus Christ coming up to the plate
and the Yankee sign him for one year.

1780
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:57,480
They actually, uh, they
actually is suspended there.

1781
01:53:57,481 --> 01:54:01,470
No facial hair rule with him.
Johnny Damon's a little upset,

1782
01:54:01,471 --> 01:54:05,790
but you know he is the
son of God fucking cunt.

1783
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:10,500
You fucking rich. Cons. He called that an
accomplishment. You win a world series.

1784
01:54:10,501 --> 01:54:13,920
What? Cause you got the most
fucking money. There's no,
there's no skill in that.

1785
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:16,080
There's no fucking skill in that.

1786
01:54:16,081 --> 01:54:19,500
You fucking pieces of shit and
they actually have, you know what?

1787
01:54:19,501 --> 01:54:20,580
I can't stand about Yankee fans.

1788
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:24,360
They actually had the nerve to be nervous
during the playoffs when they cut to

1789
01:54:24,361 --> 01:54:29,040
the crowd and like, oh Geez, I hope
this hundred million guy can do it.

1790
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:33,900
If he doesn't do it, maybe to share
her, we'll deal with you fucking cunt.

1791
01:54:33,901 --> 01:54:37,470
You know, I hit about the fucking Yankees.
Whoever beats them the year before,

1792
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,360
whoever their best guy
is within two years,

1793
01:54:39,361 --> 01:54:43,380
he's on the team to share a beat them
last year with the fucking angels.

1794
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:47,760
Now he's on playing first base.
I've already bitched about this shit.

1795
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:51,720
Who gives a fuck? Right?
It's just fucking baseball.

1796
01:54:51,721 --> 01:54:54,270
You know what I've been actually doing,
I've been watching the NHL network.

1797
01:54:55,110 --> 01:55:00,110
I actually just watched something about
the 1979 Montreal Canadians winning the

1798
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:00,241
Stanley Cup.

1799
01:55:00,241 --> 01:55:02,910
You know what the worst thing about
watching the kid and he's winning the

1800
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:03,743
Stanley Cup back then,

1801
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:07,530
is you knew that there was going to be
some sort of heartbreaking Boston Bruins

1802
01:55:07,531 --> 01:55:11,700
loss and 79 I was too
young to remember it,

1803
01:55:11,701 --> 01:55:13,290
but I just remember
people bitching about it.

1804
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:16,200
We basically beat the
Canadians for games to three.

1805
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:20,520
And then with like a minute left,
they called too many men on the ice,

1806
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:23,490
which is basically,
uh,

1807
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:28,980
I'm trying to think of the
fucking, it's, it's, you know,

1808
01:55:28,981 --> 01:55:32,490
like in football when somebody a kicks,

1809
01:55:33,070 --> 01:55:37,020
because somebody calls for a fair catch
and you've got to give like five yards,

1810
01:55:37,021 --> 01:55:39,690
you gotta give the guy five yards.
So he can catch it and I, you know,

1811
01:55:39,691 --> 01:55:40,830
people break it all the time.

1812
01:55:40,831 --> 01:55:44,160
They never call it if the other defensive
player gets in face that that's like

1813
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:44,580
calling,

1814
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:48,570
making that call with one minute left
to decide who goes to the Stanley Cup

1815
01:55:48,571 --> 01:55:49,404
finals.

1816
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:55,080
And then the fucking flying French Fox
ended up scoring a goal and then they got

1817
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:59,010
the overtime goal. It was just fucking
annoying. It was annoying to watch,

1818
01:55:59,011 --> 01:56:03,300
but they did beat the rangers.
So that made me feel good. Um,

1819
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:05,670
I think that's it guys.
I can't find this fucking thing.

1820
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:12,170
This guy did a remix of that song, uh,
that, that, that data bup, bup, bup,

1821
01:56:12,171 --> 01:56:15,910
bup, Berlin heart, heart hat.
He did a remix of that. Me
saying [inaudible] can't,

1822
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,750
can't and I thought it was
cute and I just, I, for me,

1823
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:25,370
I can't find it. What was better? The fact
I just sang it for you was that decent.

1824
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:31,080
All right. I give up. That's it. Jesus
Christ. What a fucking horrific podcasts.

1825
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:34,020
But you know what? I did get it
out Monday morning. You know what?

1826
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:35,010
I want to thank everybody.
I am.

1827
01:56:35,011 --> 01:56:39,120
We've been getting a ton of emails about
people got a letter from a postman who

1828
01:56:39,121 --> 01:56:43,110
just walks around listening to my podcast
as he delivers the mail laughing like

1829
01:56:43,111 --> 01:56:45,000
a maniac.
That's what everybody keeps telling me.

1830
01:56:45,001 --> 01:56:49,170
They keep listening to them when they're
supposed to be doing their job and

1831
01:56:49,171 --> 01:56:51,930
they're just sitting there laughing
like a fucking maniac. So why?

1832
01:56:51,931 --> 01:56:54,570
I know this one was a little fucked up.
The volume was messed up,

1833
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:57,210
but that's what you get.
That's what she get.

1834
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:00,000
Somebody sent me an email going
like, you know what? I'm so pissed.

1835
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:05,001
I've been listening to Opie and Anthony
for awhile and I had no idea that you a

1836
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:07,320
podcast. What the fuck? This
is what he said. He said,

1837
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:11,700
I've been a fan for several years.
Uh, duty. Your appearances on the OPN,

1838
01:57:11,701 --> 01:57:14,910
Anthony show a being the
lazy shitbag than I am.

1839
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:17,100
I've never checked out your
website until a week ago.

1840
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:20,940
How has the podcast not mentioned
on Opie and Anthony? They actually,

1841
01:57:20,941 --> 01:57:25,110
they have mentioned it, but he said,
do they forbid that or something? No,

1842
01:57:25,111 --> 01:57:27,960
they do not. But he said, I guess
it's none of my business anyway,

1843
01:57:27,961 --> 01:57:30,870
but I'm pisses me off. You've been
doing it this long, two plus years,

1844
01:57:30,871 --> 01:57:32,370
and now I'm just finding out about it.

1845
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:35,310
I've already listened to the last three
months of podcast and we'll continue

1846
01:57:35,311 --> 01:57:39,450
back until I've heard
them all. Um, you're,

1847
01:57:39,451 --> 01:57:42,990
you're a really funny guy and it's a
shame this podcast is flying under the

1848
01:57:42,991 --> 01:57:47,700
radar. Well, I say this to you. It is not
a shame that it's flying under the radar.

1849
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:51,450
I liked that. It is, I don't hype it.
You find it, you find it. If you don't,

1850
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:56,540
it's like fight club. Right. Except
you don't have to be a bad ass.

1851
01:57:58,130 --> 01:58:02,750
First rule about the podcast is not
that you don't talk about it. All right.

1852
01:58:02,751 --> 01:58:06,290
You know what the first rule is? Is that
you don't take the podcast seriously.

1853
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:08,151
That's what it is.

1854
01:58:08,151 --> 01:58:12,380
Like this fucking guy tore me a new
asshole about rugby because I was shitting

1855
01:58:12,381 --> 01:58:16,300
on rugby. This fucking guy sends me
this whole, we are a few weeks ago,

1856
01:58:16,301 --> 01:58:20,440
he made some disparaging remarks about
rugby is compared to American football.

1857
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:25,660
Every stop to think about how look
illogical and ludicrous it is to call it

1858
01:58:25,661 --> 01:58:29,950
football when you don't use your food.
He's giving me like Jerry Seinfeld Shit.

1859
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:31,000
If memory serves,

1860
01:58:31,001 --> 01:58:34,630
you said something to the effect that
those rugby pussies would be getting,

1861
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:38,530
wouldn't be getting up if ray Lewis
put a hit on him. You know what dude,

1862
01:58:38,531 --> 01:58:41,620
I stand by that statement, but
uh, I know I already you email,

1863
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:45,280
but for all you fucking limey cuts
over there and fucking England.

1864
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:50,550
The reason why shit on rugby was because
the English cont who wrote me was

1865
01:58:50,801 --> 01:58:52,840
shitting all over a
fucking American sports.

1866
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:54,850
So obviously you're not
gonna treat me with respect.

1867
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:59,080
I'm going to make fun of fucking
rugby and your little booty short,

1868
01:58:59,081 --> 01:59:01,900
Larry Bird short shorts from
the 19 fucking eighties,

1869
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:06,240
and how every fucking 10 minutes. You
have to basically stick your head up some,

1870
01:59:06,241 --> 01:59:06,450
uh,
uh,

1871
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:10,960
somebody else's ass as you guys tried
to do that elephant trick of kicking the

1872
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:15,940
ball out the back. Totally respect rugby.
I think it's a fucking awesome game.

1873
01:59:15,941 --> 01:59:20,530
I've seen it on TV. It is the shit
and they have literally bone jarring.

1874
01:59:20,531 --> 01:59:24,550
Lose your filling fucking hits all the
time. I do think it's a great sport.

1875
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:26,530
I do think people are tough,
but you know,

1876
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:28,330
if you're going to shit
on American football,

1877
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:31,030
I'm going to shit all over your sports.
That's how it works.

1878
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:35,080
Please do not take the podcast seriously.
I don't fucking read.

1879
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:39,850
I do it by myself. As you can tell what
the different levels of volume this week,

1880
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:45,100
I'm not organized. All right? So that's
the one and only rule. All right.

1881
01:59:45,101 --> 01:59:49,840
Don't take it seriously. And if you can
remember, tell somebody in if not, don't,

1882
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:53,170
because I think the smaller
this thing stays the cooler,

1883
01:59:53,171 --> 01:59:56,680
it's going to be named one fucking
thing that has blown up and,

1884
01:59:56,790 --> 02:00:01,540
and stayed at the same level of
quality. It doesn't, it doesn't,

1885
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:04,990
you know, you want, I want it to
be like this. I want to fucking,

1886
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:09,460
I'm gonna be down in the
Fox hole. You know, if I,

1887
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:12,540
if I had this thing actually ever
fucking blew up and I'm, and I'm,

1888
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:16,660
and I'm doing rants about
saying unacceptable, then
these fucking other cons.

1889
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:19,540
We'll figure out that. That's what
we're saying. We're saying unacceptable.

1890
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:25,030
Then the whole game plan is over and then
what I'm doing here is fucking useless.

1891
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:27,310
Right.
Wow.

1892
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:31,360
Did I just go off in a fantasy there where
this thing became the biggest fucking

1893
02:00:31,361 --> 02:00:34,390
radio show ever? I think
I just did. You know,

1894
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:36,400
that's what happens when
you sit here by yourself.

1895
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:40,360
You'll let your dreams leak out and
then people make funny and then you feel

1896
02:00:40,361 --> 02:00:43,270
silly. Um, all right. That's
the podcast for this week.

1897
02:00:43,271 --> 02:00:46,510
That was a fucking mess.
All right.

1898
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,690
It was a fucking mess.
I'm going to, you know,

1899
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:53,410
I think it kinda got back on the rails
afterwards, but it was a mess. You guys,

1900
02:00:53,411 --> 02:00:56,530
if we were on ESPN first came out and
they should sell those fucking rednecks,

1901
02:00:56,930 --> 02:01:01,210
they'd race in the mood. Remember that
they turned their tractors into these, uh,

1902
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:03,370
I dunno what the fuck they were,
but they would,

1903
02:01:03,371 --> 02:01:05,290
they would race through the mugged.
You'd get bogged down.

1904
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:09,490
That's what the fuck it was.
I was at redneck sitting
in that tractor in the mud.

1905
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,490
I like how I had to explain that. It
sucked. Like he didn't fucking notice.

1906
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:15,910
That's it.
All you guys have a great fucking week.

1907
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:21,400
And um, that's it. That's the
podcast for this week. And I've,

1908
02:01:21,401 --> 02:01:22,234
uh,

1909
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:26,080
talked myself into a corner once again
because I usually end with have a great

1910
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:28,540
week.
That's what I usually say.

1911
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:32,560
And then I continue talking and now here
I am down in the fucking murder again.

1912
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:36,850
Um, hey, has anybody seen that
come? I'm sorry to keep talking.

1913
02:01:36,851 --> 02:01:39,310
If you guys seen that commercial
where they got the fucking, uh,

1914
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,560
they're trying to help you out
of that financial, you know,

1915
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:47,000
all these people in financial
difficulties. Um, AH, fuck.

1916
02:01:47,001 --> 02:01:49,430
That's what I was going to talk about.
God dammit.

1917
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:54,020
No one's listening at this point. I'm
going to, I'm going to waste this story.

1918
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:55,730
I went to the supermarket.
Okay.

1919
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:59,310
And I don't wanna I don't use those
little savy save cards that they have.

1920
02:01:59,311 --> 02:02:03,620
Do you ever a little savvy saved card? And
I always say no. Would you like one? No,

1921
02:02:03,621 --> 02:02:04,454
I wouldn't.

1922
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:05,460
Okay.

1923
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:08,430
You know, because basically what
you're doing as a free fucking survey,

1924
02:02:08,431 --> 02:02:10,560
remember that shit so they can figure
it out. What you can't live without.

1925
02:02:10,561 --> 02:02:14,160
So they can jack up the price of that
food and then give you like nickel off of

1926
02:02:14,161 --> 02:02:18,210
like their version of corn
flakes. So I went in there, okay.

1927
02:02:18,211 --> 02:02:21,000
And they asked me if I had to sit in
their little safe card and I said no.

1928
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:23,610
And he said, do you want one? I said,
no. And The lady goes, it's okay,

1929
02:02:23,611 --> 02:02:25,110
I'll just punch in a code anyways.

1930
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:28,320
So she punches in a code
and I get money off anyways.

1931
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:33,560
So it's like they even figured out a way
to figure out what I'm fucking buying

1932
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:37,080
even when I'm saying go fuck
yourself to the safe thing.

1933
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,080
So I think the only way to
get around it at this point,

1934
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,990
I'm going to try it next time is I'm
going to walk in with cash and just have

1935
02:02:42,991 --> 02:02:47,730
cash and see what the fuck they do.
You know, they did it to me today,

1936
02:02:47,731 --> 02:02:48,211
it may see.

1937
02:02:48,211 --> 02:02:52,230
So I went out there and I bought some
towels and I bought some beer glasses.

1938
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:57,090
That's what I bought Macy's. And they say,
do you ever, do you have a Macy's card?

1939
02:02:57,270 --> 02:03:02,190
I said, no, I don't. We'll
give you 25% off every douchey
thing you bought. I said,

1940
02:03:02,191 --> 02:03:05,910
that's okay. And she goes, it's all
right. I'll give you the discount anyways.

1941
02:03:05,911 --> 02:03:07,560
And she types in this fucking code.

1942
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:09,240
Yeah,

1943
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:12,690
I dunno what they're up to.
I really don't know what they're up to,

1944
02:03:12,691 --> 02:03:15,180
but I know they don't sit around
trying to make less money.

1945
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:17,400
Does anybody know what
the fuck that's about?

1946
02:03:17,401 --> 02:03:20,100
That is your homework for this week.
If you still listened,

1947
02:03:20,370 --> 02:03:21,810
if you listened this far,

1948
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:26,160
you fucking hate your job and you
need to get a new one. All right?

1949
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:30,880
Don't hurt anybody at work. All right,
that's it. Now I'm done. Everyone.

1950
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,300
You have a good week.
I'll talk to you next week.

1951
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,390
Ooh.

1952
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:02,853
Oh.

1953
02:05:55,470 --> 02:06:00,470
[inaudible].
