1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,380
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:06,830
It's bill still and it's time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,830
March six,

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,260
2017 what's going on everybody?
I am in Phoenix, Arizona.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,080
Um, isn't that exciting? Phoenix, Arizona.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,690
Um, but actually gives man, I'm psyched.

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm working at standup live doing two
shows tonight, two shows, Tuesday,

8
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,360
two shows Wednesday. Um, um,

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,810
you know, putting together my new hour
and everything and I got a bunch of shit.

10
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:37,810
I've actually been listening
to my act. I always, you know,

11
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:40,690
when I'm putting together a
new hour, oh, I always record.

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,370
I just never fucking listen.
Well now I'm finally listening to my act.

13
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,020
I figured it out when I can do it cause I,

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,670
who the fuck wants to sit there and listen
to yourself, but I'm doing is I'm a,

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,340
I listened to it on the car ride home.

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,880
Yeah.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,130
You know, if I had a decent set, if I had
a shitty set, what's the fucking point?

18
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:03,710
You know what I mean? It's Kinda like
if you're always taping you, your team,

19
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:07,610
right. But you only watch if they win.
You know? I know people who do that shit.

20
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:10,520
They'd like know what the fuck happens
before they watch and if they lose,

21
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,840
they just don't even fucking watch.

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,740
So I've actually been watching
and that type of shit. And uh,

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
speaking of which your team winning and
losing all freckles came in last night

24
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:25,980
and I went to the Phoenix Suns were
playing, my boss did sell decks.

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,830
So I decide, you know what, I'm
going to go to that game, right?

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,440
My hundred and 17th fucking
franchise professional home team.

27
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:40,310
I've spot ever professional sports team
that I've seen a home game of hundred

28
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:44,270
and fucking 17 of these mother fuckers.
I got 10 more to go.

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,090
I can't get out any 10 every time I get
to 10 and I'm like, go one more team.

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,140
I'll fucking,

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,250
then I'll have nine left and somebody
moves and how I got down to 10 I'm like,

32
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:59,180
all right, the next one's going to get me
down to nine and then the fucking ramp,

33
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,990
the rams move back up to 11 right?

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,800
So then I go see the thunder and I'm
thinking, all right, look man, I'm down.

35
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,450
I'm down to fucking,
I'm down to nine and I'm like,

36
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:12,284
wait a minute.

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,280
Okay,

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,113
wait a minute.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,510
Okay.

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,030
I saw the New Jersey Nets.
I never saw the Brooklyn Nets,

41
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,240
so it's still 10 so I'm
like, all right, next week,

42
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,600
next week when I go see the sun's,
I'll be down to 19th left. Right.

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,420
So I'm sitting there watching
the signs and I'm like, Z,

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm down to single digits.
The Fan Slam is going down.

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,230
One of the loneliest accomplishments ever,

46
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,160
I guess if you went with
a bunch of other people,

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,270
I got to find the old pictures of me
at these stadiums. I swear to God,

48
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:46,830
they're all like disposable camera
pictures held by a stranger. Um,

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,390
you know,

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,840
when I was doing all these fucking gigs
in the middle of nowhere and shit. Yeah,

51
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,380
I pass through the major cities.
I would just go to a Goddamn game anyways.

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,380
So last night I'm thinking, all right,
I'm going to the sun's Celtics game.

53
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll have nine teams left. And I'm like,
wait a minute, the fucking charger.

54
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:06,400
It's just moved to Los Angeles.
So

55
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:07,900
yeah.

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,360
And then a month I'm working in San
Antonio and I'm going to a spurs game,

57
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,670
go on to the fucking spurs and then
I think I'll finally be down to nine.

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,640
You know, God forbid if the
fucking Raiders don't move
to Vegas after that. Um,

59
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,400
but anyways, I uh, I went
to the suns game, right?

60
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,450
Okay.

61
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,170
So I show up immediately. Um, the
club hooked us up with tickets,

62
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,370
gave us great texts who was sitting two
rows, find the fucking, one of the, uh,

63
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,820
what do you call it in basketball?
One of the nets, one of the goals,

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,810
one of the back boards,
right? Two, two rows back.

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,350
So it's really three rows back cause I
got all the fucking camera man, you know,

66
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,900
but still it's a great seats.

67
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,540
And I looked down on the right and is
this guy just riding the reps in the,

68
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,730
in the first quarter and
he really gives a shit.

69
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,460
So I'm looking at version and I'm just
looking over going to look at this

70
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,970
fucking, this guy's out of his mind.
There's a guy who gives a shit.

71
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:07,900
This is a hardcore season ticket
holder, man. Would come at you.

72
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,170
I'm laughing like he's just like,
he knows the refs names.

73
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,490
He's calling them out and all that shit
and version. He starts going on. He goes,

74
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:19,510
I bet that's the owner. I'm like, Nah, I'm
on. The owner wouldn't be sitting down.

75
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,760
He wouldn't be yelling like that if
he was the owner. And he's like, well,

76
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,110
Mark Cuban brides, the refs
like, Dad, I gotta get the
fuck out of here. So finally,

77
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,350
you know, I go, I man, I'm going
to look this guy up, right? So we,

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,970
we look them up and it's the owner.

79
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,320
I got to tell you, Phoenix Suns, dude,
you guys got a great fucking owner.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,170
Uh, Robert Sarver is his name meant we
ended up talking to them at the end of the

81
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:47,840
game because I tweeted a,
I was making fun of 'em.

82
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,150
What's his face? His shoes, his sneakers,

83
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:54,970
the fucking worst sneakers
I've ever fucking seen. Um,

84
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,310
Kelly Olynyk,
the big white goof,

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,630
the seven foot fucking pylon out there,
right?

86
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,270
I don't, I, you know, Celtics love that
guy. He got so many God, their meds.

87
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,000
Maybe it's a road trip or whatever, but
do this. He had these fucking sneakers on,

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,880
I think Garrow your premium warm in the,

89
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:21,490
that fucking Superbowl
against the Redskins when he
fucked up the field goal too.

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,001
They were like,

91
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,600
they looked like black football cleats
from the early seventies the ugliest

92
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:30,310
fucking things ever seen. So of course
I tweet about, that's why I get,

93
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,460
so I tweeted about the thing and I guess
the owner's son was watching. He goes,

94
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,320
oh, he's probably sitting right
next to you, blah blah blah.

95
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,870
That's how I didn't meet the guy.
But anyways, long story short,

96
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,340
so I tweet about this fucking thanks.

97
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,920
Making fun of the guy's sneakers thinking
obviously these has to be the worst

98
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,590
fucking sneakers.
Without a doubt.

99
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,250
Even with the Internet,
even with Twitter,

100
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
even with all of these fucking
concept or on social media,

101
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,940
nobody can argue with the thesis, the
ugliest fucking sneakers ever. Right?

102
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,320
They will low tops,

103
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,940
fucking steel goal kicker cleats from
the fucking early seventies right.

104
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,320
And all these sneaker heads.
So like you mean,

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,100
you mean the Colby 11

106
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,680
I guess just to Coby Brian Seek.

107
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,390
And what because it says Colby on it.

108
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:25,391
All of a sudden the Colbys do do you
mean the shack 14 I fucking hate sneaker

109
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:33,581
heads of fucking can't stay at home with
the 5,000 fucking pairs of sneakers,

110
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,480
taking them out of the box, showing them
off on MTV cribs and licking the soul.

111
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,350
So it's like, you see, I never, I
never even wore these joints before.

112
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,190
Yeah. I can tell from your fucking man
tick she never worn before this sneakers.

113
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,660
Why don't you go take a fucking walking
him Bruce? He's a big sneaker head.

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,920
I'll tell you, you know what?
It is fucking overrated.
It's so fucking overrated.

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,060
Jordans.

116
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,430
Okay.

117
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,930
You know what I mean? I'm not saying
they're not good looking. Some of them,

118
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,920
most of them are fucking
ugly as shit and dude,

119
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,640
the fucking mouth breathing dope.
Maybe that's what it is.

120
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,850
See of fuck. Oh Jeez,
I'm walking around now.

121
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm walking through the amount of
fucking dope that we're Jordans.

122
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,850
You know what it is about Jordans? It's,
you don't even have to fucking think.

123
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,390
You know what I mean? Oh, you
gotta do is get a pair of Jordans.

124
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,370
You know everybody's gonna like,
oh, y'all are those. The six is,

125
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,860
are those the Jordan six
is to look at these six.

126
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,940
I've got him with the black, with
the gold outline. Yo Dee Dee Dee Dee.

127
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,780
These sneakers are crazy,
right? These things are crazy.

128
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,330
You know,
I don't know.

129
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,250
Fucking mouth breathing Morin's with the
Goddamn sweatpants and they're Jordans.

130
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,390
You know, first he's a big
Jordan Guy. He loves Jordans.

131
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:55,330
See what he's wearing a pair of this week.
They've fucking ugly as shit.

132
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
They're all black.

133
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:01,880
And then they got like this white wall
tire thing down it just because it says,

134
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,970
George, I'm going to go, oh, Paul was to
check out these new George. You're like,

135
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:09,620
am I go? No, I actually, I don't. And
he can't understand. He goes, we did,

136
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:14,410
but they did their Jordans through
these, these, these are Jordan ones.

137
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,210
It's like, dude, don't give
a fuck if the Jordan Knight,

138
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,290
I'm so sick of the numbers.

139
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,193
Yeah,

140
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,570
do what's your favorite Jordans? You like
to seven's really? You like to sevens,

141
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,530
but you got to make sure that that it,
it just says Nike on the back.

142
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:31,320
If it has him on the back,
then those aren't the real ones.

143
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,310
The Colby 11

144
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,000
like what do you guys think
that if you fucking put them on,

145
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,590
you somehow going to be able to dunk.

146
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,890
You're going to score close to 80 points
in a fucking NBA game cause you're

147
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:51,560
wearing Colbys
the Sundale three seven.

148
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay.

149
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,100
I Dunno, I, I don't understand any,

150
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,790
if a fucking sneaker's ugly,
it's ugly. I don't give a shit.

151
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,410
I cannot fucking book.
If you guys,

152
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:05,620
you have to go on and you have to look
at a picture of those fucking sneakers.

153
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,010
They like referee sneakers from
the fucking early eighties.

154
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,200
It's just a black low top fucking
slipper with the Nike swoosh on it.

155
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah.

156
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,970
Do you mean the Kobe 11 dude,
the Colby of,

157
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,390
of fucking crazy. The crazy Tony.

158
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,380
You get yourself,

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
you get yourself a fucking tracksuit and
you put on a pair of those dude over.

160
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,990
Oh, you go out to the club people,
people that, oh, are those the sixes?

161
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,110
I, I don't, I just don't understand
fucking basketball sneakers. Okay.

162
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,380
Some of our good looking,
some of them aren't they?

163
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,090
They drive me up the fucking wall fall
versus the funniest fucking human being

164
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,370
I've ever met in my life. Like
he's, he sees one of these guys,

165
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:00,160
like I love him to death,
but the shit that he likes it,

166
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,830
he likes obvious shit.

167
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,440
Okay.

168
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,170
It'd be like, dude, you know what I like?
You know what I like? I like amenities.

169
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,590
It's like, really dude, you like getting
extra shit, extra comforting shit.

170
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:17,070
That's amazing. You know, I never
really thought about that. I don't know.

171
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,140
I have to think about this to do.
I like amenities.

172
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,740
You know what I liked Paul? I like a
lack thereof. I like less than like,

173
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,900
who ever say to do you know
what? You know, what do,

174
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,090
is there anything better than pizza?

175
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,350
Is there anything better
than a great slice of pizza?
Dude, you know what I like?

176
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,460
I like a Bologna Sandwich Dude.

177
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,400
A Bologna Sandwich with white American
cheese and mustard due to the mustard

178
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,540
puts it over the top. It's
crazy. It's a joke. I mean, hey,

179
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,100
it's literally a joke.

180
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,983
I Dunno.

181
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,720
So it's like, does it even need, we say,
of course it's a Bologna Sandwich. Yeah,

182
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,940
it's fucking hits the spot.
Yeah.

183
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,093
Yeah.

184
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,910
Full mainstream. Do, do you know
what I like? You know I like,

185
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,590
I like a golden retriever.

186
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,600
Okay.

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,120
Do you know what's crazy?
A white picket fence.

188
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,830
I'm sorry, I got to get him
back on this podcast cause I w

189
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,320
yeah,

190
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,880
partner calls him Mr Maxim. Cause
everything that he likes, it's like,

191
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,310
it's,
he likes what everybody likes,

192
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:31,020
but then she's got this simplistic fucking
great philosophy. We're who'd be like,

193
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:34,290
Bill a bill.
What's wrong?

194
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,760
What's wrong with sweat pants? You
know, you can't argue with them.

195
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,090
I actually had, there's, there's nothing
wrong with it. It's just, you know,

196
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:46,450
the conversation. It's just like,
it's just doesn't need to be,

197
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,990
most of the conversation just
doesn't even need to be had.

198
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,750
Was there anything better than
just walking around in sweatpants?

199
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,720
Dude,

200
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,720
you put on a pair of sweatpants with
some Jordan threes over over to what is

201
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:09,720
better than having on a hoodie and
a pair of Kobe 11. [inaudible].

202
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,370
You go to a massage parlor and
she's jerking your deck. I mean,

203
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,130
am am I crazy? It's so it, it's,
it's showing. It's a literally,

204
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:25,630
it's a joke.
All right.

205
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm sorry.
Fuck all you sneaker heads out there.

206
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,740
God bless you with your
little fucking hobby. Uh,

207
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,060
keeping your sneakers clean and you know,

208
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:38,110
fucking walking on your heels anytime
there's any sort of rubbish on the ground.

209
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,460
Grown fucking man.
Just walking like a God duck on the heels.

210
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,300
Okay.

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,720
Hey Buddy, what the fuck are
you do? I got on the seven,

212
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,760
what is it?
The first day of school,

213
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,890
Dude, you know what I
love? You know what I love?

214
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,010
Is there anything better than
when it snows on Christmas?

215
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,670
That's the type of shit he says. It's
like, no. Yeah, that's great. Paul.

216
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,810
I think everybody's pretty much in
agreement. I even the Jewish people,

217
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:14,820
like if it snows on Christmas,
you know what I mean?

218
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,970
It probably adds to their Chinese
food. I don't, where could,

219
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:21,600
a fob doesn't like a fresh blanket of
snow as long as it isn't a goddamn store.

220
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,720
Do,
do you know what I like amenities.

221
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Is there anything better than
taking a steam? Uh, no. I mean,

222
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,260
you know, that's also, that is a great
thing that everyone is in agreement with.

223
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,680
You know what I like,
dude, I like fresh air.

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,200
Is there anything better than like non
polluted air when you breathe in? I mean,

225
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:52,890
it's crazy. It's a g, it's
literally, it's a joke.

226
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,630
Um, Jesus, I went on a
fucking tangent there.

227
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,990
Oh my God. For half a second. I
thought the recorder wasn't recording.

228
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,930
I forgot my fucking microphone. So
this might sound a little bit, dude.

229
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,980
He say anything better than just laying
in your bed and just waking up and doing

230
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:15,830
your podcast. I mean it's,
it's literally, it's, it's,

231
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:19,670
it's a joke. You know, I have to
look up these fucking sneakers.

232
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,260
How the Fuck Colby Bryant, one of
the greatest fucking top of what two,

233
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,440
three players of all time,
individual players, teammate.

234
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,320
He was a fucking nightmare. Um, you wait
til that fucking confessional comes up.

235
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,753
Um,

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,180
okay.

237
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,010
When you sit there, put in my
password here. Stupid Laker fans.

238
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,400
So we chant MVP at the guy.

239
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,970
I hate that Celtic fans are chanting
MVP at Isaiah Thomas. By the way,

240
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,010
it reminds me of Laker
fans that were always,

241
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:48,940
every time fucking Coby stepped on the
court and did not pass the ball and

242
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:51,540
scored 40 fucking points
and they lose again

243
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,920
and they have the bay.
Um,

244
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,450
did you see him dunk on that guy
and then they lost? Oh my God,

245
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,440
he's unbelievable.

246
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,090
Maybe if we get 58 free agents
in here and fucking Phil Jackson,

247
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:10,530
they can win a title
and VP. All right. Um,

248
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,830
not what he's doing. He's wearing the
Colby. So he's wearing the Colby loved.

249
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,040
I have to look these fucking sneakers up.
How ugly these God damn things are.

250
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,840
And the fact that these pockets,
sneaker heads, you mean the Colbys?

251
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,330
I mean the rep sneakers,
those fucking cleats just wearing,

252
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,890
he looks like fucking Ken
Stabler out there. Kobe 11.

253
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,410
You cannot tell me that this fucking, the
computer doesn't listen to you. Oh my,

254
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,540
those are fucking dancing slippers.
Jesus. At least he got the best.

255
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,710
He got the best color.

256
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,970
They come and pink becoming red and white.
They got a Miami dolphin color.

257
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,140
Do those literally looked
like women's sneakers? Like

258
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:56,920
okay,

259
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,010
you should have like the low cut socks
with the little ball on the back if you

260
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:01,600
were those fucking things.
And I'm looking at, look,

261
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,200
look at the 100 and $1,230

262
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,720
I bet.

263
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,460
I bet if I went on youtube and this guy
and I looked up Colby 11 I bet there's

264
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:16,220
some fucking asshole sitting
there licking the fuck.

265
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:20,110
Who was a guy fat Joe did that
and his MTV cribs and he got,

266
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,290
he had like chick off.
He's like the fucking Jordans.

267
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,640
Six sixth and then he licked the
bottom of them. It's like, do,

268
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:27,710
do you realize the sweatshop? But
those things were fucking Baden. Okay,

269
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,430
okay.

270
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,010
And you think those things didn't hit
the ground in there and God knows they

271
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:32,520
probably don't.

272
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,850
They probably eat those people go to
the bathroom at the fucking station and

273
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:38,280
you're going to lick the
bottom of those damn sneakers.

274
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,010
They were in a hermetically
sealed sneaker box. Dude.

275
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:47,700
They were in a cardboard box and were
shipped over here from the other side of

276
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,800
the world.
I think I'll put my tongue on them.

277
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,300
All right. I'm going to look this up.
I'm going to see if I can find that.

278
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,390
I'm going to find a fucking video here.
Coby 11th all right. I don't know why,

279
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,710
but of the first video that came up said
exploding poo and a guy had shit on his

280
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:06,140
face. No, I didn't think they
did that type of stuff on fucking

281
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:07,370
okay.

282
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,610
Coby 11 shoes.
All right,

283
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,520
and some asshole's going
to do a fucking review.

284
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,640
Yeah.

285
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,950
Nike Colby 11 Performance Review through.

286
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,700
These are the ugliest fucking
sneakers I've ever seen in my life.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,770
These ones are actually worse.

288
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,090
Coby Brian gives the Bron James
his autograph shoes. Yeah.

289
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,660
God. What the fuck did they talk about
other than winning championships?

290
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,663
Okay.

291
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,290
That'd be like listening to the fucking
superman and like fucking Batman talking.

292
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,240
All right. Colby gives away shoes to
a fan. He was a shit all over the guy.

293
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,590
He's like the nicest guy ever.

294
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,940
Colby helps a bus load of sick children
get to the staples center by towing it

295
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:54,810
with his own body and his Colby
11th. All right, maybe I was wrong.

296
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,580
Um, Nike, Kobe, I gotta get
off this fucking subject.

297
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,040
What am I listen to some guy do
a fucking review of the sneakers.

298
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,690
Nike Colby 11 performance overview.
My initial thoughts.

299
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,760
I fucking love Youtube. Well, it gives us,

300
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,380
I guess you guys are
listening to my thoughts,

301
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,490
but I'm just being a fucking
moron. Anyway, let's get
back to the Goddamn game.

302
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,840
All right,
so Kelly,

303
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:20,160
a Lennox out there and is Colby
11 do they will fucking crazy,

304
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,211
dude.

305
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:25,990
You get a seven foot white
guy and Kobe 11 [inaudible].

306
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,860
It's all, it's all, I mean,

307
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:32,220
the black guys is still going to go right
around them and have their nuts in his

308
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:36,170
face when they dunk on it, but I mean
his, his feet from the ankles down, it's,

309
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:40,300
it's, it's all, it's going to be a
stitch of Joe. It's literally a joke. Um,

310
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,070
all right. Anyways, so we
got, we watched this game.

311
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,210
The owner of the sons is a fucking riot.
Um,

312
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,870
totally just watching him ride in
the referees, like old school guy,

313
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,120
you know, right down there on the court
watching the game and uh, you know,

314
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:00,690
he's not about some luxury box or
anything like that. Right. So anyway,

315
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,810
so we're watching the game
and the Celtics come out flat,

316
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,810
which you knew they were Gunna,
you knew they were Gunna,

317
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,220
cause they just beat the Lakers anytime.
I'm telling you this right now, gamblers,

318
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,270
gamblers,

319
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,270
anytime the any Boston
team, right? The why,

320
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,750
well I'd say the Bruins are the fucking
uh, Celtics going that west coast trip.

321
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,060
Okay. If you want to make some money,
bet against them the day after they play,

322
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,970
either the clippers,
the kings of the Lakers,

323
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,590
cause they fucking go to la.
And after the game they all go out.

324
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,870
They Bang a bunch of fucking broads,

325
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,840
a bunch of fucking actresses or
whatever the fuck it is they do.

326
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,070
And then the next game when they go to
San Jose, down to Anaheim, out to Phoenix,

327
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:47,640
up to Portland, whatever the fuck they
go next, there's always a let down.

328
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,840
So the Celtics come out flat, the
fucking son's are all over him. Um,

329
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,000
love of the guard was on the sons
was just as fast it seems as Isaiah.

330
00:19:57,001 --> 00:20:00,810
So he was right up on them. Um,
frustrating the hell out of them.

331
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:04,800
And Isaiah had to think for
files in the first half. And um,

332
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,060
so we're watching the game and I'm
just going like, I fucking knew it.

333
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm so excited to finally see this team.
I've been watching,

334
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,260
seen almost every game of this year and
they'd come out flat. I'm like, Oh man,

335
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:20,250
am I really going to the fucking
hangover game? Ah, what do I give a shit?

336
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,800
I got three fucking tickets would still,
you know,

337
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,840
it's a bunch of Celtics fans there.

338
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,430
They're all going fucking
nuts and everything.

339
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:27,600
We had like nothing to cheer about.

340
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,310
I think we were down by like
10 after the first half. Um,

341
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,930
and we just start chipping away, chipping
away, chipping away. First half was ugly.

342
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,003
I mean it was like a,

343
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,310
it was like a first quarter score
with like four minutes to go.

344
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:46,290
It was like 32 27 it seemed, maybe it was
like six minutes ago. So what the half,

345
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,730
I think they were both didn't the
forties. I don't even remember. And uh,

346
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:53,880
and I said Paul Jokingly, I go, you watch
the boats going to score over a hundred,

347
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:54,870
they're going to eat up or whatever.

348
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,510
So of course they come out and
everybody starts hitting their shots.

349
00:20:57,511 --> 00:21:00,470
It turns into this great game.
Um,

350
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,850
yeah.

351
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,730
And then the fourth quarter comes and
we start chipping away, chipping away,

352
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,420
chipping away with down by like 10
or 11 and then went down by eight,

353
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,670
then went down by five and then
without my, for next thing you know,

354
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:16,170
we're up by like two. So you guys all
know how the fucking game ends, right?

355
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,440
Okay.

356
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,000
We fucking missed what's
his face? Uh, Brown ms,

357
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:24,320
that foul shot and Isaiah,

358
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:28,430
Mr. Foul shot that would
have fucking ice tea and a,

359
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:32,180
we let them hang around, hang around
and fucking hang around. In the end.

360
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:36,090
I came up with was tired and we were up
by one. It all happened. So you know what?

361
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,370
It happened so fucking fast.

362
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:40,850
When you're at the game and you don't
have an announcer holding your hand and

363
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,800
you don't have something that
you can actually look at,

364
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,370
there's too much shit to look at. So
we go to inbound. The fucking ball.

365
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,800
Yeah,

366
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,530
right. This guy goes around Jae
Crowder, I think tied it up.

367
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,240
We'll like SLAAC right.
That's right.

368
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:55,870
We were up by two instead of being up by
three and force him to take a three and

369
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:58,050
they probably would have missed
a fucking thing. That's right.

370
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:02,140
And the guy goes right around, Crowder
lays it in, crowd's going nuts.

371
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:05,950
There's like four seconds left to go high
and they can try to get into I Isaiah

372
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,270
Thomas. Let's see what happens. We
fucking inbound the ball. Isaiah,

373
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,840
one of the only times I've seen a
mess up this year messed up the past.

374
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:15,160
Who's kind of looking up court,
you know,

375
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,190
cause there's only four seconds
left before he caught the ball.

376
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,040
They kick it out to this fucking dude.
What the hell was his name?

377
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,080
I actually wrote it down so I would
give him the respect he deserves.

378
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:26,940
Tyler ulous,

379
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,320
they kick it out to him and he hits a
fucking three point or at the buzzer to

380
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:35,590
beat the Celtics. And here's the
thing, I had second row fucking seats.

381
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,540
And guess what? I didn't even see
the play. It happened on my end.

382
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,590
You know why? Because the
fucking assholes who are in the,

383
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,490
they're in the front fucking row.

384
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,640
They inbound the ball and
they could see that, you know?

385
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,720
Okay.

386
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,840
Um, Thomas was, was fucking
it up. They stand up.

387
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,780
You read the Front fucking rob,
what are you standing up for?

388
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,320
There's nothing in front of you.
You fucking cons.

389
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,740
And all of a sudden I just saw the
ball go to the net and everybody goes,

390
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:11,280
and where the horn goes off, everybody
goes nuts. I go, what the fuck

391
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,540
does that count? Did that just go
with what the fuck just happened?

392
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,770
I had to go home to watch the replay
to see what the fuck happened.

393
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:20,670
I was sitting in the second row.

394
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:24,510
I couldn't see it because he's fucking
assholes stood up in front of me. Um,

395
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,620
I don't, I don't understand standing
up when nothing's in your weight.

396
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,940
They haven't,
you ever heard that expression?

397
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,090
Okay.

398
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,550
Why Stan? When you could sit
by, sit, when you can lay down.

399
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,960
Why stand up when you were in the front
fucking row and what is block and your

400
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:41,700
God damned here anyways.
All right, I'm done.

401
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:43,140
Fucking bitch in here.
I had a,

402
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,820
I had a great time and evidently
Kobe are fucking crazy man.

403
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,553
You know

404
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,280
dude, Chris Everett should wear that
fucking sneaker. That's what it looks at.

405
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:58,660
It looks like the one that different
colored ones. I'd like, you know,

406
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,490
do you know something that is a
testament to how great Colby Bryant was.

407
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,060
You know,
it's almost like he's so fucking good.

408
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:09,920
Nike was at the factory going like,

409
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,480
how fucking ugly do you think we could
make a sneaker if we put your name on it?

410
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,480
These people that lick the
bottom of the fucking sneaker,

411
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,890
will they still buy these God damn things?
You know what?

412
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,370
Now that I'm looking at
him cause I'm an old man.

413
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,130
They don't look like you
played basketball. Great.

414
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,000
They look comfortable as hell as far
as when they're in a different color,

415
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:29,834
I guess.

416
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,620
Okay.

417
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,120
They look like slippers.
They is,

418
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:39,140
the thing I want is, I want to fucking
ask you. Colby had that horrific, uh,

419
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:44,130
Achilles, um, injury. I
swear to God, which is like,

420
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,550
that was the end of anybody's career.

421
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,110
That is like the classic
old man basketball injury.

422
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:56,220
As you go to take a step in your fucking
Achilles goes right up the back of your

423
00:24:56,221 --> 00:25:00,050
leg. Um, I mean,

424
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,990
I don't even think I obviously,
I don't fucking play hoops at all,

425
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,920
but I still fucking,
I'm always stretching my fucking Achilles.

426
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,070
I swear to God before I get out of bed.
That's,

427
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,720
I don't know what it is about that injury.

428
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:15,380
I just know like five or six people that
have had it and I want no part of it.

429
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,760
Okay.

430
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,480
I want no fucking, you never walk right
again. I mean, if he got Colbys money,

431
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,763
you know,

432
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,820
you can go to Germany and meet the
grandsons of the Nazi fucking doctors and

433
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:28,940
they'll spend your fucking blood in a
centrifuge, whatever the fuck they do.

434
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,210
And then you come back and you can
still dunk or whatever, you know.

435
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:33,980
But most people don't have Coby money.

436
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:37,280
So what's going to happen is as you're
going to go down to the veterinarian down

437
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,600
the street and he's going to show that
thing back and you're never going to,

438
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,800
you're never going to be,
you know,

439
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,163
that's it.

440
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,231
God help you.

441
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:50,231
If you're ever in a situation where
there's panic and the crowd starts running

442
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:54,320
and it's a stampede and you've blown
out your Achilles at some point in your

443
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,330
life that you're going to get trampled,

444
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,933
you know,

445
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,190
you're going to be that zebra on the
Serengeti that gets eaten by the fucking

446
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:07,030
alligators. Basically what's going
to happen. Um, but he, you know,

447
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:10,120
he has the low tops. I wonder if that
probably had nothing to do with it.

448
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,130
I'm just surprised guys are wearing low
top fucking sneakers again. Like, it's a

449
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,480
okay

450
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,130
cause it, you know, I don't
pay attention to shit.

451
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:22,220
I usually watch hockey right at
first he's going like, no, no, no.

452
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:25,090
Colby kind of brought the low tops back.
Everybody's wearing.

453
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,280
So I looked out on the court and I saw
a number of people with low tops are

454
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,350
people still had like
these high top sneakers on,

455
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,830
but the amount of ones like that,
that they were like velcro.

456
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,920
You don't like a little kid,
he can't tie you sneakers. See,

457
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:41,870
have they had like velcro high tops with
like a fucking belt around your ankle?

458
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,800
And I,
I dunno,

459
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,810
I don't know about those either.
You know what's hilarious?

460
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,790
How arrogant I am that I actually think
that the world cares what a 48 year old

461
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:59,360
white guy thinks about fucking sneakers.
Well,

462
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,030
why don't you just get a pair
of shell toes. Um, so anyways,

463
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:08,980
we went to the Goddamn game and uh,
we a great fucking time.

464
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,460
Uh, Robert Sovereign, his family are
great. We met, we met him briefly.

465
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,680
Just talk to them. Just great
people like that guy. Dude,

466
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,120
if I was afraid expense, I would be
very happy with that guy. As an owner,

467
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:25,450
even though I know you guys are rebuilding
that guy, fucking gloves, his team,

468
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,870
there's a lot of owners, they
don't give a shit. You know,

469
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:32,620
they own a team so they can have hookers
and blow up in a fucking sweet dude.

470
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:35,590
That guy, he was, it looked
like he, I was going to say,

471
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,770
it's like he had money on the game and
he does. He's paying the fucking players.

472
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,303
MMM.

473
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,710
Anyways. Um, all right, so
let's plow ahead here. Um,

501
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,060
I don't even know what that is.
Did you guys have a dental?

502
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,420
He love it and you're buying the shit
cause they keep advertising on my podcast.

503
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,360
I know what a Predator is.
I know Wolverine is,

504
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,610
that's when that Australian guy has to
eat a whole fucking chicken to get jacked.

505
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,550
And I was reading the other day,
that guy,

506
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:50,551
he's played wolverine eight times and
he has to pack on like 25 pounds of

507
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,720
fucking muscle.
He goes,

508
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:56,440
I eat a whole chicken every day because
my jaw is literally sore from eating.

509
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,570
It's like,
why don't you just do Roy?

510
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,850
Okay.

511
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,310
You know, it's not like they
test you as an actor. Uh,

512
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,460
did you hear about the fucking wolverine?
Gay can't make any more movies.

513
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:11,580
He got suspended for three
movies. He did steroids, um,

514
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,030

517
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,220
He's fucking seven feet.
I don't give a fuck.

518
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,130
He's got the lateral movement of a fucking
dump truck. I don't know what to say.

519
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:31,964
Anyway,

520
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,860
you balls will feel nice and fucking soft
when you're wearing the Colby eleven's.

you've perfected your wardrobe.
But what about the stuff?

528
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:09,170
Not everybody gets to see if
you've been settled. Dude.

529
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,820
Is there anything better
than a new pair of underwear?

530
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,140
Okay.

531
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,760
I mean, it's crazy. Your balls
are alive. You know dude,

532
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,270
you have on a new pair of underwear and,
and you have the old Linux sevens on.

533
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,500
I'm telling you, dude, and you go to,

534
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:29,700
is there anything better than a bowl of
fucking great nuts? Um, great nuts, right?

535
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,850
You fucking, you. You're nuts. So
fucking comfortable. Your grape nuts.

536
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:36,990
A cause or a soft you.
It's going to be a great day.

537
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,190
You put on your sweat pants, you
get a slice of pizza. You know,

538
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,460
somebody says something, you go, Oh,

bought underwear, five packs,

540
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,240
I have something that will change
your life for the better me undies.

541
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,090
What's the first thing you put on
in the last thing you take off?

542
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,200
It's your underwear.

543
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,150
Make your most important piece of clothing
the best it can be with me undies.

544
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,340
What is me undies?
Oh,

545
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:07,240
just seriously soft and feel good
undies delivered right to your door.

546
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,430
Biondi you've be phonies of Kelly.

547
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:13,810
Olynyk actually hears this and kicks me
in my red nuts with this fucking Kobe 11

548
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,990
[inaudible] that would really be justice.
There's your lateral movement.

549
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,170
You're wanting, your balls is going this
way. The other's going the other way.

550
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,370
You know something. That's why I think
you have a ball bag. You know what I mean?

551
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:26,680
Cause it hurts so much to
get kicked in the balls.

552
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,890
God had to give you balls the
opportunity to try to get out of the way.

553
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,400
You know what I mean? It's like a running
back that knows how to take a hit.

554
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,010
You know you can't have like,
like Earl Campbell,

555
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:38,980
just one in straight up and down. You're
going to end up in a fucking wheelchair.

556
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,960
You know what I mean?
I know Jim Brown doesn't like it,

557
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,870
but these running backs that step out
of bounds, they prolong your career.

558
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,080
That's what your balls are doing. And your
ball beck. All right, back to the book.

559
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:50,960
Copy here, me undies are
designed in La. Oh Jesus.

560
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:56,030
And made from sustainably
sourced micro modal. Modal are,

561
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,310
it's a fabric three
times softer than cotton.

562
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:03,050
Evidentaly me undies softer
than socks. Lugs, undies.

563
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,530
Isn't that supposed to be luxury?
Lux Z Luke?

564
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:11,480
Say undies come in and ever changing
selection of classic colors.

565
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,490
Maybe you can find some to match your
Jordan's sixes through to say anything

566
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:20,720
better than walking around in your
underwear and you find some Jordans.

567
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,880
Sevenths that match. I
mean, it's fucking crazy.

568
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:26,360
If you're wearing a bathrobe
and you smoking a cigar, I
mean it, dude, it's over.

569
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,560

584
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,120
I can't be fucking reading

585
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,450
Dollar Shape Club don't.

some gimmicky fucking thing that's got a

laser point. It was 17 blades.
Make the Smad at choice.

589
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,010

Make the smarter choice and Join Dollar
Shave Club before dollar shave club.

591
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,280
It was either saved money and get a
painful shape from a disposal disposables

592
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,070
like the one that give
away for free at the gym,

593
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,940
which felt like shaving with the piece
of glass or you pay a fortune for the

594
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:57,500
latest gimmick.
He shaved breakthrough.

595
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:02,090
You don't need like a laser
chin detector or 17 more blades.

596
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,130
Yeah, do the only thing you need
two blades. One blade sucked, right?

597
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,780
It's one of my lady shaving my legs over
here. Two blades was the shit. Three,

598
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,430
three blades and on fucking horrific.
It just got too big.

599
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:19,220
He couldn't get underneath the nose and
I got a cute little button nose and even

600
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:23,750
I had a problem, you know, can't
imagine if somebody was one of them,

601
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,610
them were Roman noses. You know when
those gladiator noses, Mediterranean.

602
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,810
I can't say the obvious choice here
because everybody would get offended,

603
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:35,630
but you know what I mean? I those poor
people, what they've been through.

604
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:39,360
Can you imagine? Then all of a sudden
there's this fucking three blades. I mean,

605
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:41,110

611
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,370

612
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:03,970

624
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,720
Here we go. Here we go. Let's
get back to the fucking podcast.

625
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,300
So I've been listening to a bunch
of fucking old school country,

626
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,700
not all the way back to Hank Williams,
but like that outlaw shit, you know,

627
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,070
right before the outlaw shit is
George Jones considered outlaw,

628
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,410
I dunno.
But listening to him obviously,

629
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,520
um, to all of these other
fucking guys, right.

630
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,880
And uh, I ended up list,
I remember that this song,

631
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,920
do you guys remember Johnny paycheck?

632
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,020
Johnny paycheck was this country
singer and he, I swear to God,

633
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:28,680
he had a hit song called
take this job and shove it.

634
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,230
Okay.

635
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,000
And it was such a fucking hit.

636
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,020
It's so struck a chord with people that
they actually turned it into a movie.

637
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:44,630
There was actually a movie called take
this job and shove it. It was just,

638
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,820
it was about a fucking guy who was working
in a job that he hated and he wanted

639
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:54,700
to tell them, you know, basically
tell him to go fuck themselves.

640
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:57,310
But he didn't have the nerves.
And I think it was because the lyric was,

641
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:59,380
someday I'm going to
get the nerve to say it.

642
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,890
And everybody could relate
to it being like, Hey,

643
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:06,550
I also hate my fucking life
and I want to make a change,

644
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,870
but I don't know how to do it.
You know what I mean?

645
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:16,240
It's like the whole Donald Trump fucking
phenomenon, not the informed people.

646
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,670
You know what I mean? I'm talking
about the, the, the mouth breather.

647
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,830
You know what I mean?
Like put the Hillary Clinton,

648
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:27,730
you had the informed person that wanted
to vote for her and then you had the

649
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:32,560
hissy fit. Fucking dope.
This'll be great for women.

650
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:36,910
Like your life was really going to
fucking change. Um, I swear to God,

651
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,410
I just don't,
I don't,

652
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:42,730
I don't understand adults who haven't
fucking figured it out yet. That you're,

653
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:47,680
you're on your own. Okay. Playtime is
over. Nobody cares about you. Okay.

654
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,160
I don't care what color their
fucking tire they put their bra is.

655
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:56,190
They don't the level of money that you
have to have and then you have to give it

656
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,650
to these people for you
to even be on their radar.

657
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,780
You have to be going to these 10,000
hundred thousand $50,000 fucking plate

658
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:05,614
dinners with them,

659
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,660
and then you'd have to stand in a line
of people that all paid that money.

660
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay? And you got to get up there
with your fucking shape shifter,

661
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,580
fucking lizard eyeballs, and you
got to try to peer into their soul.

662
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,340
I didn't think it talked to him.

663
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:24,320
You just walk up with a Napkin that says
how much money you're going to give to

664
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,080
them and then you're on the fucking radar.

665
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,250
Has nothing to do with your
genitalia anyways, so all the, okay,

666
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,050
so I'm getting off the rails here.
So this fucking guy, Johnny paycheck,

667
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:38,410
he's got this fucking Sean Song
called take this job and shove it.

668
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,310
It's the funniest fucking just,

669
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,800
there's no way to listen to this
song and not fuck it. Just be,

670
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,770
I played it for Paul Versey. He
was crying and laughing. He goes,

671
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:50,140
this can't be a real song. I go,
dude, not only is a real song,

672
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:51,010
it was turned into a movie.

673
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,920
Just the way he says shove it is
voice drops way down. He goes,

674
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:59,230
take this job and shove it.

675
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,590
I work in here no more.

676
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,010
My warm and dawn left.

677
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Took all the reasons why I was working
for these are the actual lyrics you it or

678
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:17,611
not tried to stand in my way
because I'm walking out the door.

679
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,000
You could take this job and shove it.

680
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,470
I work in here no more than this
stupid baseline comes on boob but do,

681
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,700
do, do, do, do and it gets
all like kind of trying to

682
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,540
quiet. You don't want to, red neck gets
quiet, you know and starts talking,

683
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,450
leans in. It's fucking scary. You know,

684
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,020
nine whites even for white people.
That's fucking scary.

685
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,670
There is nothing scarier than a redneck
lean and in at a bar thinking that you

686
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:47,950
were, we're all on the same team.
That's some fucked up shit cause you,

687
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,100
you're immediately like, I
don't want to do, I don't,

688
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:52,620
I don't want any part of what
you're about ready to tell me sir.

689
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,090
And I want to try to get out of
this conversation gracefully.

690
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:02,091
How do I dismount out of this fucking
conversation that the second they went on,

691
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:06,990
a fucking redneck looks the opposite way
of the conversation and then leans in.

692
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,110
I'm telling you,
they should be like a fucking,

693
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,820
I'd inject her seat on your bar
stool to get you the fuck out of.

694
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,980
Where did it go?
Did I get left behind?

695
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,240
So I swear to God, somebody gets into the
verse, right? It's like he's leaning in,

696
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,140
have been working in this factory for now,

697
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,400
15 years all his time.

698
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,170
A watch my woman drowning in
a pool of tears. You know,

699
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:42,140
and I, when I love about all
those old school country songs,

700
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:46,670
is there a fucking women always leave?
They're always crying or whatever,

701
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,340
but these fucking assholes.
They never say why.

702
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,070
And whenever I listen to these
songs, it's just like, dude,

703
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,600
what the fuck were you doing? I get
it. You're working at this factory.

704
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,460
You don't like the job. Why is your
woman drowning in a pool of tears? What?

705
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,270
I mean, are you taking this
fucking so you don't have the balls

706
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,860
to try to get a better job? Tell your
boss to fuck off. So what happens?

707
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,660
You come home, you take it out on
your wife. Is that what you're doing?

708
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,400
I bet. Shit jobs. I've had
law for the first fucking,

709
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,750
I don't know how many
years of being a comedian.

710
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,390
Okay.

711
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:27,160
Was it a low paying job? I never had a
girlfriend drowning in a pool of tears.

712
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,660
I mean, I definitely made him cry,
but that's cause I was an asshole.

713
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,860
Had nothing to do with my fuck.
I wouldn't blame my job.

714
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,430
I've been featuring on the
road for now on 16 years.

715
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,120
One of these days. Anyways, he got,
he just listen to the fucking song.

716
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,020
You got to hear this song.

717
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,660
You got Johnny paycheck.
Um,

718
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,670
I know I'm making fun of him,
but I actually,

719
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:54,870
okay.

720
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,100
I don't know.
There's something about this.

721
00:42:56,101 --> 00:43:00,720
I listened to this fucking song and it
just gives me all kinds of ideas for

722
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:04,200
characters and shit like that
and movies and whatever. Um,

723
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,550
but I'm in download, George Jones,
George Jones, Tammy, why net?

724
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:10,590
All of these fucking
people and I swear to God,

725
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,403
okay,

726
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,960
you gotta, you gotta listen
to George Jones these days.

727
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,230
These days I barely get by

728
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,150
is inadvertently one of the funniest
fucking songs you ever going to listen to

729
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,571
your life.

730
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:27,540
Do you have one of those friends that
just calls up and complains all the time?

731
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,680
Okay.

732
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,590
And did you try to help them out and
go, hey, well what if you do? No,

733
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:36,370
I can't do that and we'll blow the
fucking guy who was just resigned himself.

734
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,280
Yeah. Hey, it wasn't my walk this way, x,
Y, and z. What happened? That's why can't,

735
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,510
what's that fucking attitude?
That's exactly what's going to happen.

736
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,470
You know what I mean? I got a couple
of friends like that after awhile.

737
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,960
You just like to, you're a white guy
and the United States of America.

738
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,320
How far down the fucking track before
the race starts? Do you have to be

739
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,570
Jesus fucking Christ? How the
fuck are you complaining? I'm

740
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,790
complaining. I'm not saying that white
people should not complain. I, okay.

741
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,210
I know there's a lot of people drowning
in a pool of tears harder these days.

742
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:12,890
I'm going to get the, I'm going
to blow my top. It's like, dude,

743
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,890
why don't you just address the
fact that you don't like your job?

744
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,040
Apply from some other jobs.
If you don't have the training,

745
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,440
take some night courses.
You know,

746
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:26,470
get the training you need instead of
sitting there seething coming home,

747
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:31,100
taking it out on your fucking well,
George Jones has another fucking song.

748
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,460
Okay.

749
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,840
Called the grand tour.

750
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:35,920
Okay.

751
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,500
I listened to them. I'm telling you, you
got to listen to these fucking songs,

752
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:40,390
right? I listened to that
song. It's like, George,

753
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,850
what in the fuck did you do to your woman?

754
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,853
Yeah.

755
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,550
It's like step right up.
Come on in.

756
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,220
If you had wall to tag the Grand Tor,
oh,

757
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:59,900
below we house. The awards
was home. Sweet home.

758
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,190
You're like, Jesus Christ and this mother
Fucker, he goes through his whole house

759
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,480
over there.

760
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:08,830
Okay.

761
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:13,830
Is the chair where it should bring the
pipe or to me and sit down on my knee and

762
00:45:16,271 --> 00:45:19,650
whisper, oh, I love you. Hey,

763
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,050
you're like Jesus Christ right there.
You want to get out of the house?

764
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,260
This mother fucker won't stop straight
ahead is the bed where we lay in the low

765
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,193
boom.

766
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,720
When he gets all the way to the nursery,
you're like,

767
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,060
oh Jesus Christ.
Here he goes.

768
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,240
She took the fucking baby and the key
thing in all of this is he says there's a

769
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:51,870
rings and other things and
it's like this fucking woman

770
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,840
left all of her stuff and took the baby.
George, what the fuck did you do to her?

771
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,140
Okay,

772
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,190
this woman didn't leave you.
She fled the fucking scene.

773
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,360
There's some sort of detail.
You're not fucking given me here.

774
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,300
Where are the empty booze bottles?
I mean, what do you, what do you,

775
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,670
what did I actually listened to that song?

776
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:19,180
I feel bad for the woman in his
life until I found out she left.

777
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,490
Then I actually feel good.
Yeah, get the fuck out.

778
00:46:21,491 --> 00:46:25,570
I didn't get that kid out of there. Tell
me if I'm supposed to feel bad for you.

779
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,650
Sounds like you went out back to
chop some wood and she just grabbed,

780
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:36,350
she saw some daylight, somehow got the
chains off around her fucking ankles,

781
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,260
grabbed the kid and get the fuck out
of there. Um, anyway, so it's recently.

782
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,330
Oh, there's gonna be some pure
country fancy and be like,

783
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:49,240
you're missing the point,
man. Take this job, man.

784
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:54,180
Show that night working
here. The more. All right.

785
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:57,230
Pro Flowers. Everybody
warm and burn. Blab, me,

786
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,850
my woman, Doug left me. Hey
Johnny. Paycheck. Come on.

787
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,100
It's just, you would make, Whoa, what did
she, what, what, what'd you do? You know,

788
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:15,800
I imagine if she fucked around on you,
you would have mentioned it. All right.

789
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,220
Maybe I'm taking these fucking
songs a little too seriously. Um, I,

790
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:23,400
I have a problem with that. Like when
I listened to rap music, you know?

791
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:24,850
Okay.

792
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,850
Like who sues that new group
that everybody's Migos. When I,

793
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,650
when I watched the videos,
shit,

794
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,670
and they're coming up in those supercars
and they're holding the fucking money

795
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:36,580
out. It just, it literally, I have
to look in the other direction. Okay.

796
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:37,880
Okay.

797
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,230
It just drives me nuts. Seen artists doing
that? I just, I'm always thinking ahead.

798
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,980
Please,
please buy some real estate.

799
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,040
Okay.

800
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,590
Please don't blow it all
on fucking Coby eleven's.

801
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,180
Oh my God, Dude. Watch an
artist's watching people
who don't understand money,

802
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:59,380
I guess. But I would say artists,
you know the shit that we fucking do.

803
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:00,670
It's just the dumbest.

804
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:02,640
Okay.

805
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,500
You know what's another
stupid fucking thing?

806
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,470
I love these people that buy watches
that are like you can, it's like, dude,

807
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:09,300
that thing you can hang
that on the fucking wall.

808
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:12,420
I'd know what time it was from across
the room. Why do you have that on that?

809
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,433
On your wrist?

810
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,170
The amount of guys that are
like my height and my size.

811
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,560
Okay.

812
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,860
Walking around with a watch that only
would look right on like a fucking

813
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:27,250
offensive lineman is, it's, it's like,

814
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:29,170
did you take that out of a submarine?
Is,

815
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,290
is that like deep sea scuba dive
and shit? So you can have, you get,

816
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,950
you can go fucking go down to like what?
9,000 feet and up with the,

817
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,400
the Goddamn dial won't bust on it.

818
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,310
I got my a big Oh watch.

819
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,243
Okay.

820
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,560
Paypal in a different time
zone can tell what time it is.

821
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:54,810
Take this watch and shove it. All
right. Pro Flowers. Everybody.

822
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:00,210
Have you ever forgotten your anniversary?
If you're not nodding yes, you're lying.

823
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,640
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck it says to this?

824
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,040
I don't forget my anniversary.

825
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:11,770
Okay.

826
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,970
Again,
I'm not going to lie to you.

827
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:16,420
It definitely sneaks up on me when
I'll be off pockets in two days.

828
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,940
What can I get her? What can
I get her? I don't have time.

829
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:21,520
Maybe I'll get her some fucking flowers.
Um,

830
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,100
you know those people that
are just hard to shop for?

831
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,520
Like your wife for your anniversary
or your sister for a birthday.

832
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,960
It's just the worst. Trying to find that
gift. A you don't know. You don't know.

833
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,160
Yeah,

834
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,710
I think they're supposed to say what
you don't know what the like and be.

835
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,830
It's just the worst. Trying
to, okay. It's just the worst.

836
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:47,340
Trying to find a gift that a,
you know, they'll like and B,

837
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,360
won't cost an arm and a leg. Well,
I'm going to make it easy for you.

838
00:49:51,361 --> 00:49:56,361
Pro Flowers is my goto for flowers is
actually a flower store down the street.

839
00:49:56,611 --> 00:50:00,510
That's my fucking go to. I
hate the Internet. You know,

840
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,390
I'll go on there and I'll try to click
on something and next thing you know,

841
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,330
I'll eat.
They eat the order.

842
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,630
Either won't go through all our have
enough fucking funeral to re no funeral.

843
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,060
I'll have enough fucking
flowers to rebury Elvis.

844
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,330
That's what I was trying to say.
Then I just started picturing his funeral.

845
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,640
Anyways.
Pro Flowers is my go to for flowers.

846
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,120
Yeah,

847
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,930
they're fresh price. Right. And a
perfect gift for literally anyone.

848
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,980
Oh yeah. Get one for your guy
friends. That's a fucking gift.

849
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,940
Do you just want to freak out?
When are you fucking friends?

850
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,130
Just getting some
flowers and have the car.

851
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,970
Just say thinking of you and then
you write in parentheses smile

852
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,740
and they get delivered straight
to your recipient store.

853

874
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,730
I was wondering why they were going to
be advertising flowers this time a year.

875
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,040
I was like, what are you going
to get into the fucking east?

876
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,520
Get some Ash Wednesday flowers.
Why are they advertising it?

877
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:14,330
Because you know what,

878
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:18,590
they probably had their maximum appeal.

879
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,910
They probably hit their maximum fucking,

880
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,500
I just realized it's probably somebody
sleeping on the other side. I mean,

881
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:28,850
I'm waking him up with my fucking Johnny
paycheck saying, let me get over here.

882
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,990
Um, anyways, so they're
probably like, well,

883
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:36,290
how can we get people to fucking
buy flowers all year round?

884
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,140
How can we create a need? Well,
everybody's got an anniversary.

885
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,660
Everybody's got a birthday.
Her birthday. Right? Hey,

886
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:49,190
I like the way you're thinking Carl. We
could sell flowers the whole year round.

887

905
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,300
I'm thinking I'm going to start fucking
doing that again. Now that I'm a father.

906
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:00,100
Now that I got my daughter,
my daughter dawn left me the goal.

911
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:19,040
Click
on the
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinbirdthatstamps.com
and

912
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:23,650
tuber. Alright, I'm getting up against
it here. You know what I'm doing today,

913
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:27,290
by the way,
I'm going to go see Oh cleo audio.

914
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,430
I'm going to see my dog Cleo. Um, the,

915
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,580
the people that ended up a rest
getting her from us live out here.

916
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,780
So,
um,

917
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:44,560
I'm actually gonna get to see her and
visit her today and tomorrow and um,

918
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,490
I can't wait to see her and everything.
She's probably not even gonna give a shit

919
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,430
because she's probably going to be so in
love with the other people cause I kind

920
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:54,490
of realized that going well.

921
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:59,490
She was in love with the people that
had her before us and within a week she

922
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:05,110
fucking loved us. I mean, dogs should they
adapt, they just fucking adapt. So, um,

923
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,200
I got another five minutes here
and then I got to take off.

924
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:12,370
So I got time for one question
here. Let me see. Um, let me get,

925
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:16,720
let me get a good one here.
Uh, all righty, righty.

926
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,100
A dictator bill.

927
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,970
I'm 19 years old and I've been with
my girlfriend, my Wallman dawn left.

928
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,430
I'm with my girlfriend
from now for two years. Uh,

929
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,610
I know what you're thinking too
young for all these silly problems.

930
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,590
That's not what I'm thinking. I'm thinking
good for you. Way To go where to go.

931
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:39,880
Fell. Um, anyway, for the
first year of our relationship,

932
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:43,450
literally everything was perfect. I still
love her just as much as I did then.

933
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:45,340
I'm sure she loves me just as much.
However,

934
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:49,630
during the second year of our relationship
relationship and overnight shift

935
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,020
changed,
um,

936
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:56,260
and then we stopped having sex.
It base,

937
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:58,660
it's basically nonexistent
and now and again,

938
00:55:58,661 --> 00:56:02,590
every couple of months it will happen.
But I know she's not enjoying it.

939
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,950
This is because she was on the
implant contraception injection.

940
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,500
At first I was questioning myself and
if it was me that wasn't getting her in

941
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:17,350
the mood anymore, but she promises me
that it isn't because of the implant.

942
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:22,180
She says it's that it, what the
fuck is it? Contraception injection.

943
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,200
Oh, Jesus. I, I mean I've
never heard of that shit.

944
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,110
It's an injection so
you won't get pregnant.

945
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,120
Yeah,

946
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,970
dude, if you literally told
me contraception actually
meant it's Gunna get you

947
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:39,410
pregnant,
I would believe that too.

948
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,460
That's like one of those fucking words
that I just ignored my whole life.

949
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,360
You know, like Soliloquy, like what
the fuck does that mean? You know,

950
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,060
contraception,
implant

951
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,020
official site. Get the facts. Fuck that.
I don't want to fax someone pictures.

952
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:02,883
Images.

953
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,780
Okay. They're showing it
that it's nice and small.

954
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,690
For some reason they keep putting
it up against their bicep.

955
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,730
They stick it in your fucking arm.

956
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,143
What?

957
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,040
So say some fucking robot shit.

958
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,050
Yeah.

959
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,150
Okay.
It's birth control implant.

960
00:57:33,151 --> 00:57:35,910
They stick a fucking toothpick in your
arm and then you can't have a baby.

961
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,890
I don't get it anyways.
Well yeah,

962
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:41,280
that's probably fucking annoying to
have it in there. You know what I mean?

963
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,570
She goes to hug you and the inside
of her arm hurts. Anyways, apps.

964
00:57:44,571 --> 00:57:46,870
The first I was questioning myself,
blah, blah. She says that it,

965
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,220
that has caused her to
completely lose her sex drive.

966
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:55,050
She says she just had it removed and
it's been a few weeks since then.

967
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:56,190
Nothing has changed yet.

968
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,720
I feel so much resentment towards her
every day and what I can only describe as

969
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:02,820
depression.
As soon as I see her,

970
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:07,110
most of the time I find myself being
such an angry, short tempered person.

971
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:10,440
Now when normally I'm usually
happy and smiling, ah,

972
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,350
Jesus might be time to get out
of this relationship buddy.

973
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,530
But you know something,
if it really affected her like that,

974
00:58:16,531 --> 00:58:18,060
it depends on how long
she had it in there.

975
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,510
Maybe she needs longer than
two weeks. Um, but you know,

976
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:22,770
if you're gonna be an angry lunatic,

977
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:25,950
I mean if you don't leave eventually
she's gonna. But you know what,

978
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:30,951
you get yourself a song on a warm
and Don port or to pick in or arm.

979
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,620
Now she won't suck.
My Dick won't have these days.

980
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:38,550
I'm going to whip it out
and wipe it on the wall.

981
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,470
You can take my dick and shit.
Um,

982
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:48,170
Rodney and your fucking mouth, you whore.
But do, do, do, do, do you, do you okay.

983
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,901
I always try.

984
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:53,190
I always seem to try and hide my need for
sex and act like I don't ever want it.

985
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,550
And tried to show
disinterests but I never can.

986
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,250
I guess it just must be more
important to me than it is to her.

987
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,230
I never thought sex was such a big deal,

988
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:05,730
but the last year has taught me that when
there's bad sex life in a relationship,

989
00:59:05,731 --> 00:59:07,890
it can really cause the whole
thing to just break down.

990
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,390
It just got to the point now that I've
said we need some space and a break,

991
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:16,230
because the last thing I want
is to ruin our relationship. Um,

992
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,430
dude, you're fucking miserable man. And
you have to, you have to, you know, it's,

993
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,800
you got to be with somebody and like
understand them and, and you know,

994
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:32,080
be there when they're going through
a tough time, but like, you know,

995
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,670
if they're not understanding how fucking
miserable you are, you just going to,

996
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:39,790
you're just going to keep getting
more miserable and then, you know,

997
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,680
then they're going to be miserable.

998
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,110
And then in the end they gonna fucking
break up with you and you're gonna be

999
00:59:44,111 --> 00:59:47,710
like, what the fuck? I should have done
that to them breaking up with somebody.

1000
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:48,730
It's not something you should do to them.

1001
00:59:48,731 --> 00:59:52,180
It's something you should do for yourself.
All right? This is the deal, dude.

1002
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,390
You're not fucking happy.
All right? You're not happy.

1003
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,220
It's great that you
take in a fucking break.

1004
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:59,260
And I would go out and
I'd fucking go try to win,

1005
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:03,010
join myself and meet somebody that doesn't
have a fucking toothpick in their arm

1006
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,440
that doesn't want to touch my dick.
You know what I mean?

1007
01:00:05,441 --> 01:00:08,980
That's just get down to brass tacks
here. That's what's going on. Right?

1008
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,360
They stuck that shit and her and Noah,
you can't stick your shit and hurt.

1009
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:18,310
So I mean why you gotta get the fuck out?
I get up young dog in 19.

1010
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:20,860
What are you gonna Merrier?
What are you in the military?

1011
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,670
People in the military getting
married when the 19 you know,

1012
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,200
but warmer dawn left. Um,
that's what you do. I, I,

1013
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,900
it's just sounds like a,
you sound like you,

1014
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:40,440
you need like a long time away from
each other the way that was red dude,

1015
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:44,000
that sounded like a fucking 40
year old guy wrote that. 19th.

1016
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:47,120
So that's kind of a good sign that
maybe you should get the fuck out. Um,

1017
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,110
who knows? But I, I would not say
anything mean I would not. And uh, I just,

1018
01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:52,440
you know,

1019
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,400
you want to be able to see the person
again and not get a glass to the head.

1020
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,140
You know what I mean?
That's kind of what you're going for.

1021
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:01,590
So the art form is you just
tell them how you're feeling.

1022
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,270
Okay.

1023
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:07,680
You know, I'm just not happy. I'm
sorry. That's just how I feel.

1024
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:11,400
I'm just not happy and I'm finding
myself less and less happy and,

1025
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,590
um, it's affecting my moods.
Everything you just said.

1026
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,130
Okay.

1027
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,530
And I'm finding that I'm getting angry
and I don't want to be angry around you

1028
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:25,420
and, and create any misery in your life.
So as much as this is going to hurt you,

1029
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,550
I'm walking out the door.
You can take this relationship.

1030
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:35,180
Um, that's it. They walk out the door,

1031
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,340
you know, and you'll probably walk out
that door and you'd be sad a little bit.

1032
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:41,700
Yeah.

1033
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,870
And you walk a little more,

1034
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,870
then you start skipping and then you're
running down the street. You know,

1035
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,150
it might be one of those breakups. Okay.
Or could be the one, oh, why did I do it?

1036
01:01:52,151 --> 01:01:54,870
I don't fucking know. But you're 19.
You don't, if you've got the whole,

1037
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,730
you got your whole fucking life ahead
of you. You don't need to be in this.

1038
01:01:57,731 --> 01:02:01,930
This sounds like you're fucking married.
I get up. All right. That's it. Okay.

1039
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:04,480
