1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,320
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:05,840
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,000
December 19th,
2060 what's going on?

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,180
However,
um,

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,510
oh Jesus Christ my fucking computer.
Every five seconds.

6
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,880
Do you want to download this?
Do you want to do this now?

7
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:23,690
Do you want to do it in an hour? Should
I remind you later on tonight? Lay.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,180
Give me some fucking space.
Jesus Christ.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,410
He's fucking God. Damn. I don't know man.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,510
I'm not under this shit at all. Just
the level with which that sits fucking,

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,100
I guess because of technology,
I am able to do this. You know,

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,880
if it was back in the day, I would not
be able to do this. What is this you,

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
you ask,
maybe you didn't ask.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,990
Maybe I'm doing that thing where
I'm putting words in your mouth,

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,490
but if you did ask, you know,
doing a podcast, you know,

16
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,480
I guess there's always a
price to pay and I think that,

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,640
I think that that's one to grow on.
Maybe that's the lesson.

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,840
I swear to God, I want to start
a fucking church. I got to do it.

19
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:09,190
And you guys spent watching that, uh, that
woman from King of Queens, she played,

20
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:11,860
uh, the beautiful wife, you know,

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,470
to the guy who drives the truck.
Did you know that was well,

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,720
how they've always done sick
comps, the honeymooners. Hey,

23
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:23,400
I fucking drive a bus and you know,
while I'm,

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm the wise crack can be pretty wife.
Well Ralph,

25
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,570
maybe if you're wearing a fucking hit,
Yay,

26
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:34,000
you'd wouldn't drive a bus
yellow one of these days. Alice

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,480
power, right? The baby maker,
right. It's not what they did.

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,770
Something like that little fucking
ice box in the corner, you know,

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,700
and then you get into the 60s,
right?

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,860
Sixties was like the Blue Ball era of,
uh,

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,590
of sitcoms.
You know what I mean?

32
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:55,700
Yet I dream of genie and the fucking
guy would Tejas wouldn't banger.

33
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,790
I've talked about this shit before.
I remember watching as a kid.

34
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,490
It's like he'd go, why don't you like
rubbing up against her or something?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,480
You know? I don't even know what sex was.
You know, why? Because it was no internet.

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,890
Now if there was internet back when I
was watching that show and I was like

37
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:13,580
seven or eight, uh, you know, I would
have been like, why does it need,

38
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,110
why did you are a fucking prefers job?
He style over the fucking genie lamp,

39
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,550
you know?
I wouldn't know extra shit.

40
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
What the fuck is wrong with kids nowadays?

41
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:26,970
It's like they just take ticket island.
Mel, I'm going on. An old man ran,

42
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,290
they get on these fucking computers,
right? The parents are like me.

43
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,140
They don't know how to work them. They're
not even interested in him. You know,

44
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,970
we're in the fucking corner and
making homemade apple cider,

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,290
getting ready for the holidays,
you know,

46
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,230
wearing a Christmas sweater that
we think actually it looks good.

47
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,700
We're not wearing it. Ironically, will
it go, this is my Christmas sweater, Joe,

48
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,150
my fucking mother's sell this together
for me when I was in high school,

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,280
still fit. You know, sweater is always
still fits because they stretch.

50
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,600
They like the sweatpants for your
torso. You know, it takes a while.

51
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,320
Like if you have a homemade sweater, you
know, one of those lobster fishermen.

52
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,880
Once that your mom would make you know
and she just give it to you in the bag

53
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,400
that she bought the yarn and you know,

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,830
yeah.

55
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,550
Then one day you'll look at it and some
fucking moths started eating at it and

56
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:18,120
you just like,

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,120
is it the 18 hundreds rarely a
fucking caterpillar learn God,

58
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,220
it's fucking pilots license
and now is eating my sweater.

59
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:33,221
This is like so fucking 1826 how is
this happening right now for the love of

60
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:38,270
God? Mom, can you go to the
Ray on store? You don't.

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,360
Can you make me a fucking polyester
knitted sweater? How about,

62
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,690
why don't you do that?
Why can't you do that?

63
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,270
I mean Jesus Christ is fucking jumping
toward it and sweat shops around the

64
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,104
world.

65
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,680
Okay,

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,630
you got to come and meet with yard.

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,610
That's the problem with all the
mothers nowadays. You know what I mean?

68
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,450
Did them and they fucking yard.
They just won't let go of it.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm just fucking with you. What kind of
woman knows how to knit anymore? You know,

70
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,700
trying to find a woman that knows how to
knit is like trying to find a guy that

71
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,240
knows, still knows how to
hunt, you know what I mean?

72
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,440
And that even goes for
the fucking rednecks.

73
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,020
You not doing it the way
you fucking, you're, you're,

74
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,020
you're way less fucking,

75
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:24,021
I don't know what four wheeler
fucking ancestors hunted,

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
almost talk myself into a
corner and I was like, God,

77
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,670
I don't want to do the Hacky,
you know,

78
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,960
saying your grandfather who were first
had sex with the fucking relative,

79
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:36,510
you know, I didn't want to say that.
I, I didn't want to go down that road.

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,780
I don't even know if that's true,
but how the fuck did that start?

81
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,213
You know what I mean?

82
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,320
One fucking guy banked his sister and
then all of a sudden everybody out there

83
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:49,410
that has a four wheeler, it's
doing it. You know what I mean?

84
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:50,850
Okay.

85
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,550
They can just take like,
they don't have Facebook,

86
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,090
you don't have to be lonely.
I like,

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,790
have they gotten more
aggressive on that farmers?

88
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:04,350
Only when they've really just started
shitting on fucking city folk.

89
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,170
You know what I mean?
City folk just don't get it

90
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,650
and they still make
themselves look stupid.

91
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,970
City folk just don't get it.
They could go with global warming,

92
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:21,240
they could go with overpopulation,
they could go with quality of air,

93
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:24,900
quality of life space.
There's so many different directions.

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,491
Did the hey,

95
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:29,700
you want to come back to my place and
you go there and it's like some fucking

96
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,880
city apartment. You know what I mean?
With like the kitchen is in the bedroom,

97
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:33,661
you know,

98
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,410
and the bed folds down from the wall that
you could fucking attack them that way.

99
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,650
You know what I mean? Someone true to
trying to come through their window.

100
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,390
May City folks just don't get it and
then they go to their spread, right?

101
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:47,920
Yeah.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,200
Fucking get your own parking space.

103
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,160
She not driving around the block like
for fucking nine hours trying to find

104
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,380
alternative side of the street.
Fucking parking.

105
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,810
There's all these different things.
Water levels rising.

106
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,421
You know,

107
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,120
I saw this one of these men in the street
things I've been watching that debt

108
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,240
channel Vice, you guys, what's the vice
channel? It's a fucking great channel.

109
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,810
Reminds me a lot of ways
that a little bit of um,

110
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,760
MTV during the early days where like they
had a lot of funny promo commercials.

111
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,200
I don't know why more fucking networks
don't do that. Cause you know,

112
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,890
he usually fast forward, I turned the
channel when there's a commercial,

113
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:26,570
but they get like,
they are funny fucking commercials.

114
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:30,020
Like there's some talk show on there.
These two black dudes right now,

115
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,850
at least one black dude and one
guy sort of Puerto Rican maybe. Uh,

116
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,830
maybe he's light skinned. I
don't know. I'm too white to
understand. Right. So they,

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,030
they do a talk show,

118
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,630
so they're hyping it and they're
showing like the New York City skyline,

119
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:44,660
like they always do before a talk show.
And it was a,

120
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,010
I'm going to fuck up the joke. It was
something like no big guests, no band,

121
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:49,910
no audience,

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,800
no white dudes and a then they cut to the
Promo and somebody comes out, you know,

123
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,560
and I can know what the fuck was. I was
watching, I was like, this is funny.

124
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,740
This looks like way back in the
day when I would see like Randy,

125
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,670
the redwoods agenda, taxi driver, you
know, they would have like funny promos.

126
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,680
I Dunno why they ever got away
from that. But, um, anyways,

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,170
Oh, speaking of that,
speaking of non whities,

128
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,933
um,

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,500
I saw a fucking front man this weekend
and abandon it was fucking unbelievable,

130
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:25,180
right? I went down, um, uh,
the other day I did, uh,

131
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,850
the dark matter podcast,
um,

132
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,910
which is Dave Navarro's plowed cast.
And um,

133
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,440
had a great time on that. And
afterwards they were like, yeah, hey,

134
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:39,920
Dave's doing his show down at the Roxy.
You want to come down Friday,

135
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,950
Saturday night? I guess he, I mean
I'm, I'm in the dark hair. Literally,

136
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,760
no pun intended. I didn't know he did
this just Christmas show every year. Um,

137
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,050
and it was like an all star lineup.

138
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,040
You don't know who the
fuck's coming out and um,

139
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,880
you just go to the show and then they
just start bringing people out. And um,

140
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,180
so I went down there to go
see the show and I mean,

141
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,300
I knew it was going to be good.
Dude. It was fucking ridiculous,

142
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,760
the amount of people
that they had coming out,

143
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,490
which of course I'm going to fucking
forget the names and everything, but uh,

144
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,370
you just, you know, some
of them come out, this guy,

145
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,260
because they sang student
sang the immigrant song and
something else and fucking

146
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,010
murdered it.

147
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,010
I never even heard of the guy fucking
murdered at the band was unbelievable.

148
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,320
The viral was killing it.
And then they,

149
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,670
then they brought out Macy
gray and then she sang, uh,

150
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,740
the fuck did she saying she's saying
the pretenders brass in pocket and then

151
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:38,270
she's saying Radiohead creep. I was
just like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

152
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:42,650
And then they brought out Cypress Hill
and no one was doing like their own style

153
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,940
of music that everybody would like switch
it up. So then they bring out this,

154
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,780
they get this fucking intro,
which no performer wants to get.

155
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,410
Right. The guy goes to do the
intro and he just goes, you know,

156
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,410
Billy Morrison was, and just fucking
everybody, right? It goes, um, all right,

157
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:06,210
this next guy, you know, people
suggested him for this show. Uh,

158
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,910
you know, first few like
gay, you know, we don't know.

159
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,500
We don't know if he's right for this show.

160
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,670
And then we saw him and he
absolutely blew us away.

161
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,290
Our jaws were on the ground. I'm telling
you, this fucking guy is unbelievable,

162
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,520
Yada Yada. And I'm thinking, I was
in the crowd going, oh no, not that.

163
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:28,050
That intro was to fucking war. You can't
follow it. It's, I can stand up comedy.

164
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,320
This guy he's wanting to on
a best work in comms today,

165
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,090
he reinvented the Mike Stand, eh,
Betty Murphy was still doing stand up.

166
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,190
He'd be be asking this guy
to write from it. You know,

167
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:42,060
they start giving you a fucking intro
like that. You'd sit in the back like guy,

168
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,440
he tone it down,
tone it down,

169
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:47,980
right to this guy came out and
totally fucking lived up to it.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,590
It's this guy, he's a rapper. I man,

171
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:52,440
I don't know shit about hip hop or
anything like this Guy Post Malone.

172
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,670
So the guy on stage,
for whatever reason,

173
00:09:56,671 --> 00:10:00,420
I said this guy's responsible for
Justin Bieber's career. Right.

174
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,320
Which I don't know why you would say
that in front of a bunch of fucking 40 to

175
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,780
50 something year old white people.
Right.

176
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,880
So this dude comes walking out and
there's a few people bowing like

177
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,770
couple, you know, like five people
because of the Justin Bieber thing.

178
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,260
I love people in their forties and 50s
who fucking talk about how bad Justin

179
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,190
Bieber's music is. It's like, really, it
doesn't speak to you. You're fucking dope.

180
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,430
It's not for you.
You know what I mean?

181
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,280
That's like getting mad at the fucking a,
I don't to insult the guy,

182
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,530
but you know what I mean? It's,
it's for, it's for younger people.

183
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,720
You know what I mean?
I think camp like,

184
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,110
I don't understand people getting their
forties and 50s and they just, they,

185
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,790
they don't understand that, um, somebody,

186
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,080
his perspective as a 20 something year
old is not going to seem like the same as

187
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,800
theirs. And we sit there going like,
what the fuck is he tied that? And like,

188
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,070
that's bullshit. That's a, that's a stupid
Bible, blah, blah, blah. And it's like,

189
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,990
yeah, yeah. That's what you did when
you were there that age and somebody,

190
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,160
he'll be in his forties and look
back at himself at 2123 gun.

191
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,140
What the fuck was I thinking?
Right.

192
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,080
Somehow like four or five people don't
get it and they literally Boeing,

193
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,640
you know Justin Bieber at a show,
Justin Bieber is an ad.

194
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,160
So this guy comes fucking walking out and
he just walks up to the microphone and

195
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,710
he goes, what's up la?
I'm drunk as fuck. Right?

196
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:27,240
So immediately the crowd just starts
cheering and uh, he goes, I, you know,

197
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm using, you know, I'm a
rapper and I know everybody I've,

198
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,690
I was assuming, and the crowd was
like, were you going like, yeah,

199
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,750
I'm completely unfamiliar with you.
I am a white guy pushing 50.

200
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,420
I have no idea where you are.
Right?

201
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,430
So they start playing
rage against the machine,

202
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,310
killing in the name of, and
I'm like going, Oh God, Oh,

203
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,030
rappers gonna sig did they got
the auto tune on? You know,

204
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,770
is this going to be like,
uh,

205
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,270
so you're going to have too
much deodorant under his arms?

206
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,630
Like fucking ll cool j when he did the
unplugged, what's going to happen here?

207
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,250
Dude, this guy, this guy
fucking murdered the song,

208
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,080
fucking murdered this song.

209
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,670
Okay.

210
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,860
Don't just took the whole thing to
another level and it never came back down

211
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:12,480
again.
Everybody else match this guy.

212
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,810
This fucking dude was unbelievably
sang that song. And then he's saying,

213
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Alison chains wood and
fucking murdered both of them.

214
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,803
Um,

215
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,000
okay.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,670
And you literally felt it in the crowd.
Everybody on their phones going like,

217
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:30,280
who the fuck is this guy? I got a
dog download some of his shit. Um,

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
yeah.

219
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,740
Oh, and here's hilarious thing.
So later on that weekend,

220
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,270
I'm watching vice and there's another
funny promo. He's sitting there,

221
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,730
that Guy Post Malone, right? And I
was sitting there with near gone.

222
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,730
That's the fucking guy I saw that
the guy that murdered that song,

223
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:46,400
those two songs. Right. So, um,

224
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,330
yeah,

225
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,700
he was talking about conspiracy theory.

226
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,830
I don't even know what
the commercial was about.

227
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:53,720
It was just him talking to another guy.
I'm telling you,

228
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:58,340
it's very like early days of MTV. He was
just talking about conspiracy theory.

229
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,920
And, uh, being able to teleport
and he was just going like say,

230
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:08,720
here's area 51, right? Which of course he
picks that rather than saying San Diego,

231
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,980
okay. He goes, here's area 51
right here. Here's Australia.

232
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,790
If you want to fly from area
51 to Australia, you've got
to fly all the way here.

233
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,450
You know, and he draws the arc to
it just didn't draw a straight line.

234
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,460
Like someone actually
understands aviation, right.

235
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,830
Because this is what creeped me out
because if you just drew a straight line,

236
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:27,410
it'd be like, all right, this
guy's, this guy's out of his mind.

237
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,470
But the second he drew the arc, I'm like,
Oh fuck, I'm buying into this theory,

238
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,580
right? And he goes, um, and he
goes, well, with teleportation,

239
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:39,440
they just do stuff like this and he just
takes the paper and the x area 51 was

240
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,130
in the expo Australia's he just
takes the paper and he just folds it.

241
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,340
He pushes them together. He
goes, it's like that. He goes,

242
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,400
I know you guys think of mine in my mind,
but I know this shit is true.

243
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,450
And I was like, this guy's brain.
That's what my brain tells me, you know.

244
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,420
So I don't know anything about
any of his, any of his, uh,

245
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,850
okay.

246
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,240
Any of his music. But I'm definitely
gonna Watch, download some of his shit.

247
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:09,440
If anybody knows what is best
album is or whatever, you know,

248
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:14,330
a good jump off point for that guy.
Um, it would be, it would be, uh,

249
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,030
be tremendous. Um, so
anyways, oh by the way,

250
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,190
in a viral fucking killed
the guitar solo in that too.

251
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,470
I was wondering how the
hell he was going to do it.

252
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,250
And I don't know if they came up with a,
uh,

253
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,010
an effects pedal that made
the noise that the dude from a

254
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,660
okay,

255
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,630
you know, fucking rage against
the machine. You know, cause he,

256
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,470
when he came out of here that will, those
weird sounds that he made, I don't know.

257
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,220
You know, I was in over my head
musically about fucking 15 minutes ago,

258
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:40,770
but whatever. And I want to thank
everybody at dark matter for, uh,

259
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,710
for hooking me up to see that show.

260
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,390
Okay.

261
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,700
It was fucking great, man.
Just a great God damn show.

262
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:52,700
So of course I talked to Dean del Rey
who everything. He goes, Oh yeah man,

263
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:55,310
I, he goes, I went to that show
it like the fifth anniversary.

264
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,830
And it was like fucking Ozzie,
Lemmy and Steven Tyler.

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,830
And I was just like, Oh
fuck you man. Fucking,

266
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,570
you're never going to beat Dean
del Ray with the fucking, uh,

267
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,400
I went to a concert story, fucking
guy seen everything. So anyway,

268
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,040
so I'm watching this vice channel.
I know,

269
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm just plowing through this shit
fucking all over the place. Um,

270
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,880
and my wife just kept, you
know, recording this shit.

271
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,000
They were co she recorded something about,
um,

272
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,340
okay,

273
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,640
like Dj's,

274
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,810
she recorded something about
these fucking kids of those,

275
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:39,220
you know, oil barons or whatever,
oil money in Saudi Arabia.

276
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,140
So watching both of these,
right. The DJ thing, you know,

277
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:46,720
it's just something I'd seen before the
show and how much money that they're

278
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:51,060
making. And I'm in Vegas. And, uh,

279
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,761
it was funny though,

280
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:56,470
actually actually actually asking a couple
of them what the future was in a few

281
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,540
of them understood it. And a
few of them are just like, yeah,

282
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,930
it's never going to end. It's like, dude,

283
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,350
at some point you're going to be the
bgs in January of 1980 it happens to all

284
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,450
genres of music and the in the

285
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,840
so few bands figuring out how to do it,

286
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:18,010
how to age gracefully
from one era to another.

287
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,420
Um,
and like I was saying like,

288
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,230
I think I was talking about that and I
can't remember what fucking podcasts is.

289
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:28,460
You have to, I don't know how to do
it, but somehow you have to, like,

290
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:33,320
your music has to age with you so you
don't look like a fucking moron. Um,

291
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,610
like Justin Bieber has got to write some
fucking middle age shit when he's in

292
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:42,670
his middle age, you know, cause he
can't be singing about whatever the,

293
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,520
whatever the fuck he thinks about, you
know what I mean? They look stupid at 40,

294
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,360
you know, and it makes every people,
everybody in the crowd feels old.

295
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,790
Then you start, oh my God,
we're gonna die. You know,

296
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,780
you just see your mortality
when they come out. I mean,

297
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,350
the first time that I saw that was when,
uh,

298
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,070
okay,

299
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,820
like 10 years ago when David Lee Roth
came back with van Halen and I went to go

300
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,880
see van Halen, I was like, oh my God,
this is going to be fucking great, right.

301
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,090
I can't believe he's back.
I saw a diamond,

302
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:14,300
Dave went on the Itam and smile
tours can be easily thrown, you know,

303
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,110
just think he's gonna be throwing fucking
kicks and jumping off the stage doing

304
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,680
the fucking split. Right. And a dude,

305
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:25,220
he came walking out on stage and I
sweated within two. I was like, oh my God.

306
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:29,780
And like put it five seconds is
like, ah, fuck. He's all dumb old.

307
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,480
We're going to die.

308
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,110
Like this wave of fucking depression

309
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,520
just hit me until I really realized
like, wait a minute. Like, you know,

310
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,090
guitarists and drummers don't get old.
I mean, they do, but like, you know,

311
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,980
they can still fucking, you know, if
they have a technique or whatever,

312
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:50,910
they can still fucking,

313
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,710
yeah.

314
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,690
Still fucking shred and I forgot that
Eddie and Alex have been playing again for

315
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:58,840
like 50 fucking years and
they were unbelievable.

316
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,410
The singer has it the worst
because your voice naturally drops.

317
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,300
And of course everyone from my era
actually fucking sang, you know,

318
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,040
not to shit on Justin Bieber born.

319
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,290
I was watching that Dj thing on
the vice channel. They fucking, um,

320
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,020
okay.

321
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,880
He shows up at some, some pool party,
you know, where everybody's fucking,

322
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,830
you know,
turning the cameras around,

323
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:25,130
doing selfies and the peace sign
and the duck lips and all that shit.

324
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,080
And he shows up to sing his song and
he's just clearly fucking lips thinking

325
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,280
he's not even trying to do a good
job and everybody's freaking out.

326
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,300
There was a few times,
like he took the mic away from his mouth,

327
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:43,010
pointed at the crowd. He could still
hear him singing and nobody gave a shit.

328
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:45,650
There was no band,
there was nothing.

329
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,850
And all these Yolo Douche is, we're
going fucking nuts. It's like,

330
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:53,980
how is that acceptable?
I don't know that,

331
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:55,810
that shit makes me feel old.
Like back in the day,

332
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,250
if you ever got caught Milli Vanilli
oh, the whole fucking he, Millie,

333
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,110
Millie add vanilla,
his whole fucking white through that.

334
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:06,430
Nobody gave a Shit Twan 20, 30
fucking years earlier. You know,

335
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,080
I guess it's cause those guys
technically never even sang on the track.

336
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,900
I dunno, everybody's doing fucking
commercials now. I mean, I,

337
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,990
it's just back in the,
it's the whole thing is just changed.

338
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,560
He just do whatever you want.
You don't have to sing. You
can fucking, uh, you know,

339
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,240
you can lip sync your way with the,

340
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,160
your hit song through a commercial
for fucking under Roos and uh,

341
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,800
it actually equates to more
album downloads of a deli.

342
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,350
I should just be sitting on a porch right
now watching young people walking by

343
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:39,970
yelling at them. That's what this podcast
is just slowly becoming. Um, so anyways,

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,830
I'm watching that channel and uh,

345
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,810
the next thing near recorded
was a, this thing about the, uh,

346
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,050
it looked like those same guys
that I saw when I was in London.

347
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,400
The Middle Eastern dudes
who fly on a cargo plane,

348
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,350
fly in all their fucking cars.

349
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,160
With this same ridiculous rap,
you know?

350
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,150
Or maybe it's a paint job. I think
it's a wrap that they put on there.

351
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:05,810
You know what I mean?
They've got like the fucking a,

352
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,870
it's like that mirrored finish,

353
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,290
like those three people in Shanna and
now with the gold suit's still do that to

354
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:15,970
like Mercedes and all that. Well,
when they're back in their country,

355
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:20,060
another status symbol is to own a,
uh,

356
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,360
like endangered species or a
exotic animals is they call them.

357
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,270
Okay.

358
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,500
And these fucking guys,

359
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,120
they owned like a cheetahs
and lions and tigers.

360
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,150
It was the most disturbing fucking thing
and aren't even coming into this and

361
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:41,680
like a Peter Way, I just sat there going
like, dude, that is a fucking lion.

362
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,390
You've got it on a leash.

363
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,880
Okay.

364
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,990
And these things kept,
you know,

365
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,880
they have their friends and they'd sort
of lunge at him and then the friends

366
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:52,000
would jump out of the way and be like,
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I'm like laughing.

367
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,620
It's just like if you saw how big these
fucking things where it's just like,

368
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,473
okay,

369
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,040
they could like sort of
like at the 30% like bitch,

370
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,400
slap a refrigerator and the thing
would tip over and go flying across the

371
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:10,150
fucking room. You know what I mean?
And these guys are fucking with DC,

372
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,130
so this fucking lay goes over there.
This white lady making white people look,

373
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,280
look fucking stupid as shit.
She's like,

374
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,560
she fucking goes over to
this guy's God damn house.

375
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,570
He's got a giant fucking lion. All
right? And he goes, well, we'll get,

376
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,600
or a tiger assumption. And he
goes, I will get you comfortable.

377
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,760
We'll let you play with
some smaller ones first.

378
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,970
So she's playing with these
little ones in. Immediately I say,

379
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,070
I wouldn't fuck with that. I did. Long
time ago I was on Opie and Anthony.

380
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,830
They brought in a fucking
baby tiger and little ones,

381
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,980
little white ones is some shit.
And they asked me if they wanted a whole,

382
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,350
if I wanted to hold it. I was
like, no. The thing was upset.

383
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,910
It didn't want to fucking be there.

384
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,230
And I've been scratched by a house
cat fucking killed right now.

385
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,380
All it got me with one goddamn
claw when write down my forearm,

386
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,650
I had to put all this shit
on it so I wouldn't get some
sort of God damn disease.

387
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,410
And I'm looking at this,

388
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:05,480
this cute little baby tiger alive,

389
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,610
whatever the fuck it was.

390
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,380
And I sick freed and Roy once the Mariah
Carey one where it's all fucking white,

391
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,630
you know,
and uh,

392
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,930
I'm just looking at the size
of its fucking pause. I'm like,

393
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:20,290
then things pause already a like
four times the size of a house cat.

394
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,050
I've got scratched by a house cat.
This thing's in a bad mood.

395
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,900
I don't want to fuck, I don't want to
deal with the thing. You know, it's funny,

396
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:28,090
he's actually scratched Anthony,
if I remember correctly.

397
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:32,680
And he had to get like a tetanus shot
or something,

398
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:36,550
some sort of ointment had to be put
on his fucking neck. So anyways,

399
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:40,510
so this lady goes in there, right? And
she's playing with them. She's like,

400
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,420
oh my God, there's sword Jorell. And um,

401
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,230
was really not impressed
with the intellect of the
woman that thought they could

402
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:49,840
have got somebody a lot
of fucking smarter. Right.

403
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,980
So then she goes outside
to meet this line.

404
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,280
Okay,
this lioness,

405
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:02,290
and there's no way to describe
to you how big a fucking lion is.

406
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:06,010
It's not very often that you get to see
a person standing next to a Goddamn lied.

407
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,970
She walks up to the,
to in the general area,

408
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,000
this thing and the things
immediately looking at her,

409
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,790
the way of fucking wild animal
looks at you. You know what I mean?

410
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,310
It's the same way.
I've always said this is the same way,

411
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,310
like a fucking hooker looks at you
where there's no bullshit. You know,

412
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,190
you're going to a bar, some woman looks
at you, you know, chewing. If you know,

413
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,900
she's just trying to get a fucking drink
it, well, how could it looks at you? It's,

414
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:30,160
it's a real deal. Like,
yeah, I will fuck you. Okay.

415
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,190
You have to circumstances or are,
you know,

416
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,300
if you got the money I will
fuck you. Right. It's the
same thing with like lions.

417
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:40,750
They looking at you like, if the
opportunity arises, I will kill you.

418
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,310
You know, dogs don't look at you like
that. Fucking lions look at, you know,

419
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,680
cats attempted house cats,
you know,

420
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:50,660
you turn around and he'd catch
up stock and you and shit,

421
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,710
but then you look at them and then
they fucking run away. All right,

422
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,870
picture a cat doing that.
A house cat.

423
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,260
But you turn around and it's aligned and
it doesn't run away if fucking lunges

424
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:03,290
at you or maybe it gives you that
refrigerator bitch slap, right?

425
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:08,291
So this fucking thing is looking at her
and he's the owner who has no training

426
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,660
whatsoever. Brings his fucking thing.
I'll do, my palms were like sweaty.

427
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,190
I, I had to get, well when I was watching
it in bed, I literally stood up going,

428
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,700
what the fuck are you doing?
So the thing comes over,

429
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,180
immediately starts crawling on top of her,
it's on top of her.

430
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,110
And then she puts her hands on the side
of the thing. It starts like, like,

431
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,780
you know,
rubbing it like it's a giant dog.

432
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,070
And all I remember was that there's a
youtube video of that stunt man and worked

433
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:40,940
with bears and he had brought us some
sort of relative in there who wanted to

434
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,140
learn how to work with bears.

435
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,940
And he told him to keep his hands down
by his side and the bear came up and like

436
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,880
stood up on its back legs,
put its paws on the dude shoulder.

437
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,510
And he instinctively put his
hands on either side of the bear,

438
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,500
which the bear took as like an aggressive
move and one of the fight and it

439
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:01,100
fucking killed this guy. So she puts
her hands down and I see that and go,

440
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:04,580
oh fuck is this thing like a bear?
I don't fucking know.

441
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,640
And all of a sudden,
um,

442
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,000
she got just a little bit scared and
then the thing like collapsed down on her

443
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,160
and it got weird really quick.

444
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:18,161
And then the guy stood up with this rope
fucking leash and like quickly tries to

445
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:24,160
pull the lion away, what she does
and this woman gets up like, Oh wow,

446
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,120
that was Helen's.

447
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,500
I guess I feel like that was
like a spiritual experience
of Albert's like Bitchy,

448
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,060
woman's got fucking killed
and then the guy goes, yeah,

449
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:36,650
you got scared and it senses
your fear and then Oh God,

450
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,640
thank God she didn't make any high
pitched noise like the sound of an animal

451
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,950
like suffering. You know what I mean?
You have any other that like a dog toy,

452
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:45,020
you know when they bite on it and
it makes that high pitched noise,

453
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,360
it excites the Predator.
And um,

454
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,330
so I say to Nia,
I go,

455
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,320
how far into this show before they
show us somebody who got killed? I go,

456
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,130
I say about 17 minutes.
They did.

457
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:05,131
And it was at the end of the show and
they were just like two weeks after we

458
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:10,010
left. Um, this fucking woman,

459
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:14,030
basically the housekeeper comes in.
All right.

460
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,350
She didn't fucking do anything.

461
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,350
She's not like these fucking guys
who for some reason, like it's,

462
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:22,970
it's just total like male ego shit trying
to outdo the other fucking rich guy

463
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:24,650
down the street that
they get these things.

464
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,980
They don't know anything about
the animals. They fucking,

465
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,170
at least that's the way it was presented.

466
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,840
They didn't know shit about the fucking
animals. And then they were like, no,

467
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,530
the thing has a better life live in here.
It's walking around in a fucking cage.

468
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,700
You know, it was like, do what you
want to walk around in a cage. I mean,

469
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:41,720
you could always get knifed,

470
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:44,820
you could get killed the way
an animal couldn't in the wild.

471
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,720
Okay,

472
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,070
so fucking lion who's killing a
lion other than another human being.

473
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,060
Um, so anyways, uh,

474
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,830
this fucking housekeeper came in and uh,

475
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,750
she got mauled by these fucking lines
and they bring the woman in and the guy

476
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:08,350
tried to see a dog did it.
And they were like, ah,

477
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:13,150
these injuries are a little more than
a dog. And then the owner is like,

478
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,860
well, whatever, do you
mean? It's like, well,

479
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:19,570
she's missing her left arm and the
claw marks on this. And He, so,

480
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,680
you know what the fucking asshole
did? He had three lions. He went home,

481
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,470
he shot all of them, and then burn
their bodies out in the desert. So we,

482
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,840
you know, so nothing would fucking happen
to them. And, uh, it was just like, again,

483
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,270
it's like, yeah, there you go. They go
fucking inevitable. They had like Cheetos,

484
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,840
this guy's riding in a fucking six
wheeled Mercedes with a fucking Cheetah.

485
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,240
Okay.

486
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,940
And that woman's getting in
the car guy. Oh, it's, it's,

487
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,230
it's acting just like a dog. It's
panning. It's looking out the window.

488
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,860
Maybe they had to get somebody,
I'm not saying she was not a smart person,

489
00:27:56,861 --> 00:28:01,630
she just wasn't very aware
of the situation, I feel.
And I just kept hearing like,

490
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,740
there was,
back in the day,

491
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:07,270
like 50 def jam comics did bits about
how white people fuck with wild animals.

492
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,660
And so in a way I'm like,
oh, this is good for once.

493
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:15,070
It's not white people being idiots with
wild animals, you know, now it's Arabs.

494
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,630
Let's, let's, uh, you know,

495
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,170
take a little heat off a Whitey and then
they bring this white lady in there and

496
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,730
she fucking does everything that,
you know,

497
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,410
every one of those bits says that we do.

498
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,160
Yeah.

499
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,390
So anyways, let's get to some of the,
some of the reeds here for the week.

500
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,310
If I can,
if my fucking

501
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:32,850
okay.

502
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,710
Computer isn't going to tell me to
fucking, I dunno. Updates something. Um,

503
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:41,140
oh Jesus. Here we go. There we
go. Oh wait, I have to promote it.

504
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,730
This thing real quick. All right. I was
supposed to promote this regular hero,

505
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,590
um,

506
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,820
year in review. You can donate now and
be irregular hero to change a life today.

507
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:56,780
These people work around the world
to help the disadvantaged. They uh,

508
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,690
they are a non another
yet another nonprofit.

509
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,940
And I'm assuming that because
it's on my podcast that this is a,

510
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,960
this is actually a legit one.
You know,

511
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,200
they help out with hurricane Matthew,
skid row at risk youth.

512
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
Uh Oh.
Regularly Heroes Show [inaudible].

513
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,170
Okay.

514
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,950
Oh fuck. I've done one of these. Oh,
this is what Steve Simone thing, right.

515
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:27,670
The regular heroes show has been a
great fun and an awareness raiser.

516
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:32,440
Thanks to comedians. Bill Berg, Gabriel
Iglesias, Dane Cook, Daniel Tosh,

517
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,290
Chris Hardwick,
Chris Delea,

518
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,200
the world at the world famous
comedy store in the Improv. Yeah.

519
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:39,660
This is actually a legit one in a,

520
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,710
in a world where so many of
these nonprofits are, um,

521
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,530
a complete horse shit.
This is actually a legit one,

522
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,660
which is a very nice thing. Um, because
everything is a fucking nonprofit.

523
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:57,610
Like you remember that,
that that lady from a couple months back,

524
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,290
she,
uh,

525
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,120
she lost a job at that
nonprofit yet another nonprofit.

526
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,920
Uh, when she said that horrible
shit about Michelle Obama, you know,

527
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:13,650
and of course wrote it like a
dope. She said something like, uh,

528
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,900
it will be so refreshing to have a classy,
beautiful,

529
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,710
dignified first lady in the White House.
You mean that trophy wife?

530
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,970
Well, cause she wears a red blouse. All
of a sudden she's fucking, uh, you know,

531
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,190
a better person. She wrote, I'm
tired of seeing ape in heels,

532
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,140
not an a n a ape in heels.
And ape is capitalized.

533
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,730
Like it's a, I don't know somebody's
name or some shit like that.

534
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:47,150
And so of course she gets fucking,
she gets bounced out of this nonprofit.

535
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:50,800
She gets fired because everybody knows
that makes you less racist. You're racist,

536
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,270
and then you lose your job.
And then you go, oh, wait a
minute, what was I thinking?

537
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,250
Everybody is equal. Um,
so anyways, then the, uh,

538
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,830
the fucking mayor from this town,

539
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,460
Clay County is something Virginia,
Virginia,

540
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:10,940
West Virginia I guess
backed up her Goddamn, uh,

541
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,320
why you would do that. You
know, even if you were races,

542
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,380
you think you'd be smart enough,
keep your fucking mouth shut.

543
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:20,230
This person co-signed and
what the other person said.

544
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,620
And then the mayor had to fucking
resigned. So anyways, they actually,

545
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,860
so they fired the first lady who said
it from the Clay County Development

546
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,530
Corporation. Nonprofit. They're a
corporation that developed shit. And then,

547
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,420
but it's not for profit.
Well, let me ask you this.

548
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,220
How is this woman not homeless?

549
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:42,910
I don't get how you work for a
nonprofit and you're not homeless.

550
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,420
If there's no profit, how do they pay
you? This is what all corporations do.

551
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm in business.

552
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,360
I'm in business with a certain corporation
that claims in 90 to $180 million

553
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:59,740
loss a year. And the people I work
with are buying mansions out here,

554
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,000
redoing them.

555
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,550
I don't know how that works.

556
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,270
That's actually a different thing because
they're not considered a nonprofit.

557
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:12,490
They're considered a business entity.
And if he,

558
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,710
if you don't show that
you've earned any money,

559
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:19,270
then you don't have to pay any taxes.
Um, so the corporation doesn't,

560
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:25,000
but then everybody draws a salary.
Now you have to pay taxes on,

561
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,830
um, on the salary that you drew.
But however, if you just say,

562
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:33,310
and you're not making a profit,
you don't have to pay any taxes.

563
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:35,800
And I would think that all that extra
money that you didn't pay taxes on,

564
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:39,040
you then just disperse
amongst your employees, right?

565
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,000
So rather than making a million a year,

566
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,630
you make 2 million a year and
then you pay taxes on that. Right.

567
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,220
I don't know how it
works. I don't, you know,

568
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,650
I'm too stupid to figure out
how that shit works. But, um,

569
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,711
for the life of me,

570
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:54,470
I looked up this nonprofit
trying to figure out what
the fuck they do. I cannot,

571
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:59,300
I can't figure it out. So anyways,
they fired these fucking lady. And um,

572
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,570
then like a month later, they
just reinstated her. They
just reinstated her. And,

573
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,750
uh, I don't know. To me
that is the Trump influence.

574
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,850
I think that that's what
everybody learned from Trump.

575
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,450
It's just like you just say, Hey, you
know, that's locker room talk or a,

576
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,300
you know, alright, he's fired and he
comes back. Hey, you know, I'm back. Yeah.

577
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:23,780
You know, I lie, I left for six
weeks and, uh, back. Uh, you know,

578
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,070
and what I love with media is there's
no follow up after the first story.

579
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:30,990
The first story is done.
There's the,

580
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,220
there's the whole fucking everybody
flipping out. Let's go burn the witch.

581
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,960
And then once it dies down, then you
just bring the person back and nobody,

582
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,380
they've moved onto something else.
Um, I don't know. It's really bizarre.

583
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:45,710
I just don't know how somebody could
fucking be in business with somebody like

584
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:50,320
that. It's fucking nuts. Anyways,
all right, me undies, uh, oh Jesus.

585
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,070
But Opal, me, undies,

586
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,910
me undies rubbing up on
your Cogley Doo Doo Doo. Me,

587
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:59,620
Andy's me undies. It's like
a sheepskin fucking saw. Ugh.

588
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:04,910
It's so fucking soft up against your Tate.
You know,

589
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:08,960
you fucking love it. Um, your Dick,

590
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:13,340
you will page with a pair of fucking me
undies. Why would you paint your deck?

591
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:17,090
I don't know. How many fucking
times can I sing this picture.

592
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:21,320
A world in a world where putting on a
new pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

593
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,650
You're stepping into a
better day. You know, I bet.

594
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:28,340
Where's me undies or lives in me undies?
Lifestyle is Mariah Carey.

595
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,950
I noticed the second time I brought
her up, but that fucking channel,

596
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,910
Nia keeps watching.

597
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,500
I know one of these reality shows that's
following Mariah Carey around. Dude,

598
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:38,660
she's fucking hilarious.
Every fucking shot.

599
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:43,310
She's like laying in a bed in an evening
gown with heels on full makeup and

600
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:44,900
everything with a glass of wine.

601
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,700
It's like in the 1950s what people
thought rich people did all day.

602
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:55,050
Just laying around with like,
you know,

603
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,360
some fucking $300,000 diamond necklace.
It's like, we get it. You're a diva.

604
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,750
Jesus Christ. She never
wear sweatpants. You know,

605
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,430
just to have a fucking white
Zinfandel over there. Um,

606
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,160
anyways, it says, think about it under,

607
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,250
where's the first thing you put on in
the last thing you take off unless you

608
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:16,460
weird. You know what if you don't
like your torso, what have you,

609
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,090
one of those guys that fucks with his
shirt on, you know, you sweaty tee shirt,

610
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,510
right? You know what I mean? He's
still a good tee shirt on. You know,

611
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:28,550
ladies,
if you're fucking a guy wears man ted.

612
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,640
That's when you know he's really letting
you win is when he takes the t shirt

613
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,790
off to our Jesus. But why
would you say that? All right.

614
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,511
Think about it and underwear.

615
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:39,090
It's about why would you settle for
anything less than the best feeling

616
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,290
underwear on the planet.

617

most comfortable underwear you've ever

Uh,

619
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,900
my friends at me and he sent me a few
pairs awhile back and now I can't imagine

620
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,510
wearing anything else.
Why do you keep putting it in the copy?

621
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,100
You sent me two pairs.
I wore them.

622
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,250
One I liked the other with
the Greg Lou gain is cut.

623
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:03,990
And I don't think I wasn't in that shape.
You know, you sent me the Olympic diver.

624

Fucking scabies there.
You know

625
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,250
Jesus Christ.
I went from muffin top to like,

626
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:15,240

one? Up to pastry ladder. Um,

711
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,560
I get all these aren't all, well,
some of these are reads I fucked up.

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,750
so according to the emails,

736
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,310
somebody wanted me to look at this
fucking thing and it's simply says crazy

737
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,300
Asian sport.

738
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,320
Saw The son read it and
needed you to see it.

739
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,940
A Merry Christmas. Twinkle lies.
All right, let's see what this is.

740
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,490
Oh my God. All right. Let me hit pause
here. This is basically, this is,

741
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,570
I want to go to this.
All right.

742
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:10,630
There's this whole
group of fucking dude's,

743
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,530
they're all dressed in white.
Oh my God.

744
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,340
They're all huddled around a pole and
there's a guy sitting on top of the

745
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:23,341
fucking Paul and then another group of
dudes come in wearing orange shirts and

746
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:25,354
the fucking,

747
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,350
they all have on like Olympic
boxing headgear and then when,

748
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,070
when the fucking orange Jude's coming in,

749
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:33,990
they're trying to knock
the guy off to Paul.

750
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,780
This is like fucking
ads fighting each other.

751
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,080
Yeah,

752
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,130
dude,
you fucking asshole.

753
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:41,650
How can you show me this and
not tell me what sport this is?

754
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,090
They tried to knock the guy off the
fucking poll. What is this called?

755
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,950
And what happens is,
is basically everybody gets piled on.

756
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,040
Once the orange crew comes
in, oh, there's a weak guy.

757
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,840
He turned and ran the other fucking way.

758
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,170
They start jumping up on top
of each other. Oh my God.

759
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,560
That would be so fucking claustrophobic.
It's basically like a rugby scrum.

760
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,170
If you could throw fucking
punches and you climb in,

761
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,870
just imagine a rugby scrum
and rather than the ball,

762
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:13,530
one of the rugby dudes was sitting up
on a pole and they're trying to fucking

763
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:14,364
knock them off.

764
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,333
Wow,
dude.

765
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:24,060
They're just kicking each other in
the face. I swear to God, you know,

766
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,870
how the fuck did I get so lucky to
be born in this goddamn country?

767
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:31,920
Where did they at least pretend
to give a shit about wellbeing?

768
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,430
And your like, that is a fucking
hardcore sport. You know what?

769
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:37,590
Hat's off to fucking Asia right there.

770
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,100
I would love to see them and try
to get this. This is barbaric.

771
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,270
You don't try to do it in our country.

772
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,690
Like is everybody's listening
from America. My country,

773
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:47,640
I should say this is barbaric.
This is,

774
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,700
this is promoting violence against
people at different kinds of shirts on.

775
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,900
I mean, I don't even understand. What is
it? What is, what is the purpose of this?

776
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,770
Um, can you please tell
me the name of that sport?

777
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,100
Am I ever gonna get over this fucking
cough and smoked a cigar and forever I'm

778
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:07,950
getting eight hours sleep.
Not really, you know,

779
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:11,590
knee is tossing and turning
and every fucking minute now.
I literally, you know, I,

780
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:15,990
I, I sleep in bed for like half the night
and then after awhile I just ended up

781
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:19,920
going upstairs and I fall asleep, you
know? And I want to do the same thing.

782
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:23,670
Like when the baby comes, I'm just going
to be one of the baby cries too much.

783
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,740
I'm just going to be like,
you know what,

784
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,850
I can't deal with either one of you and
I'm going to go upstairs and I'm going

785
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,050
to put on an evening God
like Mariah Carey and

786
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,080
inlay here with my fucking diamonds on.
I Dunno,

787
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,910
maybe it's just for the show,
but I just look at it as like,

788
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:42,900
this person is out of there.

789
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:46,950
If they just at some point it's just
completely lost touch of reality.

790
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,330
Um, there's something about that when you
get like backup dancers and they're all

791
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,300
hanging on your every word and they,
and they literally want to be you.

792
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:56,310
Like there's no way to keep,

793
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,810
keep yourself tethered to any sort
of fucking reality. Um, all right.

794
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,060
Advice, age, different
story. First of all,

795
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:07,350
did I talk about everything I wanted to
fucking talk about this week? I'm all,

796
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:11,580
let's talk about how you guys doing with
your Chi. If you late to the podcast,

797
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,050
you can still start right now,
man.

798
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:16,380
I've been trying to do a half hour cardio
every single day because as you know,

799
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:20,280
between Thanksgiving and new year's,

800
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:23,030
she eat all of this fucking shit.
You put on weight and then you got to do,

801
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:27,900
you just start the year behind the
eight ball by the eight ball. Right?

802
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,910
I was like,
I'm not fucking doing that.

803
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,840
So as of December 1st I've
been trying to do a cardio,

804
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:37,850
a half hour cardio every
single fucking day. And um,

805
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,310
of course I fucked up, right? I, um,

806
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,541
what did I do?
I,

807
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:48,541
I made it through the first 11 days and
then December 12th I had a busy morning

808
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,500
and you really got to knock it out in
the morning, which I didn't. And uh,

809
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:53,820
the day got longer and longer.

810
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:58,380
And then I came home and he was watching
some fucking TV and she was just like,

811
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,810
I need comfort. And I
was just like, all right,

812
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,640
acting like I was a good
husband rather than like,

813
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:06,630
I don't want to get them that fucking
elliptical again. So I missed a half hour.

814
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:10,830
On the 12th, 13th I did my
half hour. So I had 1,213 days,

815
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,240
14th I missed. Then I was like, fuck,

816
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:19,170
this is becoming a trend now.
I owe that machine down there.

817
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,920
60 minutes plus the 30 for today.
That was Friday,

818
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:26,900
December 15th so I got on that
elliptical bop, blah blah blah,

819
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,920
Dodo, no baby baby red cakes. Um,

820
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,490
I got on the thing and I
did an hour and 11 minutes,

821
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,560
71 minutes out of the 90 minutes.

822
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,100
I just looked at it like
it was a basketball game or
a sporting event that was

823
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:46,150
down by 90 points.
And so the next day I started my day,

824
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,300
I was down 19 points plus the 30 I had
to do and I ended up doing an hour on the

825
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,454
elliptical.

826
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,830
So now I was up 11 minutes
and then I liked it.

827
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,170
I liked the results of doing a
fucking hour. So then, uh, on,

828
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:07,090
say I did a an hour and four minutes.

829
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:11,740
So then now I'm up. I was down
90 minutes now I was up, uh,

830
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,270
an hour and 15, also known as 75 minutes.
And then yesterday I did an hour,

831
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,180
15 minutes. Uh, so I don't even
know what I'm up at this point.

832
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,040
45 minutes plus the next
to 45, I'm actually up 90
minutes, something like that.

833
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:28,070
I don't know what the fuck it is. I can't
really remember. But all I wanted to do,

834
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,560
I was going to do a half hour every
day and that was going to be a,

835
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,040
so 31 days it'd be 15 and a
half hours of cardio. But uh,

836
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,430
now I think I'm just going to do hours
every day for the rest of the fucking

837
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:43,640
year. I weighed myself the
other day. I was one 77.

838
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,180
Now when I came back from fucking Europe,
I was a buck 90.

839
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:50,060
So I've taken 13 pounds off since,
um,

840
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,720
since that trip. So I dunno, it's
all about the fucking cardio. Um,

841
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,150
I would love to do that. You know,
if you know what the reality is,

842
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:03,710
is if you've got an elliptical every
day and did fucking 60 minutes,

843
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,100
if you just did that, you know,
and, and when you do that,

844
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:10,070
when you put together a playlist,
that's when you got to love. I tell you,

845
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:13,070
you got to love like bands like
iron maiden or they have six,

846
00:49:13,071 --> 00:49:17,120
seven minutes songs, you know, at least
the songs, or at least four minutes,

847
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,530
which is a huge fucking chunk.
You don't want,

848
00:49:19,531 --> 00:49:21,920
I just put my sweatshirt over
the clock and I'm just like,

849
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:25,610
I just peek at the clock after
every song's done. All right?

850
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,940
So if you just do one
a half hour of cardio,

851
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:32,270
you got to listen to rhyme of the
ancient mariner. It's a 13 minute song,

852
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,763
you know?

853
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,220
Okay.

854
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,020
Hi Buddy. Hey chip. Married of the whole
fucking thing. There you go. Jay showed

855
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,080
bye bye. [inaudible] he listened
to the whole fucking thing.

856
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,310
The courtesy they apart,
right?

857
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:51,770
Okay.

858
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,110
You're going to go from fucking
27 minutes down to 14 minutes.

859
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,080
He likes is a fucking joke. I
always tried to put it on, you know,

860
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,590
have it come on time. It was
like 21 minutes, you know,

861
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,750
and then I just covered up
because the next time I look,

862
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,450
I'm going to be in single digits. I'll
be done at like eight or nine minutes.

863
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:11,590
It's fucking tremendous.
But, um, anyways, I uh,

864
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,340
okay.

865
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,001
A buddy of mine,

866
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:17,810
my drum teacher was showing me
this fucking song this week and uh,

867
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:18,980
I dunno how I slept in this one.

868
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,950
I've always been a big Soundgarden fan
is somehow I never heard that song rhino

869
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:26,840
sore and a, as always, Matt came
with the sickest fucking drums.

870
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,030
Uh, I become obsessed with that
song in that fucking album.

871
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,680
And uh, when I saw it, I thought
it said 2016 I was like, oh,

872
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:38,810
they got back together.
This is their latest shit.

873
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:41,000
And then I looked again and sit in 1996

874
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,040
every fucking thing that I listened
to. I don't know what happened. We,

875
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,610
I think part of it cause I got old and
then I was also like trying to fucking

876
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,960
get somewhere as a comedian.

877
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,110
I just completely missed out on like 20
years of music and like half the shit

878
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,780
people show me. I'm like, that's,
that sounds fucking, you know,

879
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:03,410
it always sounds like it's brand new to
me when that come out. And they're like,

880
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:07,070
yeah, like 2002. I was like, ah, I just,

881
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:09,830
I just can't get contemporary.
I got 20 years of Shit.

882
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:12,290
I got a fucking sift through.
Um,

883
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,670
so if there's any other
drummers out there, you know,

884
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:20,810
part of my lessons is
they'll play shit at the end,

885
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,100
like ear training shit. Like you got to
try to figure out the groove you got. Oh,

886
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,140
you got to figure out what
time signature was in.

887
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,020
And this was to figure out
what time signature was in.

888
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:34,760
And of course I was fucking it
up and a few drummers out there,

889
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:38,060
it's in six,
but if you count the eighth notes,

890
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:41,630
you just count up to 12 in the
phrasing is seven and five.

891
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,160
Um, and I would play it for you on
here, but I always just feel like,

892
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:48,830
because I do advertising,
if I play any music,

893
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,823
mmm.

894
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,390
Then all of a sudden is going
to come after me be like,

895
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:57,300
you owe us money cause you made money
off of me on these while you played our

896
00:51:57,301 --> 00:52:00,060
fucking song or whatever. Um, anyways,

897
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,970
what do you guys think
of the Patriot yesterday?

898
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,200
Everybody's flipping out about our
defense. Like, I don't know what the big,

899
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,850
you know, we beat the Ravens
and the Ravens did this,

900
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,860
they got that subs guy.
But back in the,

901
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,340
the edge sogs they had ray
Lewis and they had ed reed.

902
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:22,790
So they're big three is basically
down to one dude and you know,

903
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,560
they're not who the fuck they were.

904
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,340
And then we beat the Broncos in mile
high where we never fucking win.

905
00:52:30,341 --> 00:52:34,800
But they basically never going to
get a rookie quarterback. I Dunno,

906
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,160
I get so frustrated with the Patriots
because it seems like they only protect

907
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:41,880
their offensive players. They'd been,
I know I've been bitching about this,

908
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:45,660
but they just, you know, they're fucking
cornerback. Whatever the fuck his name is,

909
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,000
Taylor Lib, whatever the fuck his
name is. Like he, when he was with us,

910
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,710
that that whole side of his whole squadron
sexual, the field was just shut down.

911
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,040
What didn't we like about that?
Why don't we just keep that guy,

912
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:04,950
you know, we always, we got fucking wide
receivers. We got fucking a quarterback.

913
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,860
That's where we keep all our fucking
man. You know what? This is my theory.

914
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,820
Bill Bellacheck is such a defensive
genius. I think he just thinks like,

915
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:16,500
you know what? I don't fucking
need a, you know, I don't,

916
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:20,550
I don't look at this. My fucking computer
just decided, you know, I said, hey,

917
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,400
do you know, contact me in an
hour. And I was like, all right.

918
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:26,910
And I was going by and I was just
thinking with my fucking phone, like,

919
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:31,120
who's doing this?
So weird.

920
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,920
It's like all these fucking satellites
just fucking pointed at you. I don't know.

921
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,000
Anyways, um, I think he just,

922
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:39,360
yeah.

923
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,000
Is convinced that he can take
any second round draft pick,

924
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:47,270
train this person into being a n NFL
quality player at that position slash

925
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,830
borderline all pearl if you,
and if you become an all pro,

926
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,770
Danny just fucking gets ready
at the second you want money

927
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,300
just fucking been doing it forever.
But back in the day, you know,

928
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:06,410
we keep McGuinness, we kept rebel. So
our defense, I felt like had an identity.

929
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:09,240
Now it's like every three years it's
like a whole new fucking defense.

930
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,300
It drives me up the fucking wall.

931
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:13,070
Okay.

932
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,470
I Dunno, we'll see. Cause
I watched the giants,

933
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:18,560
you know and you know
like all patriots fans,

934
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:20,720
every year when the
giants go on their run,

935
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,270
you get this sickening feeling in
your stomach going like, oh fuck yeah,

936
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,600
you want to play him again?
Cause we got to beat him one time.

937
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,090
You know when I was sitting
there going like, all right,

938
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:32,450
well they lost Tom Kaufland. This is
going to be huge. And Lo and behold,

939
00:54:32,451 --> 00:54:36,580
they're doing it again. They're on
another fucking run. All right, big. Yeah,

940
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:38,750
the defense looks fucking amazing.
You know,

941
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:40,130
I'm not saying a defense
doesn't look good,

942
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:44,900
but it does not look as good
as theirs. And um, I dunno,

943
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,890
that's the giants thing.

944
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:49,250
Like the only thing about the giants as
they don't score any fucking points for

945
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:53,540
whatever fucking reason they got eli who's
a goddamn beast. They got the fucking,

946
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,410
uh, they got the diva
there. What's his name? Uh,

947
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:00,980
I don't,
my short term memory's for shit.

948
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,450
Yeah,

949
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:04,470
I just thought Wyatt,

950
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,690
I can't fucking remember his last name
is same name as the fucking soccer play

951
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:12,780
with all the tattoos.
Who's married to the spice girl.

952
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,800
Okay,

953
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,710
back up. Bend it like Beckham, Odell
Beckham. There you go. See that?

954
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:20,830
I'm learning on my fucking old brainworks
now I've got to go on one of those

955
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:25,310
brain exercise websites to try to help
you with your short term memory. Um,

956
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,210
I dunno, I'm fascinated how they can
have him at wide receiver. You know,

957
00:55:31,211 --> 00:55:33,640
I don't know if they play in that
Cruz guy a bunch of fucking money,

958
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:35,560
but they got eli,
they're able to keep him.

959
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:37,690
But then on the other side
of the ball they got JPP.

960
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:41,460
And if he didn't fucking mess up
his hand like they, they seem to be,

961
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,060
they're more balanced.

962
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,523
Yeah.

963
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,980
You know, so one of Chandler Jones
wanted money. Fucking earned it.

964
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,980
Sometimes I just feel like we're getting,
I don't know what the fuck she built,

965
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,880
how many super bowls to they have to
win before you realize bill Belichick's

966
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:58,560
knows what he's doing. I know, I know.

967
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,860
I'm just looking at the NFC west and
it just seems like this stronger,

968
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:06,630
I'll tell you right now, the Dallas
Cowboy, you buy it, sell it. I'm selling.

969
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:09,360
I don't believe in him.
I don't believe in the Dallas cowboys.

970
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:11,050
I don't believe in that coach.
I don't know about, you know,

971
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,560
this is just totally based on, I
look at that guy and I go, I don't,

972
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:17,820
I don't believe in that guy.
I just don't.

973
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,940
Uh,
Pete Carroll is a fucking based,

974
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,040
Eli is an animal and their coach,
who

975
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,040
I swear to God looks like he
wants some radio contest is uh,

976
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,990
is a,
is a wolf in sheep's clothing,

977
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,060
is a wolf and upper deck fucking eating
a pretzel and get mustard all over his

978
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:40,630
face. Clothing. Um, I
think one of those teams,

979
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,070
and this is really isn't
going out on a limb,

980
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,310
I think one of those two
teams goes to the, uh,

981
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,830
to the Superbowl and having watched
both teams, I think I would rather play,

982
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,380
um, I rather play Seattle. And that's only
because Seattle, you know, once you went,

983
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:59,960
a couple of you went to, when a soup
bowl you go to back to back, you know,

984
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,660
they lost too many guys.
Um,

985
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,250
not to say that they could beat the
patriots every fucking beat us this year.

986
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:11,020
But, uh, we'll see bossy. I never fucking
believe in my team. You know what I mean?

987
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:15,850
I don't know why. I always just see the
fucking, you know, why are we doing this?

988
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,430
Why are we doing that? Um, so
anyways, we shall see. But uh,

989
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,120
be nice to play the giants again and
finally fucking win. We'd actually,

990
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:28,750
we would have to win that game or else
Tom Brady would forever just get ripped

991
00:57:28,751 --> 00:57:32,410
on sports, talk radio, buy all his mouth
breathing dopes. They will be like, yeah,

992
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,320
don't,
don't do it.

993
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,760
Like it was just one on one game.
Like Tom Brady.

994
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:49,761
Every Superbowl has not let his team
down the field for the winning score.

995
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:54,960
He's had to do that. Every Superbowl
that he's been in, you know,

996
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:00,480
and four out of six times the defense
went out and did their job and two times

997
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,850
they did not.
Um,

998
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:07,380
and I'm not taking it away from fucking
Eli because two times Eli beat our

999
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:12,150
defense, but he beat our defense.
He did not be Tom Brady. However,

1000
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,050
when you're the quarterback, you
take all the brain blame, you know,

1001
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,340
all you gotta do is look at Dan Marino
and the ridiculous level of Shit that

1002
00:58:20,341 --> 00:58:24,810
that guy takes to spite the fact,
all the records that, that guy,

1003
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,400
I've never understood it. It's just,
uh, did he have to tackle people too?

1004
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:33,180
Was he supposed to run the ball up the
gut to fucking eat up some of the clock?

1005
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:34,763
MMM.

1006
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,830
I Dunno. Right? It's just so fucking the
shit that Dan Marino gets us the dumbest.

1007
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:46,390
It's the dumbest ever. This is how much
the game has changed, by the way. Uh,

1008
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,750
I looked this up the other day just
because all they do is fucking throw the

1009
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:54,370
ball and I looked up all time,
you know,

1010
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,460
running backs,
just rushing all the time for your career.

1011
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,880
And I'll tell you right now,
what's his face? Emmitt Smith.

1012
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,940
No one's going to break that
fucking record the way, the way,

1013
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,040
they just don't run the
fucking ball anymore.

1014
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:10,360
No one's going to get anywhere near that
thing. Uh, let me look this shit up.

1015
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,220
Like I looked it up yesterday

1016
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,380
and um,

1017
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,230
not now. I don't know. Install these
fucking things. Fuck off Jesus.

1018
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,010
It's like a

1019
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,180
fucking kid tugging at you,
Manny. Manny, Manny, um,

1020
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,050
where we go all time NFL rushers.

1021
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:37,050
Um, all right. Where the fuck
is it? Pro Football reference.

1022
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:40,220
This is the best thing ever.
So I look this shit up. Okay.

1023
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:45,630
And in the top 20, top 20, all like,

1024
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:50,680
as of right now, there's only
three active players in the top 20.

1025
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:54,250
The first seven are all retired.

1026
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:59,830
Okay. The, the, the, the highest ranking
one is Frank Gore who has 12,000,

1027
00:59:59,831 --> 01:00:04,750
931 yards. All right. Then you
got to go all the way down to 16.

1028
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:09,580
You got Adrian Peterson who granted took
a year off because he beat his kids up

1029
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:12,910
with, with something he found in
the woods. Uh, Adrian Peterson,

1030
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:17,410
and then he got Steven Jackson at 18.
All right, you go to the all time.

1031
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,190
Uh,
where the fuck is it passing?

1032
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,190
When the hell is it passing yards?

1033
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,820
How hard is it to find that passing yards?
All right,

1034
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:29,710
so there's only,
there's only,

1035
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,610
there's only a three active
players. Top 20 rushing, right?

1036
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,030
Starts at eight and ends at 18.
All right.

1037
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,920
Passing all time.
There is in the top 14,

1038
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,630
there's six active players,

1039
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,590
six active players in the top 14 all time.

1040
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:54,770
There's only eight of the qbs in the
history of the NFL that is thrown as many

1041
01:00:54,871 --> 01:00:58,110
or more yards than six
current fucking players.

1042
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,770
And the top two all time.
Our Peyton manning and Brett Farve,

1043
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,970
Peyton manning just retired last year.
Brett Farve retired six years ago.

1044
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,530
It's fucking unbelievable.
Like how much this game has changed.

1045
01:01:10,531 --> 01:01:14,490
And there's only two really
old school names, uh,

1046
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,970
in the top 20.
Is Johnny Unitas.

1047
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:23,610
Where's the other one? And
Fran Tarkington and uh, once,

1048
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:25,980
what's his face like a

1049
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:32,760
John Elway Warren Moon. That class? Uh,

1050
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,630
Dan Fouts, Joe Montana. They
came in, they did their damage.

1051
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:37,990
Yeah.

1052
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,910
Do Kerry Collins is in the fucking,
he's 16th all time. So he goes,

1053
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:46,090
so you got Peyton Manning's one.
Brett Farve is to drew.

1054
01:01:46,091 --> 01:01:50,340
Brees is three was 65,462 yards.
He's an,

1055
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:54,490
he's less than 7,000
yards less. Uh, what? Six,

1056
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,180
6,500 yards away from owning the record.

1057
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:02,290
Dan Marino's fourth. Then
it's Tom Brady. John Elway,

1058
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:06,190
Warren Moon than Eli Manning is eight.
Then Fran Tarkenton,

1059
01:02:06,191 --> 01:02:10,840
then Ben Roethlisberger, Vinny
Testaverde, Philip Rivers,

1060
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,400
drew Bledsoe, Carson Palmer, Dan
Fouts. I've seen like everybody,

1061
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,190
all of these people play in my lifetime.

1062
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:23,010
I catch the end of friend targeting
Dan Fouts, Kerry Collins, Joe Montana,

1063
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:26,760
Johnny United Stated and see
Dave Craig, boomer, Esiason,

1064
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:29,410
Donovan McNabb. All right. Done.

1065
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:33,330
We've Navis is 21st all time.
Um,

1066
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,560
that's how much the fucking game has
changed. It's, it's unbelievable.

1067
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:44,910
What it is, is that these guys are like
throwing for four yards, five, six yards.

1068
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:47,760
It's shit he used to give to the
running back. So I think Emmitt Smith,

1069
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:50,170
Walter Payton, those guys, no one's
going to touch their phone. I don't know.

1070
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,740
I don't know how you'd get enough
fucking attempts to even do it.

1071
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:58,890
Um, was there a point to that bill? I'm,
yeah, let's say they throw the ball a lot.

1072
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:02,760
I guess that's what I'm saying.
Jimmer say completely changed.

1073
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:05,630
And then not nothing too is just the
way that they protect the fucking

1074
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:07,980
quarterback. You know, when
they call it the Tom Brady rule,

1075
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,130
because that time he turned around
and looked at the referee, said, Hey,

1076
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,440
somebody touched my jersey. And then
referee was like, oh, I'm sorry.

1077
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:18,120
He fucking threw the flag.
Yeah.

1078
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:20,070
Everybody calls it the Tom Brady rule,
which I love.

1079
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:23,130
I love that they call it the Tom
Brady rule. Cause it is, you know,

1080
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:27,220
you gotta protect your quarterback, sets
your money. Everybody realizes that, uh,

1081
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,410
you know, when, when the best, you know,
everybody knows the fucking quarterback.

1082
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,360
That guy gets knocked out.
No one's going to watch the game.

1083
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:36,390
So they protect the hell out of them and
they're like, yeah, fuck everybody else.

1084
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,870
And uh, people who not into
sports, they're into offense.

1085
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,660
They want to see some action.
So they just, they, you know,

1086
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,660
now it's like a legal to cover,
cover a fucking receiver

1087
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,220
to Dan Marino did the shit you could
do during that guy's fucking career and

1088
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:53,750
he's still through for like
60,000 fucking yards. I Dunno

1089
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,970
if he's talking about steroids.
Right.

1090
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,750
And then they put an asterisk next
to your name. You know, they don't,

1091
01:04:00,751 --> 01:04:03,030
you don't have those same way they
don't give Barry bonds is just do,

1092
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:05,280
it's just like, Hey, are you going
to sit there and tell me, you know,

1093
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,290
all of these fucking guys were as
good as Dan Marino with the yard.

1094
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:12,060
So putting up the fuck out
of here. All right. Um,

1095
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:15,960
in Feis age difference
and history a dear bill,

1096
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:21,250
I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a
bill. Um, I'm a big fan of yours.

1097
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,280
I really enjoy your podcast, your,
thank you very much. I appreciate it.

1098
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:28,870
I am 28 years old and in a relationship
with my girlfriend who's seven years

1099
01:04:28,871 --> 01:04:32,470
younger than me and who I plan on
marrying were really great together.

1100
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:37,150
I love her. Well congratulations.
The thing is is as our
relationship has gone on,

1101
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,320
we've slashed, I've been getting some
static from people about our relationship.

1102
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:43,990
Well who gives a fuck what they think?

1103
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:46,750
Like I said,
she's seven years younger than me,

1104
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:48,310
but we've known each other for a while.

1105
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:53,260
We've met when I was working at my first
job as a counselor at a camp when she

1106
01:04:53,261 --> 01:04:55,360
was one of the kids.
Oh Jesus.

1107
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:58,760
When we first met I was 17 and she was 10.
Yeah.

1108
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:03,750
Uh Yeah Yap, Yap man. There that,

1109
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,130
that's that creepy thing.
That's that creepy hippie

1110
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,670
thing. Cause at some point you were
like, oh look at that little kid.

1111
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,150
That's the woody Allen moment where
you go, oh, isn't she adorable?

1112
01:05:13,151 --> 01:05:16,570
And then at some point the
switch flips to be in like, Hey,

1113
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,600
I think I want to fuck
that. You know, there's,

1114
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:22,840
there's no way to get around that sir.
He'd have to understand that. So anyways,

1115
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:25,900
he says nothing happened between us
at that point. Well, I would hope so.

1116
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,220
It wasn't until we reconnected years
later when we were older that we started

1117
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:32,980
talking again and really getting
to know each other. All right,

1118
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:37,210
well I guess that's fair, but people are
going to say some shit. Right? Anyway,

1119
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,990
I'm getting shit from some family
and friends because of our history.

1120
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,260
Just from an outside source.
I'd like to know what you think.

1121
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,060
Do you think it's strange or weird?

1122
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:50,620
I know there's people out there 15 to 20
years apart. It's just with our history,

1123
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:52,090
it throws people off again.

1124
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,970
What do you think from an
unbiased perspective perspective?

1125
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:56,800
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

1126
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:01,750
The thing is is that you were 17 and
she was 10 when you first met her. Um,

1127
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,190
that's what makes it weird.

1128
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:04,893
MMM.

1129
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,300
Like my wife is 10 years younger than me,
but I didn't meet her until I was like,

1130
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,940
you know,
35 and she was 25.

1131
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:14,943
MMM.

1132
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,630
Hey Nia, come in. Here is a question.

1133
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,230
Somebody, uh, somebody is a 28,

1134
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,680
what did he say? That Wendy
Hoodie. So out of breath for

1135
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,450
come here. Yeah. You need a place
to sit here. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah.

1136
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:34,340
So this guy, he's dating this
woman, right? He wants to marry.

1137
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,920
He's 28 she's 21 he said, the thing
is, I met her when I was a counselor.

1138
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,610
I was 17 she was only 10 he goes,
obviously right,

1139
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,620
nothing happened.
Then

1140
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,040
he goes, obviously nothing happened
then, but now that we're together,

1141
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,510
people are given a shit.

1142
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,500
And I was saying how there was a 10 year
difference between us, but I, you know,

1143
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:52,334
I was 35 yeah,

1144
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,810
25 right. So, so they're
looking at you like, uh,

1145
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:02,020
you've been grooming her since she
was like seven years old. Yeah.

1146
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:05,140
But he like met her but then didn't
seem like he didn't see her for a while.

1147
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:07,720
Then they reconnected and had
all the chorus, which happens.

1148
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,870
Don't worry about it if you know
everything's on the up and up.

1149
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,560
Just just do your thing. Yeah.
Is there a family cool with it,

1150
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,890
you know,
is her family given him the side eye?

1151
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:21,460
Like he was grooming her or
seems to just be friends.

1152
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,630
What do you mean? His friends?
People that he knows it just like,

1153
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,610
this is what I would do.
I would just,

1154
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,120
whatever those Pete runs are giving
him shit about it. I wouldn't,

1155
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:34,540
if you meet new people, I wouldn't tell
them that that's how you first met him.

1156
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,033
Probably not.

1157
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:40,600
And not everybody needs to know your
entire history and that way just because

1158
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:44,260
people will misinterpret it. But
yeah. Have you guys are fine.

1159
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,870
Your family's are fine. Like
don't worry about it. Yeah.

1160
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:49,630
As long as nothing happen when
you were a counselor. Exactly.

1161
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,910
As long as you're sure nothing
happened when you were a council there,

1162
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,800
which I'm sure they didn't, he always
wants to push her on this. Swink oh God.

1163
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:00,920
I know.
It's bad.

1164
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,200
All right. I want to see, I did it to you.
Sorry. You're gonna you're gonna have to,

1165
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,310
you know, this is certain level of shit
you're going to have to deal with. Um,

1166
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,323
where are you going?

1167
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,070
I'm going. I'm going out to have a
little, a little breakfast with a friend.

1168
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,220
I didn't like the vagueness of that.
Having a little with a friend.

1169
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,570
I'm going to get smoothies with Chelsea
Peretti. Oh, he didn't have to say that.

1170
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,230
Smoothies.
Chelsea Peretti

1171
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,460
Sacramento zone. Chelsea Peretti. Yeah,

1172
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:35,450
she's from Sacramento.
No, Hella Sacramento.

1173
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:43,160
Um, she's white trash
from, uh, yes she is.

1174
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:48,050
She's white trash from
northern California and she is,

1175
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,650
she's also a Republican. Um, anyway.

1176
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,700
All right. Where the fuck am I? Um, yeah,
I do it just, you know who gives a fuck?

1177
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,770
This is the deal. Once you get married,
you have fucking kids and shit.

1178
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:04,080
You're never going to see anybody anyway.
So who gives a fuck?

1179
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:09,090
Who gives a fuck what people think?
Go out and do what makes you happy.

1180
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:12,810
Okay. As long as you're not hurting
anybody and you're not breaking a law,

1181
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,000
please go out and do it before.

1182
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:18,900
Just being happy becomes
illegal because, uh, you know,

1183
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,260
just the level that the
population is going in, you know,

1184
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:23,730
I'm thinking by the end of my life,

1185
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:25,380
I don't know what it's
going to be like over here.

1186
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:30,170
I hope we don't end up like China. With
China. It's so fucking overpopulated.

1187
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:33,540
They've got to like people, nobody
drive cars for like five fucking days.

1188
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:36,150
And just the shit that they're dealing
with is a, it's brutal over there.

1189
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,200
What are you doing? Yeah, take
the priests, take the priests.

1190
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:44,750
I still have the Prius. Everybody.
I'm going to be selling the car.

1191
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,020
I just can't find the title.
So I sent,

1192
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,860
I sent in all the forms to the DMV.
Bye.

1193
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,180
Enjoy your smoothies.
You big Hollywood phony.

1194
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:01,190
Alright. Um, so I sent it in

1195
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,050
to the local one and I fucked up.
Not only did I send it to the wrong DMV,

1196
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,870
I wrote for some reason 2017 on the check.

1197
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:12,290
So they thought I was trying to
be pull a fast one. So then, uh,

1198
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,020
I ended up having to send
it up to fucking Sacramento,

1199
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:17,210
some waiting for that thing so I
can finally get rid of that other,

1200
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:21,610
the fucking car. Um, all right,
here we go. Girlfriend texts.

1201
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,540
Hey Bill, I'm in in a bit of a
tough situation. I think you are.

1202
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:30,110
You wrote in twice and we'd love
to hear your take it on it. Uh,

1203
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:33,830
I'm 24 years old and was recently
seeing a 33 year old girl.

1204
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:36,410
Whoa.
I love it.

1205
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:38,720
Okay.

1206
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,910
Bought out. Who Do, do,

1207
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:44,620
do calm and rubbed my fucking balls.

1208
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,150
You are fucking nine years older.
Um,

1209
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,410
for about six months. Uh, within the
time span I cheated on her twice.

1210
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:55,420
I told her about it and
although she was upset,

1211
01:10:55,421 --> 01:10:59,280
we agreed to get back together
and start over a new, uh,

1212
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:01,690
everything was relatively
fine until last week.

1213
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:05,860
I went to her house before she got off
of work to do some work on our computer.

1214
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,490
When I noticed her text messages opened.
Oh,

1215
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,650
mac computers are usually
linked to a person's phone.

1216
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,340
So I was able to see all of her texts.

1217
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:19,780
I'm sure you know by now where
this is going. Oh, Jay. Jay's,

1218
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,430
um, since she has gone
through my texts before,

1219
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:27,330
I figured I would take the
same evasive liberty. Well,

1220
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:30,770
you've fucked around on a twice. I would
think that she would be doing that. Uh,

1221
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:35,830
I found a particularly strange thread
from someone named Lauren who am I found

1222
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:40,410
out was actually her ex boyfriend and she
had it in her phone in a woman's name.

1223
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,000
Oh God. They were sexting back and forth,
talking dirty and exchanging pictures.

1224
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:49,380
I also found out she was sending
him videos of us having sex.

1225
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,260
What the fuck?

1226
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:59,310
What the fuck?
Whoa,

1227
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,070
dude. That's, I don't think that's legal.

1228
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,253
Okay.

1229
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:07,200
Is that legal weight? Did you
consider, oh wait, how does that work?

1230
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:08,760
If you could essentially let somebody,

1231
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,400
if you didn't know you were being filmed.
I don't think that that's legal.

1232
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,740
This is what I do know. I'm not a
lawyer and I have no idea what the lies.

1233
01:12:17,741 --> 01:12:18,574
All right,
let's continue.

1234
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:23,790
I confronted her on it and at first she
minimize the entire situation saying it

1235
01:12:24,581 --> 01:12:26,890
wasn't really that big of a deal.

1236
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,130
Since then, we've been going back
and forth arguing, you know what,

1237
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:37,131
you guys are both like not ready to be
in relationships remotely and thank God

1238
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,220
you both found this out before
you got married and had kids.

1239
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,480
She sends apologize,
but I'm not really sure what to do.

1240
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,340
I did cheat on her.

1241
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:52,370
So does that even the playing field
or is the whole thing just rooted in

1242
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:57,000
disfunction and chaos? There
you go. Walk towards the light.

1243
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,510
I can't tell if I'm just lonely
and want her in my life again,

1244
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:02,850
or if I should just walk away.
Please help me here.

1245
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,980
I am emotionally involved
in this situation,

1246
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:09,810
so it's hard to make a clear objective
call to just walk away, walk away,

1247
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:12,900
and you need to do some work
on yourself because, uh,

1248
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,970
I think you're a fucked up dude. Um,
and I'm, I'm saying this with empathy.

1249
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,960
Uh, you're a fucked up dude was actually
relationship guy and probably would have

1250
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:25,920
just gotten married and fucking had
your own little fucking fruit stand or

1251
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:28,470
whatever. But something fucked
up happening. He was a kid.

1252
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,030
You got weird boundaries.

1253
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,230
So you get into relationships with
dysfunctional fucking people and then you

1254
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:38,670
could consider continue to fuck around
on the side and all that. The, it's, um,

1255
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,140
it's actually a very common
thing. So I would say, uh,

1256
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:48,360
what you need is you need
to be single and, uh,

1257
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:51,630
you need to do some work on yourself.
I'd may would go to therapy,

1258
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,730
figure out what your deal is,

1259
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:58,620
really figure out what the fuck it is
that you want in life and what it is that

1260
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:02,550
you're looking for. And then just take
a baby step everyday walking towards it.

1261
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:05,390
That's what I would do, but I would
get out of this relationship. Um,

1262
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,860
and I would give her the same advice
to, um, [inaudible]. There you go. Yeah.

1263
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:14,350
Get out of it. And uh, and just know
that you're going to be fucking lonely.

1264
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:17,020
But it, all it takes is like, do you
know, two to three months you'll be fine.

1265
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:21,550
You know what I mean? Just make yourself
go to the gym. What you gotta do is you,

1266
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:25,720
you're breaking a routine and you fucking
use to this person being in your life.

1267
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,560
But like the further you go
without seeing that person,

1268
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:31,090
the more objective you can be.

1269
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:33,820
And you can look back and then one
day you're just going to be like,

1270
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:35,110
what the fuck was I thinking?

1271
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,673
MMM.

1272
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,940
And it can actually be funny to you or
you can really just see like, like uh,

1273
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,550
like what the fuck is wrong with me?

1274
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:47,850
That I would do that to a person and what
is wrong with me that someone would do

1275
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:51,690
that to me and I would consider
staying. Uh, you need some self esteem.

1276
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:55,350
Their buddy. Um, all
right, girl with pet rat.

1277
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,730
Okay.

1278
01:14:56,730 --> 01:15:00,450
Oh Jesus Christ.
Dear Billy Christmas toes.

1279
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:04,590
I don't know what that means. I've been
listening to the podcast for a long time.

1280
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:08,910
I recently came into a situation that
resulted in me having to make a decision

1281
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:12,480
instead of writing into you and
asking what to do in this situation.

1282
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:17,190
I decided to do what I thought you would
want me to do and write in what the

1283
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:19,930
results.
Dude,

1284
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:22,350
don't base your life on what the
fuck you think I would want to do.

1285
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,240
But this is already interesting.

1286
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:28,590
Last month a girl I'd
been dating got a pet rat

1287
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,080
boy got a pet fucking rat.
Okay.

1288
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:35,900
Okay.

1289
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:39,240
Is it Angelina Jolie,
then she have a rat or no shits.

1290
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:40,610
Billy Bob's blood around her neck.

1291
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,910
We had been dating for about four
months and it was going well.

1292
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:47,000
I would say that if we were
together about six months,

1293
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:50,300
I would have moved in with her.
We really clicked well.

1294
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:52,910
She got a pet rat and I
wasn't down with that.

1295
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,790
Not because I had a problem
with a rat in a cage,

1296
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:01,210
but her taking the rat out of the cage
and holding it while we watched a movie.

1297
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,190
Okay.

1298
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:07,670
Bill, I can barely even stand a cat
on a lap because I don't trust them.

1299
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:12,050
So I voiced my concern and she laughed
them off and ended up being a bigger

1300
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:14,600
argument and eventually
came back around to the rat.

1301
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,600
I told her it was me or the rat.

1302
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:23,930
She said she'd rather me, Oh, you missed
a word here. She'd rather have me,

1303
01:16:23,931 --> 01:16:27,980
I guess, except there was a long
pause and some serious thought.

1304
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,200
I really liked this girl.
And honestly,

1305
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:33,950
if my devotion ever came down to
choosing between her in anything short of

1306
01:16:33,951 --> 01:16:37,250
family or friends, uh, would she,

1307
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:39,470
are any girl ever except that.

1308
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,600
Okay.

1309
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,660
Dude, you're so emotional. You
skipping words here. Probably not,

1310
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,820
they'd say bail on the guy who's not
sure if he choose you or something that

1311
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:52,780
potentially spreads diseases.
Anyways, that's what happened.

1312
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,530
Merry Christmas to the burrs.
Um,

1313
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,710
okay.

1314
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:56,891
Yeah,

1315
01:16:56,891 --> 01:17:01,000
but what's you're doing is she loves
that rat and you're making her get rid of

1316
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:05,320
something that she loves.
So there's going to be,

1317
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,760
I guess a pause.

1318
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,143
MMM.

1319
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,300
I Dunno.
I think that it was really bugging you.

1320
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:19,850
I think it was really fucking bothering
you and you let it simmer and then you

1321
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:22,100
just fucking hit her with,
you know,

1322
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:26,960
you were ready to talk
about this for days, weeks,

1323
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:27,830
I don't know how long.

1324
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:32,360
And then you just fucking caught her off
guard and she's been bonding with this

1325
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:37,010
thing and you made her make a Sophie's
choice between you or the rat,

1326
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,580
which, um, I gotta tell you,

1327
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:48,190
I don't know about that move.
I Dunno about that move.

1328
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,190
You could have easily just said,
listen,

1329
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:56,830
I respect the fact that you like a rat.
Okay.

1330
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:57,870
For,

1331
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:01,240
you know what the first thing I would do
is I would look up life expectancy of a

1332
01:18:01,241 --> 01:18:04,930
rat. All right? And I don't
mean someone that snitches,

1333
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:09,130
cause I think everybody even I
know at this age is white as I am,

1334
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:13,960
that snitches get stitches.
Snapchat. Um, all right.

1335
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:20,200
Life expectancy. What do you guys
think of? What's the over under here?

1336
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,120
How long can a fucking Ratliff,

1337
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:26,680
I'm gonna say they live
six to eight years,

1338
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:31,390
you know, if those are the prices, right.
And I was the last person to fucking,

1339
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,750
I would say six. I'm gonna say eight,
eight years. Life expectancy of a rat.

1340
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,990
Uh, two years do it only lives
for fucking two years. All right?

1341
01:18:40,991 --> 01:18:44,770
This is what you say to her.
If she hasn't gotten rid of the rat,

1342
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:49,310
come back and say, listen, I know
he loved that. Fucking wrote it.

1343
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:54,580
Um, here's the deal. The
things only lived two years.

1344
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,960
All right. I plan on being with you
in two years. Can you do me a favor?

1345
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:04,570
Make this be the only rat he
ever have. All right. Okay.

1346
01:19:04,571 --> 01:19:06,760
She agrees to that thing and
then just put parameters.

1347
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:10,120
When I come over and we're
watching sleepless in Seattle,

1348
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:12,010
I don't want to have a threesome,
if you know what I mean.

1349
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,050
Just keep it in the fucking
cage when I'm not here.

1350
01:19:14,051 --> 01:19:15,940
You want to roll around the floor,
get yellow fever,

1351
01:19:15,941 --> 01:19:17,830
whatever the fuck you want to do.
Whatever the fuck rats do.

1352
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:20,980
If you want to do that,
that's fine. I just, you know,

1353
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,580
I don't want to fucking deal
with the thing. You could've
done that, but you know,

1354
01:19:24,581 --> 01:19:28,760
you kind of made her a like what
she going to do with the rat now?

1355
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:34,140
Like how do you get rid of a rat?
Is there like a fucking adoption agency?

1356
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:38,400
They didn't make me feel bad about my dog
again, which is of course been brutal.

1357
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:40,390
Or am I going to talk
about it? All right. Um,

1358
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,540
yeah,

1359
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:46,180
yeah. You just let the fucking
thing go. Do you know those lines?

1360
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:46,841
Do you know when the twins,

1361
01:19:46,841 --> 01:19:50,590
those people have those fucking
lions and tigers and cheetahs,

1362
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,520
fern long enough time.

1363
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:54,280
They can't release them back into the
wild because they don't even know how to

1364
01:19:54,281 --> 01:19:57,640
fucking hunt anymore. You know what
I mean? That really blew my mind.

1365
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:00,940
They don't have to hunt anymore,
but they can murder a fucking housekeeper.

1366
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,780
I mean, he's just had a fuck.
Do you have that in the house?

1367
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,980
There's no fucking,
this

1368
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,510
was in Kuwait, by the way. I don't
know why I said Saudi Arabia. Kuwait.

1369
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,910
Exotic
pet deaths.

1370
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:22,920
Let's see what we got here.
Lions. Tigers to come. Problems.

1371
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:24,150
Pets in golf.

1372
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,820
MMM.

1373
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:31,080
Big Cat killings. Smallings
big cats escape, right?

1374
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:36,070
Here we go. This is 2014 this
is a website you want to go to?

1375
01:20:36,071 --> 01:20:41,020
Big Cat. Big Cat rescue.
All right. Big Cat killings.

1376
01:20:41,021 --> 01:20:42,160
Molly's and escapes.

1377
01:20:42,161 --> 01:20:46,330
2000 tens before a lion.

1378
01:20:46,331 --> 01:20:49,300
Attacks on humans.
Here's a video I don't do.

1379
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:53,830
I want to watch this and is it weird
that I root for the fucking animals?

1380
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,760
Oh, Jesus Christ down right
to look at those things. We,

1381
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,750
I was talking to [inaudible] and we were
talking about these big cats like those

1382
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:06,490
big cats. They literally the
Lamborghini's and Ferrari's of fucking,

1383
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:12,610
of cats. Of Animals. Oh my God.

1384
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:14,370
Okay.

1385
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,410
It's fucking,
it's got his fucking arm.

1386
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:20,250
It's got his fucking arm and
he's trying to slap at it.

1387
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:23,663
Okay.

1388
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:28,560
Oh my God.
Jesus fucking,

1389
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,700
you're a fucking idiot.
This guy is trying to remain calm.

1390
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,133
Okay.

1391
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,010
This is dude.
There's one guy,

1392
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:41,310
he's dealing with this lion
attacking him and then the fucking,

1393
01:21:41,311 --> 01:21:45,870
there's another guy slapping at the
fucking lion and it's got his fucking leg.

1394
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:50,190
It's just sort of holding him.
He's almost a way.

1395
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:51,570
He's almost a way.

1396
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,790
Oh my God.
He's fucking got him again.

1397
01:21:58,940 --> 01:21:59,640
Okay,

1398
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,090
dude, you should have got the fuck out
of there. Get the fuck out of there.

1399
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:06,420
And this guy,
he's still staying in the fucking cage.

1400
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,153
Yeah.

1401
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:15,020
Oh, hey, go. You fucking dope. Oh,
this is like the top 10 all right.

1402
01:22:15,021 --> 01:22:17,750
You got to go to this big cat rescue.org.

1403
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,133
Yeah,

1404
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,600
and this is another guy. He's getting
fucking bit by this goddamn thing.

1405
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:27,651
It's weird,
man.

1406
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:30,860
When they decide that they're going after
somebody liked the other guy can just

1407
01:22:30,861 --> 01:22:31,950
totally be like,
get the F,

1408
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,820
you know the other guys like the
friend and the bark on, come on man,

1409
01:22:34,821 --> 01:22:36,350
you don't need this.
You don't need this.

1410
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:39,650
This thing is just going
after this one fucking dude.

1411
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,840
Lion attack number rate. All right.
He's petting the back of the thing.

1412
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:49,310
He's patent it, you know, it's a fucking
line. And then boom, oh, it's got his arm.

1413
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,950
I've seen this one.
It's got his fucking arm.

1414
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:54,283
Uh,

1415
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,610
now his friends,
his friends are pulling,

1416
01:22:56,611 --> 01:23:00,150
it's a tug of war with this guy right now.
And the other guy is funny.

1417
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:02,400
He tries to hit the line,
but he's too afraid to go near it.

1418
01:23:02,401 --> 01:23:05,890
So he keeps hitting his friend
who has it in his fucking mouth.

1419
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,450
Wow. Lion attacks hunter.
I've seen this one.

1420
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:14,470
I don't like that one because they
killed the fucking light. Jesus Christ.

1421
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:16,210
You know what I gotta be honest with you,

1422
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,410
what you don't see in any of these
fucking videos is women that own fucking

1423
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:25,030
these things. You know, guys is just such
fucking dope. Um, anyways. All right,

1424
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:28,690
that's the podcast for this week. And if
you guys miss last Thursday's podcasts,

1425
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:32,090
um, you got to tune into
a bridge. Shied. No, man,

1426
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:36,280
this guy gives you basically eight
standup comedy history class.

1427
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:38,680
He's one of my favorite guest
I've ever had on the podcast.

1428
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:43,330
I could've talked to him for like two
hours. You have to get his book. Um,

1429
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:45,241
you know,

1430
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:49,380
it's about his life as a standup comedian
was at walking through the ashes of

1431
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:52,720
standup my life as a standup comedian.
You got to get the book because, you know,

1432
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:56,170
he started to tell me those Johnny
first time he did the tonight show,

1433
01:23:56,171 --> 01:24:00,100
he had cocaine bag, a little Baggie
of cocaine in his fucking pocket.

1434
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,560
He said the next time he did it,

1435
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:08,350
he did a joke about heart attacks and
Johnny was really nervous about having a

1436
01:24:08,351 --> 01:24:10,630
heart attack because he smoked in,
hated him,

1437
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,680
and they made sure that he stayed in the
fucking dressing room and they're like,

1438
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:17,350
you never do in the show again, and Blah,
Blah Blah and all this type of shit.

1439
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,660
It's fucking, the book is amazing. Um, but
you got to listen. Listen to the podcast.

1441

up, um, it was just effortless.

1442
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:30,900
It was one of the fastest hours
