10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,340

godforsaken strip mall in the
middle of fucking nowhere,

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,300
which is basically the middle of nowhere
to me at this point is anywhere that is

14
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,950
not near my house. You know,
big come to Chicago. What?

15
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,400
In the middle of fucking
nowhere. I get a bus. Well,

00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:08,000

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,220
but union is that serve the North
American, the fuck away from me here.

18
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:16,640
An agent if free mason.
Is it an amazing how you can't talk?

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,550
You try to adjust yourself. He

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,370
I've been working out.
I work out.

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,480
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
We'll do, um, I've been, uh,

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,370
yeah,

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,610
I um, let, let's, let's, let's,
let's bring it down a little bit.

25
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:45,700
Let's bring the tone down a little bit.
Let's just ease it on in, you know,

26
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:46,780
you sitting there,
right?

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,820
Coming down from the sugar rush from
that fucking Curley's shouldn't Eaton uh,

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,700
they had bear claw, right? Well,
what else did you have a what?

29
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you have the thing at the airport? What
do they got there? The big fucking, uh,

30
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,830
you know, we look like, it looks
like a diabetic. Took a shit.

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,990
What do they call a Cinnabon?

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,860
A lot of people don't know
that. That's, that's where they,

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,100
that's where they get their dough from.
As a,

34
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,520
when a real fat person takes
a shit, they, that's when you,

35
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:21,521
that's when you know you have to lose
weight is when you just shit a Cinnabon

36
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,380
and you didn't,
you knew you didn't eat one.

37
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,070
It's not like it went straight
to your system. Okay. It's,

38
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,910
that is just an amalgam of that is the
waste of what you ate that day. You know,

39
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:35,870
something. I is it my goal to
lose every female on this podcast,

40
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,060
any fee remote female listener.

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,770
It's almost like this subconscious
self self sabotage. Two minutes,

42
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,550
40 seconds into this fucking thing.
And you know,

43
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,720
I got to put that visual out there.
You know,

44
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:54,110
I probably lost not only all of the women,

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,700
I lost some guys who were like
in touch with their feelings.

46
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,220
Anybody's a remotely a human

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,810
being. So now, now it's just a, now
it's just us. It's just a sociopath's.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,830
Let's just let them slowly co,
you know, file out of the room.

49
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,420
I thought it was going to be something
different. I did too. I like sweets.

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,470
I don't shit set up month.
Sorry. I said the f word.

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,230
Um, my fucking dog, Cleo,

52
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:26,620
I want your life, you know,
what is your biggest decision?

53
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,280
What room am I going to lay down and go
down and fucking go to sleep? Sleeping.

54
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,720
Is that what it is? You've got a
fucking spider web on my, uh, uh,

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,980
the remanence of a spider web.

56
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,110
I can't figure out I'll all the spiders
in my house like me or they don't like

57
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,550
me,
you know,

58
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,130
cause I kind of let them be when it
gets a little ridiculous, you know,

59
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,180
the size of the spider webs. Cause I
figured that they're here for a reason.

60
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:55,690
That must mean I have other bugs
here and they're going to kill him.

61
00:03:55,691 --> 00:04:00,691
So like I look at them like they're
my like insect police squad,

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,630
you know, and I'm the rich guy
is, isn't that what the uh, uh,

63
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,720
what do you call them? The
fucking policemen? ARF.

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,000
Isn't that why they initially came about
was to protect the rich people's stuff

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,920
just in case everybody
working farm was like, hey ya,

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,760
how much does that vase worth? Their
fucking, what's a rich guy's name?

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,060
Hg fucking cunt face. They help
that we had those names back then.

68
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,620
Not The cunt face part, but they always
had the initials. Right. You know,

69
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,550
Hg Rockefeller, Jd Rockefeller, you know

70
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,750
JP Morgan, JP, it ain't fair man.

71
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,960
I don't care if with kitchen
put my shooter got out. Right.

72
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,360
And they all talk like Edward G.
Robinson for some reason,

73
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,770
30 years before even fucking was famous.
C'Mon pill,

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,500
get your shit together. Um, I
have a sugar rush right now.

75
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:58,210
I had fucking spaghetti again.
Bet At four times his fucking week.

76
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,870
That's what happens when all your recipes
that you got from your parents or for

77
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:06,400
like 10 people, you know, and it's
just you and your God damn dog.

78
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,010
Whatever you make and you know,

79
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,450
you make sketti you're going to
eat and that for fucking two weeks,

80
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,250
I got fucking octopus coming
out my fucking nose here. Um,

81
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,630
that was the soprano's version
of a Tony Montana case.

82
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:25,450
You were wondering that knee is out
of town again this week. You know,

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,620
I think she's slowly breaking up
with me via vacations, you know,

84
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,560
just sort of easing me into what it's
going to be like when she's not here.

85
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:37,540
And I got to tell you I'm doing fine.
You know, I can't fucking do the laundry.

86
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,320
I can't make spaghetti 10 times in a week.
I don't need you.

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,210
Yeah. Jesus. What'd you do
with your weekend bill? Well,

88
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:52,960
I had too much to drink Friday night
and I'm back on the wagon, you know,

89
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,070
back on the fucking wagon.
I don't think this is an old Jimmy,

90
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:02,030
that old joke where they say,
uh, I'm not an alcoholic.

91
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:06,950
I just drink like one a that,
that's me. You know what I mean?

92
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,580
I'm one of those guys,
if I'm going to have a pizza,

93
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:12,230
I'm going to eat the whole fucking thing.
All right,

94
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:16,220
let's save some for later and maybe having
it for breakfast and then talk about

95
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,570
sports on ESPN.
All right.

96
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,110
And they have a show called cold
pizza with skip Bayless was, uh,

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,340
always losing his shit about something.
Do you guys buy,

98
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,950
do you guys buy that guy?
Do by his outrage?

99
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,890
Um,
you know what I mean?

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,090
I think his outrage is about as
believable is ice cubes, anger.

101
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,090
Ice Cube has had the exact same scowl on
his face from Nwa all the way to these

102
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,270
cores like commercials.
It is the exact,

103
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,950
he is the exact same look on his face
when he was talking about the man as he

104
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:00,880
does when beer bottles take
over his studio. You know,

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,850
maybe he's just straight across the board.
Angry. God knows I can relate to that,

106
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,120
but there's certain people after
a while you gotta be like, Dude,

107
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:12,440
you got to have another emotion in there,
don't you skip Bayless is another guy.

108
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,060
I don't give a fuck if you said,
hey, you need air to breathe.

109
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,100
He would somehow argue the other side,

110
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,400
put his eyebrows up near his fucking
game show host hair that he has.

111
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,580
You know, is that his hair?
It's gotta be his hair.

112
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,710
Either that or he went to like, he got
a, do they make weaves for white guys?

113
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,510
You know,
if they made weaves a white guys,

114
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:43,160
everybody would want skip Bayless is here.
I get it. If it came in some sort of a,

115
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,990
some sort of red, I'd get
one. I get one in a second.

116
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,280
I'd be hot at some of the, you know,
that's why I never get a fucking toupee,

117
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,890
you know, just sitting there with
your full head of fucking here,

118
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:02,891
just slapped on there like a shingle
scalps sweating underneath it.

119
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,470
You know, what the fuck
am I do with, you know,

120
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,880
and then one at night I come home and
I take it off and I just look at me,

121
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,040
just look at the landing strip on top of
my head, right where, where, you know,

122
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,260
the rest of my face got sun and then this,
I got this blind.

123
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,100
You know what I would, I would
look like the globe, you know,

124
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:31,550
on top of my head would be
like the North Pole, you know,

125
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,480
my chest would be the south pole and
then my face would be the tropics.

126
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,530
And that basically it, I mean that's
basically the climates, you know,

127
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,680
my nose would be some sort of mountain
range coming down from fucking Alaska.

128
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,860
Why do you guys listen to
this stupid podcasts? Um,

129
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,650
anyway, so, oh, I didn't tell
you this. I got to fucking,

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,830
I gotta I gotta I bought one of those,
those giant eggs

131
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,460
to fucking Bobby Q.

132
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,050
I bought one the ugliest fucking sin,
but they are the shit.

133
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,440
This is not an advertising.
This is a Freebie. Alright.

134
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,840
People over at the big green egg
in case you sell half of one, um,

135
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,520
I love the goddamn thing.
It looks like an unripe avocado.

136
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,100
It's one of the ugliest things
you've ever seen in your life. Okay.

137
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,340
But they got a couple of gaskets.
They got a seal here.

138
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:27,930
It's a seal here and you
run it up the alley. Um, oh,

139
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,240
I made some burgers and dogs.
That's what I did first.

140
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,480
And then there was this barbecue place
that was going out of business or

141
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:37,020
relocating. I Dunno what was happening,
but all I know was all their shit was,

142
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,000
was half off. So I went down there and
I got the thing for fucking ribs, right?

143
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,500
Not Baby Becky to the fucking,
the good ones, you know,

144
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:50,400
you just lay the fuck are
right over there. Okay. Doing
ribs isn't even that hard.

145
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:54,960
They'll just fucking Douche you see
on, uh, on, on the food channel,

146
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,260
talking about all the shit that they do
when they sit sitting there with their

147
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,180
little fucking based or hey,
well what do you do?

148
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:02,520
You slather it with some
shit that this tastes good.

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,520
You stick it in the fucking thing

150
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,650
and then you come back four hours later
and he'd go, oh, would you look at debt?

151
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,460
Oh, which you look at debt
falling right off the boat, right?

152
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,590
And then they eat it and then they
always tell you it's good. Well,

153
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,660
of course you're going to say that
it's your fucking cooking show.

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,920
Have you ever seen on a cooking show?
A guy took a bite and was like, ah,

155
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,050
God damn it, I overcooked it, dried that
shit out. Well, you know, you win some,

156
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,510
you lose some,
come on back next week folks,

157
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:32,450
maybe I won't cook the shit out of
this salmon. They never say that.

158
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,540
They always eat you. You know, it's like,

159
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,130
and they always eat it too when they're
like running out of time. So before they,

160
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:43,770
they, he'd take half a bite
and they go, ah, ah, ah,

161
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,140
I wish you could take, you
didn't even fucking show it.
You know what that's like?

162
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,560
That's in, in uh, in
the acting profession.

163
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,300
I learned this one, I did glee. That's
called playing the end of the scene.

164
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:57,920
Okay.

165
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,480
You know what I mean? Like if you,
you know, if you read like you,

166
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,620
you're all seen, you know, you
have to audition for, right?
And it's basically your,

167
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,840
your character walks
into a rental car place.

168
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,090
She's supposed to have a fucking
rental car. They don't have it.

169
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,460
And then you flip out and you yell,
right?

170
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,160
And in the end there's a big
fucking yelling bullshit, right?

171
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,540
And the inexperienced actor comes in
already fucking amped up. And it's like,

172
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,470
why you already amped up.

173
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,870
You'll walk in and expect in
the fucking car to be there.

174
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,960
You wouldn't already be mad.
You're playing the end of the scene.

175
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,030
That's what those cons
do on the food network,

176
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,810
because they're running out of time.
Oh fucking Susie mother and hips there,

177
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:33,830
whatever the fuck her name is,

178
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:38,000
who I said I'd like to bang her before
she highlighted her hair and did the

179
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:42,230
whole fucking j Lo thing was she
toned down her fucking Brunette Ish.

180
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,510
Look on her face. You know what I
mean? Uh, what's her name? Rachel Ray.

181
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,020
Rachel Ray did the exact same
make over that fucking j.

182
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:54,820
Lo did both of were uh,
were,

183
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:59,710
were Brunette Brown eyes,
big bushy fucking eyebrows.

184
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,070
They did the same goddamn thing. They
fucking, they thin that shit out.

185
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,220
They throw with a little, throw a
little sun in their hair. All right?

186
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,640
Then all of a sudden, Oh wow, look,
you jumped off the page. You know,

187
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,220
you don't want to do an
over correction though.

188
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,860
You don't want to over correct Brunette.
If you over correct Brunette,

189
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,880
you go right past blonde and into red
head and then that's a slippery slope into

190
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,300
albino and you're not getting,

191
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:25,510
no one's going to see your fucking
movie or watch you make some French dip.

192
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,490
All right. So I'm not making
fun of the profession that,

193
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:33,491
that's a very delicate process to take
someone who has brown too much brown,

194
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,540
you know, and they got to lighten
them up and the eyebrow hair area.

195
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,000
But what I always think because I'm a
fucking pervert is it's like all right.

196
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,020
Yeah,

197
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,380
you fucking, you know, you dialed in the
sun up top. What happened down bottom.

198
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,000
You know what I mean? Cause if your
eyebrows and that fucking bushy,

199
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,590
what in God's name is going down,

200
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:57,650
they're going on down there
and you and the slacks area.

201
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,610
Did you get that highlight? Is
that going to match? You know,

202
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:04,700
am I going to see who you really are when
you're draws? Hit the floor sweetheart.

203
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,940
Oh, Jesus Christ. Um,

204
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,250
well that was a fun first fucking
15 minutes, wasn't it? How? Oh Hey,

205
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:20,580
guess who's advertising this?
This, this week? Guess who's back?

206
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,740
It's our old friends at pro flowers.

207
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,490
Remember them way back on Mother's Day?

208
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,830
Mema them I on Valentine's Day. Well
now they're hitting us up every month.

209
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,550
They want you to buy flowers every month.

210
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,900
And I know what you're thinking.
What the fuck would I do that for?

211
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,620
I don't know, but it's up to me is
the pitch man that I have to some,

212
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,330
they have to somehow
come up with an angle.

213
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,920
I got to come up with an angle here.
This is what you gotta do. Okay.

214
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:57,180
And I actually do this. Okay. So this is
coming from my heart, not from the wallet.

215
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,140
All right. This isn't the
magic bullet here. This is
coming straight up. All right?

216
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:06,120
Didn't make a right turn down on my ass,
right in my wallet. It didn't. Okay.

217
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,850
Um,
every once in a while.

218
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,130
Okay.

219
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,710
Every once in awhile I'll wait.
Cleo, shifting, shifting Ed,

220
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,720
she stretching and then that's it.
She didn't get up.

221
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,330
Um, you look like a little pig.
You know that little wild boar,

222
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,703
Cleo,

223
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,750
no size on you.
Do you do squats when I'm not looking?

224
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:34,260
Is that what you're so tired from all the
time? Anyways, portfolio is everybody.

225
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,110
It's July 4th. You could've given
some to Uncle Sam last week,

226
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,660
but it's too late for that now.
Uh,

227
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,920
is that the original goatee by the way?
Uncle Sam.

228
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,530
Uncle Sam looks like an old retired
like NBA player from the 70s,

229
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,800
but somehow he's white.
By then,

230
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,120
by then Whitey was, was getting pushed out
of the League, wasn't he? Um, all right,

231
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:02,290
let's get back to the advertising here.
Uh, proflowers. Proflowers it's July,

232
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,960
it's July. You know what?
This is what you got it.

233
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:07,060
You were in a relationship every
once in a while, just out of nowhere.

234
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:10,590
You've got to give him some
flowers, you know? Okay. You know,

235
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,600
is it ever a wrong time to
give your mother some flowers?

236
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,070
Are you going to go visit them?

237
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,340
Do you have a mother in law
who just looks at you? Like,

238
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,830
why did you marry my daughter?
You know,

239
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,280
give her some flowers. Maybe
she'll lighten up. Either way.

240
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,080
If you get a big enough arrangement,

241
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:30,470
you have to look at his stupid
face across the team. Uh,

242
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,430
the table when you sit down to eat.
You know, if you don't like somebody,

243
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,660
what better way to block this stupid
face than to go out and get a bunch

244
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,670
ofFlowers@proflowers.com.

245
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:44,940
Just click on the microphone
in the upper right hand corner.

246
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:49,560
You'd type in the Password Berbee
you U R and they'll get the vase,

247
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,100
they'll stick him in the water and
they'll send it to that person.

248
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:57,660
Love them or not send them flowers.
And that's the end.

249
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,620
And the dismount. Oh, speaking
and the dismount. You know,

250
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,230
I was telling you that I was starting to
put on weight again. Oh, Billy fat again.

251
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,470
You know, Billy McPhatter again. Um,

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,510
and I decided that I was going to halt
that and I was going to turn this bus

253
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:20,250
around
and tried to get myself back in shape.

254
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,810
And uh, I've been doing
all, all bodyweight stuff,

255
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,450
climbing the rope. I'm doing the pull
up some during the day. I'm doing,

256
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,300
uh, what else you got there?
Whatever. I don't do chin ups though.

257
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,580
Yeah.

258
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,110
Chin ups or are for girls. Pull
ups are for men. All right.

259
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,180
In fact,
I remember when,

260
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,040
when Demi Moore played that chick
who got her head buzz down Gi Jane,

261
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,960
right? She wasn't doing shit up. She was
doing pull ups cause she was a marine.

262
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,920
Right. I think that wasn't
the message of that movie.

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,940
What was the message of that movie?
Other than men are horrific.

264
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,820
What is the guy version of
that movie? Like, like hot dog.

265
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,020
And when those,

266
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,500
those tits and ass movies they used
to make when you first got cable,

267
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,080
but ski bunnies in the same premise
and now they're on the beach and they'd

268
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,920
always be chicks like just taking
their tops off. Like that happens,

269
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,680
you know, maybe it happens on
the French Riviera, I dunno.

270
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,670
But then they got hairy armpits. This
is always something to balance it out.

271
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:34,110
People, it's the ying and
the Yang, you know? Um,

272
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,140
I just completely forgot
what I was talking about. I
was talking about pullups.

273
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,830
That's right. So, so I
don't know if you guys,

274
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,330
Melissa,
how long have you listened to podcasts?

275
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:50,040
I F I fucked up my abdomen
on the right side. Uh, about

276
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,710
five years ago,
I was at a Pittsburgh pirates game.

277
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:57,360
I was one of the field and I was there
and I was drunk as always, alcohol,

278
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,720
always playing a role. And I
was drunk. I was drunk, Bill.

279
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,880
Um,
and I was with Paul Versey who said,

280
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,650
yeah, I fucking called.
Yeah, look at the bridge.

281
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,970
I said, it ice when they
make this ballpark. I said,

282
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:15,260
you know what they're gonna do.

283
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,400
They're gonna have it where you
could see the bridge from the, from,

284
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:22,150
from home plate. Looking right
out there it is. I call it,

285
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:26,300
you're not taking this one away from
me. You're not taking, I called it. Oh,

286
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:28,980
look at the bridge.
Um,

287
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,000
by the lightweight,
I love when you

288
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,940
guys send me tweets or twitters or
whatever the fuck you call up when, uh,

289
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,060
whenever Robinson can know does
something and you make fun of mercy.

290
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,840
That always makes me laugh.
Like Quinoa had a double Versie called it.

291
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,860
He called, he called it, I'll Paul Versey.

292
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,400
Do you want to be the guy who calls
it? Well, all you need is my dude.

293
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:58,690
I called it system number
one fucking call everything.

294
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,690
Think about it.
If you call everything,

295
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:04,960
eventually something that
you said will happen, Dan,

296
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:06,730
what you do is you yell about it,

297
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,760
you continue to yell about it hopefully
until everybody forgets everything else

298
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:13,600
that you called.
That did not happen.

299
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,070
Yeah.

300
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,400
You know it is at this point,
the fact that virgin, he
still talks about his call,

301
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,470
that Robinson Cano was
going to be a hall of fame.

302
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,290
He watched him like fucking three weeks
and said this guy's going to be a hall

303
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,220
of famer evidently. Okay.
Which is absolutely asinine.

304
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,560
Okay. Unless you like Ted Williams,
unless you're really a guy in baseball,

305
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,100
you can, you can look at those things.
All right. Versus one of those guys.

306
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:42,320
He wants to be the guy who said it first.
So he just says shit first. You know,

307
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:43,970
like if he was on the prices right,

308
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,210
there's no way he would pass
the first showcase. He wouldn't,

309
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,680
he would bid on it cause he wouldn't want
that other person to bid before he did.

310
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,670
That's what he would do. Did that
make any sense? I don't give a shit.

311
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,693
MMM.

312
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,290
So anyways, I've been working out this,
what the fuck I'm trying to talk about.

313
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,180
So this is how I fucked up my
app abdomen. All right. I was um,

314
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,010
I was at the, what, $10 with
this other comic Doug's in.
Yay. I was with Paul Versey

315
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,000
don't,
I don't what I said.

316
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,803
Um,

317
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,670
and myself and I think Doug's brother,
right?

318
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,220
We were all having a good time
drinking some beers, right?

319
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:26,910
We're all talking shit is old guys do.
And next thing you know,

320
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:30,150
I'm trying to show them that I
can go into the pike position.

321
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,420
Hammered.
All right?

322
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,040
So I put my fucking hand on one
sheet and then on what another seat,

323
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,930
lift myself up and then I bring my legs
straight out in front of me like I had

324
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:46,500
been doing, but I'm old. I didn't stretch.
I don't know what happened. Right?

325
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,200
And then later on the night, I
remember being drunk. It's somebody,

326
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:55,290
we were skipping rope on a sidewalk and
it had like a 45 degree fucking angle

327
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,880
across from this place where a
bunch of drunks were getting food.

328
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,180
I feel the life of me. I don't know
where we got the fucking jump rope.

329
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,973
I don't know where we got it.

330
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,930
I think somebody there had it from the
gym and then that's what it became.

331
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,250
That's probably when it became cars.

332
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:12,680
I actually fucking went into the
pipe position so then they will,

333
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:15,740
I could fucking skip rope.
Typical guy. Shit. All right.

334
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,930
And I know this bugs the ladies,
but you know something.

335
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:22,190
That's why there's air conditioning.
Okay. That's why, because of that shit,

336
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:24,500
because that's how we're geared.
I can do this while I can do this,

337
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,110
while I can do that fucking better.
Right. And next thing you know,

338
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,090
you got wall to wall carpeting.
All right,

339
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,410
so shut your face and make me a sandwich.
Um,

340
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,890
anyways, so the next morning I
wake up and I don't, it feels,

341
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,530
it felt like somebody took
some sort of medieval,

342
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,900
like if that Freddy Kruger glove dipped
it in fire and then fucking raped right

343
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,500
down the right side of me.
So for years I've been babying it.

344
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,790
Finally at one time I went and I got,

345
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,080
I got a Roth I believe,
which is a really deep fucking massage.

346
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,210
It was really weird.
It was a the only person I found,

347
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,590
although I was kidding who the first
person I found, I just clicked on that.

348
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,330
Okay.

349
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,950
Um,
I went to that,

350
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,580
that person's place and I went there
and ended up being a guy doing it and it

351
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:20,700
was really fucking weird. It
was just weird. I was like,
we'd done yet not on it.

352
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:24,960
We still got more. You got to do the other
side, but I think that's all right. Um,

353
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,920
did it help? I don't fucking know.
So, you know what I finally just said,

354
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,370
I finally said, um, I found is that,

355
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,490
is that homophobia by the way?

356
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,450
That I will only go to a girl to get a
fucking massage unless I'm really hurt,

357
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:39,980
you know,

358
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,000
if I'm really fucking hurt and I'm just
so fucking like time I jacked up my

359
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:47,840
shoulder, I just don't give a shit and
just like, just make the pain go away.

360
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,810
Is that homophobic?
You know,

361
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,330
I bet if a woman did, it was
like, you know, I, I don't
want, well, she would say,

362
00:22:56,331 --> 00:23:00,680
I only want a girl. All right, so I'm a
little homophobic. Go fuck yourselves.

363
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:05,390
I got issues. Um, so anyways,

364
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,450
so I finally, I finally
just said, you know what,

365
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,070
why don't I just try
pushing through the paint?

366
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,740
When do I stop being such a fucking pussy?
Just push through the pain.

367
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,410
So you know, you know those, uh, those
little wheels with the handles on them.

368
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,050
I just started doing that. I do 10
reps a day. I wouldn't go too far in,

369
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,540
in like a week. The whole pain's gone and
gone away. She know me. I can't be like,

370
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,000
oh, fuck it now. Now I feel good.
Is that good enough for bill? No.

371
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,970
Now I'm on youtube trying to
learn how to do the human flag.

372
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,040
It fucking 44 years old.

373
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,580
I'm literally going down the street
to a stop sign doing my little,

374
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:42,260
the little side things,
trying to build up the strike for what?

375
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,770
For what purpose bill? You know,
you got your health, you, you,

376
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,370
your core feels good again.

377
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,070
Why are you going to go down there
and just blow something else out?

378
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,860
You're a fucking moron.
You know,

379
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,510
you're gonna be right back on a table
getting massaged by a dude. Um, all right,

380
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,540
whatever.
It's what the fuck I do.

381
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,250
So this weekend a knee has
been away and uh, so anyway,

382
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,270
I got this big green fucking egg thing
and uh, I got the, the, the uh, Dee Dee,

383
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:15,950
Dee Dee, Dee Dee Dee Dee, the
table that came with it. And uh,

384
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,510
that took like a fucking month by the
way, to get that thing. You know, I got,

385
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,930
I got the table where the egg sits in it
cause I hate that shit when you fucking

386
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:26,030
barbecue and they give you that little,
those two little,

387
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,700
it looks like those trays that you know,

388
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,090
that you have like an airplane and
you just set them down a both sides.

389
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:34,730
And that's supposed to take your
whole fucking, you know, all the meat.

390
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:38,810
And then where do I hang the fucking
spatula? I don't need that shit.

391
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,610
All right. That guy, he's going to die
in jail. I don't need that shit. Okay.

392
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,610
Ain't happening to me. Hey, you
stopped dealing in that shit. Um,

393
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,800
you know something? I watched Goodfellas
the other day and I think, uh,

394
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,900
I think what the fuck's his name now?
I,

395
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,590
I'm starting to like him the best
in that movie. To Fuck's his name.

396
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,830
Pauly Paul Sorvino.
I love that.

397
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,070
I love that fucking thing.

398
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,580
When he told him not to deal drugs and
he's telling him how that guy's gonna die

399
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:10,450
in jail.
Okay.

400
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:14,620
Then it happened in me and stupid
sweaty piece of shit and re hill,

401
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,970
the fucking rat, by the way. I didn't
get one when the real Henry Hill died.

402
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:20,110
Why people like,

403
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,170
they kind of confuse their love of that
movie and kind of forgot that this guy

404
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:30,540
ratted out all his friends, you know,
if, I mean, if that movie's accurate,

405
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,600
right? I mean, I know he
ratted out his friends,

406
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,580
but I don't know if that's
the exact reason why I did.

407
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,470
Was it because he was fucking dealing
drugs? Was there a guy saying,

408
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:43,110
don't do it.
Am I going to keep asking questions?

409
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,570
So anyways, I get this table
for this fucking thing and uh,

410
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,210
you know, it comes, comes here like a
newborn baby. It's fucking naked, right?

411
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,270
It's got new phone and it's not
staying, just got nothing on it, right?

412
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:00,270
So I gotta I gotta deal
with all that bullshit.

413
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,300
I've been doing that the whole fucking
weekend and doing it the right way too.

414
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:08,370
By the way.
I stand on top and the bottom.

415
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,370
I know a lot of your weekend
warriors. Yay. You're like, fuck that.

416
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,940
I ain't doing that.
Nobody looks under their door.

417
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,820
What if any water gets on there
prior to the fucking table?

418
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:21,030
The whole thing's going to be underground
and underwater. Well, go fuck yourself.

419
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:25,260
I did the whole thing,
two coats on Friday,

420
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,480
on Saturday, and then today I did
the fucking the varnish and uh,

421
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:33,420
I gotta tell you, man,
that's a bitch of a job.

422
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,520
It's just tedious.

423
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,830
Okay.

424
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,990
Fucking tedious.
Especially if you do the underneath too.

425
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:43,010
I'm sitting there laying on my back,
like fucking funds a rally, you know,

426
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,910
just fucking lay in there. I've
working on this shit. And, uh,

427
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,850
I got to tell you a lot of times I
was going to tap out and just be like,

428
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:54,350
you know what?
I'm not going to do this the right way.

429
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm just going to do this stuff the fuck
headway and I didn't and I was happy.

430
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,580
I was proud of myself.
And you know what?

431
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,240
I'm going to show it to Nia and I'm
telling you, I, if she fucking says,

432
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,410
why did you pick the heck?
Why did she do this?

433
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,430
Right?

434
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,180
I'm going to take what's left of that
fucking stain and I'm going to dump it

435
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:17,120
over. I would never do
that. You know what?

436
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:20,420
I'll do it to myself and become the
martyr and then we'll see what she has to

437
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,740
say.
So anyways,

438
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:26,570
I got this fucking egg and I'm going to
make ribs and all this shit is somehow

439
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,410
still be able to do the human flag as I,
as I'm going to fucking,

440
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,570
I don't know what I'm going to do.

441
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:37,580
I'm going to buy like a fucking bison off
of Ebay and freeze that son of a bitch

442
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:41,960
and cook it slow, Cook it for the rest
of the summer and that's going to be it.

443
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,720
I'm going to get fat, girls going to get
fat, my dog's going to get fat and uh,

444
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:49,520
I'm going to have a whole new hour of
material and when a tub of Shit I am,

445
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,110
that's how great that thing is. Um, all
right, let's plow ahead with the podcast.

446
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:57,890

448
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:06,020
You want to give me shit?
You're probably saying bill,

452
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,310
Oh, before I get into this shit, um,

453
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,220
I'm going to be in Washington DC
tomorrow night. Uh, not too. All right.

454
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:30,221
Tuesday night at the DC
Improv's celebrating their
30 years in the business by

455
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:32,240
telling my Dick and shit jokes.

456
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,890
And then this weekend I will be
at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire.

457
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,810
Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino. One
of my favorite venues that I do. Uh,

458
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,130
led Zeppelin played there.

459
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:46,850
One of the few small venues that they
played on their quick little tea party

460
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:51,050
tour that they did before
they just blew up. Um,

461
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,950
and then I'll be at the Newport Yachting
Center in Newport, Rhode Island.

462
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:56,000
I know that sounds fancy,

463
00:28:56,001 --> 00:29:00,170
but I swear to God it's an air condition
tent in a parking lot. You know,

464
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,620
when you walk out the tent, you can see
a bunch of yachts, but I'm not on one.

465
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,270
It sounds good though. All right.
Okay. Here we go. First one,

466
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,880
first one out of the gate.
Validations. Son's mother is a nut job.

467
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,370
This is coming from my nut job.
That's an east coast dual.

468
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:21,230
She's a fucking nutjob up.
Um, all right, dear Billy.

469
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:25,940
Boy did I just fuck this thing up?
Come on, come on. I need life here.

470
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:28,760
Here we go. All right, dear
Billy. Boy, a couple months ago,

471
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:32,990
I split up with my son's
mother. Uh, we weren't married,

472
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:36,560
so I basically packed my shit up
and my son's stuff and moved out.

473
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,640
We hadn't been getting,

474
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,550
we hadn't been getting along for a while
because she didn't help me out with our

475
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:45,470
son and was texting all the time.
That's what she was doing.

476
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,220
She was texting all the time as she's
probably talking to the other guy.

477
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,920
She's probably fucking, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to put that out there. Um,

478
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,190
the night before I moved out,

479
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,060
I received a text talking about
treating her better than I did.

480
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,940
I asked to see her phone
and she wouldn't let me.

481
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,380
So I moved out the next day and she
spent the night with some dude that same

482
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,540
night I moved out yet. Dude, let
me tell you something right now.

483
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,900
If your girl isn't paying attention
to you and she's texting all the time,

484
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,120
she's talking to the Dick
that she's riding. Okay. So
unless yours is vibrating,

485
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,630
she ain't texted you.
All right? No. Okay. Um,

486
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,470
anyways, next night, the next night,

487
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:31,780
this guy started living with
her. Jesus Christ. Yeah.

488
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:34,400
So she had a full on relationship
going on the side. Uh,

489
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,220
so we were pretty much through but a
couple of weeks later it was mother's Day

490
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:42,000
and she told me what my son
wanted me to get her. Uh,

491
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:44,940
my son is two years old and
doesn't really talk a whole lot.

492
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,770
So she was telling me what she wanted.

493
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,120
I told you to go fuck herself because I
wasn't getting her shit. There you go.

494
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,090
Good for you.
Uh,

495
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:57,570
she told me that she was still the
mother of my child and I should get her

496
00:30:57,571 --> 00:31:02,160
something. Jesus Christ is this
people who use that kind of guilt,

497
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:06,540
who you actually use, like the
children. The fuck is wrong with you.

498
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,030
Anyways.
Also,

499
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:13,200
I had paid the rent right before I moved
out and when I found out this guy was

500
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:15,090
staring,
staying there the night I moved out,

501
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:19,440
I cancelled the rent check and
also got my name off the lease. Oh,

502
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,880
there's a nice one too to
the fucking jaw bone. Uh,

503
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,110
I know I did the right thing.

504
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:29,760
Please tell me that you agree that this
chick is fucked up in the head too. Oh,

505
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:34,230
and since I moved out, she sees our
son one or two days a week tops.

506
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,750
Uh, so to me, she's a shitty mother
who didn't deserve it. Deserve a gift.

507
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:44,210
Go Fuck yourself ps when he come
into the Kansas City area. All right.

508
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,110
Uh, well granted, I just heard your
side of the story, but uh, yeah,

509
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,640
sounds like the way the picture you're
painting there, sir. Absolutely.

510
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,560
Look,
the fact that the day you move out,

511
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:59,990
she bangs another guy and then
the other person moves in. I mean,

512
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:03,590
I think he got it good. I think
you got it. Good. That's a,

513
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:06,620
that was nothing but victory
in there as far as I see.

514
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:09,590
You didn't marry or you didn't love her.
You're knocked her up,

515
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,930
you toughed it out.
He tried to do the right thing.

516
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,270
There was no love there
to sustain it in the end.

517
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,880
And in the end she was
doing what she wanted to do.

518
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:19,940
She was trying to find love somewhere
else and she's probably a little relieved

519
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:24,680
that you're gone. Um, I
will tell you this self,

520
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,620
the fact that you have a kid with her
and she's going to be in your life for at

521
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:32,330
least another 16 years until this kid's
18 years old so she could make your life

522
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:36,890
really fucking miserable. Don't ask
me how. I don't know. They find a way.

523
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,310
It's what they do. So, uh,

524
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,550
you know that this one, you're right. If
she gives you shit, just be like, listen,

525
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,420
I move out and that night you bang another
guy and the next day you know the guy

526
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:54,280
moved in. Okay, I can do the math.

527
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,680
Am I really supposed to sit
here and believe that you
didn't have a relationship

528
00:32:56,681 --> 00:33:00,250
going on while we were still together and
then you want me to go out and buy you

529
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:03,790
a a fucking Flowbee.
Rarely is that what you're telling me?

530
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,020
Well screaming into your content cause
on that list, Jesus. Bill, come on.

531
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,490
I'm surprise we're getting a divorce.
All right, here's a new story. All right.

532
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,250
Hey Bill,
I know you have,

533
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,510
you aren't a therapist but I think I just
want to talk to anyone at this point.

534
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,740
So here it goes.

535
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,070
I've been married for just under four
years to my wife who I dated for four

536
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,270
years prior to marriage.

537
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,100
I love being married and have said that
to anyone that asks. Since day one,

538
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,940
we own a nice house together. We have
three dogs, pit bulls, too. Good man.

539
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,520
And both make a decent living. I share
everything in my life with my wife. Uh,

540
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,560
when something makes me happy,
she knows when I'm upset about something.

541
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,210
I tell her,
uh,

542
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,810
throughout the course of our relationship
about once a year she would suddenly

543
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:51,811
without warning say she she was
unhappy and has been for months.

544
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,630
Oh God. Here we go. Uh,

545
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:59,230
she says she has discussions with their
mom who loves me and is the sweetest

546
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:04,231
woman alive and close friends about
the things that make her unhappy by,

547
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:08,170
I never hear a word about it until it
boils over and she floors me with how

548
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:12,760
unhappy she is. Oh, that's
not fair. All right.

549
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,610
We tried to work it out though.
Make changes.

550
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,930
She would act like it was okay
while it bottling it up again once,

551
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,200
once the lid goes on. The bottle.
There is no opening and again,

552
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,190
each and every time she
calls the unhappiness state
of the Union meeting and to

553
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:27,940
session.

554
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,300
I've always been completely honest as
saying that I'm very happy with her.

555
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,550
I love our jokes and honesty and honestly
enjoy spending time at Baba Baba Jesus

556
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,090
Christ to get to the fucking point.
All right, last Wednesday, here we go.

557
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
We had a good night together.

558
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,200
We went out for dinner and ice cream
and laughed at about, ah, Ba, ba Ba ba.

559
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:50,310
So I thought I'd come home the
following night in general, great mood.

560
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:54,040
She told me she had talked to her mom
and a friend and that they recommend that

561
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,450
she talked to me. I was confused, Eh,

562
00:34:58,451 --> 00:35:00,430
most shit about not being unhappy.

563
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,620
Okay.

564
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,810
Uh, anyways, I wanted
anything to make her happy,

565
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,450
but she told me she didn't
think there was anything.

566
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,710
It was very emotional as she finally
mustered up the courage to say that we

567
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:13,360
might need to get separated.

568
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,530
I was floored and not in an almond asshole
husband that sits around drinks beer

569
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:23,740
and watches football with his buddy way.
I love my wife. We have free. Okay Dude.

570
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:28,510
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, so the
following day, after much reluctance,

571
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,040
I get her to agree to try
marriage counseling so we
can work out our happiness.

572
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,300
Do it.
I'm not giving you shit that this is,

573
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,460
you're pouring your heart out cause
this shit just happen. I understand.

574
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:40,160
But for the of the listeners,
I got to fly through this. Uh,

575
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,430
I get to agree with her. I get to, I
get it. Okay. So the following day,

576
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,620
it's like Lord of the rings here,

577
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,180
after much reluctance I get her to agree
to try marriage counseling so we can

578
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:55,230
work out her unhappiness. I was
willing to do anything at this point.

579
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:58,380
I immediately scheduled an appointment
with the counselor and it was looking

580
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,780
forward to having someone
neutral for us to talk to.

581
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,020
Later that night we were laying in bed
and I asked her if there was someone else

582
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:09,000
in her life. She said, no. Yeah
Dude. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Uh,

583
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,920
Jesus, here we go. We just went over
the waterfall folks or where we,

584
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,240
you know,
it is not all in this story.

585
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:18,840
We were hearing the waterfall and we've
just looked at the other person in the

586
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:22,980
raft with a panicked look on her face
for that split second before we tried to

587
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:23,671
desperately.

588
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:28,500
But futilely try and paddle the fucking
thing over to the God goddamn coast.

589
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,720
Okay, here we go. We're going over.
I got a feeling we're going over.

590
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,650
Um, she said no, there's
no one else in my life.

591
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,400
I asked her if she's ever been unfaithful
and our relationship relationship and

592
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,170
she adamantly said no again.

593
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,390
Then she turned out the light and laid
down to sleep five minutes later and she

594
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:51,240
sat up and turn the light on.
Oh fuck.

595
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,200
She told me she just lied to me and said
that she had messed around with someone

596
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:02,310
a year into our marriage. And he
writes in capital letters, what period?

597
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,560
The period fuck period.

598
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,670
I probed her to tell me what
messing around was as got
to at least be a blowjob.

599
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,670
Ha Ha, ah, fucking whore. Um,

600
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,480
and after a minute of me guessing
her silence told me that she went

601
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,390
down on a guy she works with.
Swear to God.

602
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:31,500
I hadn't read this. Oh, if
I was [inaudible] right now,

603
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,840
you heard me.
You heard me

604
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,980
fucking creep.
I was furious and hurt.

605
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:42,480
Then furious again. She cried
and cried and said she was sorry.

606
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,330
We cried together. Dude,
you're a bigger man than me.

607
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,940
While I tried to wrap my head around how
she could possibly have done that to me,

608
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,000
I've had casual flirting
with people over the years,

609
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:57,250
but to act on something physically
with someone other than your spouse's,

610
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,800
completely disgusting.
To me,

611
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,790
the worst part is I love this woman
more than anyone. She's been my og.

612
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,310
Here we go again and he's going to be
a best friend for the last eight years.

613
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:06,540
She knows everything about me.

614
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,610
I want to hate her and make her sleep
at her parents' house until we divorced.

615
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:14,820
But all I want to do is be near her
again. Yeah, dude, that's because,

616
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,090
yeah, dude, she, she was in a hurry
up offense. That's what happened here.

617
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:23,390
So now your scamper and trying to figure
out what the fuck is going on. And she,

618
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:26,000
you know, she has the next three plays
that she just called in the huddle.

619
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,650
That's why this, this is why it
sucks to be you right now. Um,

620
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,760
one of my close friends tells me what
I know is the right thing. He goes,

621
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:36,610
let it go.
Don't bother with cloud ceiling.

622
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:40,510
What else has she done that you don't
know about how he never trust her again?

623
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,650
Bill's it possible for me to forgive
my wife. Am I wasting my time?

624
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay.

625
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,020
Um, also I find out who this guy is
and I really wish I hadn't had to,

626
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,600
of course, all I wanted to do was show
up at the job, beat the shit out of him.

627
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:00,440
Like Ed Norton, Pete's the blonde,
pretty boy up and fight club. He writes,

628
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,120
I wanted to destroy something beautiful.

629
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,800
My other thought is since this guy also
cheated on his girlfriend who was still

630
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:07,634
with,

631
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,640
mmm.

632
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,520
My,
he did it with my wife.

633
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:15,780
I'd threatened to tell his girlfriend
what he'd done but not actually do it.

634
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:17,850
Yeah.
You don't want to do that that way.

635
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,170
He live in fear of coming home and her
knowing everything because I told her or

636
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,660
he would try to beat me to it,
admit to it,

637
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,340
hopefully ending his relationship
and getting terminal cancer and aids,

638
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,870
terminal cancer and aids. And you know
what? You're still being a gentlemen.

639
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,330
I still think that you're,

640
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,120
you're handling this with class wishing
terminal cancer and AIDS on this guy.

641
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,440
Um, I know you don't give a
shit. Of course I give a shit,

642
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:49,380
but not occupying. Ah, but I've got
to occupy my mind. So I thought I, I,

643
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,460
I do it here. Yeah. Do, why
would you think I don't give
a shit? You know, I mean,

644
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,950
I'm not a friend of yours, but you know
what I mean. Give me a fucking break.

645
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:57,900
This is horrific. Um, all right.

646
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:00,930
Your first question bills it possible
for me to forget my wife. Uh,

647
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,060
eventually you're going
to have to, uh, and

648
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,210
or you're going to go on a fucking tear
and you're going to meet some really

649
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,400
damaged fucking women and they're going
to reinforce everything that you've now

650
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:19,780
found out about your wife. See, can't do
that. You're going to go on a fucking,

651
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,010
uh, hate fuck pussy spree. That is, yeah.

652
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:29,170
You don't want to do that. Um, he
said, am I wasting my time? Yeah, dude,

653
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,100
it's over. She's not happy.
She's not good at communicating.

654
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,500
Um, she puts a lid on it, you
know, until it boils over.

655
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:43,150
This is the deal, dude. You know what?
I, this is going to kill you. All right,

656
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,870
let's go with the positive. You
don't have any kids with her. Okay?

657
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,680
You can just walk away.
Okay.

658
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:55,460
We had a prop and there was a,
there's nothing we can do.

659
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,570
So he didn't make it.
Did you just fucking walk away?

660
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,390
Just walk away. It's over. All right. Um,
that's a good thing. All right. One thing.

661
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:06,800
You've had a bunch of
kids with this fucking,

662
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,390
this person who for whatever reason,
couldn't say that they will.

663
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,880
I don't think that she wanted you
to wanting to fucking marry you.

664
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,550
I think she ignores her feelings.

665
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,080
She's actually having a
fucking breakthrough right
now while stomping all over

666
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:24,650
your fucking heart. All right, well

667
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,070
I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno. Fuck
her. Give me a break, dude.

668
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,420
You fucking, you loved her with your
heart. You say a mother's a sweetheart.

669
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,700
You got dogs.
You like communicating dude.

670
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,140
You know something your like
the fucking guy. You're the guy.

671
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,430
My girl wants me to be.
Every fucking woman wants a guy like that.

672
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,150
You know guy who actually wants to be
married guy who actually comes home and

673
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:50,984
communicates,

674
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,530
you know a guy who gets along with
the mom and all that type of shit.

675
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:56,930
You're a family man. All
right. Unfortunately,

676
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:02,360
you know you met the wrong person,
so forget that dude.

677
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,800
All right. Forget it. Forget it. Fuck
that. Fuck that. It's over. Walk away.

678
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,780
Yeah.

679
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,970
Walk. Walk away, Dude. Gimme a fuck by.
You know what you talking about there?

680
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,800
You're talking about like the,

681
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:19,000
the amount of fucking shit she asked to
go through before she even learned how

682
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:23,290
to just communicate or fucking emotions
and the frustration of that's going to

683
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,020
meet every once in a while she's
gonna blow somebody at work.

684
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,930
Are you wasting your time
apps? A fuckin lutely. Okay.

685
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,430
Apps a Fuckin lutely.

686
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,140
And as far as like going there and
trying to fuck over that other guy,

687
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,170
that other guy is, he's already,
you don't need to fuck him over.

688
00:42:41,171 --> 00:42:44,400
He's fucking himself over.
He's living it.

689
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,210
He's living a life of misery.

690
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:52,050
That life is miserable to fuck
around with the person that you with,

691
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,150
with somebody else.
That is a miserable life.

692
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,950
You know, I dunno. I think it's
something that a lot of guys do,

693
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:03,850
myself included back in the day in my
twenties going into thirties trying to

694
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:08,440
fuck them, you know, figure
myself out. I lived that life,

695
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:11,140
that whole fucking double. It's
horrible. It's a fucking horrible thing.

696
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:15,670
Then in the end I ended up alone and
I heard a lot of people and I was a

697
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:18,970
complete piece of shit.
So, and believe me, dude,

698
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,550
it was a miserable and ended up
me with me on a fucking futon.

699
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,450
So,
um,

700
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:26,870
yeah,

701
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,920
yeah. Do you, you're, you know,
don't become a piece of shit now.

702
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,940
Don't judge other women like
that. Just fuck it. You know?

703
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,750
Yeah.
Get out of it,

704
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,880
get out of it and just know that
it's going to be a fucking a,

705
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:43,420
I dunno,

706
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,480
it's going to be a hundred yards of pain
that you never fucking dealt with in

707
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:50,260
your life and you just got
to go through it. And um,

708
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,740
I would say the next time you
get with somebody, uh, make,

709
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,740
you know you're going to get serious
with somebody who make God damn sure that

710
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:02,250
they know how to fucking
communicate because that's a,

711
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:04,040
that's a scary thing to get
with a woman who doesn't,

712
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,760
how to communicate because
that's something that
they're supposed to teach us

713
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:10,680
how to do. You know, in a way they make
you better because you're like, oh,

714
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,030
I can just say, uh, no,

715
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:15,480
I don't feel like doing that without
fucking punched in the wall. You know,

716
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,170
they do that set up,
sell you down.

717
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,290
If you get with some psycho and
she can't settle you down. I mean,

718
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,810
she's a, she's damaged goods.
All right, here we go. Next one.

719
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,690
It's just these things just
keep getting deeper. Asexual,

720
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,230
just from a plant or
something. Dear billion, uh,

721
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,790
this is a bit of change from
the emails you usually get,

722
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,480
but I hope you can help me out anyways.
I'm a 26 year old guy.

723
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:42,660
Completely normal in every way
except for one. I'm asexual.

724
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,570
For your listeners who
don't know what that means,

725
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:49,680
it means I don't feel any sexual
dot desires at all. I never have.

726
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,350
Take a moment to wrap
your head around that one.

727
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,460
I think I'm going to need more than
a moment. Dude. Let me ask you this.

728
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,220
What do you do with all your free time?
You know,

729
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,270
how many fucking languages can you speak?
You want to think about that?

730
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,170
How much fucking shit you would get done
if you weren't chasing it all the God

731
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,040
damn time. All right. Uh,
but believe it or not,

732
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,790
I do have a girlfriend. Uh, we've
been together for four years.

733
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,630
So what do you do to get aroused?
Think about like when it's over.

734
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,770
I'm really being a Dick Right now.
I'm sorry. Um, and he goes in.

735
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:25,530
Before that we were friends
for about another five years.

736
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:29,340
We both helped each other through some
rough shit and eventually decided that we

737
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:30,930
wanted it to be more than friends.

738
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,400
She's the first girl I've ever known
who made me wish I wasn't a sexual,

739
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,170
she knew all about it when
we started dating. So there
were no surprises. In fact,

740
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:44,010
she's been really cool. We joked about
it a lot. And when we did have sex,

741
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,320
which was once or twice a month,

742
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,540
I did everything I could to make it
good for his is like fascinating.

743
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,680
So like what are you thinking of,

744
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,073
you know,

745
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,780
three more minutes and she
should be happy. Row, row,

746
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:03,500
row your boat gently down the street. Uh,
but lately things have been different.

747
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,950
It wasn't a sudden change,
but something I just noticed recently,

748
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:09,740
she doesn't joke around about
sex as much as she used to.

749
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:12,200
And we now have sex once
every two or three months.

750
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,780
Our emotional bond is still
as strong as ever. In fact,

751
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:17,020
just last week we were
talking about marriage by,

752
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:19,940
I have a feeling my gut that she
might be fucking another guy.

753
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,890
I know her well enough to know that having
sex four times a year is nowhere near

754
00:46:24,891 --> 00:46:26,360
enough for her.
The thing is,

755
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:29,180
it wouldn't bother me if she
was fucking someone else.

756
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,760
I know she has needs that I can't fulfill.

757
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,050
So I'd be willing to have a pinch hitter
come in and get the job done for me.

758
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,830
Jesus. Talk about a fucking
180 from the last story.

759
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,300
Um, I just, sorry,

760
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:48,390
I had to pause and do the math and just
make sure that I didn't say that the

761
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:52,760
wrong number sometimes. Yeah, it was a
total three 60. Now that was a one 80. Um,

762
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,430
I just wanted, I just want to know about
it. I've, I've wanted to ask her about it,

763
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,790
but I'm worried about what will
happen if I'm wrong. What should I do?

764
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,970
I love this girl that get death and I
never forgive myself if I fuck up a good

765
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:03,810
thing we have together.

766
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,970
A dude that's outside my
totally outside my bounds.

767
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,880
I don't know what to tell you. I
would, I would start going to therapy

768
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,340
alone first and then possibly
bring her in. But, um,

769
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,290
you know,
that's a,

770
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,910
yeah,

771
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,200
I don't know.
I don't know anything about,

772
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:27,500
I don't know anything
about being a sexual, um,

773
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,010
so that,
that would

774
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,090
be my advice. You know, if you want to
fix that problem and that type of thing.

775
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:38,740
But I dunno, I feel like I've
let you down, dude. I'm sorry,

776
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,960
but I'm not gonna sit here and
fucking run my Yap. Like I, I mean,

777
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,550
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about to begin with.

778
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,680
I definitely don't know who I'm
talking about with that. I would,

779
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,120
I would go get some fucking therapy.
It just say, I don't know what it is.

780
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,840
I don't fucking, nothing
gets me going. Um,

781
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,370
and then hopefully you,
you go to some asexual specialist.

782
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,850
Jesus. I'm the worst.
Sorry, I let you down.

783
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,030
I'll give you a podcast magnet
next time. I see. All right.

784
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:08,560
27 year old Virgin Jesus
Christ. Uh, hey Billy,

785
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,660
I love to hear your humorous take on
my pathetic situation. First of all,

786
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:16,960
dude, let's work on your
self esteem. All right?

787
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:21,250
You're already shitting all over yourself.
Um, all right. Hey, watch this guy.

788
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:26,090
Watch him shit all over himself. I'm
a 27 year old virgin. Oh, ggs. Uhh,

789
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,180
that's what he wrote.
Now your first question is going to be,

790
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,420
how the fuck did that happen? Well, to
protect myself, I'd actually preserve,

791
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:33,460
prefer to keep my background
is quite as possible. Hey,

792
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:36,460
I'm not trying to get you to rat
yourself out. Here's what I can say.

793
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:39,470
I come from a rich town inhabited
by obnoxious [inaudible].

794
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,690
I was always the weird kid and very
socially awkward people hated me no matter

795
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:46,630
how nice I was, Jesus Christ. Dude,

796
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,770
are you like a superhero that's like
the exact same background of like every

797
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:54,640
fucking superhero movie, isn't it?
It's probably cause nerds, right?

798
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,910
Those movies because they don't have to
fight and all of a sudden you're like,

799
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:01,510
what am I knew how to fly? What if I could
fly? There was a guy who can save me.

800
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,033
Um,

801
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,040
then they draw it and then nerds line
up around the block to go see it.

802
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,700
Did he see you spank him in? Yes.
It's exactly like the other ones.

803
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,990
Um,

804
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,740
I was always the weird kid and very
socially awkward people hated me no matter

805
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:21,610
how nice I was. And eventually I
came to hate myself and still do.

806
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,120
I called it dude, I fucking called it.
Uh, he's shitting all over himself.

807
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:32,121
Eventually it was discovered that I most
likely have a mild case of Asperger's

808
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:36,960
syndrome, which is a mild form of
autism, which is way out of my league.

809
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,690
Are you guys trying to make me look dumb?
I thought I did that.

810
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,210
I achieved that by how
awful I read out loud.

811
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,480
Here we go. That causes social
ineptitude and Quirky personality traits.

812
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,870
Well I would go find a hooker
with Asperger's. That's
the first thing I would do.

813
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,020
You get the Fucking v off my back.
Definitely wear a condom.

814
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,680
See that's where my advice is
going to be coming from. You guys.

815
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:03,350
You have some weird conversation
in some ironic vehicle. Um,

816
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,140
at least discovering this made me more
of self aware and I've been able to clean

817
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:12,060
up my act over the last few years,
but I still have a lot of social anxiety,

818
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,410
shyness, and very few
friends. On the flip side,

819
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:18,430
I'm actually pretty decent looking,
have a decent job in a laboratory.

820
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,390
These are fucking,

821
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,500
he's going to get bit by something
radioactive and he's going to become a

822
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,750
superhero.
Uh,

823
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,410
and I'm a certified commercial
pilot and do volunteer work

824
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,080
dude. Like you know something,
if, if I was in the FBI,

825
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:40,920
like so many fucking red flags
just went up there. Uh, okay.

826
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,920
That's the set up now.
Now for the question

827
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,190
first, what the fuck would you
do if you were in my situation?

828
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,570
I told you I'd get a hooker
with Asperger's syndrome
and you guys could just bond

829
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,490
over that. Uh, I don't know. Let me,
let me, let me read all your questions.

830
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,490
I'm obviously kidding him off.

831
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:01,150
I'm trying to find a hook with
Asperger's syndrome, right?

832
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,430
You couldn't find one that would
be like needle in a haystack,

833
00:51:03,431 --> 00:51:06,880
which you'd have to do is go to an escort
service and request that personally.

834
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,770
Um,
I would think

835
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,700
I'm looking for 36,
24 36 with Asperger

836
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,170
hair color does not matter.
Yes, I can hold a next if,

837
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:27,620
if eventually everything I ever
do make it anywhere with a chick.

838
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:29,780
Should I tell her up
front about my status?

839
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,230
I had this conversation a few weeks ago
with a friend who has a lot of romantic

840
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:37,550
experience and she said it would be
extremely obvious that I'm new to the game

841
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,080
and that withholding that information
could itself be detrimental.

842
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,890
But I also know that if I do tell
a chicken 27 year old virgin,

843
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:50,150
she will demand an explanation before
going any further and it will send up red

844
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:52,690
flags for the most. What do you do, Bill?

845
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,610
Thanks for doing your awesome podcast
and go fuck yourself. All right.

846
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:56,444
This is what I would do.

847
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,280
Okay.

848
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,900
I would just start hitting on every check
that fucking interest me and I would

849
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:04,280
be just totally honest.

850
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,690
Okay.

851
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,460
Tell him, tell her what your, your,
uh, your situation is. And, uh,

852
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,300
you know,
if she doesn't accept it,

853
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:16,720
then fucker let her walk and then you
don't have to deal with any of the

854
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:18,010
bullshit you didn't know.
You just,

855
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:22,220
you just fast forward through a three
year fucking horrific relationship. Um,

856
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,680
I would just be up front with people.
I wouldn't open it with Ai.

857
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,530
You have beautiful eyes and I have
Asperger. I wouldn't do that, you know?

858
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,880
Um, I will work on my self esteem.
I wouldn't talk shit. You just,

859
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,580
you shit on yourself right out
of the gate. I mean, obviously,

860
00:52:36,581 --> 00:52:39,970
I know you're going to do that. When you
said you were 27 year old virgin and,

861
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,360
and you probably going to go that route,

862
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,320
but uh,

863
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,540
think good thoughts about yourself, man.
I know that's kind of like simple, but I,

864
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,970
you know,
you gotta like,

865
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:50,300
okay,

866
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,630
you got to amp yourself up a little bit.
Go out there and you know,

867
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,810
you don't have to go find the check
he your dreams, but just go out.

868
00:52:55,811 --> 00:52:58,460
You don't get to tell some girl you got
fucking Asperger's syndrome. You don't,

869
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,840
why don't you just do that with somebody
that you're really interested in,

870
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,270
but it's just want to go out and get laid.
Just go out there,

871
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:06,290
start hitting on chicks,

872
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:10,010
turning into a game so you don't have
to deal with the pain of the rejection.

873
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,110
Just be like, all right, I don't
have the balls to take the next step.

874
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,830
Whatever that step is.
Peeling yourself off the fucking wall.

875
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,880
Striking up a conversation.
Just saying hello to a pretty girl.

876
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:23,990
She walks down the street.

877
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:27,960
Just try to get over fucking hurdle and
give you permit yourself permission to

878
00:53:27,961 --> 00:53:31,800
suck and you just, you gradually build it
up. It's like learn how to play guitar.

879
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:34,140
You're not going to pick it
up and immediately be able
to play all your songs.

880
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:38,340
You learn a couple of fucking cords,
you know? Then your fingers hurt, right?

881
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,210
And you get frustrated,

882
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:41,430
but you keep coming back and
eventually you can fucking play.

883
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,700
Pussy is no different.

884
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:51,530
That's what I would do. Put The ass burger
on the back burner. Who knows? Do it.

885
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:55,610
Maybe not as fucked up as you think you
were socially. You know what I mean?

886
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,410
Maybe you've got a sense
of humor under there.

887
00:53:57,411 --> 00:54:00,920
I think you do your shit on
yourself in a funny way. You know,

888
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:05,670
spin it around that way. Do you
have any interests? Go, go to a,

889
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:08,210
go to a fucking, I don't know.
Whatever, you know, do you fly kites?

890
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,320
Go to some flying the kite.

891
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,160
Good venture. There's gotta be some
woman there also likes to Kate.

892
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,520
I know that was an overly simplified thing
by, that's what I would do. All right.

893
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,110
And then when you go to like a
hookup with somebody, uh, they,

894
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,710
you know, edgy yet. Tell him
if he stopped and you're not,

895
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,330
don't know what you're doing to watch
a couple of fucking pornos, you know,

896
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:33,170
you'll get the idea. Actually
no, don't do that. Don't do that.

897
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,930
Cause then you'll suck and start
slapping them around. You don't do that.

898
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,820
I know what to tell you, dude. I get
buy some books. I say go buy some,

899
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:45,110
buy some books in that data that,
that part of the bookstore that you know,

900
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:49,070
if bookstores exist anymore going gone
line has got to be plenty of information.

901
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:55,330
I bet if you literally looked up finger
banging technique is you looked how to

902
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:58,040
kiss. I bet this is going to be
reams of fucking information.

903
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,873
Okay.

904
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:05,010
I've never done that cause I never had
to. Oh, just kidding. Of course I had.

905
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:05,431
Do you think of that?

906
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:09,120
I didn't wish that fucking information
was around way back in the day when he

907
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:09,750
had no id,

908
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,830
just practice kissing your fucking pillow
and tried to overhear conversations in

909
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:17,280
the fucking high school cafeteria and try
to figure out what people were talking

910
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:21,090
about. That's all I could do. You, you
have the whole world at your fingertips,

911
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,403
you know,

912
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:26,610
so when you're done in the laboratory
working with radioactive shit before you

913
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,580
get bit by something you don't want you
to go on and get late before you learn

914
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:36,240
how to fly. All right. All right.
Personal dilemma. Hey Bill.

915
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,090
Hey Bill. Hey Bill.
Read my fucking letter.

916
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:45,390
I got some problem.
Oh look who's up.

917
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,000
Look who woke up.
What's up buddy?

918
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,430
How are you? You want to go
outside when we make my dog howl.

919
00:55:58,490 --> 00:55:59,840
This is Cleo.

920
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,203
You won't go outside.

921
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:05,430
Cleo.

922
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,200
She's dancing around Cleo.

923
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,090
Cleo,
do you?

924
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:22,250
I tried to go low. Cleo, come
here. Cleo. Ah, you fucking,

925
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,760
you know I feel right and I feel like
I'm that bugs bunny cartoon when that

926
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:28,270
bullfrog is singing. How my
baby hell am I on a, you know,

927
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:32,980
and now you guys are here so she won't
do it. Cleal now she's licking herself.

928
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:37,150
I'm not gonna fucking be able to top that.
All right, personal dilemma. Hey Bill,

929
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:41,470
a few days ago, a good friend of mine
lost her dad in a motorcycle accident.

930
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:46,330
Jesus Christ. Is there any ray of sunshine
at the end of these? We started off,

931
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,150
let, let's, let's just rewind here.
Let's see where the fuck we were.

932
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,540
How we got to this point. All
right. Start it off. Validation.

933
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:58,000
My son's in that job that was
kind of, oh, whatever surprise,

934
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:02,590
we're getting a divorce. I blew
somebody at work. Holy Shit.

935
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,090
That we go asexual,

936
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:09,610
fucking whipped that around and then
we can hit the 27 year old virgin now.

937
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,610
Now we're talking about death.
Okay.

938
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:18,160
And none of this am I qualified to
talk about, um, bill a few days ago,

939
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:20,980
a good friend of my lost her
dad in a motorcycle accident.

940
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,460
It's obviously an incredible
emotional time for her and her mother,

941
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,080
much younger brother and
rest of the family, her dead.

942
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,590
This is such an awful joke.
Did they tear?

943
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:36,430
That sticks his stick figure like
picture off the back of the SUV.

944
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,830
Sorry, I had to lighten it
up. I had to lighten it up.

945
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,930
I'm sorry.
All right.

946
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:47,860
Her Dad loves his motorcycles and we'd
take it across the continent with his

947
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:51,670
body and his wife and he had his kids
on dirt bikes since they were young.

948
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:56,770
Everyone is giving all the support they
can and will continue to do so in time.

949
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,620
Uh, during this tough
time about bar last week,

950
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:04,270
my buddy and I both bought
our first motorcycles and
I've been really excited to

951
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:08,570
get it out on the road.
We both pulled over 15 grand into it.

952
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,380
Not only our bikes,
but Ryan and gear and two courses.

953
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,780
Obviously this is pretty bad timing and
we can't cancel or reschedule the first

954
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:20,830
course or else we both give a
grant to these dicks for nothing.

955
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,240
The course is next weekend and we're not
sure whether or not we should go under

956
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:26,320
the circumstances.

957
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:27,460
Okay.

958
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,570
It's a funeral falls within that weekend.
It's obviously more important,

959
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,340
but if not,
should,

960
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,530
yeah,

961
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:35,850
we take the course.

962
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,540
Okay.

963
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,110
I told her about the bike and
do this is fucking hilarious.

964
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,540
This is fucking hilarious.

965
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,240
Yeah.

966
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,680
This guy is trying to act like he really
cares about this guy and he's trying to

967
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:53,640
weigh whether I go take my
funds are really course or
go to the fucking funeral.

968
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,150
I thought the stick figure was a bad joke.
Now I don't feel bad about it.

969
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,780
All right. I told her about the bike
and courses before the accident,

970
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,640
so hiding it really isn't an option.

971
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,350
I don't think she would want us anywhere
near a bike after this. Uh, okay.

972
00:59:07,351 --> 00:59:09,570
I see what you're doing. All right. A
strike that. Strike what I just said.

973
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:12,570
I've been close with this girl for a
while and I don't want to do anything that

974
00:59:12,571 --> 00:59:14,100
might make the situation work.

975
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:19,490
Where's my buddy and I both know this
sounds incredibly fucking selfish and if

976
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:22,940
we had the option even rescheduled,
we would have done it,

977
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:26,780
but a grant to a student as a lot of money
and we don't want to give it to these

978
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:31,580
pricks. I love how these guys are pricks
how they fix these. Then that practice,

979
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:34,430
they have a business, they said what?
It was up front. They didn't Jack it up.

980
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:37,970
You paid it for them. You're trying to
make them out to be the bad guys here,

981
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:43,340
but we also don't want to offend and make
her and maybe make a fender and maybe

982
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:47,270
make things worse if that's even possible
at this point. What should we do? Thanks

983
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:47,960
stowed.

984
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,960
You want to go to this fucking course
and the worst way you give a shit you

985
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:57,200
care, but you don't want
to lose your fucking money.

986
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,323
MMM.

987
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,660
Yeah. I mean 1000 bucks is 1000
bucks. I don't know what to tell you.

988
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:08,410
You got to answer that one on
your own dope, but you want to go,

989
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,420
you definitely want to go on.

990
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,540
There was a way for you to go and not
go to the funeral without getting in

991
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,430
trouble.
You would fucking do it in a second.

992
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,940
And it has nothing to do with those
fucking pricks with their business.

993
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,713
MMM.

994
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,680
All right. You know
who's kitten? Whoa, dude.

995
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,090
Steve with all the fucking
dancing and skipping around there.

996
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,960
You want to fucking go learn
how to ride a motorcycle.

997
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:34,710
You have $15,000 motorcycle.
All right. With the [inaudible],

998
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:37,680
Punky Tuscadero outfit,
you want to go put that on?

999
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,990
Is there a way for you to fucking
go to the course and then come back?

1000
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:48,190
Dude, this is what you do. You go
take the course that day. All right.

1001
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:52,120
And hopefully the funeral's at night
and right is the service starts. You're,

1002
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:56,320
you come flying back on your bike and
then attribute to that guy who died in a

1003
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:56,781
motorcycle.

1004
01:00:56,781 --> 01:01:01,690
You come through right through the
fucking church doors on the motorcycle and

1005
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,880
when everybody fucking gas,
if you just yell out,

1006
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:06,700
yeah,

1007
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:11,420
you want a water. He died doing
what he loved and I brought my bike

1008
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:17,420
and I went to that class because I
knew he would want me to do that.

1009
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,910
Look at me that way.

1010
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,710
All right. Continue on with the
service. That's what you do.

1011
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,420
All right. That's my advice. If
you're going to fucking do it,

1012
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:32,290
cause I know you want to do it. What's
your wrestling with right now, sir?

1013
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:37,810
Is the selfish cunt within you.
And I'm not judging you.

1014
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,110
I am.
I'm relating.

1015
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:50,260
Good luck. Alright, Matt chicks. Oh wait,
I haven't done any advertising this week.

at this point. Do you guys like
going to the pot to the podcast?

1036

So the Post Office, Huh?
Maybe you do. Maybe a dump.

1037
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:12,030
Wouldn't it be nice if
that was one more thing?

1038
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,610
Off the list of things to do that day.
You could just cross off.

1039
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,430
Would it be great if he just could
handle it within your own apartment,

1040
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,080
home or sleeping bag?

1041
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:24,240
Would it be great if you could print
official US stamps off of your computer

1042
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:26,700
where they gave you a little scale?
You got to buy the hat.

1043
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:29,520
But what if they gave you a little scale?
You could, you could just weigh boxes,

1044
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:32,670
put the official US postage,
take a right out to the post office box.

1045
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:34,770
She could do at two in the
morning while eating cereal,

watching reruns of the Jeffersons.

I'm going to go buy a widget on
amazon.com you just helped out the troops.

1090
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,850
Who's a hero? You are not me,
not me. I'm just the Messenger.

1091
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:23,380
I'm just, I'm an open channel. I just
let it flow right through me. All right.

1092
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:27,370
Smart chicks. Bill,
you're an American hero.

1093
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:33,460
Lead talking to May for what
if I did?

1094
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:37,300
I, I uh, I must know somebody
at the American hero awards.

1095
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:42,460
Nepotism. Uh, my dad started
it so he just gave me one.

1096
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,380
I'm smart chicks,
smack chicks.

1097
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:48,790
My girlfriend dumped me because she could
sniff out my bs before even realized

1098
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:49,624
it smelled.

1099
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,070
She was definitely smarter than me
because after I was through pouting about

1100
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:58,600
being dumped, I realized she was
right. That's very mature. You know,

1101
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:02,350
you're not that dumb. There's a lot of
smart guys, you know, they can't do,

1102
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,980
they think Albert Einstein would do that.
Some chick who's smarter than him,

1103
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:07,240
he could fucking handle that

1104
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,830
with his Phil Spector
haircut before Phil Spector.

1105
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,960
Tom Selleck, mustache. All
right, so here's my question.

1106
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:22,690
How do I make smart chicks dumber.
Thanks for you help.

1107
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,700
Don't go fuck yourself. Fuck others.
Okay. Um, this guy's a wise ass.

1108
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:33,040
I like, how do you make
smart chicks dumber? Um,

1109
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,370
all right,
this is what is what you'd

1110
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:36,270
do.
I don't care who they are.

1111
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,270
They got to have some sort of physical
thing that you can tell it there that

1112
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:42,900
they're sensitive about.
Okay.

1113
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,990
Maybe they have little arms like that
little hot Italian chicken on the food

1114
01:07:45,991 --> 01:07:46,824
network.
You know,

1115
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:50,430
every time she goes to reach something
like her arms are always totally straight

1116
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:54,720
or else she can't get it yet. She somehow
like five foot two. That's what you do.

1117
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:59,640
You just look for something.
Okay. And then you focus on that.

1118
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:03,900
Anytime she starts being smarter, you
bring up her little arms, you know,

1119
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:08,250
you bough,
you gradually destroy her spirit.

1120
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,480
That's how you do it. Now,
do you want to do that?

1121
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:17,750
I hope you don't because if you do,
then seriously go fuck yourself.

1122
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,160
Oh, sorry. Anyways,
let's go dilemmas bill.

1123
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:27,520
Would you rather gain a three pack a day
smoking habit or have to wear a dress

1124
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,540
for the rest of your life?

1125
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,540
Yeah.

1126
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,400
Oh,
I take a dress all day long.

1127
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:38,260
I'd take all fucking day long.
I would get some fucking,

1128
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:43,261
a fruity smell and shampoo to wash
what's left of my Hayek and uh,

1129
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:46,350
I'd wear, I'd wear down the street.
You know what I would do? What?

1130
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,510
I would start hanging out in coffee houses
and act like I played guitar and I'd

1131
01:08:49,511 --> 01:08:53,350
probably get more ass than I ever did
as opposed to fucking three pack a day.

1132
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:56,350
Smoking habit. There's no fire. I want
to do that. Then what? Die earlier.

1133
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,750
I'll be at my desk bed going
out, dress still be alive. Uh,

1134
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,050
the Bruins still at first place. Fuck.
I know that. Got To win it again. Uh,

1135
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:09,620
would you rather have a third nipple
in the center of your chest or a third

1136
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:12,800
testicle? Oh, without question. I
take the third ball all day long.

1137
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,970
Who the fuck's going to see
it? You know, and then a fair,

1138
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,950
we get kicked in the balls.
I got one that can get out of the way.

1139
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:23,030
So maybe it can like somehow offset
the pain of one and only feels like,

1140
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,020
like when lance gets kicked in the balls.
Does that make any sense?

1141
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,450
Yeah.

1142
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:33,290
I mean, I dunno when, when is a
girl really gonna what is it girl?

1143
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,970
Really even look at your
boss. You know, it's funny.

1144
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:39,970
I could have three balls and my
girl would know. You know, I know.

1145
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:44,030
Notice that course you're dead and it's
all fucking inflated and not inflate it

1146
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:48,200
and shift in and it's, it's like,
uh, I don't know what it is.

1147
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:51,380
It's like a ball sec. I don't even
know what the fuck is in there. Yeah,

1148
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:52,191
it's throw another one in there.

1149
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:57,140
I don't give a shit as opposed to having
that third one sitting there looking

1150
01:09:57,141 --> 01:10:01,520
like a late model Ford 1948
Ford, it was at the, uh, no,

1151
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:03,170
what was that guy?
That Tim Robbins,

1152
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:07,490
that car Tim Robbins made in that movie.
Tucker.

1153
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,400
Look at like the front end at one of
those Tucker's, yeah. I'm not doing that.

1154
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:18,410
Having a third headlight.
No fucking way. No Way.

1155
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:22,100
There's not enough makeup to cover
that up, but you know, whatever,

1156
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:26,720
throw something else in my ball bag. Hey,
you know what I say about my ball bag?

1157
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:29,990
The more the merrier. And he liked
that. All right. And what that,

1158
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:33,110
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody up nice and early,

1159
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,180
it's able to be downloaded perfectly.

1160
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:39,080
What could you think about
bitching about next? Who knows?

1161
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:43,220
Please visit me on Twitter.
I'm almost up to 100,000 followers,

1162
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:48,320
you know, and I think once I get to
100,000 that's going to be critical mass.

1163
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:52,070
And that's when I can really start hitting
you guys with my conspiracy theories

1164
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,850
and, and possibly start getting
a little momentum, you know?

1165
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,500
Um, that's it. Okay. This week everybody,
I'm going to be at the DC Improv.

1166
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:01,370
It's already sold out,

1167
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:03,680
but I'm going to bring it up just so
I can tell you that it's sold out.

1168
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,070
You know like when they have a poster
up on the wall and they just stamped,

1169
01:11:07,071 --> 01:11:07,970
sold out on,
it's like,

1170
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:10,700
well the why you still advertising
it to rub it in that I'm not going.

1171
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:14,430
That is exactly what I'm doing.
I'm at the DCM prop down.

1172
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,170
I'm out there to celebrate,

1173
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,550
celebrate their fucking
a 30th anniversary.

1174
01:11:20,551 --> 01:11:23,760
It's one of my favorite clubs of all time.
You know?

1175
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:24,990
There's some special ones out there,

1176
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,720
ones that I dreamed of playing
and that is one of them.

1177
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:31,380
How do you like that endorsement?
People at the DC Improv.

1178
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,430
I love him so much and we'll be there
in a Tuesday. Oh Jesus. You know what?

1179
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:40,431
I just try to overly cross my leg over
the top of the arm rest here and I just

1180
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:44,120
crushed one of my balls for a second,
you know?

1181
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,950
Why do you think that just happened?
Do you think my house is haunted?

1182
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,150
Do you think there was maybe somebody
who used to live here named Ulysses who

1183
01:11:51,151 --> 01:11:54,540
was killed by a bunch of fucking mean
neighborhood kids because they found out

1184
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:58,140
he had three balls and now I finally
brought it up and I unleashed him.

1185
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,780
You know what?
I think I'm going to call ghost hunter

1186
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,640
as cause it's the grace,
the ghost of three ball Larry.

1187
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,000
And you know what's funny about that
fucking ridiculous Goddamn show is they

1188
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:12,950
would actually show up to film it.
You know? You know I want to do it.

1189
01:12:12,951 --> 01:12:17,460
I want to film them filming my place
and catch them when they throw that rock

1190
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:20,220
down the hall big. Oh, what the fuck
was that? Did you still saw a door?

1191
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:23,640
I definitely felt something.
You know that show is,

1192
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:26,370
it's like a bunch of Paul
versus chasing ghosts.

1193
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:37,070
All right. You want, you want to hit the
biggest, the biggest fucking scam ever,

1194
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,330
and this is such a big fight
between me and Nia all the time,

1195
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:44,090
is the use of the fucking dishwasher.

1196
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:50,290
I think the dishwasher is one of the
biggest scams other than the Federal

1197
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:56,210
Reserve. It goes Federal
Reserve, ice cubes, anger,

1198
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,710
and then the dishwasher.

1199
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:01,760
Yeah.

1200
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,730
And you can throw, skip Bayless
in there somewhere. His,

1201
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:07,250
his screaming and yelling somewhere.
You can throw it in there somewhere.

1202
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:12,200
I don't give a fuck. Um, you know, it's
all, it's all up to personal opinion.

1203
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,750
The dishwasher,
it doesn't fucking wash dishes.

1204
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,170
And I know this is a Seinfeld thing.

1205
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,083
Why?

1206
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,100
Yeah.

1207
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,530
Did you call it the what?

1208
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,210
Um, yeah, it doesn't,

1209
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,390
it doesn't,
the dishwasher does not scrub the dishes.

1210
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:36,630
It basically like you have to take a piss
and there's a skid mark and the toilet

1211
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,710
and you just start pinging on it.
That's what a dishwasher does, you know?

1212
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,600
So basically if the food has been
there long enough, it's not coming off.

1213
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:46,681
All right.

1214
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:51,681
And My lady will fucking put dishes
in there and they'll stay in there for

1215
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:56,340
fucking days. And then she runs it
and it gets, it gets most of it done,

1216
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:57,780
you know?

1217
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:01,740
And then I go out to make myself an egg
and there's fucking dinner from fucking

1218
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:06,330
three nights ago, a couple of like
skid marks in the toilet, Lasagna,

1219
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:08,880
skid marks on the fucking plates.
It drives me nuts.

1220
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,040
I had a hissy fit.
Everybody,

1221
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:18,010
okay? I literally, I had a hissy fit,
I'll even call it that. If you saw it,

1222
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,330
you would have laughed your asses off.

1223
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:23,110
Cause I was here by myself cursing and
screaming when I couldn't figure out why

1224
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:25,900
we didn't have any fucking forks,
where are the forks?

1225
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,130
And then I finally was like,
you know what, I bet during
the goddamned dishwasher.

1226
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,050
And I went over and opened dishwasher and
it was like fucking 10 plates in there.

1227
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,490
All with this shit that
you couldn't get off yet.

1228
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:38,500
I didn't have to hire one of those fucking
guys who paints cars at this point to

1229
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:43,000
come over here with that sand blaster
to get the shit off. And uh, you know,

1230
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,610
I don't know. I'm, I'm, I'm
talking too much about the ship,

1231
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:49,630
but the dish dishwasher is completely,
it's a scam.

1232
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:53,200
It doesn't fucking work. And for some
reason it adds value to your house.

1233
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,830
When people show up, does
it have a dish? Oh honey,

1234
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:59,600
they have that thing
that doesn't really work.

1235
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,720
You know? Ah, Jesus, your bill, you know
it's, you're an hour and 15 minutes in.

1236
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,760
You gave them their fucking money's worth.

1237
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:11,510
Do you really need to end it with your
goofy little riff about dishwashers?

1238
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:15,170
Do you think other people never used
them and realize that they don't quite

1239
01:15:15,171 --> 01:15:18,860
fucking work? You stupid cunt. All right,
that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves.

1240
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:19,910
We'll talk to you next week.
