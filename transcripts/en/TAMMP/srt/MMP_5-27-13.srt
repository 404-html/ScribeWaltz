1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,291
Hey,

2
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:06,291
what's going on is bill burr and it's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,680
May 27th, 2013 I don't like
the way I just said. Um,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,190
Monday. Um, you have to catch
yourself. Sounded like a Douche.

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:20,190
They're happy.
Memorial Day.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,310
Happy Memorial Day.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,600
A Beautiful Tab to thank
the troops and stuck.

8
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:31,860
Give stuff your mother fucking
face with Shit. All right.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,090
Isn't that what you're doing?

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,700
Let's all have a moment of silence for
everyone who made a sacrifice for this

11
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:42,720
country. Alright, right.

12
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,450
Let's go stuff our faces,
right? Isn't that what it,

13
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:50,280
isn't that what every fucking
holiday is? Flag Day. Today is a day.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,553
Okay.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,820
Joe, Roman by, I remember,

16
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:57,821
I remember all the flags set
up wave though about those
contract Godrej projects

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,140
and allies. Stuff our faces, faces, faces.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,690
Let's get drunk and have a fight with
a mother's mother's mother's mother's.

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,550
You know,
isn't that what it is?

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,660
How many people are actually going to
go to a fucking parade today from the

21
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:19,040
halls up Ooma to the shores of Tripoli?

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,083
Huh?

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,290
Who can sing beyond that fucking two
lines other than a goddamn ex marine or a

24
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:32,700
current marine, one or the other.
Is that what they do? And when you,

25
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:33,990
when you joined the marines,
by the way,

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,240
do you have to sing that song at
some drill sergeant is in your face.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,260
Hey you,
you fucking screaming.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,280
Oh Shit. They're single
arc. One of them. Of course.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,073
Right.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,070
I commend anybody who's in the military
service simply for the ability to get

31
00:01:56,071 --> 00:02:00,990
through bootcamp and having somebody
screaming in your face and just pushing

32
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:05,991
down every ounce of your being to not
like just punch that guy right in the

33
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:10,050
fucking face. This is thing like,
I've thought about that Shit, right?

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,460
Like let's say thanks,

35
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:16,461
get really fucked up and all of a sudden
they want to draft soon to be 45 year

36
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,840
old balding red heads like myself.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,090
And I've actually thought
about for some reason

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,310
I think I think about it whenever I do
pull ups because whenever I do pull ups

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,750
or climbing the rope,

40
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:32,751
I always think you think I could make it
through fucking maybe three obstacles.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,190
Three obstacles in one of those bootcamp.
Thanks.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,320
I could get up the fucking rope.

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,530
I probably couldn't do the
required amount of pullups,

45
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,190
but I wonder if I could just get
out of the drill sergeant. You know,

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,310
I'll still take care of Claire.
I haven't pressed,

47
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,320
where's your upper body strike you all
right. Get the fuck out my face. Right.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,690
Can I at least get one of those?

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,440
But my thing is if someone screaming
in my ear like that, like I got,

50
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,420
I got tonight is what our tetanus,
however the fuck you say.

51
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,440
I have it one of my years.
So if the guy screaming in my ears,

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,280
I'd have to be like, yeah, skills me. Uh,

53
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,090
I guess I'm not trying
to not be Maureen light,

54
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:18,091
but I just wanna let you know when I
played a lot of drums and my ears are very

55
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:23,440
sensitive. If you could just, uh, you
don't even continue with the insults.

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,150
I'm not trying to tell
you how to do your job,

57
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,990
but if you could just somehow
bring the volume down, you know,

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,620
and then immediately I'm pile because
everybody else has to start doing pushups.

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,580
Is this quiet enough for you?
Private bar.

60
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,040
Okay.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,320
Look at the rest of your platoon
sitting here doing pushups.

62
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,280
Cause you don't want me to yell too loud.

63
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,890
Just exactly.
How quiet do you think warriors,

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,970
you redheaded freckled fucking faggot.
Right?

65
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,260
There's no way that they have a city.

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,380
It's always the homophobic shit is
not what they come at you with. Huh?

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,200
I bet you're sucking Dick.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,273
Right.

69
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,020
You know what?

70
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,010
I actually shouldn't say any
of this because I have no
idea what they say to you

71
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,730
other than what I've watched in movies,
you know.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,380
So anyways,
Happy Memorial Day,

73
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,570
a beautiful time to thank the troops and
stuff he fucking face with some shit.

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,740
Um,
that should be the official memorial day.

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,880
I think the only people who truly
appreciate it are people who have actually

76
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:34,610
served and know people who have served

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,773
know

78
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,110
that would be my really built.

79
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,180
He really think that the people who are
closest to it appreciate it the most.

80
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,010
What other groundbreaking things are you
going to say in this podcast? Oh, I know.

81
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:51,300
I know. I'm a moron. All right.
Can you just let me have my moment?

82
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,080
Can you well,
all right then.

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
MMM,

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm in New York City right now.

85
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,420
I'm in my old up Budnick loneliest shit.

86
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,150
I Dunno how he used to
do this as a single man

87
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,770
at all.

88
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,840
Although I have to tell you it's a,

89
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,620
you guys know the comedian,
not Ted Alexandro if you don't,

90
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,570
you showed he's one of the
best fucking comics out there.

91
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,880
He used to have this great joke.

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,820
I'll just do the gist of it cause
I don't want to fucking burn Joe.

93
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:29,200
He used to just say that basically
it was essentially that, you know,

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,390
being single, it's sucked at
night cause you will lonely.

95
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,160
But it was great for the rest of the day.

96
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,120
I can't say I'm feeling that,
but I do have to.

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,370
I have to concur with that joke that at
nighttime when you fucking go home by

98
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:47,350
yourself,
that's when it gets to you.

99
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,470
I think it was when you wake up in
the morning, you have errands to run,

100
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,700
you got to, I'm going to go to the gym.
You know, there's hope. That's what it is.

101
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,860
This hope that you're going
to find somebody, you know,

102
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,160
when at night all that hope
is gone and it's just you,

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,570
a pint of ice cream and a slice of pizza,
you know,

104
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,900
solely crying as you crying
softly as you're chewing,

105
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,150
getting down to the crust.

106
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,070
Um, actually, you know, I, I've, um,

107
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,780
I've made a rule that this time
when I go through in New York,

108
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm not having any pizza and
I'm not having any ice cream.

109
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,300
And I know what you thinking,
Bill, you're in New York City.

110
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,750
You have to have the pizza. Okay,
well, I'm going to tell you what,

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,400
I've had enough New York pizza
to last me a fucking lifetime.

112
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,030
First of all,

113
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,030
90% of New York pizza sucks a giant
pizza cock because it doesn't make any

114
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:45,170
sense.
Um,

115
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,120
it doesn't make sense simply because
there's so many people living off the

116
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:53,060
fucking reputation that
New York has great pizza.

117
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,693
You know,

118
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,750
that's the problem.
New York does have great pizza,

119
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,751
but there's no laws prohibiting anybody
from opening a pizza shop saying the

120
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,520
best pizza in New York City,

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,213
you know,

122
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,280
it's fucking horrific.

123
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,940
Maybe if I do danger fields or
go over to that Sutton pizza,

124
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,380
they're over on first avenue.

125
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:17,890
I always liked have pizza and a nice
fucking zip over there and I zipped to the

126
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:21,370
sauce there. Nice Little Tang near
Nice little, what the fuck was that?

127
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:25,420
Their in their uh,
in their pizza slices,

128
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,893
you know,

129
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,930
I don't know.
Pizza is always that shit.

130
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:34,170
You're like stumbling home after a couple,
two, three fucking whiskeys. Right.

131
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,300
And then you fucking,
uh, I dunno what I mean,

132
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,680
what the Hell I'm saying
you got to realize I have
to get a fucking appointment

133
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,560
book cause I just realized how much
shit I just planned for tomorrow.

134
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,533
You know

135
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm going to get a steak fucking dinner
with Joey roses and Keith Robinson.

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,940
Somebody over at the stand comedy club,

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,110
the head chef over there is going to
teach me how to make the fucking pizza pie

138
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:58,944
over there.

139
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,573
MMM.

140
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,130
Cause I got the big green egg and I
can heat that fucker up to 700 degrees.

141
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:10,540
Do you guys even know what I'm talking
about? Just realize that I bought this,

142
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,860
this big green egg,

143
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:16,720
this barbecue where in a smoker and they
give you this book showing you all the

144
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:19,960
wonderful shit that you can make on it.
And all I've made on it is burgers,

145
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:23,680
hot dog and fucking chicken.
So I want to take it to the next level.

146
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:24,880
I want to be able to make a pizza.

147
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,130
But you gotta know how to
make your own fucking dope.

148
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,783
You know,

149
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,590
which I don't know how to do.

150
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:34,660
So I'm going to have this person show me
how to do it because I'm a fucking seat,

151
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,900
right? I'm always trying
something new. Oh, what's that?

152
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,310
What's that bill up to the
to fucking today. Anyways,

153
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,450
how about those Bruins? Huh?
Hey are we go bro? And we go.

154
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,610
That's how it used to be.

155
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,470
That's the chant that used to get going
back in the days in the old Boston guy.

156
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,450
Now they go, let's go, Bro wins and I'm
telling you, that's the ranger champ.

157
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,120
Who is, here we go, Bro. Ones. Here we
go. And let's go. Rangers. All right,

158
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,080
well you know where the range,

159
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:12,081
is it going now out to the
fucking golf course because yes,

160
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,610
the Bruins and one short week

161
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,400
went to the fucking Mecca,

162
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,330
Madison Square Garden and in five games
it was actually a five game sweep.

163
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:32,280
Who's kidding? Who? You know, not to
take anything away from the Rangers,

164
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,000
but I've got it all right.

165
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,990
When the whole rally on your side gets
going, cause our goalie fell down.

166
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,420
I want,
have you ever a goalie?

167
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:46,800
He just falls down like some kid playing
peewee hockey and then he tried to go

168
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,810
out. There was a Rut in the
ice. You fell down. Took.

169
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,900
It's okay. It happens to the best
of us. Go down to a public, Rick,

170
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,860
you see it all the time.

171
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,300
My favorite thing in a public rink is
watching that guy who where it takes like

172
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:05,000
12 seconds for him to fall.
[inaudible] I've ever,

173
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,600
oh right.

174
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,000
The fucking six going backwards.
Six going forward. Right.

175
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,880
And then the fucking Bam,

176
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,400
and it's usually the back hits first and
then the fucking whiplash and then the

177
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:24,330
head makes that nice hollow coconut
pook right off the fucking ice.

178
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,810
That unmistakable sound of somebody
squash hitting a sheet of ice.

179
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,040
That's a fuck as an incredible sound.
You know what?

180
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,970
And I don't think that
that can be reproduced by
Hollywood unless you actually

181
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,280
had somebody slammed the head on it.
That's incredible.

182
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,380
Not even with one of those Casio keyboards
that has access to over a thousand

183
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,041
sound effects.

184
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,220
They never have to even notice that they
never have the sound effect of a head

185
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,390
hitting the asphalt or a,
or a sheet of ice.

186
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,710
So there's one few nerds. What does
it somebody out there, you know,

187
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:02,500
when are you Photoshop concept? They're
trying to get me up the perfect that,

188
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,790
that perfect sound effect and sent it to
me and I'll have my first sound effect

189
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,600
on the podcast. You know, and I'll
turn this into a wacky morning show.

190
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,600
And every time I say something
dumb, I go, oh, what was I thinking?

191
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:17,100
And then I'll click the button and then
you'll hear it and then your laugh.

192
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,230
Okay?

193
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,230
Then you'll be in the parking lot at your
job holding onto the steering wheel 10

194
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,730
and two just staring at that front door
that you don't want to walk through.

195
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,540
It's having those last
few moments to yourself

196
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,330
thinking about all the decisions
you've made over the last 12 years.

197
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,900
Why did I break up with her?
Why did they major in this?

198
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,330
Why did they buy this car?
Okay,

199
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,220
why can't I feel feelings anymore?

200
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,470
Is Your eyes well up with tears?
Just

201
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,570
look up at the heavens.

202
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,470
Wonder if there's some old
guy up there that gives a fuck

203
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,230
you Christ softly.

204
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,980
And then for some unexplained reason,
you look over to the left

205
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,460
and this is your boss stare at you.

206
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,040
But this weird look on his face.
Like

207
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,980
is that my crying in his fucking car?

208
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,190
Yeah.

209
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,200
She quickly tried to play it off.
Like you sneeze,

210
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,870
you take a big deep breath and you
push all those fucking feelings down.

211
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,890
You like it and you get out of
the car. Hey Paul, they boss.

212
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:40,590
Are you doing and I allergies.
Allergies. All right. Yo.

213
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,300
See in there you have can't wait.

214
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,410
I'm sorry.
Anyways,

215
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,420
so the Bruins are now
going to go play the,

216
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,190
the, the most confusing
franchise in, uh, in,

217
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:00,310
in um, in Nhl law, in the NHL.

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,910
I don't know how to feel
about the fucking penguins.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I totally respect him and I'm fucking
blown away by their ability to somehow

220
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,650
always get the guy that's the
next guy. I mean, it's insane.

221
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:17,950
I liked in the last 20 years,
25 years,

222
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,370
I would actually put
them beyond the Yankees.

223
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,270
Yeah. Wait a minute. Or I would, I would
know. I would compare him to the Yankees.

224
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,913
MMM.

225
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,280
When the, when, when
the Yankees, you know,

226
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:37,120
got a babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
Then Joe Dimaggio,

227
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,440
Mickey Mantle.

228
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,130
I would actually that this is the
closest thing you've seen where they,

229
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,200
the penguins,
Mario Lemieux.

230
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,600
Jaromir Jaga um,
Sidney Crosby,

231
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,160
it fucking Gino market. I don't want to
say [inaudible] [inaudible] and Denny,

232
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,410
I don't know how to fucking say
these hockey names nowadays.

233
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,880
I used to be shocks all these French
fucking names. So that was easy, right?

234
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,390
Michelle Goulay oh, shoots. He scores.

235
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,323
MMM.

236
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,090
Fucking for absolute snipers.
I mean,

237
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,300
unbelievable fucking top
notch goddamn players.

238
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,410
It's incredible, right? They have that.
And then on the other side, right.

239
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,310
And then whenever they get
hit, they're like, you know,
Mario [inaudible], you know,

240
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:31,390
if people don't stop cheating,
I'm not gonna play anymore.

241
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,540
Alright. Yoga was always like, oh,

242
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,570
he's got a mullet and he
just loves those Kit Kats.

243
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,630
Yeah.

244
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,410
Late some all the time. So people flew us.
Why? You know, he scored all those goals.

245
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:49,310
Well, I'll tell you, I wish I knew that
when I'd Floyd. All right. Sidney Crosby,

246
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,210
big pouty lips. Fucking cub
scout dead. He is, you know.

247
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,180
Yeah.

248
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,880
But say hate about that guy.
Other than the fact that you know,

249
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,740
he doesn't do anything wrong in life.

250
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,010
Help an old people cross the street.

252
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,530
Even with the skates on
runs out of the arena,

253
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,560
is that an old person
trying to cross the street?

254
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,890
Just a fucking Wheaties cereal
box cover look and son of a bitch.

255
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,310
Why is he a son of a bitch?
Because you know he's better than you

256
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,480
head and shoulders.
The best fucking guy in the league.

257
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,670
Then he got milk guy who could be
a fucking cunt and be like, Hey,

258
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,890
what about me?
He doesn't give a shit.

259
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,970
He just plays his Goddamn game
and his tremendous, all right,

260
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,670
it's a great fucking hockey town.

261
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,470
They had one of the great last arenas,
that Mellon arena, Carnegie Mellon,

262
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:47,970
Heinz, whatever the fuck they called
it, Goddamn Pittsburgh people.

263
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:51,930
They got three names for everything.
See the Heinz Carnegie,

264
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,980
Carnegie Mellon or just melon?
I guess that's four,

265
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,420
but was really just Carnegie Mellon. Just
all fucking remix like p. He's in there.

266
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,380
By the way,
the more years that goes by,

267
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,430
that biggie has been dead and,

268
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,980
and his legend just keeps growing and
growing with the fact that nobody's ever

269
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:14,220
matched that guy's ability with humor,
storytelling,

270
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:18,540
and being able to paint a fucking picture.
Forget about his charisma.

271
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,860
His last time you saw a guy even remotely
with the fucking charisma, that guy.

272
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:23,790
All right.

273
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,770
As the years go by and you keep going
back frustrated with the new shit,

274
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,570
and you just keep going back to that,

275
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,810
that mumbling fucking shit that
puffy does on every fucking track,

276
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,490
it's,
it's like it's kicked somebody out there.

277
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,700
Send me some fucking biggie tracks,
will you?

278
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,220
You removed Tahfeeth going,
that's right.

279
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,973
Uh Huh.

280
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,050
Okay. And the fucking pack round,
whatever the fuck he says. Oh,

281
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:59,500
just repeats every guide that the last
word of every line that big, he says,

282
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:00,550
it's like we heard it.

283
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,640
Was it an enough for you to be
in there with the fucking faders,

284
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,970
pushing those up and down? I've got
to listen to your mumbling jackass.

285
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:15,130
I tell you one of the worst fucking rap
songs ever was when he and that other

286
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:19,390
mumbling jacket, Mace
County who've had those,

287
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,940
that how he heard the guy to do.
You know what?

288
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,790
Tell me which one to use fucking
rapping because I can't tell the it,

289
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:29,790
why am I this upset? Anyways,
let's, let's, let's dial it down,

290
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,930
but style down, let's get back
to the fucking, to the SBA. Okay,

291
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,320
I'm agreeing with him.
Um,

292
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,760
oh fuck.
So that's one side of the penguins.

293
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:48,300
And then on the other side of
the penguins and, and you know,

294
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,820
Crosby bitch moaning and complaining,

295
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,820
Mario Lemieux bitch moaning and
complaining about the thuggery,

296
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,530
the cheating and all that fucking shit.

297
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,590
And then like right in their
own goddamn locker room,

298
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,520
they have had

299
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,120
the exact same thing where you had the
Ruth Dimaggio and Mickey Mantle of Lou

300
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,650
Gehrig. They've had that of the
fucking biggest God damn need breakers,

301
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,760
cheat and sons of bitches ever.
You know,

302
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,460
I have this love hate with the penguins.
You know,

303
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,640
I love him because I respect the franchise
and I hate them because not because

304
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:28,000
they have these cheat and constant
fucking just go out there and try and end

305
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:32,290
people's careers. It's the fact
that they then have the balls.

306
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,890
Okay to bitch.
You hope those are kind of walking.

307
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,940
The yard loaders are going
to deploy them in order.

308
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,120
You know why we're even in this week.

309
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,650
He wanted to get fucking Matt Cook in
35 years of watching people play hockey.

310
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:52,790
I've never seen a guy check somebody in
the boards and accidentally completely

311
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,160
sever the guy's fucking Achilles tendon.

312
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,580
How does that happen?
I don't know.

313
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
They say it was a fucking accident and I,

314
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,940
if it was anybody else
I would've believed it.

315
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,300
You know what the sad thing about Mac
cookies is a guy can actually play.

316
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,710
He's a fucking great player and
he's definitely toned down his shit.

317
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:13,670
But I mean I can't have a,

318
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:18,050
forgive the guy cause he ended Savardi
career guys on a follow through of a

319
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:20,540
fucking shot could not be more vulnerable.

320
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:25,541
And you come by 30 miles an hour and
hit him with that plastic shoulder blade

321
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,501
would pad,

322
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:29,500
which is like hitting somebody crossed
the job with a fucking wrench and you end

323
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,000
his God damn career.
Unbelievable.

324
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,370
I'm fucking so this is going to be a,

325
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,380
okay,

326
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,090
this is going to be a brutal series.

327
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,793
MMM.

328
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,720
The only fucking weak part I
can see on the penguins is the,

329
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,090
they have shaky goaltending

330
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,420
yeah.

331
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,140
You know, but just their
offensive power. I just, I am,

332
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,903
I dunno,

333
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,830
my heart says Bruins,
but if I was putting money on it,

334
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,840
I mean I would say penguins. It's six,
nine, it was a lot of bronze finish.

335
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,550
Go let your flag waving flags
and Shane do you what? You,

336
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,410
you fucking get no weird. Now that
you live in out fucking la. Good.

337
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,100
Now I just watch enough hockey and I've
seen what the fuck they're capable of.

338
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,460
Like Sidney Crosby is
literally unstoppable.

339
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,510
Okay.

340
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,520
You don't fucking stoppable. And if they
just had one guy like that, you know,

341
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:27,870
like the capitals and Ovechkin
is nowhere near a Crosby.

342
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,310
Although he had a great year.

343
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,923
MMM.

344
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,770
Now I'm going to have those
guys fucking wine into me

345
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,223
total.

346
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,363
MMM.

347
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,350
If he just fucking had him. But the
fact that you have all those other guys,

348
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,300
you know, Malkin and all
those guys, it's good.

349
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,590
It's going to be fucking,
I dunno how he, I,

350
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,300
you know what I'm calling it right now.
We were going to play the trap.

351
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,260
We're going to try and play that boring
ass fucking hockey and it's going to

352
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:02,070
kill me. I'm going to have to
watch because it's my team.

353
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,510
But I want before anybody sends me the
emails, no, I don't enjoy watching it.

354
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:10,860
Even if we win a game, I
don't like it because, uh, I
really enjoyed watching the,

355
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,650
uh,
penguins senators series,

356
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,040
even though that one last game was
that seven goal game was a fucking,

357
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,050
was a blowout. Um, oh, by the way,

358
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,761
once again,
you know,

359
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:27,540
a lot of people explain to me why there
was such hatred towards a maple leaf

360
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,780
fans, Toronto in general
and all that type of thing.

361
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:35,781
And everybody was saying that basically
that that's the biggest city in Canada

362
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,960
and that's where like all the media is so,

363
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,940
because all the media is there,

364
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:45,750
it's like everybody in Toronto then
thinks the whole fucking country of the

365
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:49,050
whole world revolves around them. I'm
not saying it's true, I'm an outsider,

366
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:52,310
but that's what they say.
But it reminded me kindness kind of like,

367
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,960
like New Yorkers,
you know what I mean?

368
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,320
Okay.

369
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,040
Like they just think everything
begins at fucking ends,

370
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,810
you know,
with like mad.

371
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:06,190
And the only reason I Madison
Square Garden is this Mecca
is because it's in the

372
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:10,960
middle of the biggest fucking city
with all this media here, you know?

373
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,200
And a lot of New Yorkers, they really
confused that it's a mecca. Yeah.

374
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,750
That's just a gathering place.

375
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,830
Okay.

376
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,730
People come and play hoop there because
that's where they can make the most

377
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:24,910
amount of fucking money and get
the most amount of media exposure.

378
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,960
But that has nothing to do
with the Knicks are how good.

379
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,310
Okay.

380
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,550
Oh the, the, the legendary.
The Knicks are not legendary.

381
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,330
They're not all right

382
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,700
with spike Lee sitting court side.
You're fucking low rent. Jack Nicholson.

383
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,610
Oh, woody Allen with his
awful hat. Jesus Christ,

384
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,930
you know,
at least La,

385
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,050
they have the decency to
get their faces laminated.

386
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,800
If you're going to be the
celebrity sitting on the side,

387
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,880
just fucking with you anyway.
So the next route,

388
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,420
the rangers are out cause of
the Boston Bruins. And uh,

389
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,100
once again, the garden is silent
and it's ready for the circus.

390
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,940
The Mecca [inaudible].
That's their fucking,

391
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,270
that's what happens every goddamn
yet you realize the rangers have one,

392
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,540
one Stanley Cup and the less 73
fucking years you understand that.

393
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,110
Do you realize that in like the fucking
60 something years that the NBA has been

394
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:39,130
around the uh, New York Knicks?
If one, only two titles,

395
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,140
two titles. Last one. That one was in
1973 Oh, let's do the math on that one.

396
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:49,010
That was 40 fucking years ago.
That's a verse he kills me.

397
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,620
The guard was rocking last night.
He's always telling me how loud the is.

398
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm fucking believable. Rarely. Okay.

399
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,640
Louder than the fucking piece
of shit. TDF, Xyz Garden,

400
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:08,510
whatever the fuck they call the Boston
Garden. No, when the boys came back down,

401
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:11,510
fucking three goals and a game.
Seven. Was it louder than that Paul?

402
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:15,630
Versey I'm asking you. Um, all right.

403
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,010
You're listening to the Monday morning
podcast here. Everybody. Geez Louise.

404
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:19,611
You know what?

405
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:23,450
I think it's time to tell you guys about
some wonderful products that you might

406
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:26,720
not have been aware of. All
right. Here's one for you.

The Dollar Shave Club,

408
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,390
getting a good shave can
be a real pain in the ace.

409
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,300
I'm searching through 50 brands,

410
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,880
matching new blades to old handles,

411
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,030
bullshit features where your razor
doubles as a flashlight at vibrator.

412
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:47,930
Toothpick, 20 bucks for new
razors. That really is a rip off,

413
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:52,430
by the way. The new razor blades I
love. They haven't behind a case,

414
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,830
you know,
like they're giving you gold coins.

415
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,320
It's like maybe if you didn't
charge 80 bucks for each one,

416
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,520
you wouldn't have to fucking

your company there. Hey, let's keep,

478
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,320
let's keep talking with the sports
here. All right. Who's kidding? Who?

479
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,030
I don't watch that much NBA hoop.
I don't, I really, I like it.

480
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:17,070
I know I shit on it a lot.
But uh,

481
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,710
I got to tell you that Dwayne
Wade flying fucking elbow.

482
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,110
All right. Now it did look like he
was trying to leap over the guy,

483
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,630
but at the last second there
was no fucking reason to
do what he did was like a

484
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,050
wrestling move.
And I know it's debatable,

485
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:42,051
but what killed me was Reggie Miller
and the other commentator or Steve Carr

486
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,140
immediately
the first reviewing of it just go.

487
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,470
Yeah, that wasn't intentional at
all. That's that, you know, it's,

488
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,840
it's part of the natural bodily
movement when you leap into the air,

489
00:29:55,841 --> 00:30:00,250
like one of your elbows just sticks out
like that to give somebody a forearm

490
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,290
shiver.
He fucking gave the guy

491
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,370
an impromptu flying elbow.

492
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,910
That's what I think had he
leapt in the air, you know,

493
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:12,190
cause they were kind of crossing
over each other in a weird way.

494
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:16,520
He jumped over the guy and was
like, oh, there's his head man. Boy,

495
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,670
I ain't going to fucking
write their friend out. He
liked the game. One of those,

496
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,180
the guy collapses in a fucking heat.
Although I heard he's known for flopping,

497
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,190
but it just killed me. That just
automatically deny him. Holy Shit.

498
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,340
Look at that elbow. Oh wait, that's one
of the superstars of the league. You know?

499
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,080
I don't think that there was anything,

500
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,440
there was no malicious
act. Just, it's ridiculous.

501
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,260
If that happened at Dwayne Wade
and he went down, I swear to God,

502
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:49,720
both of them, would it be like,
see now that, that right there,

503
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:54,721
that's the kind of thing that just does
not belong in this game at this level

504
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,520
or, or at any level for that
matter. You know? I mean,

505
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,320
there's kids at home watching this game.
I mean,

506
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:03,180
that's just a little look at that.
Let's watch this again. I mean, oh,

507
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,270
that's just disgraceful. That's
just, I mean it just premeditated.

508
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,620
I'll tell you the legs got to
take a look at this at all.

509
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:12,670
I would be really surprised if that
gentleman was plaguing a next, uh,

510
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,020
the next contest. Fucking
superstar does it. Ah, you know,

511
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:19,630
he didn't mean anything by that,
you know, he's kind of a, I mean,

512
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,000
he was in the area, had flap
his wings like a bird, you know,

513
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,010
he doesn't have any feathers,
so he's got to tuck his, his,

514
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:27,460
his hands back towards his torso. It's
very normal, very normal right there.

515
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,170
Um, that's it. That's all I
know about hoop this week.

516
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,630
Other than him pulling for the paces, who
else is playing? WHO's out in the West?

517
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,980
I love,
you know what I love,

518
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,880
I love the spurs and their white
guy basketball that they play.

519
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,560
I absolutely love. They are
fundamentally sound. Pick and roll.

520
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,380
Fucking kiss it off the glass.

521
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,100
I can't jump either game that
they played this tremendous,

522
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,370
there's not a lot of white guys
out there doing it, but when I,

523
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,230
when I watched the spurs play,
that's,

524
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:07,231
it looks like five white guys
playing pickup at the y and it,

525
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:12,250
and it's effective. I don't know how
they do it. So who are they playing?

526
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,510
They're playing the grizzlies.

527
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,773
MMM.

528
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,640
I don't give a shit. I'm just so
elated that the Lakers aren't in it.

529
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,480
So fucking a lady absolutely love it.

530
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:28,481
And I hope Dwight Howard stays with
the Lakers the same way I've enjoyed.

531
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,943
MMM.

532
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,490
What's his face? Alex Rodriquez
steak with the New York Yankees.

533
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:40,550
Alex Rodriguez is my most favorite
Yankee of all fucking time,

534
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,153
you know,

535
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,290
is they try to shame him out of town and
he's just like, ah, you know, I, you know,

536
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,480
you want me to sit down at a playoff game?
I don't give a fuck.

537
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,130
I'm not leaving that contract. Go fuck
yourselves. I'm staying. I love it.

538
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,660
I absolutely love it. Um, actually,

539
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:02,390
what's your really disturbing
a youtube video last night?

540
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm trying to think of
how the hell I got there.

541
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I was watching animals and I was watching
these two little fucking weird things.

542
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,880
They can't see that.

543
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:18,881
Well their heartbeat when they're
nervous can go up to like 1300 beats per

544
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,560
minute.
You know,

545
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,210
like somebody trying to win
one of those fastest hands,

546
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,820
single stroke roll drunk contest.
They fucking,

547
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,790
they can beat them with their heart.
They can't see that well

548
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,240
and uh, I dunno, they basically
they have to live meal to meal,

549
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:41,680
their heartbeats so fucking fast that
if they miss a meal they could actually

550
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:46,160
die.
The sleuth of sloths.

551
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,660
I don't know what the fuck this thing was,

552
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:51,470
but all I know they don't
see that well and they,

553
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,160
two of them don't see each other too.
They literally run into each other.

554
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,920
I got to find this fucking video
and they just had this,

555
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,230
does this sickest
fight I've ever seen in my life.

556
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,830
Like they had to slow it down.
Look, when they were showing it,

557
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,490
they go and this is not sped up footage.
This is how fast these guys,

558
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:17,990
it was like watching two flyweights
times like, you know, to the fifth power.

559
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,600
So I'm watching that shit, which leads
to more shit. And then I see like these,

560
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:26,540
these,
these bloodhounds getting fed,

561
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,070
doing all that shit. Next thing
and you know, you just give me,

562
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:34,160
just keep looking to the right and it's
more, you know, eagles killing snakes,

563
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,181
snakes,

564
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:40,100
killing fucking this a mancuss
killing a fucking a black Mamba.

565
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:45,101
And then next thing you know I'm watching
these rednecks going bear hunting.

566
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,833
All right.

567
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,140
And it got all these dogs in these
metal cages and they could stick their

568
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,380
fucking heads out and it's hilarious.
They stick their heads out and the go

569
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,710
right and all the Peta people
are of course like there's
thing I want to get out

570
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,970
of this cage.

571
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,330
They're really excited cause they want
to go fucking hunting is what I'm what

572
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:10,600
I'm thinking they do it.
So I might think in a hunt,

573
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,300
these bears with dogs,
what the fuck is this?

574
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:15,910
I made a bear could just swap one of them,
kill them.

575
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,430
But what it is is they have so many
of them and basically the dogs go,

576
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,200
they chased the bear,
the bear goes up a tree.

577
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,750
And then like 10 rednecks walk up to
the tree and then one of them decides,

578
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,250
all right,
I'll fucking shoot it.

579
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,700
And they shoot it and it
falls out of the fucking tree.

580
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,800
It's just the worst thing I've ever seen
in my life just as far as like, listen,

581
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,360
go and bear hunting takes
unbelievable fucking balls.

582
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,430
If it's you and a buddy,
you know?

583
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,810
Yeah.

584
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,430
And you're in bear country and you
could stumble upon a grizzly bear that's

585
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,050
she's walking with their cubs.

586
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:01,080
And then she immediately comes over
and tries to rip your fucking face off.

587
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,490
And even though you got a gun, that still
takes an unbelievable amount of balls.

588
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:10,491
But I gotta tell you this hunting
black bear with like fucking 10 dogs,

589
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,930
five dogs, and they chase it up a
tree and then you show a watch here.

590
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:19,920
So I'm going to shoot that thing that's
the size of my garage. Fucking nailed it,

591
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:22,530
man. It was, it was fucking disgusting.

592
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,690
It was really disgusting.

593
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,620
Okay.

594
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,100
I respect it on one level because you
have an ability to live off the land.

595
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,020
The dollar crashes you like, well, we
didn't have anything in the stock market.

596
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:39,130
Fuck it, let's go bear hunting. You know,

597
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,600
because those people really are
the ones who are going to survive.

598
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:46,750
So I have such a tremendous respect for
anybody who hunts and has the ability

599
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,440
okay.

600
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,060
To go out and,
and

601
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,000
yeah,

602
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,390
basically go get some food.
Unlike me, he's a total pussy,

603
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,510
just goes down to the
fucking grocery store.

604
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,030
They're kind of get a pound of the
Omega three quarters of a pound off the

605
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:05,730
Turkey. Do you have to smoke?
Let me get the smoked Turkey.

606
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,520
Some of heartache cheese with that. I'd
like that. Right. That's me hunting.

607
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,720
And I get frustrated when I
can't find the cereal aisle.

608
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,730
So I'm basically one of the guys who
when the shit hits the fan, you know,

609
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:24,450
and I'm in a city and I just get fucking
hurt into some goddamned FEMA camp.

610
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:28,050
I'm done. Vantage Bay, I'm
done right? Those red rednecks,

611
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:32,160
we'll just fucking back slowly
back off of their property.

612
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,540
Like that dude who tuck his package
between his legs in that movie with that

613
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,670
chick who was in the
fucking pinball movie,

614
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,700
right silence of the lambs and it just
slowly fucking back out into the woods

615
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,390
and you'll never see them again.

616
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,770
They're going to be able to live off
the land and fucking ride it out and

617
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:52,320
they'll create a new clan,
you know,

618
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,130
and they'll be the ones that eventually
topple over the bankers after they

619
00:37:57,131 --> 00:38:01,420
exterminate everybody and they take
all the land and they'll laugh at those

620
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:04,210
rednecks, you know, and just
call him a pesky problem.

621
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,740
Okay.

622
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,970
Not Try to hunt him down with
drones from their fucking,

623
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:10,010
Phyllis knows fucking rednecks.

624
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,160
They're going to be out there
covered in mud like Rambo,

625
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:15,200
a little bit of deer urine
behind the neck, you know,

626
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,670
and eventually begging to come
back like fucking Attila the hun

627
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,090
and all empires fall and it's going to
be those mother fucking rednecks who do

628
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:29,660
it tremendous respect from.
Okay.

629
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,090
Now having said all of that,
Jason,

630
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:35,570
a fucking bear up a tree with a
bunch of God damn dogs. It does.

631
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,150
Did she just see the bear up there?
Like things just appear like, dude,

632
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:43,090
are you fucking kidding
me? You know, it's, it's,

633
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,640
it's not like it, but it's not totally
upset. It's like, all right, I'm up tree.

634
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,260
I don't really know what those things are.
They're very loud as a lot of them,

635
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,470
but they don't seem to be able
to climb up the tree. So a,

636
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:01,300
eventually they'll get tired, they'll get
thirsty, they'll leave, I'll climb down,

637
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:05,500
you know, crack open a keystone and
have a pot full of honey and I'll just,

638
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,400
you know, that'll be my day. And
then all of a sudden these fucking,

639
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,190
you know,

640
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,830
do you have to got all bore these
fucking guys just come walking up and I'm

641
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:15,131
telling you,

642
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:20,131
they're literally standing like maybe
20 yards from the tree and this giant

643
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:25,690
furry beanbag is right up there and
they've just shoot it in the neck and then

644
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,850
it just falls. And they always,
they don't need edit out.

645
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,790
It fallen out of the fucking tree.
Uh, it's just, it was just a, uh,

646
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,000
I dunno. Any red necks out here
listening to this while you can defend.

647
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,750
Okay.

648
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,940
I Dunno, that just seems like the, uh,

649
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:45,560
the tiddly winks of fucking a hunting,
you know,

650
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,570
checkers, not chess. You know what I mean?

651
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,700
To quote Denzel and one of his movies
where he screams at the fucking white guy

652
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:57,380
from the suburbs doesn't quite, you
know, it was in over his head. Right.

653
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,540
Teaching them the slang. Um,
all right. So like I mentioned,

654
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:06,430
I'm here in New York City and, uh, had a
great time last night. I went down to, uh,

655
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,000
the comedy cellar and did
like three shows down there.

656
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,080
And it reminded me of the old days when
I used to do all the shows here in New

657
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,110
York and fucking jumping calves and
sit back and forth between the clubs.

658
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,950
You'd have a new joke and you get
to try it three times a one night.

659
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,450
He just can't, uh, you can't
put a price tag on that.

660
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:30,290
And I ran into Ari Shaffir who was
living in La. He's now in New York City.

661
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,760
Um,
and he's working his way into the club.

662
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,820
Told me last night and he's going to start
being leaving a veil so you can check

663
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:42,050
out Ari Shaffir hopefully
on some upcoming shows. And,

664
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,860
uh,
I'm psyched for him.

665
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,180
It's like to watch and grow by leaps
and bounds by getting all that, uh,

666
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:51,740
that extra stage time. So it's been
a, a wonderful thing out here. Oh,

667
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:56,570
I know what you know, I forgot to
bring up, um, the Toronto mayor.

668
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,340
Can you guys give me some
more information on that guy?

669
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:03,540
They're trying to say that he was smoking
crack and he goes, uh, he goes up,

670
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,180
there's a video of him smoking crack.
He said it doesn't exist.

671
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,520
Then he called the media a
bunch of maggots, so vent.

672
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,290
So immediately I'm loving this guy.
He's talking all this shit,

673
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,680
but then I kind of read up on him.

674
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,450
He's got a lot of sketchy
shit in the background.

675
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,140
I always wonder what you people
in Toronto think about the guy.

676
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,460
All right in neighboring cities. Do you
think he is a piece of shit? Do you think?

677
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:31,080
Uh, the media is a bunch of magazine
of fucking dope. Let me know. Anyway,

678
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:35,570
so here we go, Bill. As a
penguins fan, I have to ask,

679
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:40,140
do you endorse the Bruins pa
announcer going woo after goals?

680
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,190
If so, what is wrong with
you? Um, I have to admit,

681
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,390
I hated it when I first heard it.
I hated it,

682
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,230
absolutely fucking hated it.
And uh,

683
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,530
but I've come to an acceptance but
that the Bruins aren't mine anymore.

684
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,320
I'm an old man now and uh,

685
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:01,350
it's onto the younger generation
and this is how they're doing it.

686
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,570
And uh, I got to admit now
when I watched the games,

687
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,770
it's the playoffs and they score. I'm so
fucking excited that when the guy goes,

688
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:12,600
Woo,
I fucking do it too.

689
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,980
And I feel like fucking ric
flair and it's, and it's,

690
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:20,580
you can call me a Douche all day long and
you'd be a hundred percent right. It's,

691
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,810
I can't even defend it.

692
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,870
And if it wasn't my team, I would
be trashing the shit out of it too.

693
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,160
I really would. All right.
Well let me ask you this.

694
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,490
You guys have off Samuel Sing Alf,
Sammy scene.

695
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,390
I'll Samuelson in your ring of honor.
Okay,

696
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:44,250
let me ask you what's worse. All right.
And I know what you're going to say.

697
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:48,390
You're going to say the woo cause you
don't give a fuck. You don't give a fuck.

698
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,690
Cause he's not fucking blowing
out the needs of Sidney Crosby.

699
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,770
But I can guarantee you cried
like a fucking bitch would.

700
00:42:55,771 --> 00:43:00,210
Crosby was out for a year and a half
because that guy gave him a concussion.

701
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,220
Right? And when Mario Lemieux was
bitching about the fucking islanders,

702
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,310
probably like, yeah, that's like
Mario. That's exactly right. You know.

703
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,470
So here I am trashing something
that my own fucking team does.

704
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,980
Why don't you grow up and have
the ability to do the same if not,

705
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,330
go fuck yourself. Okay. A few
weeks ago I asked, you know when,

706
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,710
when you go to a casino,

707
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:29,750
you know once the deal
with the fucking covert,

708
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,130
like why they have the
ugliest carpets planet.

709
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,120
My theory's always been a
casino was so goddamn big.

710
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,560
The amount of money that you will save
by buying the ugliest fucking carpet on

711
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:42,394
the cheap.

712
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,503
MMM.

713
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,010
You know, that's why you do
it. When you political, I
mean, how many square feet is,

714
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,520
is like, you know, the Mirage,

715
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:54,760
how many square feet is the fucking
Bellagio and all that. I mean, I mean,

716
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,370
it has to be,
I have no idea.

717
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:03,070
I have no fucking idea. A million
square feet. I have no fight. I mean,

718
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:05,980
how many trucks have to pull
up with that Goddamn carpeting?

719
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:09,460
So that's why I thought that it was the,
it was always ugly carpeting.

720
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,890
So here's some theories
that people have said to me.

721
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,720
MMM.

722
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,730
Hey, bill, wanted to let you
know in response to your five,

723
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:23,080
your May 20th podcast from having
worked in the casino industry.

724
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,970
I've heard the reason the carpets in the
casino are so vomit inducing Lee ugly

725
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,300
is so people will avoid looking at them
and look up at all the slot machines,

726
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,960
restaurant signage,
merchandise and whatnot.

727
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,980
It's a psychological manipulation to
focus your attention where they want it.

728
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,970
This also usually a confusing
pattern to the carpet,

729
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,580
uh, to the pattern. A weight.

730
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,770
She was also a usually a confusing
pattern to the carpet design and overall

731
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:54,180
structural layout too,

732
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,980
to the place to make you subconsciously
wander around and put your money into

733
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:02,770
something rather than having any
clue where an exit might be or how,

734
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,890
how much time has passed.
Um,

735
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,170
I agree with that. So I
would, I would agree with the
second half, the first half.

736
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,520
I don't know. How long would
you stare at carpet? You know,

737
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,640
like God, look at the fiber, look out,

738
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,010
look how beautiful that carpet is.
Um,

739
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,550
I would actually think at this
point if he had a beautiful carpet,

740
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:28,460
like a nice fucking electric
blue, you know, but, and
people feel like, oh my God,

741
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,140
something exciting is going to
happen here. You know, maybe a piece,

742
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:32,780
something peaceful they could be,

743
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,910
can be a little more relaxed when he
fucking walked in there and he can look

744
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:37,290
around at the horse,
I don't know.

745
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,870
But as far as like having a confusing
pattern and a weird structural layout,

746
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:47,460
I mean if you've ever been,
if you've never been lost in a casino,

747
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,870
you've never been in a casino,

748
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,110
which you ended up having to do
is you've got to pick like a,

749
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,330
you got to start memorizing
where the restaurants are.

750
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,050
Like there's where the sports book is,
so I know the elevators to the right,

751
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,090
but if you start cutting through slots
and you're like fucking oh another Jack

752
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,920
Nicholson,
reference him in the shining in the end.

753
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:08,340
Why under her as you're going
through all those hedges, you're not

754
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:11,251
like,

755
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:16,110
I'm surprised you don't see somebody
sitting on the ground like dead with an ax

756
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:17,430
in the head and not frozen.

757
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,680
But you know if frozen like those people
you pass when you're trying to get to

758
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:24,060
the top of that mountain there,

759
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,720
Mount Everest right over there in the
Himalayas. Is it in the Himalayas?

760
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,690
I have no idea.
Here's another theory.

761
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:34,830
Somebody has this strange pattern and
the carpeting on casino floors is so if

762
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:35,820
you drop a chip,

763
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
you don't hear it hit the floor and the
crazy colors hide the chips if you're

764
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:45,690
looking for them. Um, I
don't buy that one either.

765
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,430
That just seems like a fucking long
way to go to try and make some money.

766
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:53,970
You're already playing a game where
the odds is so in favor of the casino,

767
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,600
they don't need to be crawling around
the floor afterwards. Vacuuming up chips.

768
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,160
I wouldn't go with that.

769
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,030
Somebody else said that the reason that
they have it is because it's easy to

770
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,500
clean up puke stains. I don't
know what it is, but please,

771
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,130
please bring me more theories
to that because I find it
fascinating. There has I,

772
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,440
out of everything that I, that
was just, I just read there.

773
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,620
I believe it's a confusing pattern and
it adds to the confusion of trying to get

774
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,280
the fuck out of there and then you
just, next thing you know, you're,

775
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:27,780
you're playing a game. I, that one
seems to make the most sense to me.

776
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:32,660
All right. Um, here's the next one here.

777
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,430
Where the fuck am I here?
All right, dear bill,

778
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:41,431
both Fagens I have recently discovered
my lifelong friend is in fact an asshole.

779
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,940
First let me give you some backstory.

780
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,290
I put friends with this kid
since car seats and baby teeth.

781
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,930
So last year when I'm looking
to move into a new place,

782
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:56,700
I naturally turned to him. Oh, that's,
that's not a good thing to do. Live it.

783
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:56,971
And you know,

784
00:47:56,971 --> 00:48:00,120
one of the quickest ways to end a
lifelong friendship is to go and live with

785
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:04,050
somebody. Just think of all
the people who've fallen in
love. You're my soul mate.

786
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,540
They get married and within five years,
you know,

787
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,870
one of them goes mysteriously missing.

788
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,673
You know,

789
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,990
by the way,
that's a bad thing to do.

790
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,970
If you're going to kill
your wife or your husband,

791
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,660
you should really go practice on some
homeless people and prostitutes first,

792
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,110
you know, get you get your murderer
in game up to par. You know,

793
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:26,830
to really try and get away with a
murder with your first murder when you,

794
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:29,710
you have everything to gain
with that person being gone.

795
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:32,350
It's no wonder everybody gets caught.
You know,

796
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,810
you gotta you gotta suck it up.

797
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,190
You got to push your ego down
and go to the miners first.

798
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,310
Get some at bats down there at the foot.
The fucking,

799
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,540
the fucking Newark bears. They a couple
of pokes, you know, get out there,

800
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:53,020
shake the rust off. I'm sorry. Anyways,

801
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,710
took us last year. I decide to move
into a new place. I naturally, uh,

802
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,560
so when I'm looking to do that,
I naturally turned to him.

803
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:03,740
He was living on his own with his cousin,
was happy to move in with me.

804
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:08,420
Now since I have known him so long,
I know his tendency to be a slob.

805
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,650
I discussed with this,

806
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:13,880
with him before we moved in and let
them know I could only tolerate so much.

807
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:17,240
Uncleanliness he responded
back in, kind in. Agreed.

808
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,550
Now flash forward to after I move in,

809
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,720
I wake up in the middle of the night
to snoring that can wake the dead.

810
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,740
I do what any normal person would do
and go out and ask them to do something.

811
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:31,820
Since it was keeping me up.
The kicker is he wasn't even in his room.

812
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,730
He's laying on the floor
in the living room.

813
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,440
So I wake him up and asked him if he
could either a stop snoring or B go to his

814
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:42,830
room.
This elicits no response from the beast.

815
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,540
He attempts confrontation and finally
relinquished his to his room. Yeah,

816
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:51,830
this guy's a, he's, he sleeps
pretty hard. Um, he goes,

817
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:54,290
this has happened on and
off now for the past year.

818
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,690
Usually he just gives me the finger now.

819
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,350
Just gives me the figure.
Now when I wake them up for snoring,

820
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,580
clearly I get the impression that he
only cares about himself and gives two

821
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:09,050
shits about anybody else.

822
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,200
There's other things like him
not cleaning up after himself,

823
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:16,670
not caring for his pet and some smoking
habits that are less than appealing.

824
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,630
I'm willing to compromise though,
but he just makes no effort.

825
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:24,830
He refuses to address any of it.
He always says he thinks of me as family,

826
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:27,920
but I don't imagine anybody treating
their family. This actually,

827
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:30,560
that's exactly how you treat family
cause you know they're not going to leave

828
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,990
you. I'm so, he goes, so now,

829
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,370
so now I'm moving out and I haven't
told him this is the reason.

830
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,650
So what do I what? So bill, what do I do?

831
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,000
Do I tell him he's an asshole
and tell them to kick rocks.

832
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:47,360
So just forget about it and let bygones
be bygones. You just forget about it too.

833
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:52,010
All right? Because this guy was your
best friend until you live with them.

834
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,143
Just like,

835
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,620
okay,

836
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:59,480
just feel bad for his future wife and
this is the deal. One of these days,

837
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,460
you know,
he'll bring up,

838
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,750
you guys live in together and you'll just
laugh about it and just be like, dude,

839
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:10,970
I left because I swear to
God I was fantasizing about
going out into the living

840
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:14,090
room and chopping your fucking head off,
you know,

841
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,750
or just fucking stuffing a chloroform
rag in your God damn mouth it all and you

842
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:26,670
can just laugh about it. But to a right
now with how upset you are at him,

843
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,220
it's going to affect your
friendship. Um, you know,

844
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,710
if you'd done being friends with the guy,
I would bring it up now,

845
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,920
but if you're not, then I would just, uh,

846
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,880
I would use that story to get laid.

847
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,040
That's what I would do because
it will be a funny story.

848
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,660
And as you're telling the funny story,

849
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:47,970
the woman's going to be listening
and being like, Oh my God,

850
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:51,840
this guy's consider it.
He picks up after itself.

851
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:56,520
I have this unbelievable urge to
suck his dick. Now what is that?

852
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,450
Why do I do that guys? That's
how I would use it. All right?

853
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,930
And then whenever he brings
it up, just laugh about it.
That's like a, I live with,

854
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,810
uh,
Bobby Robert Kelly,

855
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,240
one of my best friends
in the whole wide world.

856
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,430
We almost killed each other
when we lived together,

857
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:17,440
but Opodo Polo [inaudible]

858
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,740
I left with them and he was a
fucking slob and I was the fucking,

859
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,930
I want, I mean, I'm not even that neat.
That's the thing. I'm not even that neat.

860
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:33,750
Like I don't make the fucking bed every
day. You know, I always have three,

861
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:38,250
four days of clothes, but I get to
that 0.34 days and then I pick up,

862
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,270
I'm pretty good about doing the
dishes, but he, he was just like,

863
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:47,271
I'd come back from the road and there
would be like dishwater like six days old

864
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:52,020
or something and they'd be like noodles
from like the Chinese food floating in

865
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:53,190
there.
It was like,

866
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,613
okay,

867
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,070
ah,

868
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,330
we didn't have any rubber gloves and I'd
have to stick my hand reached for that

869
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:03,650
plug. Oh, it was fucking nasty.
We lived in such a shit hole.

870
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,180
I got to talk to them about
that someday if he remembers.

871
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:12,740
We had this fucking kitchen.
The counter top was,

872
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:15,980
this was plastic.
I don't,

873
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:19,850
I don't know what it was like this hard
plastic and it was yellow and it was

874
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:23,750
dirty. It was, it was so fucking gross.

875
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,680
Like couldn't even cook in there
and had this fucking stove.

876
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,480
I swear to God that features,

877
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,970
you could rock it back and
forth two or three times.

878
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:36,630
It would literally come down like an
old shack. It was such a piece of shit.

879
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,660
And then the guy who actually
his name was on the lease,

880
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:43,050
used to keep his smelly hockey
stuff out there in the kitchen.

881
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:45,180
It was the most disgusting fucking thing.

882
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,600
And then there was three guys
living there and like assholes.

883
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,470
We had like a bathroom
basket out in the kitchen,

884
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,010
not a big like kitchen size of
bathroom one. So it was always,

885
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:59,880
always overflowing with whatever
the fucking eight. It was fucking,

886
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,560
it was nasty bug. That really just took
me back to a bad period in my life.

887
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,140
Although it's funny now.
It's funny,

888
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,190
yesterday I was over with Bobby and
his lovely wife eat some dinner.

889
00:54:11,191 --> 00:54:15,060
She cooked a fucking tremendous meal and
we started laughing about the old days

890
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:18,120
living together. Right. And I'm
still friends with them, you know?

891
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,110
And you know what I did?

892
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:23,160
I addressed what a slob he was while we
were living together and we went like

893
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:26,550
six months without even speaking
to each other after we moved out.

894
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,500
And you know what? You don't want
to go through that type of shit.

895
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,680
But we were both young and immature.
Maybe that's where you're at.

896
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,850
Maybe you got to go through it. I don't
fucking know. Anyway, success story.

897
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,480
A Billy red face.
I'll keep this short,

898
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:44,540
but you gave me spot on advice a few
months ago about my cheating ex wipes.

899
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,130
So I sincerely thank you.
Well, you're welcome sir.

900
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:51,360
And if anybody's listening to this know
that I'm a fucking moron because every

901
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:53,460
once in a while like, you know,
he played darts long enough,

902
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,090
you're going to hit a bullseye.
Alright.

903
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,720
But you guys listened to me and my advice
at your own fucking risk. All right.

904
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,610
So anyways, he goes,
I couldn't be happier.

905
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,530
My real question is how long were you
single before you met Nia and would you

906
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:12,180
care to share any of your
bad dating stories? Um,

907
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,600
thanks and fuck. Syd The kid and the
pussy. Penguins Bruins and six. Alright.

908
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,270
Bruins fans. Um, how long was I single?

909
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:22,920
I was single for quite a while.

910
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:31,220
Uh, I don't remember. So
fucking long ago. I don't know,

911
00:55:31,221 --> 00:55:35,340
a couple of years. Couple
of years. But I was not,

912
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:39,870
I was never good at being single,
doing that whole fucking playboy thing,

913
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:42,730
you know,
talking girls into bed and all that types.

914
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,760
I always felt like shit afterwards unless
the girl was like fucking smoking hot

915
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:52,260
and then you had like cute bleed. She
slept with me man. You know, kind of vibe.

916
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:53,970
I never a

917
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,320
okay.

918
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,500
I Dunno, you know, it is. By the time I
figured out how to talk a woman in bed.

919
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:02,970
By then I was like in my early thirties
and it was always something that,

920
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:05,010
you know, he fucking talking
to somebody like, you know,

921
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:09,660
2123 and they're just fresh
out of college. I literally,

922
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:13,980
it was like the pussy verges of watching
those rednecks hunting bear with dogs.

923
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,990
You know, I just didn't feel the, uh,
the sense of accomplishment after awhile,

924
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:24,460
you know, I'm a big softy. What

929
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:45,210
There's just something about being a
guy cooking some raw meat over an open

930
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:47,260
flame.
I don't know what it is.

Henry Ford and Joe Derosa.

where decisions have to be made.

1003
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,730
For the past seven years I've been working
within an industry that has thrown me

1004
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:20,480
so many curve balls and fuck yous
that it just doesn't seem normal.

1005
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:25,910
The brief roundup of what I've been
through, shit, canned three ones, three,

1006
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,660
three weeks after buying a house.
Oh my God.

1007
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,030
You know, I've never had to
deal with stress that level.
I can't imagine that one.

1008
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,350
Number two business close
two weeks before my wedding.

1009
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,060
Oh my God. So not only,
you're not making money,

1010
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,420
you now have to be even more involved in
the wedding planning because you don't

1011
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:51,800
have the, I gotta go to work.
Excuse. All right. Number three,

1012
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,640
numerous dead end jobs and
what not leading up to today.

1013
01:01:56,210 --> 01:02:00,230
Although I have had the pleasure of
listening to the wise words of birth.

1014
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,640
I don't know about that dude.

1015
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,980
You're listening to a more on that
you can relate to you. You said, uh,

1016
01:02:05,981 --> 01:02:09,440
I have decided enough is enough.
I'm off to join the army.

1017
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,270
Going to do a trade,

1018
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:16,040
throwing away eight years within the
tech industry to become a chef. Um,

1019
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,930
so be a chef in the army.
Did he go,

1020
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,990
you just hang back and peel potatoes?
That's what I know. You're not even yet.

1021
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:30,430
You fucking make that shitty army
food tastes unbelievable. You know,

1022
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,760
and then you got it. Then you don't,
then you get fans within the army.

1023
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,440
Then you come out, don't blow all your
money on hookers and all of that bullshit.

1024
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:40,480
Save all your fucking money.

1025
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,760
Be a chef in the goddamn army.
And, and then when you get out,

1026
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,820
you know,
start your own restaurant.

1027
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,130
Okay,

1028
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,690
I'd experiment with food and find
out what the average American likes.

1029
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:55,710
You know,

1030
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:00,710
you have an a in total like
demographic right there,

1031
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,380
running the gamut. You've got people
from all 50 states, all right.

1032
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,670
And some of them know how to cook.

1033
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,270
Maybe the southern guy can teach you how
to make some of that fucking barbecue.

1034
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:10,560
You know,

1035
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,680
somebody out in buffalo could show you
how to make some wings that are juicy on

1036
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:18,180
the inside. Crunchy on the outside
is a tremendous opportunity.

1037
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,600
You can go see the fucking world, eh? Uh,

1038
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,340
I know it was other people in the army
see the fucking world over the middle of

1039
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:27,210
this fucking shit. All I know, I'm sorry,

1040
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:32,160
I'm trying to put a positive spin on
this. Yeah, it is. It is what you,

1041
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,470
it's what you're, what you
put into it here. So he goes,

1042
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:37,440
there's a lot of hard work ahead.
Yeah. That guy yelling in your ear.

1043
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,070
What kind of chef do you know can
go through an obstacle course?

1044
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:44,040
I hope you're going to do some
pushups buddy. And he goes,

1045
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,200
it'll be well worth it in the end.
If all goes to plan,

1046
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,870
I'll be away from home and
the wife for eight months,

1047
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,370
nobody said I'd get a holiday to a lol.
Anyways,

1048
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,860
just wanted to say thanks and
I'll be sure to listen always,

1049
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,850
even when I'm living on some base,
far away from my friends and family.

1050
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,240
All right dude.
Well good luck for your man.

1051
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,020
Do you feel like that's
the right way to go?

1052
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,480
I hope you come back to being
a chef though, man. You know,

1053
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,390
if that's actually in your heart.

1054
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,933
MMM.

1055
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,211
You know,
it's funny,

1056
01:04:13,211 --> 01:04:16,330
that story just reminded me of something
and I was laying down and then I just

1057
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:20,290
sat up and now I can't even
fucking remember the fuck.

1058
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,480
I gotta go back and reread some
of this shit. I'm a chef. Uh,

1059
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:28,180
hard work will be worth it. Ah, fuck.

1060
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:33,010
What happened in my brain? Huh? What
happened to it? Everybody. All right.

1061
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,430
We're almost done. Oh, I know
what it was. Getting into shape.

1062
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,100
I gotta show you this youtube video,
by the way.

1063
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,590
I love youtube more than
anything on the fucking planet.

1064
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:44,410
It's one of the things that I always
go to, but this whole thing where they,

1065
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:48,760
they're not letting you say, I don't
want to use my real name. You know?

1066
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,230
I don't want to use my real name.

1067
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,510
I don't know cause I write country shit
just because I don't want people knowing

1068
01:04:55,511 --> 01:04:58,380
who the fuck I am.
You know?

1069
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:02,880
I don't even really leave
that many comments on youtube,
but you know what it is.

1070
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:05,910
I just don't like how they're not
giving me the option to say no.

1071
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,960
So you keep hitting the refresh button
and you know it's getting to the point,

1072
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,420
you know? Well, you know what I would
do if I had any sort of computer savvy,

1073
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:20,020
I would just start a total rip off
youtube where you can remain anonymous and

1074
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:24,950
you just have the exact same fucking
videos. And anyways, I don't know how I,

1075
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:27,370
I've tried to find this youtube video.
We're going to have it up there.

1076
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:31,480
This guy has this fucking plank position,

1077
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:34,240
five minute fucking workout
that I'm going to start doing.

1078
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,690
You know the plank position where you
basically, it's like you're in the pushup,

1079
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,770
pushup position, but you're,
you're, you're on your forearms.

1080
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:46,030
So he, he does each one of these
positions for 15 seconds. All right?

1081
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,390
This is basically the workout as
far as I can remember it. All right,

1082
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,410
so you're doing the original
plank position. You're on
your forums. 15 seconds,

1083
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,270
alright,
next 15 seconds.

1084
01:05:55,271 --> 01:05:59,680
You just have your left arm
pointed straight ahead like
you doing sieg Heil Heil

1085
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:00,514
Hitler,
right?

1086
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,690
You do that and then after
15 seconds you put that down.

1087
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:09,040
Now the right hand Heil Hitler. All
right? This is by no means pro Nazi.

1088
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,490
I'm just trying to give you a visual
here or you can just watch the fucking

1089
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:15,640
video. All right? Then the next 15
seconds, she left leg straight out,

1090
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,610
put that down. Then your
right leg straight out, right.
And then, then you go, uh,

1091
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:24,090
left leg, right hand, right arm.

1092
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,840
That's like a balance of thing.
And then the opposite of that.

1093
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,230
Then you go to your cell.
It's fucking insane.

1094
01:06:31,231 --> 01:06:33,630
Like the longest I've ever been able to
do a plank position when I was in really

1095
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:36,960
good shape was like two minutes.
So I'm on the ship,

1096
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:39,900
I'm on this shit. All
right. To do it with me,

1097
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,440
I'm going to want to put a link up to
the podcast page to the youtube video and

1098
01:06:43,441 --> 01:06:46,020
hopefully you don't have to go through
that rigor Moreau of having to leave your

1099
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:47,970
real name if you do,
just hit the refresh button.

1100
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,490
But I found lately if he hit
the refresh button too much,

1101
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,090
it just keeps going back to it and then
you just have to shut it off and then

1102
01:06:54,091 --> 01:06:56,400
just click on youtube again.
It's a pain in the ass.

1103
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:00,740
I don't know why they're doing
it, if anybody knows why. MMM.

1104
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:02,951
I mean,

1105
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:06,400
one of it I pointed the Chi kind of would
be great if people who write all that

1106
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:10,920
racist shit actually had to leave their
real names. Maybe they wouldn't. Um,

1107
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,570
but what does that really solve? There's
still going to be racist, you know,

1108
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,870
they just know not to say it out loud
so they won't lose their jobs. Right.

1109
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:25,310
Isn't that right? I don't
fucking know. Anyways, uh,

1110
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,070
that's a podcast for
this week. Everybody, uh,

1111
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,620
I still had a couple of good ones to
read here. Gay reminding you would get,

1112
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,900
what else do you got to deal
with some Memorial Day, right?

1113
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:38,740
Let's read a couple more horses. I hate
bill. Thanks for your relationship.

1114
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:42,670
Uh, think of your relationship with
your dog. This is what you can,

1115
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,890
you can have with the horse,
but it's more, oh yeah.

1116
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:48,370
Cause I said if I ever had a horse, I'd
love to have a horse that I never wrote.

1117
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,070
I hate that whole breaking the horse.
He goes,

1118
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,380
dogs are kind of like
happy go lucky buddies.

1119
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,890
They have a lightness
horse are like noble dogs.

1120
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:00,700
They are a little smarter and can
be even more emotional than a dog.

1121
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,870
So they uh, so they can be even
more loyal than a dog. They,

1122
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:09,610
they have to be one over,
oh, you left out the beat.

1123
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:13,090
They have to be one over with respect.
And once you do this,

1124
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,830
they consider it a pleasure
to have you ride them.

1125
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:21,050
It's a two way thing that's hard to
describe. Watched the movie black beauty,

1126
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,920
the one with Alan Cummings as
the voice and go fuck yourself.

1127
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:29,390
Um, all right. I, I don't know that they

1128
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:36,100
would you ever find it a pleasure to
have 150 to 200 pounds on your back?

1129
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,260
Magic.

1130
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:43,100
If you had a backpack that way we'll
just say 180 pounds and I don't think,

1131
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,210
was it on your back?

1132
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,600
It was fucking slap in your ass telling
you to go faster and which way to go.

1133
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:56,090
Would you enjoy that? I Dunno.
More horse stuff. I wanna know.

1134
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,910
I want to know because I love horses,
but I just can't,

1135
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,940
I could never break one that
would kill me. That really would,

1136
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:08,550
that would hurt my fucking hat.
A underrated uncle billion.

1137
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,850
This could be the
underrated of the century.

1138
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:17,270
Keeping your Dick and check flipping
the script on the lace and refusing your

1139
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:18,540
woman's sex.

1140
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:23,250
I just told my girl no sex until she
goes and applies for 10 jobs today.

1141
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,710
And the look on her face was priceless.

1142
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,010
Like she just had no
clue what just happened.

1143
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,300
Look like a little kid that had just
been just sad. It's teddy bear stolen.

1144
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,320
Love the podcast and go fuck yourself.
You redheaded bastard. Ah, yeah.

1145
01:09:37,321 --> 01:09:40,710
Now that's a great one. That's a great
one. I'm like, you're fucking with that.

1146
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:45,300
That's, you know, what you have in your
Dick and check is like you're a woman, um,

1147
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:49,710
fucking bench pressing more than
you. That's basically it. I mean,

1148
01:09:49,711 --> 01:09:53,850
the core thing a guy has over a
woman as a, he's physically stronger.

1149
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:59,160
Okay. Core thing a woman has is she does
that were run by our Dixwell. I mean,

1150
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,990
they're all so smarter.
I think they're just there.

1151
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:06,030
I do think women are smarter in, in a lot
of areas just because they have to be,

1152
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:09,840
it's a nature thing. You know,
we're stronger. So we don't, we,

1153
01:10:09,841 --> 01:10:13,410
I think we just didn't use our brains as
much back when you could fucking drag a

1154
01:10:13,411 --> 01:10:18,220
woman around by her hair and beat her
with a branch. I shut the fuck up.

1155
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:20,880
You know,
you didn't have to grow as a human being.

1156
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,310
They had to sit there and be like,
how do I get that big,

1157
01:10:23,311 --> 01:10:25,890
dumb Oaf to do exactly
what I want them to do?

1158
01:10:25,891 --> 01:10:27,600
I can't grab him by the fucking throat.

1159
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:33,380
How can I make him do it and actually
make him feel like it's his decision,

1160
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:39,600
you know? Anyways, whatever. That's a
podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves.

1161
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,410
Um,
I'm torn with the teen idols sensation.

1162
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:48,570
We're going to be at the count Basie
theater this Wednesday, you know,

1163
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,340
one o'clock jump count bass.
He fucking theater out in Red Bank,

1164
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:57,180
New Jersey. And then we're going down
to some fucking theater in Baltimore.

1165
01:10:57,181 --> 01:11:01,080
I don't have the names of these on
Friday. And then Saturday, I don't know.

1166
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:05,570
I'm in some place in a, no, Thursday,

1167
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:06,231
I'm in Baltimore.

1168
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:11,231
Friday I'm in Pennsylvania and this
Saturday I wind it up with two shows down

1169
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:14,550
there. And what do you call
in fucking Atlantic city.

1170
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:18,840
And a tickets had been selling
unbelievable the best I've
ever sold in my career.

1171
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,070
And I want to thank all you guys.

1172
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:23,220
It means the world to me that you guys
are coming out to my shows and I get to

1173
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:26,610
continue live in my dream here. Right? So
thank you for that. That's the podcast.

1174
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:29,670
Like I said, go fuck yourselves.
Have a great memorial day,

1175
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,280
and I'll talk to you next week.
