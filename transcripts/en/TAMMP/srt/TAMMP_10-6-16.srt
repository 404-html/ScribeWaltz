1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,540
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,760
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts and

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,260
just checking in on you.
Just chicken and Anya chicken in Anya.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,090
Jay help man. I need your help. Guess
what I have, I have the iPhone seven.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,420
Oh

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,120
yeah.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,070
Well what are you going to comicon
bill? What do you, when you got,

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,620
what do you got all of
the latest technology for?

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,530
I'll tell you why I was fucking

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,880
making some God damn fucking potatoes and
I had my fucking iPhone to the side on

11
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,510
the sick and water splashed
around and it got in,

12
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:44,680
it got in it somehow and then
the thing just went below a hoe.

13
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:48,400
Just fucking shut off. Right
as I realized it, I thought I,

14
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,820
you know the fucking counter tops. I
didn't see it. I fucking set it down.

15
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:54,880
This little was in a rush fucking,
you know,

16
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,930
peel potatoes like a fucking God damn
Mick. I Dunno what the fuck I was doing.

17
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,710
And I looked over and watched a couple
of dishes and I always lose sight of

18
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:06,470
where my phone is. It was near the sink
and there was water from, you know,

19
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:08,320
all of those pots and pans and stuff,

20
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,280
sprays and it was just sitting
in a fucking puddle and uh,

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,640
and my wife was just like,

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,520
shut it off, thrown in a bag of
rice, you know, it was like mash,

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,970
the happy ending and the thing
just fucking died. And, uh,

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,860
I didn't save any of my contacts,
you know, I, I didn't have,

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,490
I have had zero phone numbers.

26
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:31,400
I lost all my photos and all
my video for my European run,

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,410
my trip down to a mall fee. I lost
fucking everything, all kinds of shit.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,440
I lost a picture of my fucking Ludwig
Drum Kit when I played at the Roxy and I

29
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:47,510
just did shit that I lost. I didn't even
want to fucking think about it. And uh,

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,490
but you know what, most
of it, I forget anyways,

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,370
it's like all that clutter that
you got your fucking house,

32
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:54,890
all the magazines you saving, you
never get to go back to them. You know,

33
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:58,040
if somebody actually snuck in your
house and took half of it, you know,

34
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:02,270
other than the space, you wouldn't
miss it, right? So this is my thing.

35
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,140
I know a lot of you guys would think,

36
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:06,220
oh well why don't you just put it on the
iCloud? And she says, well, you know, uh,

37
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,750
I don't know if I said this because I
had to start this fucking thing twice.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,420
Yeah.
I don't want somebody at fucking,

39
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,050
I just don't want somebody else
having my shit. I mean, is,

40
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,830
is that so what can you fucking imagine
like back in the day, if somebody,

41
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,920
older people, you remember when
you had your little black book,

42
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,490
all your fucking phone numbers member,
all your family photos, your slides,

43
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,910
can you imagine if some corporation guy
will hold onto these, should be there?

44
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:33,080
Fuck you, will you Weirdo? What
are you doing with them? So,

45
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,860
and the reason why I never backed him
up to my computers because I could never

46
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:41,660
figure out how to do it. I mean, I, I
googled it and all that shit and says, go,

47
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,010
go in the iPhone section
of your iTunes.

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,460
Click on the Info fucking tab.
I can't wear it.

49
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,030
I have no fucking idea where it is.
I've looked up on all these things.

50
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,570
There's no video of it. Does all these
Shinay had to go iPhone to iPhone?

51
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,910
I found an ad iPad asked the fucking,

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,490
they've got everything except pop for me
to put my fucking phone numbers in the

53
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:08,290
contact book,
which I could do a few phones ago.

54
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,530
I know you guys think I'm a fucking moron.
I know you think I can't read.

55
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:16,470
I know you think I suck at reading out
loud and you know what? You're right,

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,170
but I'm not at the age where I used to
know how to do shit. Now I don't. Okay.

57
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,540
Give me a little bit of credit.
I'm only 48 years old.

58
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm at 78 88 that's when
that shit creeps on. Okay.

59
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,090
I knew how to do this shit.
It used to be fucking easy.

60
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,040
You just do it automatically.

61
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:36,030
You just fucking plug it in and then
all you fucking knows we're on your

62
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:38,310
computer now.
Now they've,

63
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,550
they've made it really fucking difficult
in the amount of times. I just thought,

64
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:44,760
just given, given given
bad, put it on the cloud.

65
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,400
Let the ghost of Steve Jobs handle
it. Fuck that guy. Fuck that guy.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
There's a reason why
God took him so early.

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,170
He needed to fucking slap
him around first. Okay?

68
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,630
He needed a yank that fucking
turtleneck right up over his head.

69
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:01,080
Jesus Christ built the man is dead.
He had children. I don't give a fuck.

70
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,860
I can't figure this out. Okay,
so people have to get hurt. Okay.

71
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:06,961
Oh,
I felt good.

72
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:11,910
So if anybody knows where the
fucking Goddamn fucking Info Tab is

73
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,120
in the iPhone section of fucking
iTunes and can explain to me how,

74
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,480
how the fuck I can save my own phone apps.

75
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,600
I actually went into Barnes and nobles.
It's a bookstore.

76
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,040
Everybody for anybody under the age of 40
they used to sell books. They still do.

77
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,210
And they're all,
my God.

78
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,610
What a collection of fucking human
beings that are in that place.

79
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,170
The last of the last, the last
of the book readers, right?

80
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,670
Like the last of the blacksmiths,

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,510
the last of the people with the
crank start fucking cars, you know.

82
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,090
Last of the Mohicans,
right.

83
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,100
Last person to take his shit and CBGBS
before they turned it into a John fucking

84
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,050
Barbados.
All right.

85
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,960
I am gave you some examples. I can't
even, what the fuck I was talking about,

86
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:00,290
but all I know is uh,
I need your help. Okay.

87
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,641
I don't know.
I don't know.

88
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:08,360
I went into the fucking Barnes and
nobles or is it Barnes and noble?

89
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,290
I don't even know. Once I see
Barnes, I'm like, uh, yeah, it's it.

90
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,310
What does it Benny Barns guys,
a fucking drug dealer.

91
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,600
He's either in jail or is hide.
[inaudible] Nicky Barnes.

92
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,810
I don't fucking know Benny Barnes.
Who the fuck was Benny Bart?

93
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,150
Was that one of the cats on top cad.

94
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,570
Okay.

95
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,800
It wasn't John Leguizamo's. Benny
Blanco. Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

96
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,930
The fuck was Benny barge.

97
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,040
He was somebody that's too cool name and
not have been somebody that is somebody.

98
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,610
Anyways, we'll get back to that. When
I looked that one up later, if I,

99
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,740
if I still know how to
fucking turn my computer on,

100
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,850
God knows on the new operating
system, maybe that changed. Um,

101
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,710
so I walk into this fucking bookstore and
I walk up to this, this woman, you know,

102
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,360
who's just like one of these
people who probably, she's,

103
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,830
she's the one who should be running the
country. All right? But she's, you know,

104
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,241
cause you know,

105
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,790
but she's not going to it because she's
a good person because she probably

106
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,000
doesn't like telling people what to do.
She probably doesn't feel qualified.

107
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,230
All right.

108
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,760
Unlike those two complete
fucking psychos that you mean,

109
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,080
can you imagine if the two of them
had a kid, if Trump fucked Hillary,

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,650
what would come out of that
fucking pre presidential snatch?

111
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:20,030
I can't even fucking imagine
the lack of feeling while,

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,440
and it would have black eyes.

113
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:26,940
Yeah.

114
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
Whatever it had.

115
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:31,050
And you'd look over and
it would be sitting on the
swing just staring at you and

116
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:34,410
you would be fucking horrified.
Um,

117
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,100
so much of this has to do with the fact
that I can upload my contacts. All right?

118
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:42,030
So don't take it too, too
personally. Um, but um, anyways,

119
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,460
by the way, uh, you know what I,

120
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,410
I barely noticed because I'm just like
every other fucking mouth breathing more

121
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,790
and just watching the football season,

122
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,480
did you notice how there's
like no pink in the NFL?

123
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,520
Like they toned it down
over the last three years.

124
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,520
That kind of fucking tapered off.
Isn't that amazing?

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,470
And you know why that is right?

126
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,130
Because the NFL raise so much
money for cancer awareness.

127
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,010
They put such a debt and the
disease that they don't even,

128
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:14,640
they don't have to do it anymore.
That's what happened. Okay. That's,

129
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,190
that has to be what happened.
Cause if that's not what happened,

130
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,290
then I guess the NFL doesn't care about
finding a cure for cancer anymore.

131
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,020
Dead. There's no fucking way that's true.
It's kind of weird how that happened.

132
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:32,040
Kind of weird how fucking went all the
way the fuck up and then it just kind of

133
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:36,000
tapered the fuck off and people are
still getting cancer left and right.

134
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,990
This kind of weird. I thought
that that was like, yeah,

135
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,840
I thought they were all about the
family's support and the tropes.

136
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,750
Charging them for those pictures.
Right.

137
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,690
Support and the fucking troops
and all that. Those fucking cops,

138
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,030
they got in bed with that pink lady.
They all got their yachts.

139
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,580
People are starting to figure out like,
hey, where the fuck is all this money go?

140
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:56,940
You know where it's going.
Okay.

141
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,110
It's going down to the pick Twat fucking
strip club and all the owners go down

142
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,600
and they fucking bang away while
their wives are fucking, I dunno,

143
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,630
driving around in their pink
fucking caddies, they stepped away.

144
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,950
The NFL stepped away.
They just backed up.

145
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,340
They just slowly fucking backed
out of the room, you know?

146
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,680
Now they just got a little pink
fucking thing on the, on the,

147
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:21,920
this is all my conspiracy theory. They
just have little pink thing on the field.

148
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,611
You know,

149
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:27,611
let's say it's a maybe 30 paces around
next year it'll be 15 this it is going to

150
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,450
gradually disappear. Yeah.
And then maybe one guy in,

151
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,030
in October in the NFL will get Pinkeye
and that'll be the last fucking thing.

152
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:38,650
And they'll just, they'll just, Joe just
fucking step away. They made their money.

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,650
They're going to let that lady take
the heat. You know what I mean?

154
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,410
They gonna play babe in the fucking woods.
All we did know,

155
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:47,260
we thought it was on the Fuckin Bull,
but the, you know what you were doing,

156
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,190
you took all that fucking
big money, you cuts. Um,

157
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,070
got it being such a great mood. If I could
just fucking, you know what's great is,

158
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,120
is today the amount of the
amount of fucking phone
numbers I've got to tell you,

159
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,410
having not used the iCloud any,

160
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,710
the only fucking number that I knew other
than mine was, was my wife's. That's it.

161
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,380
I knew nobody else's,
you know.

162
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,280
Okay.

163
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,530
Trying to think if there's
even like a commercial on TV.

164
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,740
Was that one? Hey date, hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate that fucking phone number.

165
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:24,940
The seven seven's a car.
[inaudible] I know that one. Um,

166
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,850
it's a car service in New York, I believe.
I don't know if they're still around.

167
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,130
I think they are like the
only ones that I fucking knew.

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,893
MMM.

169
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,550
But I mean I got like, I got
like a fucking, I swear to God,

170
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:38,830
I feel like you've got a hundred
phone phone numbers back already.

171
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,640
Let's go into the old fucking iPhone
seven which for some reason you got to buy

172
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:47,470
this umbilical cord in order
to this little mini umbilical
cord that's 10 bucks,

173
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,160
10 bucks for this little fucking thing
that you know you're going to loose if

174
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,370
you're like me.
I mean I,

175
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,720
I've probably bought in 15 fucking
charges for every phone that I have.

176
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,770
I always lose them. I always leave him.
And those things are actually, you know,

177
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,200
they're long enough. They're like
an amaze. She hated garter snake.

178
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,390
I mean I shoot with a big fucking head,
you know what I mean?

179
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Like I shouldn't be losing those,
forget about this little thing. I mean,

180
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:10,960
I don't think it's longer than an inch.
So the problem is,

181
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,930
is that now with the new ones,
I guess when you charge them,

182
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,940
you can't listen to your music,

183
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,650
which of course is just a major
problem for everybody, including me.

184
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,930
Forget about all these political
prisoners around the world.

185
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,930
Forget about the children that's so
together. You're flashy fucking clothes.

186
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,210
Let's talk about how us in the first
world can now not plug our phones and

187
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:34,570
charge them while listening to our music.
Okay. I know it's a first world problem,

188
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,610
but of course it is.
I live in a first world.

189
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,513
MMM.

190
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,560
Jesus fucking Christ. Let me see how
many fucking context I had already.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,150
I put that guy's name in wrong.
Got To fucking fix that one.

192
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,020
I've just been obsessed all
fucking day long. All Day long.

193
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:55,900
Just just everybody who
I had to take every call.

194
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,110
Like once you lose all your contacts,
you don't know who the fuck's calling you.

195
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:03,630
It's like, Jesus, I got to call this
guy. What if? What if? This is what?

196
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,230
This is the guy calling from the thing.

197
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,870
What if something amazing is
going to happen? You know?

198
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,230
And it's just the same old bullshit
fucking phone calls. Let's see here.

199
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,930
All right, done. All
right, then you hit this.

200
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:17,110
So the new thing about this one is it's
fucking waterproof, which is great. Oh,

201
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:17,980
by the way,

202
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,420
okay.

203
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,140
If you want to get a,
there's a Belkin lightening,

204
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,980
3.5 meter adapter, B, e. L. K. I. N.

205
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,650
They're 15 bucks.
And if you get one of those,

206
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,260
you can charge it and listen
to your music at the same time.

207
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:36,670
So they have filled the void,
the proverbial void created.

208
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,320
Um, was it done on purpose when we return?
All right, so let's see what I got here.

209
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:45,730
How many fucking phone knows
do I have here? One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

210
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:46,930
eight. You know what? I'm gonna hit pause.

211
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm going to count these fuckers and
let you know. All right, I'm back.

212
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,300
Quick count hundred 13 phone,
phone numbers recovered.

213
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,470
Okay.

214
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,640
Recovered in fucking in Lynn
in 24 hours then ain't bad.

215
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,880
I'll get another hundred tomorrow,
you know?

216
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,860
But there are some that I'm just like,
Oh fuck,

217
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:09,290
I'm never going to get that guy's
number. You know what I mean? You got to,

218
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,570
you know, when you lose all
your numbers, there's like,

219
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:14,660
rather than just trying to get to
everybody, you got to have hubs.

220
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,460
You gotta be like, all right, this guy,
he can give me five. Okay. And that one,

221
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,140
one of those five will
lead to another five.

222
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,110
And this thing is you can only hit
each person up for about five numbers.

223
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,960
Have you once in a while you find
a fucking sweetheart, which I did.

224
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,790
And she'll give you a zillion of them.
My wife gave me a Zillion, uh, you know,

225
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,250
the woman that I put the Patrice
O'Neal benefit together with.

226
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:36,500
She gave me a bunch and,
um,

227
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,960
I'll just kinda keep going and
going and going and going as a,

228
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:42,200
as we get this thing together. But, um,

229
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,950
I lost all the photos and,
uh, you know what I think, uh,

230
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,840
I think I'm all right with it. Whatever.
You know what? I got him up here, man.

231
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,100
Got Him up here. The gray is hard
drive ever, man. You brain. Um,

232
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,070
I keep threatening. I keep
threatening to get a flip phone again,

233
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,140
but I can't because everybody is just,

234
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,710
you know when you run
your own fucking business,

235
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:10,430
even if that is shit jokes and everything
and people are sending you emails and

236
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:12,050
you have to sign shit and scan shit,

237
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,710
it's at some point you got to have one
of these and I also love having all this

238
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,800
fucking music on it. I really
do. Oh, that's another thing too.

239
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,820
When I plugged my new fucking iPhone
and I lost like half my music.

240
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:27,020
How does that happen? I don't
know. Is it a, is it in the cloud?

241
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,680
Is it on the stars with a
fucked it all my music go.

242
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,610
I had every fuckin ACDC album. Now I have
like four. Where the fuck did they go?

243
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,241
Oh I know.

244
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:39,560
I'll call somebody up at iTunes and I'm
sure I'll get them on the phone shortly

245
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:43,010
and they'll, they'll help me
out with it. Fucking hostile.

246
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:46,010
Can't she can't get to anybody.
You know what,

247
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,030
this is one of this was blessed would
be what it really fucking feels like as

248
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:54,530
you grow older is you just feel the
world cares less and less about you.

249
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:58,550
You just like this old horse ready for
the glue factory and that we can't make

250
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:01,770
any money off this guy. Just this guy
can't carry anything. My fuck them.

251
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,240
And you just sit.
Yeah,

252
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,020
there were,
I can I get anybody on the phone,

253
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,330
you know, like, you know what I'm really
feeling bad for right now is Hugh Hefner,

254
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,150
you know,
you have,

255
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:18,690
there was and always will be
the fucking man. All right.

256
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,620
And he recently, he had to, you know,

257
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,390
he had the magazine and
because of new technologies,

258
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:25,820
nobody's buying magazines anymore.
They tried to revamp.

259
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:29,720
They tried to keep up Babababababa
online porn, all this fucking shit.

260
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,610
They just couldn't keep up. And uh, he
ended up having, I think having a s,

261
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,810
I don't know what he had to fucking do.

262
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:39,560
All I know is he put his house up for
sale and part of the sales price was,

263
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,920
you know, that he was gonna
live in the house until he dies.

264
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,130
And then you get it and you can do
whatever the fuck you want. And I oh man,

265
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,410
what a fucking this bit.
I gotta tell you something man.

266
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,260
Okay.

267
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,170
I said this to, to, I ate

268
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,130
Nia to, I'm going to forget how I said
it. I was just talking about Los Angeles.

269
00:14:55,131 --> 00:15:00,020
Los Angeles is an extraordinary
lonely place to die in

270
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,800
and less, but he does have kids. So
I think we'll be all right. You Dude,

271
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,930
if you fucking just,
if you just,

272
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,880
if you go out here and you make some
money and you get some fucking whores and

273
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,940
you get some blow and you
take the fucking ride,

274
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,790
you know what goes up,
comes back down.

275
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,510
And when you come fucking back down and
that you got no cartilage left in your

276
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,640
nose, right. And your fucking
hairpieces fucking flopping around.

277
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:32,540
I mean that and then, then you just
sit in there and whatever's left.

278
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,350
Uh, yeah house. That used to be the shit.
Now you're sharing it with somebody else.

279
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,120
Right.
And you sit in there slowly dying.

280
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,780
No one I'm dying and then no one in the
background here in the cars going by.

281
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,720
Right. And just knowing it's
going to keep going without you.

282
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,120
They're going to keep making movies.
They got to keep,

283
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,760
there's going to be beautiful women and
then I could have fucking it's over.

284
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,620
It's over for you. I hope you had a
good fucking time buddy. All right.

285
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,150
I know it's fucking more, but if
shit, but you know, I can't get my,

286
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,530
I can't get my phone numbers.

287
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,250
You'll be fucking hilarious as
if you went country to country.

288
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,340
What's your biggest fucking
problem and uh, you know,

289
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:12,950
or like neighborhood to neighborhood,
you know what I mean?

290
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,050
All this black lives matter shit and
I'm fucking sitting here. I can't yeah,

291
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,360
get my fucking phone.

292
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,843
Okay.

293
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,520
It's people with diseases is war torn
countries and I am throwing literally at a

294
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:35,081
48 year old man having a fucking shit
fit cause I can't get all these fucking

295
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,870
people's any, what's funny is,
is pretty much at this point,

296
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,780
I have everybody's phone number,
I got all my friends,

297
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,280
I got all my family pretty much.

298
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,590
I got all of that and I got
my business context and uh,

299
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,590
okay.

300
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,423
I Dunno,

301
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,490
you don't some worst thing about losing
all your numbers is you lose all those

302
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:57,270
do not answer once, you
know, fucking psycho,

303
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,390
don't pick up.
You know all of those ones,

304
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,400
Jesus Christ and I, I have
to pick up, I, I'm, I,

305
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:09,780
I'm one of those I got to pick up. I'm
like, oh what if, what if this is a,

306
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,130
what if this is Steven Spielberg and he's
doing a reboot, a VT and he wants me,

307
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,880
he wants me to play 80 he wants me to
fucking crouched down and I'd fucking do

308
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:22,190
it too. I do it. I don't
give a shit. You know what?

309
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,380
Stick me in a fucking movie, Gag, go.
Whatever the fuck you need me to do there.

310
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,360
Stevie,
you know,

311
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,100
you want me to sling the mud
around as I'm looking at a volcano?

312
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:36,180
Is this some flying saucer playing some
fucking music? I will do that in a cell.

313
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,014
That's the lead.

314
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,400
I never understood that
movie close encounters.

315
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,220
I wanted to see it so bad when I
was a kid, when I finally saw it,

316
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:48,240
I was just like, that's it.
That was the fucking movie

317
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,480
that, that really look
hastily put together. You know
what I mean? Like I don't,

318
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,250
I don't fuck,
maybe I got to watch it again.

319
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,460
Maybe I'm just a football
watch and fucking moron.

320
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:02,910
But when I watched that movie in Richard
Dreyfus is just sitting there like

321
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,730
listening to this, whatever that
like, it was like a Simon says,

322
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,810
but it was a flying saucer going like,
hey booboo, BBB. But he's going like,

323
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:11,370
wait a minute man,
wait a minute.

324
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,020
And he's throwing like fucking
mud at this, this volcano.

325
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:20,490
And somehow he gets it. He gets
what the fuck's going on? And uh,

326
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,120
I don't even remember the end of the
movie. I, you know, I don't remember most,

327
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:30,330
what the fuck do I get off criticizing
a movie, having never made one.

328
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,510
Right like that. Like being the
director and the creative force.

329
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:36,030
I never fucking did that shit
and I can't remember how it ends.

330
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,720
That's not gonna stop me from
criticizing it. I didn't like it too.

331
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:43,180
Freckle thumbs down,
close encounters of the third kind.

332
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,700
There's a lot of fucking movies that
have done really well that I just don't

333
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:51,120
understand. You know, there's the
classics like chariots of fire.

334
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,030
I don't know who the fuck that was for,

335
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:57,480
but when I sit down and I saw that movie,

336
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:01,290
I could literally smell the house of the
person that liked that movie because I

337
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,140
had a paper route and I knew what
those kinds of people smelled like.

338
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,580
You know what I mean?
They just,

339
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:09,210
the heat was going to be on too high and
it was going to have that musty smell

340
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:12,360
of someone beginning to die.
You know, you know that, oh,

341
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,260
there is an old person odor
and it's so you have a meeting,

342
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:19,560
you have a meet somebody who's like almost
your age and they already have it and

343
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,260
you just look at it and I'm like, do
they realize they're were already dying?

344
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,790
It's, I don't if PSAs smell
it, the cake, you know,

345
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,260
how does that happen? I mean, Jesus
Christ, that's like a fucking car.

346
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:35,340
If you don't start it up every day saying,
I don't know. Is that what happens?

347
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,370
I don't fucking know. All I know is
Tom Brady. Tom Brady's coming back.

348
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,540
Okay. And also, Oh shit.
Starting tomorrow night,

349
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,590
take me out to the ball game.

350
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,160
Take me out to the crowd.

351
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,850
I don't give a fuck about the first one.

352
00:19:56,851 --> 00:20:01,540
62 I show up in October.

353
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,480
Oh whoa.
That's what I do.

354
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:08,310
And I root root root
for the fucking red sox.

355
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,310
If they don't win,
it's a shame.

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,460
But they are already beat the cursor,

357
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,370
the babe and everyone Mozhan
rights. Right. That's why I left.

358
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,600
I left in 2010 I left in 2010 with
baseball. I was just like, look,

359
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,050
either fucking get it out of
the game or make it legal,

360
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:31,470
but stopped getting me excited about
shit that you can say five years later.

361
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:35,520
It doesn't come. I still love the game.
Who Doesn't love somebody? I, you know,

362
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:39,450
I love a picture still. That's how much
I love baseball. I like to keep score.

363
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,030
I like all of that. But, um,

364
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,800
I know from 98 to 2010 there was just
too many fucking people that I was just

365
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:50,020
like, Holy Shit, Whoa Lee Shit Dude.

366
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,110
I'm watching a guy who is fucking with,
you know,

367
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,860
the greats of the Goddamn game. And
then the, and then like, you know,

368
00:20:56,861 --> 00:21:00,600
five years later I actually,
he was parked,

369
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,000
Sentara had I done,

370
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:06,190
it doesn't really count that as shitty
or should they not be in the hall? Right.

371
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,460
But then you had like,
you know,

372
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,030
people like Alex Rodriguez come
along and they fucking like, I mean,

373
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,980
they've got most talented
fucking do it all, you know,

374
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,180
and all of a sudden it's like,
oh,

375
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:19,210
he's on steroids and the
big fall of him or whatever.

376
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:23,410
And then I love the guy comes back,
he gets a 600 home run in. I'm in,

377
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,630
I'm in New York City
in this video of this,

378
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:28,450
cause I know I posted it
somewhere on the cover.

379
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,420
They were given shit for the Patriots.

380
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,820
One of the trumped up fucking horseshit
ticky tack charges of US cheating.

381
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,410
And then on the back they were given
Alex [inaudible] rig is love for hitting

382
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,430
his 600th home run.

383
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,860
It's only cheating if the other
team does it. Um, so anyways,

384
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm very excited for playoff baseball,
you know,

385
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,730
that's my favorite time.
Everybody's all bundled up.

386
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,930
They get the extra microphones at the
ballpark. Joe Buck's calling the game.

387
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,140
What's not to like the
Games fucking matter.

388
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,410
Yeah.

389
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,700
Of the four major sports,

390
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,410
there was not a fucking sport out there
where it matters worse if you lose a

391
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:19,310
game when there's 160 fucking two of them.
It just,

392
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:22,830
it doesn't fucking matter.
You know, and, and I,

393
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,710
the fucking slave labor that these people
have to go out and play 162 fucking

394
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:31,580
games is just like, I
mean, baseball's got it.

395
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,610
How the fuck does football
make more money than baseball?

396
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,770
You would just think collectively like
during the height of the steroids era,

397
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,730
which is is a great argument for steroids.

398
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:47,150
I mean the ballparks were packed,
you know what I mean?

399
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,280
I think you know all of these people
around the world who are just confused at

400
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:55,820
why America could give
a fuck about soccer,

401
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,100
right?
Or feet ball is what it should be called.

402
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,190
You know what I mean? I love whoever
the fuck came up with that on Twitter.

403
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:06,910
Cause what do you call football and you
can pick it up. Well why do you call,

404
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,360
what do you call it? Football. You can
use both feet, right? And then feet ball.

405
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,240
You want to be a cunt? We can be
a cunt to right. This is a deal.

406
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,500
If they would just fucking
roid these fucking players up.

407
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,430
Okay,
we're there at at center ice,

408
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:26,060
but it's a field and they could just
tee one up and fucking blasted into the

409
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,970
back like fucking album again.
It's back at the day at the Blue Line.

410
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,560
You know what I mean?

411
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,550
Fucking Paul Coffee Skate down towards
his old goaltender, widen it up,

412
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:40,420
go and fucking top shelf. If they
had some people fucking doing that.

413
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,770
Somebody said that to me one time

414
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,060
I was in Fenway and then we were talking
about how we're just not into soccer

415
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,700
and the dough just goes, well we
have soccer here. It's, it's, it's,

416
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,830
it's called hockey and it's a lot faster.
And whenever I watched soccer,

417
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:55,880
like I see that I look,

418
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,640
I understand there's a beauty to
that game and everything, but, uh,

419
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,000
you know what the reality is, is I just
don't have time to watch another sport.

420
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:05,740
I mean, I've gotten a little behind
with the f one, you know, um,

421
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,670
I haven't seen the Malaysia race yet,
but I, I was able to go back and,

422
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:14,120
uh, I watched the Singapore race, which
was cool as shit cause it was at night.

423
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,523
MMM.

424
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,120
And then I watched the beginning,

425
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:22,180
it was at the beginning of the Malaysian
race would that fucking Hackenberg guy

426
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,700
just got fucking hit and the whole
side of his car got taken out.

427
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,020
What a fucking buzzkill that is.
Um,

428
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,490
okay.

429
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,200
But anyways, I know Nico's, no, he
came in third place. That's right.

430
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,230
And then force India, didn't they win
the first to spot? I gotta look it up.

431
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,820
What was it, the red bull team. I
don't fucking know. But um, anyways,

432
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:46,140
I think Japan's next and then do
they go to Austin, Austin, Texas.

433
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,520
I think that's what it is. Yeah.
Which that's, I obviously don't,

434
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,330
I should probably go to that one next
year. Book Myself Out there in Austin.

435
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,720
Go out there.
Right.

436
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,130
Check it out.
Stock car racing.

437
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,393
Yeah.

438
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,180
Um, anyways, what the fuck am I talking?
I'll whipped of 25 minutes here.

439
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,360
I don't have any of the
advertising but um, I am actually,

440
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,920
I'm flying out to Atlanta,
um, later on tonight,

441
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:17,600
taking the red eye out and I'm
working the Fox theater in Atlanta.

442
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,560
Uh,

443
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,100
tomorrow night with Paul Versey guess is
going to be tonight when you listen to

444
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:24,080
this.
Paul Versey,

445
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,960
Joe Barton neck and then a good friend
of mine from the original punchline

446
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,380
Atlanta and they've just reopened. Jamie
Bendel is going to come out and mc it,

447
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,590
bring up the acts. We're going to
have a great time. And then, uh,

448
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,380
then we're going down to Gainesville
and I don't give up. Let me tell you,

449
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,540
I don't give a fuck.

450
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,340
All right about this God
damn tropical fucking storm.

451
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,480
Is that all it is at this point?
Because they've their fucking,

452
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,493
and this is the thing,

453
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,890
this sitting there on these weather
channels and they're showing people from

454
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:58,760
2005 buying up all this bread they use
using stock footage of people freaking

455
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:01,840
the fuck out. All right? And they're
saying like, you know, we did,

456
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,490
there's so many of these warnings
that people, they've, they've,

457
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:08,120
they've come become complacent. They be
completely, they like blaming people.

458
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:11,450
It's like, no, because you
can't have trick these people.

459
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,730
You've cried wolf so many fucking times.

460
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:16,590
And I know you have to warn the general
public that there's something coming,

461
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,320
but the way that they do it,

462
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,530
yeah.

463
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,363
You know what I mean?

464
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,820
They just have this riveting footage
of people getting washed out to force.

465
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,630
They don't get washed out to sea. There's
always some Douche fucking surf into.

466
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,420
Yeah.

467
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,253
MMM

468
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,020
know they scare the fuck out of people.

469
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:34,200
And there's only so many times
you can end up, you know,

470
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,250
just getting a regular rain shower and
you have like fucking six weeks worth of

471
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:42,930
of of milk in your refrigerator that
you just going to be, ah, yeah. Yeah.

472
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,640
That's like them freaking us
out about the fucking yell.

473
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:51,300
The next giant earthquake is coming out
here. That's the funniest thing ever.

474
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,970
So what exactly am I? It's a fucking
earthquake. Should I go with, is no earth.

475
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,600
What am I going to leave my
shit like when you moved to La,

476
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,540
you know you're rolling the dice.
You're basically rolling the dice.

477
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,110
I can make enough fucking money.
All right,

478
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,690
I can make my mark and then I can get
the fuck outta here before this thing

479
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,210
breaks off.
It's ups.

480
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,090
You're basically Wiley coyote looking
over the edge of a fucking cliff.

481
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,170
You know what I mean?

482
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,050
As the roadrunners coming by and
you know what's going to happen,

483
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,350
you're a little apparatus. You can jump
on the stick. The rock goes up in the air,

484
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,750
it hits the fucking part of the
clip you're on in the year you get,

485
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,550
you're going to go down.
Right.

486
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,140
You're just hoping that it
doesn't happen during your time.

487
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,410
It was probably a bad example,
but you know, I'm, I'm, yeah,

488
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,470
I'm not the brightest guy.
I mean,

489
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,930
I can't even upload my context
under my fucking computer,

490
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,100
but I know after this podcast, I will be
able to, cause I've reached out to you,

491
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,030
the common man, the person,
the common lady on Twitter.

492
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,080
And you know what I love about
you guys. I know, you know,

493
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,090
you're going to teach me how to do it,
but you're gonna,

494
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:53,580
you're gonna hate your stupid
freckled fuck blah, blah, blah, blah.

495
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,500
You can give me all, and I don't
give a shit. I'm gonna fucking,

496
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,100
I will glide through those insults
to get to this information.

497
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,280
I've already wasted a fucking hour of
my life trying to figure out how to do

498
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:07,050
this, to avoid being in this
exact same fucking situation. Um,

499
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,520
I was actually, when I was at
the, uh, the fucking iCloud store,

500
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:15,300
they would have an iTunes store, the
apple store, right. I fucking go in there,

501
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,970
you know,
let's see if one of our geniuses,

502
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:21,090
they literally say it with a straight
face, one of these geniuses configure out.

503
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,550
But who's can, no, I can't figure
out how to do it. So in my world,

504
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,610
I guess they are a genius.
So this guy was cool as shit.

505
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,030
He goes to just store anything on the
ICLOUD and I go, well, not on purpose.

506
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,120
I might've clicked something by accident
and we just would just sitting there.

507
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,000
He goes, we'll click on this, wait a few
seconds. And he's like, ah, no, no, no,

508
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,330
no, no. Well maybe your
folders, maybe save she photos.
Click on that. And I'm like,

509
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,520
nothing. He goes, no, no, I'll wait a
second. Wait a second. Just wait a second.

510
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:48,050
See if something comes up. Yep. Nothing
there. And he goes, how can we, you know,

511
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:51,720
use the iCloud? And it doesn't have to
like, I was fucking creepy to me. He goes,

512
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:55,590
well, you know, it's a really
safe, totally secure system.
I go, yeah, until it isn't.

513
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,600
He goes, yeah, I know.

514
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,230
So, um, anyways, I'm very
excited to go to Atlanta.

515
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:10,590
That's where I take my last special.
I'm getting ready to do another special.

516
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,000
I picked out the fucking shirt I'm gonna
wear. It's a little nod to Nashville.

517
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,910
Um, little busier than old
fucking Frederick always used.

518
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,460
What the fuck? Why not every special
should have its own God. Damn. Look,

519
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,200
I'll wear a snazzy shirt for those
fucking cowboy. Fucking those,

520
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,130
those steer cow punching
fucking people down there.

521
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,080
Um, I am beyond ready to
do this fucking thing. Oh,

522
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:41,860
by the way, by the way, I got a call.

523
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,060
My car fucking showed up yesterday,
showed up yesterday,

524
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,610
the detail in it. Everything's going
to be fucking ready. All right.

525
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,530
And I pick it up. Uh, hopefully next
Monday when I get back, I come back,

526
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,640
I go out there, I picked this
fucking thing up. And, um,

527
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,120
so I'm taking my last
few rides with the Prius.

528
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,470
You what's funny about the fucking Prius?

529
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,320
All you guys shitting on
the fucking Prius, right?

530
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,410
Do you know what me fucking offers I've
gotten when I, I was buying a new car,

531
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,250
the amount of fucking people that have
asked me to buy that Goddamn car simply

532
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:19,270
because of the gas mileage. I got the
fucking side view mirror of fixed.

533
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,590
I got a,

534
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,860
I got to get the bumper fixed and then
I got to go get a detailed because of,

535
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:28,360
you know, all these years I have in
my fucking awesome dog, you know,

536
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,010
um, you know, she's a dog. She shipped.
Sometimes she doesn't smell as good.

537
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,810
Um, and evidently according to
my wife, when she gets nervous,

538
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,110
she admits and odor. She's never
peed or shit in the fucking thing.

539
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:45,670
But definitely when she gets fucking
nervous and I don't know what the deal is.

540
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,710
Um, yeah, but mentally she admits
a fucking odor or something.

541
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,230
Maybe that's what the fuck it is. I don't
know what it is, but there's definitely,

542
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,470
hey man, there's been a dog in this
car for like eight years. Right?

543
00:30:56,471 --> 00:31:00,580
So I got to get that shampooed out,
uh, before I sell it to somebody.

544
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,890
I wouldn't do that to somebody. You
know what I mean? Fucking asshole.

545
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:08,710
He hit my God damn car right before I'm
giving it away. So I'm like, all right,

546
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:12,940
throw like the fucking 18th bumper on
this thing that I've had to get in.

547
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,540
Reality is probably like the sixth back
bumper, like every year, year and a half.

548
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,720
I got to get another one cause
someone fucking hits me. Um,

549
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,290
and uh, I took it over to
get the estimate, that guy go

550
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,130
slab. Actually, uh, I, there's probably,

551
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:31,240
I can tell by this dent,

552
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:35,740
you're probably going to need more than
a just a bub or see there's another

553
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:36,574
layer behind that

554
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,890
layer behind that layer. And then
there's the frame. And I was like, well,

555
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:43,060
I wasn't having problems closing
the hatchback, so I think it's out.

556
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,800
Know that will, I will, I'm not
going to know until I get back.

557
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:50,000
So the fucking asshole hit me and I
didn't even run it through my insurance

558
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:54,290
company. I just said, fuck
it. Fuck it. You know,

559
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,310
I'm not going to deal with that shit.
You know, go down there and then, and

560
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,990
then they're not going to say, and then
they go, well you didn't, you do this.

561
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:03,870
And what about this guy over
here? I just say, fuck it.

562
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,180
I use insurance companies for the
big things. You know what I mean?

563
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,650
Cardiac arrest, a near
death experience. You know,

564
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:16,830
some guy gets mad at somebody and
he slams a car that hits a card.

565
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,850
The den hits mine. I feel like that's
par for the course out here. You know,

566
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,450
I kind of wished the cops got there before
he just grabbed his bags and left his

567
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:27,810
car. Probably fucking stole
the thing. Who knows? Well,

568
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,350
this is the end of this
rambling horse shit. Uh,

569
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,160
you can listen to some
advertising after that.

570
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,710
Then there'll be a little bit of
music and then you listen to some, uh,

571
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,600
some clips from a podcast,

572
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,190
from a podcast gone by in a time
that's already happened. Um,

573
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,490
I want to thank everybody who tries
to help out me to help out me,

574
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:49,510
to help me out with this fucking thing.
Um,

575
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,410
if you're listening to this and uh,
you have my phone number, text me,

576
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,710
send me a fucking text,
cause chances, chances,

577
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,460
I don't have your fucking

578
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,950
number in my fucking iPhone seven.

579
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,110
I'm calling it right now. That little, uh,

580
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,180
umbilical cord that's
hangs off that thing.

581
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,050
I'm going to have to buy at least nine
of those before I buy the next one.

582
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:19,670
This is the first time I've gone from
like one number two, the very next number.

583
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:23,300
Like I kept the iPhone
four s until I got the six.

584
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,980
Um,

585
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,760
I had the three and then the iPhone four
came out and then I get the every other

586
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:33,080
one. I never had the five. I got to
six and I was like, fuck the seven.

587
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,580
You know, especially when people are
complaining about something new, right?

588
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,380
Like this one is so stupid to buy.

589
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,190
I would not buy this phone because what's
going to happen is they're going to

590
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:46,700
figure out this little appendage fucking
thing. They're going to figure it out.

591
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,470
And you know what?
They already have it

592
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,383
figured out.

593
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,690
They have the next nine complaints
already figured out and they don't give a

594
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:57,700
fuck. They just put it out
like this. So everybody could
be like old, you know, 89%.

595
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,250
Great, but what about this? Right? So,

596
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,600
um, you know, I wouldn't buy this one.

597
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:08,480
I would wait for the seven
s or possibly the eight.

598
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,340
That's what I planned on doing until I,
uh,

599
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,740
look making any mashed potatoes.
All right, go fuck yourselves.

600
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,880
Have a wonderful weekend.

601
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:21,050
You can't and I will discuss more
shit with you on Monday. All right,

602
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:24,290
have a great weekend.
Enjoy the advertising.

603
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,120
Whatever the fuck I get it.

604
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,290
All right, here we go. A little bit of
advertising there. All right. Siki week.

605
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,510
Oh Jesus.
Someone else's doing it.

606
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,190
Let's see if these people
don't go out of business.

607
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,410
Siki buying tickets online for sports
and concerts has been a confusing process

608
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,490
for a long time.

609
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,790
It's always been hard to find the best
deal for that game or show you you want

610
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:51,840
to go to. And none of these older
tickets sites wants to change that,

611
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,670
but seek geek is different.
They've come along,

612

614
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:05,271
Siki does all the pricing price comparison
for you by searching multiple tickets

615
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:08,860
sites and ensuring that you get
the best possible deal. See,

616
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:13,830
Keke does not does all the work
and you save time and money.

617
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,120
Jesus Isapro and seek geek wants to help
you get the most bang for your buck.

618
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,200
That's why every ticket on Siki
is given a grade based on value.

619
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,790
You'll immediately see any underpriced
seats and be able to find the best deal

00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,800
And the home security industry wants
you to believe it's your only option.

630
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,810
They got [inaudible] Oh,

631

Same thing trying to scare you into
signing one of their longterm contracts.

632

She gets stuck writing huge checks
month after month with no way out. Man.

633
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,170
It's robbery by contract contract
and it can cost you thousands,

634
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,260
but maybe hundreds if you

I'm a 29 year old guy and
recently broke up with a funny,

674
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:05,120
attractive and all around.
Great girl. Oh Gee.

675
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,680
Why Sir would you do that?
You ask. All right, uh,

676
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,150
two things. Her Dad was born
without teeth and your words,

677
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:18,650
your baby will if you breed with her or a

678
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,850
is she has got something
going on in the vaginal area,

679
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,190
some sort of odor, sticky
pussy. I don't know. Oh, here
we go. Well let me tell you,

680
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,640
this girl and I had been dating for about
three months and we had a great thing

681
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:36,750
going. She's half Afro Cuban,
half Puerto Rican and really sexy.

682
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,070
She had a rough upbringing,
but I didn't care because she's honest,

683
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,060
easy going and not bitchy like so many
girls I've dated. She was a bit needy,

684
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:45,960
but I didn't mind.

685
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,590
Okay.

686
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,050
Um, we were out at a bar one night having
a few drinks and I was feeling pretty

687
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:51,740
good.

688
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,860
I was looking at a couple of floozies
at the end of the bar and asked her if

689
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:59,360
she's ever been with another woman.
She coyly looked at me and said yes.

690
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,140
Okay,

691
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,350
good stuff. I thought, yeah, dude,
this is a fucking fantasy right here.

692
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,210
Fucking red shoe diaries.
Um, then I proceeded with,

693
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,840
have you ever been in a threesome
with two girls and a guy again?

694
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,220
She answered yes.

695
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,490
Okay.

696
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,570
Okay. Kind of slutty, but I'm
no saint. While I couldn't stop.

697
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:22,420
They are God, you're going to
go for the rotisserie question.

698
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,610
What's in the box? Ah, here we go.

699
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,330
Here we go. Strap yourselves in for
this one. Well, I couldn't stop there.

700
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:34,640
So I asked, have you ever had
a threesome with two guys?

701
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,520
She looked down at the ground
and she looked up a bit ashamed,

702
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,780
Lee and said, yes. Wow. Skank alert.

703
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I thought I then asked
her one more question.

704
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,630
I knew this one could back for
where the fuck do you go from here?

705
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:57,820
Like throwing the high heat to Elbert
Elbert pool hosts. I finally asked,

706
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,390
wait,
have you ever been in a porn?

707
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,970
She then blushed and look me
in the eye and said, yeah.

708
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,170
I looked at her calmly and was
like, oh, but inside I was like,

709
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:15,170
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes. Well, you should,

710
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,310
you know those first couple.
I mean,

711
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,280
you can look at, let's, let's break this
down here. All right. She's been with, uh,

712
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,300
she's had a threesome with another
girl and a guy who get that.

713
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,760
That's who gives a fuck right there.
All right.

714
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,660
You're already knew she banged
another guy. All right. But, uh,

715
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,360
the fact that she also did it with another
girl that takes a little fucking, uh,

716
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,160
that tones down his dick in her pussy.
Right? This is how guys think. Women,

717
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:49,140
I'm sorry. All right. That's something
that, that's something in the, uh,

718
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,280
the credit is the credit. Uh, why, why,
why do you try to talk with counting shit.

719
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:59,720
You're too dumb. All right. That
one's all right. The two guys thing.

720
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,430
Now you can look the other way on that.
Maybe if it, if it was in another state,

721
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,320
but it can't be in the same state because
if you run into one of the two guys

722
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:15,570
that fucking, you know, we're high fiving
as they fucking banged her that, I mean,

723
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:20,770
I dunno about that one. But then the third
one she did a porno. I mean, yeah, no,

724
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,410
that's a,
you've got to walk away from that

725
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,000
or,

726
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,960
or you have to go to NASA to get tested
for the latest fucking STDs I would

727
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:35,260
think. And then also God
knows what's going on. Uh,

728
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,740
mentally that you would do
that. What? I just like sex.

729
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,360
No, now there's something going on.
Who doesn't like sex? I Dunno. Anyways,

730
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,640
plowing ahead. See, she's so, she egos.

731
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,270
So basically she had moved down
to Los Angeles when she was 20.

732
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,720
She's now 25 and after a
short stint in the military,

733
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,370
somehow she got into the porn industry
for eight months. She did everything.

734
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,760
Ooo,
Fox sucked the whole Shebang.

735
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,950
I asked her if I could see her video,

736
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,560
but she wouldn't tell me her
performer name and said Vietnam,

737
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:12,030
the that it would be impossible
to find her body of work.

738
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:16,140
I asked her why she got
into porn and she replies

739
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,070
because I wanted some feeling in
my life and then he rides dao.

740
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,210
Ji Ji is, yeah, dude. Oh, this poor
girl. Something happened to her.

741
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,580
The thing was she was clean,

742
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,440
had a good job and really liked her
and the sex was great. Yeah. Obviously,

743
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:34,921
you know what's funny,

744
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,990
there was something you wrote in the
beginning where I just thought she was

745
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,550
going to be good. 29 year old guy,
attractive all around. Great girl.

746
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,310
All the fact that you said
she had a rough upbringing,

747
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:50,640
but she was easygoing and honest and
not bitchy right there. I was like,

748
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:55,550
that girl's good in bed. It just
seemed like a kind of free open person.

749
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,030
I don't know. I didn't know. She was going
to be that open. Oh, Gigi. Um, anyways,

750
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,020
the thing was she was clean and I
have a blah and the sex is great,

751
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:10,021
but I couldn't stop picturing her in some
sleazy porno that was probably filmed

752
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:12,010
in some junk yard on labrea.

753
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,790
So I went to ask for friend's advice.

754
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:20,850
Most of my guys were telling me to dumper
my gay friends told me it was fabulous

755
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:23,530
and that I should overlook it.

756
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,640
I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends
because they would automatically

757
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,420
reject her and assume I had aids.
There you go. Keep your options open.

758
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,880
So regretfully I dumped her.

759
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,540
I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell
her it was because she was a porn star

760
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,400
because she would have been
ashamed for the rest of her life.

761
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:48,020
And I was happy that she was honest with
me. I've done my fair share of sleeves,

762
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:52,340
but this was too much. My question
bill was, Bill, my question bill,

763
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:55,820
was it wrong for me to dump her for
some decisions she made years ago?

764
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,710
Should I have stayed with her?
What would have you done? Um,

765
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,270
well you don't want to know what I
would've done. I'm a fucking degenerate.

766
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,130
So lets you, you seem
like a good person. Um,

767
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,873
dude,

768
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,880
when you're trying to find the person
you're going to spend the rest of your

769
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:18,390
life with you, you have to have
a list of criteria. All right?

770
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:22,470
You sound like you're still
young, so there's no reason
to compromise. All right?

771
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,150
I mean,

772
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,110
when you get with somebody like that
and you're gonna live with them and you,

773
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,570
when you get with anybody, you're
taking on all of their fucking baggage.

774
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,270
All right?
You're only three months in

775
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,690
and you know people who go into
the porn industry that, you know,

776
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,350
it's like people will come. Comedians
were not healthy individuals. Okay.

777
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,160
And that is like a
specific area that I just,

778
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,940
this is just my own personal nonmedical
feeling that you're just not a healthy

779
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:57,920
person. Something awful happened and that
line, I just wanted to feel something.

780
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:02,360
I mean, something bad happened to
her, caused her to or self off.

781
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,050
I don't even want to try to guess what,
but you know,

782
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,670
there's nothing wrong with anything that
she did purse, you know, technically.

783
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,350
And she was honest with it.

784
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,520
It all comes down to whether or not
you want to deal with it. All right.

785
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,990
And if you feel that you know,

786
00:47:19,991 --> 00:47:23,320
you want to deal with it and that there
was this sort of connection that you

787
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:25,480
just had,
this girl had to be in your life,

788
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,440
then you're going to have to
learn to live with it and get it.

789
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,480
MMM.

790
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,460
But I would be definitely,

791
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:43,461
I would definitely be concerned
with a certain mental issues.

792
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,140
Um,
now like she's insane.

793
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,700
And then I would also be concerned with,
uh,

794
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,980
sexual boundaries,
you know,

795
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:04,330
like would she have any and could she
remain faithful after a while and when you

796
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:07,520
settle into the seven
year itch or whatever,

797
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:08,810
yeah.

798
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,250
And you really start needing to work at
the relationship and it's feeling boring

799
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,660
and she needs to feel something again.
Is she going to go back to that right

800
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,600
leather couch from that show?
Martin, my end, you know,

801
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:25,930
down on fog in the valley. And get
banged again. I mean, I don't know.

802
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,570
I Dunno. That is a, uh,

803
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,803
okay.

804
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,890
That is, you know what,
that is beyond my skills.

805
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,620
I don't know how to tame that horse.
I can tell you that right fucking now.

806
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:42,170
I have no fucking clue. That's a a, you
know what? That's a doctor drew question.

807
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:47,840
That is a classic doctor drew question
and that guy within two seconds we'll get

808
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:51,860
right to the core of it. I would
call, I would call in love line man,

809
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:56,480
if you're out here, call him up. Cause
that's a, that's a great one. Um,

810
00:48:59,370 --> 00:48:59,780
okay.

811
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,190
Yeah,

812
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,950
I guess you'd have to figure out is is
has she works through whatever the fuck

813
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:05,900
she was working through
and now she's ready to

814
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,713
okay.

815
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,420
I mean,
I don't know.

816
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,630
Hey those are some good looking
girls down there and she's like,

817
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:15,410
yeah they are or whatever. Like, I mean
if you kept steering it in that direction,

818
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,580
you'd probably get you fucking
threesome right there. Um,

819
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,170
okay.

820
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,790
So there's that,
there's that option.

821
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,690
The option that you have is if you're
with her. Like I think he, I mean that,

822
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,800
that's,
that's a selfish fucking and I,

823
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:31,460
and a shallow reason to stay
with somebody long term,

824
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,690
uh,
that you,

825
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,783
I don't know.

826
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,470
Hey,

827
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:36,470
what's going on the Monday
morning podcast and uh,

828
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:42,870
I gotta admit I'm a little tired today.
I drank too much yesterday.

829
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:47,490
I don't know what the hell happened
to some bar out here in la.

830
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:51,720
And uh, I was watching the
patriots playing the 40 niners

831
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:57,630
and I get caught up in it and I had a
couple of beers drinking cores light.

832
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,650
I mean, it's like water, right?
And like fucking four of those.

833
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,540
And somehow I started doing shots and I
was, oh, next thing you know, I had to,

834
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,510
I had to call a cab and
actually flagged one down,

835
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:14,100
which is practically impossible in la.
And I had to just,

836
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:18,920
you know, go back and rescue
my car later on that, that,

837
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,090
that's how early football
comes on out here.

838
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:24,810
I actually got shit
faced watching the game,

839
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,420
took a cab home, passed out, sobered up,

840
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,590
and was able to go back and get
my car and it was still light out.

841
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,360
That's how early the games come
on out here. Isn't that amazing?

842
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,670
Christ, what the fuck is
my phone ringing my phone?

843
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,940
Shit, hang on a second. Hey Paul.

844
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:56,750
Hey, let me call you right
back. All right. Ima uh,

845
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,183
yeah,

846
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:03,930
that dude's calling me back cause I just
left him a message telling them about

847
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,830
fucking sports radio. He lived
from this dude. His name's Paul.

848
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,420
He fucking, he fucking, he listens
to sports. Very listen to me.

849
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:16,140
I'm a mess today. All right, let's
get focused here. He listens to a,

850
00:52:16,141 --> 00:52:21,100
that's sports talk radio, which
uh, you know, I finally discovered,

851
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,560
uh, that ESPN radio thing out here on
the am station by accident and you know,

852
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:28,400
they got it. They have these
triple header baseball games.

853
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:31,980
So I like listening to the Games
like Michael K and those guys.

854
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:34,590
I think those guys are great.
I love listening to the Games,

855
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,910
but the sports talk radio,
it's just so ridiculous.

856
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:40,950
It's like,
I dunno.

857
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,090
And then I just feel like they just
deliberately saying shit to get people to

858
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:49,620
call in and you yell, you know,
really bill, does that what you think?

859
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,710
Do you think people deliberately do that
so their ratings are higher so they can

860
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,890
make more money and fucking pay
a mortgage on a bigger house?

861
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,910
Why didn't, that was just one of the
dumbest statements I've ever heard.

862
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,040
You don't want, I think they
do. I think they use gimmicks.

863
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,560
Some more people listen, so they
make more money. While bill,

864
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:08,370
you'll really going out on a fucking
limb there on Shah is basically what

865
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:09,270
happened last night.

866
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,560
My Red Sox were playing the angels was
one of the best baseball games I've seen

867
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,100
in a long time.
It's why baseball's a great sport.

868
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,020
It's why playoff baseball is awesome.

869
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:23,430
It's why I love the five game series
because every game is so huge.

870
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:28,260
So I'm listening to fucking
douchebags talking about the game.

871
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,000
And uh, this guy actually makes a
statement. He goes, uh, you know,

872
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:37,080
I think the red sox last night were raw,
taking the angels lightly. You know,

873
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,230
I think they thought that they were going
to come back to Boston and a day we're

874
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:43,470
going to close it out.
[inaudible] it's like really,

875
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,490
really well.
Why do they always do that when one,

876
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,180
that's what I hate about sports talk
radio is they can never give credit to the

877
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:52,050
team that wins.

878
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:57,210
They always got to trash the team that
loses and just talk about how they fucked

879
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:01,170
up. So, so using that analogy,
that means that the angels,

880
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,590
the reason why is the red sox won the
first game was because the angels would

881
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:08,520
taking the red sox slightly. And then
when gain two came along, the angel said,

882
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:12,750
Hey, you know what? I got a good idea. Why
don't we take the red sox lightly again?

883
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,840
And then the third game came along and
then they said, hey, wait a minute.

884
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:18,450
It's the playoffs.
Let's take the red sox seriously.

885
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,680
And then fortunately that same night,
the red sox for some reason decided to go,

886
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,120
oh, hey, let's take the
angels lightly. You know,

887
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,870
you know what that meant that that's the
same mentality of when the giants won

888
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,704
the super bowl.

889
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,330
I still don't feel like the giants got
the fucking credit that they deserve for

890
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:39,510
having one of the most undisputable
championships of all time.

891
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,600
They beat Dallas in Dallas.
They be Green Bay in Green Bay.

892
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,190
They fucking bill the last game
of the season we played them.

893
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:49,620
They scored 35 fucking points on us,

894
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,830
only lost by three clearly showing that
they were among the elite and everybody

895
00:54:56,071 --> 00:54:56,641
ignored it.

896
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:01,641
There was 17 point fucking underdogs and
it was all this fucking bullshit hype.

897
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,880
I don't know. Meanwhile the Patriots
of squeaking by winning games,

898
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,090
we beat the ravens cause they fucked up.
That was in November.

899
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,490
Everybody just ignores that
and they just ride the hype.

900
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,710
And when the hype doesn't play out then
they got to figure out, I don't know,

901
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,870
I'm saying it was the
fucking giants for the shit.

902
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,630
And they kicked the shit out of
the top three teams in the league,

903
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,670
which means they are the baddest team of
last year and looking on this year they

904
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:29,880
won like 44 to nothing or 44 to three.
I don't know.

905
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,710
So I'm saying so all I'm saying is
tonight it's going to be a great game and

906
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:39,120
whoever wins the game is because they
played better now cause the other team

907
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:40,050
wasn't trying.

908
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,350
It's like you have a play a video game
with some fucking Douche bag and he

909
00:55:43,351 --> 00:55:46,110
thinks he's the shit
and then you beat him.

910
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,490
And then rather than him admitting it, he
just goes to, or it wasn't even trying,

911
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,990
it was even trying. Then he packs up his
little fucking Atari and he goes home.

912
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,840
You know, it's just, this is
fucking stupid. I don't know why.

913
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:01,410
Why do people listen to sports talk radio
as that so they can then call in with

914
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:04,590
their dumb theories. You know, you know,

915
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:08,430
I thank God for ourselves is deliberately
overweight because he's trying to have

916
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,130
a heart attack during a
game because, uh, you know,

917
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:13,830
coaching football just got
too easy for him. I mean,

918
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:16,650
that's why you never want to super
bowl with the judge to the cowboys.

919
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,360
He was just bored. Oh, that's interesting.
Let's discuss that for an hour.

920
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:26,350
God knows we have five hours of
radio to fill. You know, it is,

921
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:28,570
I'm just mad at myself. It's because, um,

922
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,730
about a year ago I figured out how to
watch sports because it was annoying me.

923
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,960
Like, uh, just how big they had gotten.

924
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,520
And I was really starting to have a
theory that people who aren't even into

925
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:46,690
sports or watching sports now because
they're so fucking over height,

926
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,830
you know what I mean? It's kind of like
me. When Star Wars finally came back,

927
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:55,180
I went and I saw that first episode.
All right,

928
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,370
forgetting that I fucking hated star wars.

929
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,950
I didn't hate it. I just didn't have that
Jesus Freak. You know what I'm saying?

930
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:10,180
It's just like, yeah, you know, I
like sesame street when I was a kid,

931
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,490
but when the muppets
come up with a new movie,

932
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,140
I'm not going to go see it
because I'm fucking old now.

933
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,690
You know what?
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

934
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:25,480
I just totally lost my train of
thought. They'll fucktard. Well,

935
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,340
where the hell did I kind of, they
get to that point. All right, let's,

936
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:34,120
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Uh, I think it's built bar. You know,

937
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,830
obviously he came to my page. I do one
of these every single Monday. And, uh,

938
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:42,670
he said, you can subscribe to this

943
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:01,720
Try to put a smile on your face
at the beginning of the work week,

944
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,360
isn't La all right.

945
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,580
Last week and was riffing
above directors in the 1920s.

946
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,520
And I was trying to remember what the
fuck was that thing that they yelled

947
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:17,521
through that fucking battery free
bullhorn and a megaphones bullhorn.

948
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,730
Wait a minute. A bullhorn is
the one with that Jesus Christ.

949
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,680
A bull horns. The one like, uh,
that's the modern day one on tension.

950
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,390
We have,
you're surrounded,

951
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:39,430
weighing down your weapons and come
up with Dan's up than any comp ever.

952
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:42,490
Really say that my intention.
You know what?

953
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:44,740
I bet when they get in that situation
they don't know what to say.

954
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:47,620
Cause like all that dialogue
is so in their head. I mean,

955
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:51,220
what else are you supposed to say?
Excuse me,

956
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:58,030
I'm a police officer. All right. Anyway,
so the thing that you yell through that,

957
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:58,893
uh,

958
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,330
that's erectors UC yell through
way back in the day and action cut,

959
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:09,400
print it, whatever. I guess
it's called a megaphone. It's a,

960
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,290
it's a megaphone.
And somebody told me,

961
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,560
I guess back in the day they
called it a speaking trumpet,

962
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,140
speaking trumpet, but a megaphone.
And then the person said, yes,

963
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,330
I listened to podcast for that long.
Jesus,

964
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,180
I know last week's was really long.
It was like 40 minutes long. I Dunno.

965
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,880
I these things getting too long.

966
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,780
Was he saying that's the one thing
when somebody sends you an email,

967
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,060
like you can't tell like how they mean it,
you know what I mean?

968
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:39,010
And they make fun of themselves. It's all
up to the interpretation of the reader.

969
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,570
All right. So anyways, if
you're new to my podcast,

970
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,480
I do one of these every
single Monday and I, uh,

971
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:49,280
I answered questions and I learned
stuff like I learned this week. Uh,

972
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,000
the original bull horn was a
megaphone or a speaking trumpet.

973
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,600
And there is something that you can sell
somebody at a party right before you're

974
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:59,900
going to get laid to switch it into, oh,
wait a minute, you're not getting late.

975
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,920
And, uh, people send me and movie
reviews, overrated, underrated,

976
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:06,280
and I babbled about shit.
Um,

977
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,310
I actually did a college out
now in Phoenix this week,
this aeronautical college.

978
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,970
And I got to admit I had to
look up aeronautical and I
still don't know what the

979
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:18,170
fuck it means. Um, I think it's the, the

980
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:24,620
one, is it the science of
space or something like that?

981
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,550
These guys basically. All right.
The kids. Okay. The 2021 years old,

982
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:32,540
which was a kid to me cause I'm 40.
Right. And they know how to fly planes.

983
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:37,280
Some of them they're
designing planes and they uh,

984
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,870
I dunno. Weaponry. I have no idea. All
I know is when they have a job fair,

985
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:46,700
the fucking CIA shows up, which
is a, it's pretty intense,

986
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:49,400
Huh? That when they
show up there, you know,

987
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:52,940
have like the men in black suits and
they have like those sunglasses with like

988
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,710
the fucking built in Ipod.
That's how they get them. Man.

989
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:00,320
See you like these sunglasses
kid. Hey, why don't you sign up?

990
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,080
He's sick of playing video games.

991
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,680
You want to do video games for real
when you sign up with the CIA. Okay.

992
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:11,330
Cause when you know Brent up Datto was
a fucking joke compared to what I did

993
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,760
last weekend.
Um,

994
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,020
so anyways, yeah, I had a good
weekend man. I went out there.

995
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:20,120
I'm always have a good time
when I'm out in Phoenix.

996
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,510
Swung by the Improv and a,

997
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:25,910
I'm not even listening what I'm saying
right now cause I'm trying to find the

998
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:30,890
first question of the week, which is
this one? Uh, this guy from Detroit. Uh,

999
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,480
let's see. Love the DVD bro.
Definitely well worth the wait the day.

1000
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:40,400
Started listening. Money mean podcasts.
All right. Podcasts, questions.

1001
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,670
Um,
okay.

1002
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:48,380
Is being happy and being content.
The same thing.

1003
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,080
Recently I had a discussion with some
friends at a local bar that went well into

1004
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:58,070
the night. I'm undecided. All right,

1005
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,180
well you know something.

1006
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,440
Well actually he says he's undecided
due to the fact the majority of people I

1007
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:08,420
had the discussion with were
women. Um, okay. All right.

1008
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,910
That didn't really shed any light on it.
What are you saying?

1009
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:12,950
Women are stupid or they're not a guy,

1010
01:02:12,951 --> 01:02:16,370
so they're going to have a different
point of view. I don't know. Okay.

1011
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:19,250
As being content and being happy the same.
Uh

1012
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,880
Huh.
I don't know.

1013
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:27,870
Something about being content means that
you just kind of gave in to the shit

1014
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:31,620
around you. You know, where
you just kind of like,

1015
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:35,250
well I guess she's just going to be a
cunt for the rest of my life and there's

1016
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,790
nothing I can do about
it. So, uh, but you know,

1017
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:45,050
my own half the house and as long as
I'm not in the half that she's in a,

1018
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:50,280
you know, I'm pretty content, you
know, set the greatest situation.

1019
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:53,280
But uh, you know, it's good. I'm happy,

1020
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:55,620
I'm happy when she's not in the
same room as them. You know,

1021
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,750
I'm gonna have the most amount of people
that, you know, can we compare to,

1022
01:02:58,751 --> 01:03:02,790
while a lot of other people
live in, you know, well,

1023
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,520
I mean there's people trapped in
rubble after an earthquake, you know,

1024
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:08,760
I definitely got a better than
them, so, you know, I think I'm on,

1025
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:10,830
I think I'm content with
world with what I got.

1026
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,530
That's my definition of,
of half of content and being happy is a

1027
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,810
such a weird word, Huh? Happy. How
are you? I'm happy. No one says that.

1028
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,230
I don't say I'm happy.

1029
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,550
Happy sounds like a lie. I don't today.
I'm good. Thanks a great. I'm a good mood.

1030
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,210
No one ever says I'm happy. That's
one of those words that's used a lot,

1031
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,880
but nobody really uses it.
You only use it when you write.

1032
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:46,920
You write when you're typing shit.
That's all it was typing only words,

1033
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,160
you know,
the only time you ever see happy,

1034
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:51,990
it's like on the cover
of like a self help book.

1035
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:58,040
How to be happy and make the 12 people
around you happier by some bald guy with

1036
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:01,140
the fucking goatee.
Um,

1037
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,620
Eh,
right.

1038
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,350
As long as any of you can answer the
question is being happy and content the

1039
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:10,500
same? Um, I don't, I don't think it is.

1040
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:15,830
I think being happy is generally you're
just walking around and you're in a good

1041
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:19,740
mood. You appreciate
life and a, I don't know,

1042
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:24,690
you'd try to do something to a every day
to make sure he didn't waste a day or

1043
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:29,040
whatever. You know what I mean?
You're not an angry cycle like me.

1044
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,770
I guess that would be happy.

1045
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:33,780
And you know how many fucking
arguments I got into this week.

1046
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:37,700
I get in an argument with a
guy in a scooter. All right,

1047
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,660
fucking guy passes me on the right
between a parked car. So I beat that. Um,

1048
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,660
um,
you know,

1049
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:48,930
first of all these fucking assholes and
these scooters out here because gas is

1050
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,390
so expensive out here in la.
Like literally it's,

1051
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,580
it's starting to look like Europe,
the amount of people on here,

1052
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:57,090
on scooters and in vespas and all
that shit. But the funny thing is,

1053
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:00,540
is secretly every guy always
wants to have a fucking Harley.

1054
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,740
He wants to be a bad ass with fucking
tattoos and some fucking winch on the back

1055
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:07,740
of his bike. You know,
doesn't have a boss.

1056
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:11,700
He's a fucking outlaws and he can play
the guitar like Duane Allman. Okay.

1057
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:15,840
That's what fucking guys want to do.
Okay. But the people, most guys like me,

1058
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,290
we don't have the balls to get a fucking
motorcycle because we don't want to get

1059
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,840
road rash and you know,

1060
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:26,380
have your nose burned off when you do
a fucking face plant out on the fucking

1061
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:31,030
one one-on-one one. Right? So what
happens is, is a lot of these douche bags,

1062
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:35,200
now they're buying scooters and they
have a false sense of safety because it's

1063
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:38,800
just the scooter and nobody
who works in emergency room,

1064
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,870
like they'll always tell you
the worst accidents we ever see,

1065
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,570
a motorcycle accidents.
They never say, Oh my God,

1066
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:48,810
this guy was doing 45 on a
scooter and he hit a lemon tree.

1067
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:53,230
And let me tell you, I have not seen
carnage like this since Vietnam.

1068
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,730
You never hear that fucking story.
It's anyways, it's fucking ass.

1069
01:05:55,731 --> 01:05:58,630
And plus all of these assholes get on
these scooters and that they think that

1070
01:05:58,631 --> 01:06:02,380
then they, you know, it's kind of fill
in that I really wanted a motorcycle,

1071
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:04,630
but I don't have the balls
to buy one kind of thing.

1072
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,360
And they get like that
born to be wild vibe.

1073
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:12,510
So this fucking moron passes me on the
right between a parked car because the

1074
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:17,500
road was about ready to split
and I was going to make a left,

1075
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:19,960
but he was going to go straight.
So I fucking beat that him.

1076
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,010
And he immediately slammed on the brakes
because the light was turning yellow

1077
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,150
and he fucking,

1078
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:29,860
he backs up his scooter
to my fucking hybrid.

1079
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,353
Okay.

1080
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,750
This guy on a scooter screaming
at a guy in a hybrid men, it must,

1081
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:38,770
it's fucking hilarious.

1082
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:43,120
It's like it really was showing you
the future when we're going to have a

1083
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:45,400
different, we're going to be relying
on a different kind of energy.

1084
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,970
How the whole definition of
being a man is going to be,

1085
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,970
it's just going to be different. The whole
marvel man thing is going to be gone,

1086
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,300
right.
So anyway,

1087
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:58,301
so he flips up his visor to reveal like
his fucking twisted up angry face in

1088
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,960
this little Tom Selleck
mustache that he's got going on.

1089
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,740
He's like looking for release. It's
fucking yelling at me. I was like, Dude,

1090
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,640
you just passed me on the right
between a parked car. I didn't see you.

1091
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,960
I didn't want to hit you.
Right.

1092
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,080
So he keeps fucking yelling
at me and I'm just like, dude,

1093
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,410
I'm not giving you shit.
I just don't want to run into you.

1094
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,750
I know I'm just driving a
fucking hybrid. You dumb. Fuck.

1095
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,940
But if you do something like that,

1096
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:24,770
you know your head's going to be over
here and your mustache is going to be in

1097
01:07:24,771 --> 01:07:28,330
the fucking trees. So I keep
telling the guy like, dude,

1098
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,460
I'm just beeping at me cause
I didn't see ya. All right,

1099
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:33,370
I don't want to run into you. I don't
want you to get hit. And then he goes, oh,

1100
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,110
I didn't mean to startle you.

1101
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,080
And he flipped down his
fucking visor and then went,

1102
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:44,950
oh boy. And a, I got to
admit I laughed my ass off,

1103
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:48,310
but then was kind of pissed cause I let
a guy on a scooter get the last fucking

1104
01:07:48,311 --> 01:07:49,144
word and Ami.

1105
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,070
So I got into that argument and then I
got an argument with this is all in like

1106
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:55,060
within 24 hours,

1107
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:59,440
I got to know argument with a TSA person
or whatever the fuck they are at the

1108
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:01,570
airport.
Um,

1109
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,450
because of their Gestapo fucking attitude.

1110
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,690
And then I got into an
argument when I was in Phoenix,

1111
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,030
I was driving under the
budget, rent a car. And, uh,

1112
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,160
I was looking down at my directions cause
I trying to figure out how to get to

1113
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:19,310
the hotel and this fucking cop in shorts.

1114
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,890
I don't know if it was rent a cop or
a real cop. I don't know what he was.

1115
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,790
And bicycle shorts was, you
know, he was directing traffic.

1116
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:28,910
So he's telling me to go, but I'm looking
down at my directions and he's like,

1117
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,930
hello, hello? Like yelling at me like
I'm a moron. Like I didn't see him.

1118
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,020
I did fucking see him. I just want to
make sure it was going the right way.

1119
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:41,240
So I just snapped and I was holding
up the directions and I just started

1120
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:45,770
screaming. I'm reading the
directions, I'm just reading me Sarah.

1121
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:50,600
I kept saying, sir, rather, but, but
the undertone was you fucking asshole.

1122
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:54,320
Which I couldn't say because I didn't
know if he had the authority to arrest me

1123
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,910
and uh, I don't know.
It's just bad. You know,

1124
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:02,510
that's another thing that I can't
fucking stand about America right now.

1125
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:07,160
Is this too many variations
on the police officer outfit.

1126
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,500
And I think there's a lot of times that
people aren't cops and you give them the

1127
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:16,520
respect like they are cops. I'm
going to guess. You know what I mean?

1128
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,090
When you don't have to, like I don't have
to take shit from a fucking meter maid.

1129
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,100
I really don't.
You know what I mean?

1130
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:25,910
Like this morning I made like I made like
an illegal u turn and then I saw that,

1131
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:26,121
you know,

1132
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:31,121
this fucking person meter maid sort of
looking at me and I got nervous for half

1133
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:33,920
a second. I was like, wait a minute, it's
a fucking Meta me. What are you gonna do?

1134
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:37,900
Throw it three little fucking pencil.

1135
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:41,870
Lamean can they do anything
to me? Like if they said, hey,

1136
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:44,870
that's an illegal u turn. And I said,
hey, why don't you go fuck yourself?

1137
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:46,910
Can I do that?
You know,

1138
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,540
I really wanna I really wish I knew my
rights more because I think there's a lot

1139
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:55,190
of times you don't like that guy is I
drove by, I go, dude, I'm just, I'm sorry,

1140
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,450
I'm just reading my directions.
He goes,

1141
01:09:56,451 --> 01:10:00,020
well that's why we don't
read when we drive. Really?

1142
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:03,680
That's why we don't eat
whoppers with cheese when we
drive either. You Fat. Fuck.

1143
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:07,610
That's what I wanted to say. But you
know, I stopped myself because I was like,

1144
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:11,270
well, wait a minute. What if that's
a real cop? You know what I mean?

1145
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,810
Thomas would have been worth it just
to see him running after me and those

1146
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:18,150
fucking bike shorts. That was
my favorite part of the, uh,

1147
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,470
that reservoir dogs movie Jvc.
When Steve Buscemi,

1148
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,190
he's running down the street
and he shoots, you know,

1149
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,330
after he gets hit by the car and he
turns around and he shoots those at those

1150
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:30,560
three cops, they actually hits one
of them. And as he's driving away,

1151
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,790
you see in and out his back windshield is,

1152
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,460
do you see that one copper and down
the street just shooting his gun?

1153
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,980
Um,
that's what I would have got to see.

1154
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,740
Like if he was fucking shooting
at me, Jesus Christ. I'm
really all of, let me get,

1155
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:50,240
let me get back to the fucking questions
here. All right, so a happier content.

1156
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:53,750
Um, do I think that the
same thing? No, I don't.

1157
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,030
I think content is an exception.

1158
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:00,320
This is an acceptance and acceptance that,
you know what,

1159
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:04,940
you're not going to make it to the NBA
and uh, you, you a, you appreciate,

1160
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,170
I think, I dunno. What would you rather,

1161
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,690
would you rather be
happy or content happy?

1162
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:15,150
Just sounds like you're fucking in denial,
you know what I mean?

1163
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:19,710
Do you just fucking walking
around? Hey, it is great. It
is great. No, it isn't. No,

1164
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:23,460
it isn't. Banks are failing. $10
billion a month is four to fucking war.

1165
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:29,070
You know, everything isn't great.
Everything's Kinda fucked up right now.

1166
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,710
I'll speak into that shit.
You know,

1167
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,620
people always make fun of me with my
conspiracy theories and that type of shit.

1168
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:37,260
You know how they're eventually going
to stick a microchip in the back of your

1169
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:41,220
head. And I've been doing this bit on
stage talking about how they start slow.

1170
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:43,800
They start with dogs.
That's the first thing they start with.

1171
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,480
And everything's cute.
Oh good.

1172
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:49,350
I found fluffy and then they
graduate going to work on
the kids. And sure enough,

1173
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:52,890
there's a fucking commercial
outright now with this lady.

1174
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:57,060
Lady can't find her kid and
she's freaking out in the park.

1175
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,530
So she takes out a device,
okay.

1176
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,550
And she fucking hit some buttons and
then all of a sudden the end of the

1177
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:07,740
commercial,
she finds her fucking kid.

1178
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,560
Now the thing is is they never
showed a device on the kid.

1179
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:14,280
He didn't have a wristband,
there was nothing in his, uh,

1180
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,480
he didn't have a funny hat
with a propeller on it with
an antenna coming out of

1181
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:23,220
it. Nothing. She just fucking had
that little thing and they found it.

1182
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:28,080
And the funny thing was the commercial
is for batteries. And I'm telling you,

1183
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:33,450
they are working towards
putting microchips in kids
that they're going to do it.

1184
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:38,400
And it's all going to be done with
fear as they always do it. Oh my God,

1185
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:42,450
I can't find my kid. Oh,
there he is. Thank God.

1186
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,033
You know,

1187
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:49,260
I thank God I put a fucking microchip in
my child and now I'm able to find them.

1188
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,040
You know what I mean? And they're
gonna use fair and the reality,

1189
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:57,420
they're going to put all your
information on that ship from your bank

1190
01:12:57,421 --> 01:12:59,580
information, your, uh,

1191
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,530
your social security number,
everything you fucking resume to,

1192
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:08,700
you'll just be getting scanned.
And the conspiracy theory is though,

1193
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:12,870
is if the powers that be
ever turn your chip off,

1194
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:18,450
everything you've ever done is gone.
Your money, you records everything,

1195
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,960
it's all gone and you're fucked
and you are immediately homeless.

1196
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,080
So that will,
that will be the ultimate level of power.

1197
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:29,670
Plus they'll always know where
you are. Oh my God. It's put the,

1198
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,290
you know what?
They're going to fucking do it.

1199
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:34,140
They're going to get away with it
because all you got to use his fear

1200
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:39,570
is anybody else seen that commercial
and it fucking creeps them out. Anybody?

1201
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,540
Am I seriously the only one here? Just
kind of going nuts here. All right,

1202
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:46,950
let's move on to the next fucking
question here. All right. Um, uh,

1203
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:50,730
where are we a blah, blah, blah. You
mentioned being a Stevie Ray Vaughan fan.

1204
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:54,180
Did you ever see him? Um, yes I did.

1205
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:59,210
I saw him on the instep tour and on
the summer of 1989 at great woods in

1206
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,560
Mansfield,
Massachusetts,

1207
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:07,370
and I was fucking loaded and I remember
I was with my brother and he ended up

1208
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:10,170
getting into a fight with some guy,

1209
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:15,380
an argument with some guy who was easily
three times the size of me and I'm

1210
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:20,450
bigger than my brother. So I just
remember like going through it, uh,

1211
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,190
you know, what are you trying to do? I,

1212
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:28,220
whenever the guy had a big orange
mesh shirt with a Jimmy buffet hat,

1213
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,550
and you remember those sunglasses from
the 80s with either had the neon green or

1214
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:37,120
orange, I think he had
the orange ones. I mean,

1215
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,720
in retrospect, I could see why my
brother was yelling at him, but you know,

1216
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:44,530
you know what I mean? I came there
for a, an evening of blues music.

1217
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:47,260
I didn't want to fucking roll
around the floor with some fat fuck.

1218
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:52,420
And then I have that Mesh imprint on my
face when it's fat torso landed on me.

1219
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:58,000
All right, next question, uh,
is the U S U s is the UFC?

1220
01:14:58,001 --> 01:15:01,650
Look how fucking like what alcohol
does to me. Why do I keep drinking it?

1221
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:05,440
Is the UFC jamming too
much down our throats?

1222
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:10,390
Do you think the UFC is somewhat of a
fad that'll end up bearing itself or do

1223
01:15:10,391 --> 01:15:15,010
you think that it will be us
three with us for a long time? Um,

1224
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,600
no, I think, I don't think the UFC is
jamming too much down our throats. Uh,

1225
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,560
what do you mean there's too many shows?
What they got the tap out show,

1226
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,670
they got the other one. I Dunno.
I like all those shows and uh,

1227
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,810
I dunno. I don't think it's going to
end boxing either. I think they're both,

1228
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:35,650
you know, I mean, I even want
like those tough man competitions.

1229
01:15:35,651 --> 01:15:38,380
You put two guys in a ring who are going
to try to beat the shit out of each

1230
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:42,310
other and how do you not watch it?
It's great. It's almost even better.

1231
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:44,430
Like some of those
amateur ones where they,

1232
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:48,970
they don't not have fight and they fill
those haymakers and the guy gets the

1233
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:53,380
other guy gets knocked out with five
basically getting hit with the palm and

1234
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:56,550
risk of the other guy. You
know, those, the [inaudible].

1235
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,600
That's why I think about barroom brawls.
They throw punches like black girls.

1236
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,320
You have to see black girls.
They do that fucking,

1237
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:05,830
you know Damon Wayans bit he does about
the windmills thing that they get going.

1238
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:09,460
That's how a lot of fucking
a barroom brawls look like.

1239
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,410
I guess.

1240
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:14,860
You know what it is is because you're
not a professional fighter and you're not

1241
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:19,150
calm. So even if you know
how to fight, you don't, you
don't throw, you know, Jabs,

1242
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:24,100
upper cuts, you deserve. You
just basically espousing up,

1243
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,880
which is always, that's always
fun to watch. All right,

1244
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,140
moving onto the next thing here.
What else do we got? Oh, you know,

1245
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:35,590
why do I hype some shit that I've got
coming up next week? I'm a really excited,

1246
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,110
um,
I'm very content.

1247
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:42,340
I'm very happy with the fact that next
week for the first time ever I will be

1248
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:43,570
performing in Austin,

1249
01:16:43,571 --> 01:16:47,770
Texas at the cap city comedy
called and it's part of the uh,

1250
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:52,260
the uninformed tour, um, which
is the radio show I do with uh,

1251
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,440
Joe de Rosa who will be opening for me
out there at the Cap City Comedy Club in

1252
01:16:56,441 --> 01:16:58,180
Austin, Texas. Uh,

1253
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:03,690
and I will be there from August 16th
through the 18th and a on the 18th.

1254
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:08,130
I will in fact be going to the
Texas Longhorns, Missouri Games.

1255
01:17:08,131 --> 01:17:11,510
So take out your binoculars because
I will be one of the people,

1256
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:15,650
one of the 100,000 people at the game.
And uh,

1257
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:19,730
if you would like to get tickets anyways
to go to the Austin thing, a Oxman show,

1258
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:25,060
go to a cap city comedy club.com and
a click right on the tickets thing.

1259
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,970
I'm on the website right now. There
it is. Look at that. There it is.

1260
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,030
Who's going to be the, and some guy
named Matt Sadler's there this week.

1261
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:39,650
So if you want to look at the room,
go see him,

1262
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,570
look at me hype and other guys
fucking shows. All right, so is that,

1263
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:47,690
is that going to be it? Oh, hey,
let's do overrated. Underrated.

1264
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:52,730
I didn't really get any this week, so, um,
or at least I can't find any that I got.

1265
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:58,100
Um, I'm going to tell you my fucking, you
know what I think is overrated. You know,

1266
01:17:58,101 --> 01:18:02,600
it's overrated. Japanese, uh, baseball.
Wait a minute, somebody said that,

1267
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:04,130
didn't they?
They already said that on this one.

1268
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,290
Somebody said that Japanese baseball
players are overrated. And you know what?

1269
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,430
I have to agree with them after
watching dice k pitch game too,

1270
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,950
and when he came over,
oh,

1271
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:19,400
the fucking gyro ball and all
that type of type of stuff.

1272
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:20,870
These Japanese baseball players,

1273
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,190
they always have these
ridiculous nicknames like
they're going to be, you know,

1274
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:26,751
you know,

1275
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:30,680
they're always named like titled in
Godzilla and then they come over here.

1276
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:33,300
So we're going to miss
strike three had decky Ema,

1277
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,390
now I can talk to act goes down again.

1278
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:38,330
He's in a bit of a slump and it's amazing.

1279
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:41,540
He hit 9,000 home runs over in the Osaka.

1280
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:47,420
You know, why don't they just
go to the Dominican Republic?

1281
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,540
That's where they all are. I mean,
how many fucking Pedro Martinez?

1282
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,660
You know what I mean?
Like a Manny Ramirez.

1283
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,180
But what the fuck he's
done for the Dodgers. Okay.

1284
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:59,740
And he's just from Washington Heights.
All right.

1285
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,340
But if you actually go to to the,
to the fountain, to the source,

1286
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:08,530
anything down there. Puerto Rico. Yeah.

1287
01:19:08,531 --> 01:19:11,720
You got to respect that. That dom
isn't that where many Rivera's from

1288
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:17,480
David Ortiz doesn't need Dominican?
Why wouldn't you go there?

1289
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,610
Look at those guys. The fucking
insane. I mean, I think you've got to,

1290
01:19:20,611 --> 01:19:23,180
you got to go Latino firms. I'm going
to, I'm going to send it out there.

1291
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:26,780
Latinos have taken over
Latinos saved baseball.

1292
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,490
You know,

1293
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:32,510
people always talking about how black
dudes took over hoop and they took over a

1294
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:36,680
football and all that type of ship
and no one's bringing up a baseball.

1295
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:42,230
All these fucking guys, right? I just
don't know enough baseball players.

1296
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:44,240
But anytime I see somebody doing like,
you know,

1297
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:48,260
turning a double play with his back to
second base and he doesn't even take the

1298
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:51,530
ball out of his glove and he fucking
flips it over there with his club.

1299
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,030
It's always a Latino dude are some
of the top white Jesus Christ.

1300
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:01,370
There are many white guys left.
Really getting low self esteem here.

1301
01:20:01,371 --> 01:20:03,470
When his second Ukeles

1302
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,390
wow was just fucked up. I
am hard pressed. Who is,

1303
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:12,810
who is the best white guy is a question
for you guys. Who's the best white guy?

1304
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,510
Baseball player outright.

1305
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:19,920
Now I'm really drawing a
blank half of Derek Jeter.

1306
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:23,760
Can we get credit for that?
Um,

1307
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:28,380
well let's look at the red sox.
Jason Varitek calls a great game.

1308
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:33,030
He's batting about fucking Oh 25 Euclid.

1309
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,280
Kevin Lowe,
Jason Bay.

1310
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,480
Adroit Jesus Christ.
Wait a minute.

1311
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,080
You know, I can't think of one fucking,
you know. No, this is bullshit.

1312
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:49,560
This is bullshit. That's gotta be one.
I'm just throwing fucking drawing a blank.

1313
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,780
Let's go to the Yankees. They was going
to a zillion stars. All right. Hey Rod.

1314
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:00,180
Okay. Hey, Rod Rodriguez. Okay. He's
not white. Derek Jeter get half credit.

1315
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:05,770
Second base, uh, the
fuck, that's not Soriano.

1316
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:11,010
What the fuck play second base.
I know who he is.

1317
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,950
He looks like fucking a Ralph Harris.

1318
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,740
That's not a white dude. Jason
Giambi. I mean Jesus Christ.

1319
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:25,110
Fucking guys on a, these are like horse
tranquilizers. You have another set guy.

1320
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:27,660
He fucking hits the ball.
He just starts running down the line,

1321
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:31,830
licking his lips and he's always sweaty.
Got that crazy fucking look in his eye.

1322
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,400
Like he wants to admit to a
murder, but he, but he can't.

1323
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:40,290
Then you go out to the outfield.
Who Do they got? I don't know.

1324
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:43,110
Random fucking figured stuff.
You know what I, my brain hearts,

1325
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:48,990
I think we got Tom Brady. Tom
Brady is the AMT. Wes Walker.

1326
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,690
They ain't go, I can not tell you
something right now. You know,

1327
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:53,790
I did a bit on my last special about how,
you know,

1328
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,680
whenever you watch the Olympics,

1329
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:58,740
whenever you watched the track race has
always nine black dudes and at one token

1330
01:21:58,741 --> 01:22:01,080
white guy in lane eight,
you know,

1331
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,900
and I'll not the other
nine black dudes bomb away.

1332
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:06,330
I don't know if you've noticed
during this Olympics. I Dunno.

1333
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:10,590
I dunno what new synthetic drug is out
there that they don't know how to test

1334
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:14,160
for. But I think that they, they're
giving it to some white dudes because uh,

1335
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:14,791
that was someone,

1336
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:18,690
some of the fastest white people I've
seen in a long time and I was just sitting

1337
01:22:18,691 --> 01:22:23,670
there like fourth place.
Really? Wow. They were flying.

1338
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,920
Well, the short shorts, I think
the white dudes coming back. Yeah.

1339
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,820
Well I'm going to, I'm going to
fucking go out on a limb here.

1340
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,410
I'm going to say that uh,

1341
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:36,390
blacks and Latinos have raised the
bar and Chinese people in Ping Pong.

1342
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,280
Not to be disrespectful, you know, want
to make sure I include everybody and uh,

1343
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:46,410
now we're going to raise the bar. Hey
listen, the question I've got for you,

1344
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:51,411
how come only USC seems to
know that Samoans make great
linebackers or defensive

1345
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:55,680
backs. Every time you get fucking
watching UFC, they always got some,

1346
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:57,091
some new motto.

1347
01:22:57,091 --> 01:23:02,040
Follow guy with fucking a 12 inch Afro
mullet coming out of the back of his

1348
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:06,760
helmet. Just lighten people
up. Did Samoans only say,

1349
01:23:06,761 --> 01:23:10,330
I'm only playing in southern California
because that's the closest thing to the

1350
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:13,390
beautiful weather we have in the islands,
Samoa. You know what I just realized,

1351
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:15,520
I have no idea where the ILS Samoa is.

1352
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:22,710
I'm going to guess it's a south of
Hawaii in a little further east now.

1353
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:29,200
Live a little further west.
Got Him stupid.

1354
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:34,270
That doesn't make you stupid, does
it? I don't know. All right. Anyways,

1355
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:36,730
this has been the podcast for this week.
It's been very disjointed,

1356
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:40,820
very hung over.
My voice is tired and uh,

1357
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:42,520
and when I was telling you
I was quitting drinking,

1358
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:46,930
well obviously I've stopped
and uh, you know, I don't,

1359
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:51,130
I don't have to do about
it. It's just fun. You know,

1360
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:55,030
it's like that guy said he's sitting
there bar and he got new big an all night

1361
01:23:55,031 --> 01:24:00,010
debate over. What's the difference
between happy and content?

1362
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,300
You know what I mean? It's a, you know,

1363
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:09,100
it's good discussion considering
everybody has air conditioning nowadays,

1364
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,120
so no one hangs out on the stoops anymore,
so you can't shoot the shit.

1365
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:16,420
You go down to the bar and
you have great discussions.

1366
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,160
It was a good one. I had the, it was
a fucking, when I had the other day,

1367
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,320
who was one of those,
what would you rather be?

1368
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,470
Would you rather be gay or
would you rather be tortured?

1369
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:33,430
That's what came,
that's what came through.

1370
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,070
You know,

1371
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:40,510
that fucking dilemma
was like an hour debate.

1372
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:41,351
What would you rather be?

1373
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:45,670
Would you rather be gay or would
you rather be tortured? All right.

1374
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:49,480
Now I believe that you're born gay.
Okay.

1375
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,940
So it was a bad question because
what they should have said,

1376
01:24:51,941 --> 01:24:56,941
would you rather be forced to be
straight and forced to perform a gay act?

1377
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,650
Or would you rather be
tortured but to just say,

1378
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:02,410
would you rather be gay or be tortured?
It's a no brainer.

1379
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:06,480
You'd rather be gay because you born
that way. You just came out going, hey,

1380
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:11,350
I'll loving the cock. You know, it's like
Lichen cookies. You like it. That's like,

1381
01:25:11,351 --> 01:25:11,441
what?

1382
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:14,980
Did you run any cookies or have someone
take a pliers and remove one of your

1383
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:18,100
fingers? Ah, I think
I'd eat the cookies. So

1384
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,940
now, you know what I mean? I, I'm, I'm of
that school. I believe you're born gay,

1385
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:27,520
you know, I don't understand these
people who think is a choice.

1386
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:31,780
Why would you choose that? You know,
everyone, if you could make a choice,

1387
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:36,580
you're trying to be a quote unquote
as normal as humanly possible,

1388
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:39,730
unless you like Madonna and you're
just like an attention whore.

1389
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:44,680
You know what I mean? So you just
deliberately, you know, finally jumpsuits.

1390
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,760
Did you just yank up between your Twat
lifts? What does with her? You know,

1391
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:52,180
it's like lady you 50. I got it. You're in
shape, but I don't, you're, you're weird.

1392
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:56,680
Look. And now they just weird
looking because the loan you,

1393
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:59,560
she looks like an old stripper,
you know?

1394
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:04,250
Fucking put the God damn glass
high heels away lady. It's over.

1395
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,950
If 50 yeah.
Had a great run.

1396
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,660
People have been fucking rubbing
one out to you for since the 80s.

1397
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,460
That's unprecedented that it's,
it's three decades.

1398
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:21,650
You know, I think you got enough.
Think you've had enough. All right.

1399
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:26,000
Oh wait a minute before I
wrap this up here. This is,
somebody sent me this thing.

1400
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:30,440
Um, uh, what is this? I actually,

1401
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,950
I didn't know where to file this
under other than just an op ed piece.

1402
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,650
All these are the movie reviews.
What am I talking about?

1403
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,130
Someone actually made up a great one here.
They said they gave me a good,

1404
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:44,280
when they said my number one worst movie
of all time time was m night Shambhala

1405
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:47,990
limit Dingdong whatever his fucking
name is. Uh, that movie, the village.

1406
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:53,240
But now pineapple express has
taken its place. Horrible movie.

1407
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,490
I guess you have to smoke weed to get it.

1408
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,810
Although half baked was hilarious.
Now

1409
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:05,900
I think you made a great point there.
In the end we said you know, half,

1410
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,471
but you know,

1411
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:11,060
you think Pineapple Express was the
worst movie ever but you like half baked.

1412
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:15,530
And I'm going to say that's because
half bake came out 10 years ago when you

1413
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:19,220
were probably 18 to 21.
You know what I mean?

1414
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:22,670
Cause I saw pineapple express.
I thought parts of it were funny,

1415
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:25,040
but in the end I was just
like, yeah, you know,

1416
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:28,220
I kind of felt like I wasted my money and
I was like, ah. It was kind of stupid.

1417
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,720
But then I was thinking, wait
a minute, you know what? If
I was 16 to 21 years old,

1418
01:27:32,721 --> 01:27:35,840
pineapple express would be one of the
funniest fucking movies I ever saw.

1419
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:40,400
Just because you're in
that mindset. So, you know,

1420
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,920
so it's not even fair for me
to say that star wars sucks.

1421
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,710
Now you know what it is.

1422
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:48,710
Because I remember I thought the way
he walks for gay way back in the day,

1423
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:51,350
and by gay, I don't mean, uh,

1424
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:57,080
I don't mean happy like the gay
nineties number, the 1890s, everybody,

1425
01:27:57,081 --> 01:27:59,690
they would call it the gay nineties
before gay switched to meaning.

1426
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,600
You like to have sex with
someone of the same sex.

1427
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:06,830
And I don't mean gay as in,
uh,

1428
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:12,260
yeah, homosexual. I mean that other
kind of gay, you know what I mean?

1429
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:17,180
You want to do that, that's fucking
gay. That doesn't even mean stupid.

1430
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:19,160
What the can may give me a good
definition, but that's one of those,

1431
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:23,000
everybody knows what it means,
but she can't give it a definition.

1432
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:26,240
Doesn't mean happy.
It doesn't mean homophobic.

1433
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:29,810
It's that inbetween said gray area of gay,

1434
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,460
like uh, uh, jam bands.

1435
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:35,480
That's fucking gay.

1436
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,080
I don't watch somebody play a
fucking guitar solo for 90 minutes.

1437
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,550
That's not even a good example.
I'm the fucking worst.

1438
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:46,120
Why don't I prepare for these
things? All right, here's, yeah,

1439
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:49,010
well this is the last thing I'll read.
This is some op ed piece feeling I,

1440
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:51,920
because this wasn't a question,
it didn't fit into any category.

1441
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:56,420
It was just somebody opinion. So
this might start something new. Um,

1442
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,960
okay. Here we go. Bill. Nowadays,

1443
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:04,620
the majority of men are such wimps that
there is no hope for a woman meeting.

1444
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:06,930
A decent man that isn't a pussy.

1445
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:12,180
Most men have no shame
admitting that they are weak.

1446
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:15,390
And I seriously wonder myself,
where have all the man,

1447
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,740
where's all the manhood gone? Didn't
men use to feel good about being manly?

1448
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:25,080
Have we as strong women, quote unquote
taking it away? My grandfather,

1449
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:29,400
my grandfather would rolling over in
his grave if he heard how pussified most

1450
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,130
men have become it.
It's very sad. However,

1451
01:29:32,131 --> 01:29:34,110
it has caused me to
stand on my own two feet.

1452
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:36,120
So I never have to rely on a weakling,

1453
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:41,190
which is good because I don't want
anyone else running my ruining. I mean,

1454
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:46,140
running my life about myself.
Um, and then it just goes on.

1455
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:51,090
And it wasn't our fault that men have
weakened, uh, and been feminized.

1456
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:51,924
So

1457
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:57,930
have women become so strong that men
are afraid to take their rollback?

1458
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,490
That's a ridiculous question.
Oh yeah. Yeah. We're terrified.

1459
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:06,810
Have we lost because we've won either
way. It sucks. Smell. You know what?

1460
01:30:06,811 --> 01:30:08,910
This is sweetheart.
This,

1461
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:14,450
I dunno if it has to do with your hormones
or what it has to do with a woman.

1462
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,240
Never for the most part,

1463
01:30:18,241 --> 01:30:21,930
never really knowing what she wants
or what's going to make her happy.

1464
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:27,140
And you become psychotically focused
on something and then when you get it,

1465
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,970
you are still not fulfilled,
which causes you to question everything.

1466
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:37,710
And uh, I dunno, I don't think,

1467
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,411
I dunno.
What,

1468
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:44,670
what are you basing nowadays that the
majority of men are such wimps that,

1469
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:48,300
you know, are you basing that on
like the television you're watching?

1470
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:52,680
Because I definitely think that we are
in a streak here where they, you know,

1471
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:56,640
I think always throughout the history of
time with like sitcoms and that type of

1472
01:30:56,641 --> 01:30:58,050
stuff that they,
uh,

1473
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:03,870
they always had to make the guy
like dumber and the woman's smarter.

1474
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,031
And,
uh,

1475
01:31:06,031 --> 01:31:10,800
I just think they do that as an apology
for the fact that for the most part guys

1476
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:13,250
run shit and uh,

1477
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:17,590
don't let women get past a certain point
in management. So I think that they, the,

1478
01:31:17,591 --> 01:31:19,020
you know,
to throw you a bone,

1479
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:24,120
they make the guy character a fucking
idiot in the, uh, in the Sitcom.

1480
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:28,130
But at the end of the day, who wants to
show some studio that's run by some guy?

1481
01:31:28,131 --> 01:31:32,790
So who gives a fuck? So,
I dunno, I think you're,

1482
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:37,500
you're probably fishing in the
wrong pond. Um, but you know,

1483
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:39,340
be careful what you wish for.
Uh,

1484
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:44,630
because the quote unquote real
man is a probably an asshole,

1485
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,590
I would think.
I don't know what the fuck do I know?

1486
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:54,060
I don't fucking know anything.
Have guys become pussified.

1487
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:57,240
I think a lot of the comedies,
like you know a lot of them,

1488
01:31:57,241 --> 01:32:00,070
like these hipster fucking
Douche bags out there that, that,

1489
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:03,940
that kind of in right now.
Maybe that's what you're basing it on.

1490
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:08,650
How they were those stupid
fedoras and it's just a fucking,

1491
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,390
I don't know what it is. I hate
the fucking, you know. Dot.

1492
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,200
That that whole fucking, that whole
scene just bugs the shit out of me.

1493
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:22,450
Fucking idiots walked around there for
doors like deliberately dressing like

1494
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:26,490
nerds. It's like, dude, you are a
nerd. You don't have to try. Okay.

1495
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,620
And stop acting like you
were cool in high school.

1496
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:32,860
Stop trying to rewrite your story.
All right. You weren't cool,

1497
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:37,270
you weren't getting any pussy
and now you know, and it's just,

1498
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:39,550
I fucking hate that whole thing. I
think that's all. But you know what I,

1499
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:44,170
you know I'm really sick of
though, is, is the word awkward?

1500
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,930
You know what I mean? I'm
sick of awkward comedy. Like,

1501
01:32:46,931 --> 01:32:50,680
do you guys watch that show? The
office? I can't deal with that show.

1502
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,150
It's just like,
can some person,

1503
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:56,680
can one person on that show be
aware of what they're saying?

1504
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,370
It's just everything that happens
on that show and it's like,

1505
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:04,720
and then my house burned down,
not good.

1506
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:09,190
And then they sort of look around like,
wait a minute, what did I just say?

1507
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:14,130
It's just fucking, it's ridiculous.
I'm sick of that kind of comedy.

1508
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:18,160
Yeah. The, I'm calling it first
awkward comedy is out. All right.

1509
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:23,020
And if it's somehow spin
back to false anger,

1510
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:27,940
I get my own goddamn show.
All right. That's it. How
long have I talked this week?

1511
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:31,000
42 minutes. These things are
getting too long, I think. I mean,

1512
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:34,150
I'm making fun of jam bands and I'm
having 42 minute fucking podcast.

1513
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,910
Why don't I get to the point a little
quicker? All right. So anyways,

1514
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:40,570
I am going to be at the a Cap
City Comedy Club in Austin,
