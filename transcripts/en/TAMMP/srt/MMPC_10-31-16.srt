even even brown 10 they just start saying
little wise ass conti fucking things.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:47,790
You know?

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,370
That's the hardest thing about being an
adult around a kid is they think they're

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,560
so fucking smart and it's just
like, dude, I was, I was your age.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,510
I've been 10 I've been 12.
Okay. Dan had been 2030,

18
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:03,870
40 almost up to 50. You're right. You'd
dump. Fuck. Do you think you think,

19
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:08,580
I don't know what you're doing. Do you
think you're playing with my mind, man?

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,430
I mean, just so you just want to say
it to you. Remember that your mode,

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,680
everybody's got to have that.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,580
Do you ever have that fucking
adult that just fucking, you know,

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,870
when your parents weren't looking,

24
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,790
just look to you and just
told you to shut the fuck up.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,190
Okay.

26
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,240
Probably doesn't happen nowadays because
of all the smart phones and everybody's

27
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:34,870
got a video camera and the kid
blogs about it. Next thing you know,

28
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:39,220

I Dunno. I Dunno what Cleo,
get outta here. Go on. Go on.

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,060
Um,
you know,

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,930
but back then, I mean, that's
the kind of Shit you could do.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,410
I remember what we were talking in church,

32
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,860
me and my brother and this
dude fucking turnaround. He
goes, hey, he goes, shut up.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,170
He said that. He goes, well, you shut up.
You know, it's just one of those things,

34
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:03,441
you know,

35
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:06,350
and my mother and I looked at my mother
and she fucking put her eyebrows up like

36
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:11,290

doesn't happen nowadays. Apparel my,

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,350

You don't do that much emotional abuse.

38
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,150
Verbal abuse. No. You kid
needs to shut the fuck up.

39
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,680
So what our do you,
there's this, that shit,

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,220
that fucking hour where they just
stopped being cute. You know,

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,610
they just stopped being cute and they
get fucking annoying and then it get,

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,470
it goes over the hill where it just
becomes like, you know, they're coming up,

43
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:39,080
do your thing. And they got the
Shitty Grinch smirk on their face.

44
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:42,610
I'm telling you this fucking
year does fucking year.

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,750
Some kid comes up with a
smirk on his face. I go,

46
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:48,380
I'm not giving you any candy cause that
look on your face is what I want to say.

47
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:49,310
But you can't because of that.

48
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,670
Look on your face and if you do anything
to my mailbox or anything like that,

49
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:56,510
I'm going to fucking kill you.
All right? You fucking pussy.

50
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,590
You don't even know how to drive
yet. The Fuck Outta here. Right?

51
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,560
But you can't say, you know, he
can't, not, not today's America,

52
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,390
not in today's America. Well, you know
what, Trump's going to bring that back.

53
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,500
Um,
I've had such a bad experience,

54
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:19,030
like all my life, all my laugh ever there
was a bid. I've been waiting for the,

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,190
I couldn't wait to have a fucking house.

56
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,640
The kids came by to go trick or treating.

57
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,580
I mean I moved out and um,

58
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,110
the first time I lived like
in the up the attic of,

59
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,290
of a fucking old house that
they turned into an apartment.

60
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,250
It was fucking hilarious.

61
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:40,390
And you had to like walk down the center
of the apartments so your head head

62
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,720
wouldn't hit either side of
the fucking roof. And uh,

63
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,000
I told you guys this right now,
he didn't have a bed.

64
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,540
I slept in a sleeping bag
and I would sleep right by
the window because I didn't,

65
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,860
we didn't have any AC.

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,190
And then one night there was
like some torrential downpour.

67
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,290
I was sitting there dream and
I was on a boat or something,

68
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,610
some about water and I woke
up just soaking wet. Um,

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,070
and then he always funny ended up catching
a cold and like the next day it was

70
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:10,090
like July was like 89 degrees out
of something. And I had a cold,

71
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:14,530
like it was fucking November. Um, Oh God,

72
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:16,510
that fucking sucked.
Um,

73
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,100
then I moved back in with my parents,
get my shit together,

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,160
fucking finally graduated fucking college.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,840
And then when I moved out I ended up
going to New York City and people don't go

76
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,280
trick or treating in New York City.

77
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:33,850
They have places where they go where all
the fucking candy is and they make sure

78
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,670
there's no fucking Weirdos there.
Um,

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,200
and then when I finally moved out to La,
I don't know,

80
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:46,150
people still didn't come to
my first apartment was when
I got my house, you know,

81
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,840
five years ago there was just like, all
right, now they're going to be coming.

82
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,600
And I was fucking loaded for bear
and I, you, I did the bid on,

83
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,020
I had the full size candy bars.
Jesus Christ.

84
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:00,640
Cleal you're driving me nuts. Get
over there and lay down. You keep,

85
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,860
there's no way to be mad at
a dog for longer than four.

86
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:07,150
Frustrated more than three
seconds. They'll can you
please lay down. Hey Buddy,

87
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,120
laid out,

88
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,630
down.
Go on,

89
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,240
lay down. There you go. And the
follow through. Thank you. Um,

90
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:21,670
I already can tell she's not going
to sit there cause she's laying down,

91
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,530
but she has her ears up and she's just
staring at me. You know what it is.

92
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:29,620
I had to get up early to do this fucking
podcast cause I've got a bunch of shit

93
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,690
that I need to do.
So anyways,

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,020
people finally started coming to the
fucking house and uh, that's what I found.

95
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,490
You know, soon as the sun goes down the
first, I know we always talk about this,

96
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,830
but you gotta admit it's true
the first like hour and a half.

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,600
It's the cutest fucking kids you've
ever seen. The parents are great,

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,580
you know, it's just like a great, it's
just, I dunno, it's fucking awesome.

99
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,870
The kids are adorable. And then somewhere
around, I don't know, two weeks,

100
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,370
seven and eight, it starts switching
over and there's just nothing,

101
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,660
but it's like after like
a quarter to nine, I mean,

102
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,750
just everybody see it's going
to be a bunch of fucking,

103
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,893
oh man,

104
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,680
you know something about rent in this
fucking house and it's got this crazy

105
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,570
driveway. I don't even think
anybody's going to come up here,

106
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,960
but next year I promise
you guys I have to fucking,

107
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,890
I want to open a door and be like,
ah Nah. You guys, you're too old.

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,610
You're too old. Look at, Hey, go buy
some candy. Get the fuck Outta here.

109
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,800
But then you got to worry.
They're going to fuck up your house.

110
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:35,230
Even if they don't do it that night,
they're going to do it another night.

111
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,520
Just be like, come on man, you guys are
too old. Maybe it'll just lie and be like,

112
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:44,230
oh, sorry. I might've candy. How
tall are you? Five Watt. Yeah,

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,330
I'm out of candy. What do

114
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,710
You're not for 11. Fuck out of

115
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,160
Um Oh y'all are. You know what you do is,

116
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,150
is what's the worst kind of fucking candy?
Oh,

117
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,630
it's just a shitty old lady kind of candy.
That's what you do, you know with the,

118
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,070
the fucking fruit in the middle
of it. Like real fruit. Oh my God.

119
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,500
I don't know about you guys. I don't
know what grandmothers are like nowadays,

120
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,300
but when I was a kid, man, my grandma,

121
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,050
my grandparents had the
worst fucking candy,

122
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,640
at least one of them did.
And then like the fuck,

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,550
I had a paper route and then there was
like a bunch of old biddies and shit that,

124
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:28,030
you know, a couple that never got married
and shit or that fucking, they're dead.

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,330
They're fucking husband died and they'd
always have like this little candy.

126
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:35,830
I have a piece of candy. Right. And
I know he got a bite into, Ugh, God,

127
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,600
I didn't know what the fuck it was.
It was just, it was just horrible.

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,600
Just there, just, you know, he was like,

129
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,600
did they put your perfume in the
middle of this shit? I'm sorry. It was,

130
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,670
it was too. I'm just saying it was
disgusting. All right. So anyways, um,

131
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,550
I'm actually going to a
Halloween party tonight.

132
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:57,330
I was going to make some pumpkin bread
for the house straight. I was like, ah,

133
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,270
or the party in and neo's
going like I was, I got mad.

134
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:03,790
I got so much shit to do when I go
and I gotta make that Pumpkin bread.

135
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:08,320
And then she just goes like,

138
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:18,730
It's like, it's Pumpkin bread. It's
not that. It's just like, it's fucking,

139
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,190

140
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,250
10 minutes to put it together and then
throw it in the fucking oven for an hour.

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,450
It's just a pain in the ass to do
it. She, why don't we just do this?

142
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:32,950
I could afford to fucking just being
another asshole shown up with a bottle of

143
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,290
wine as opposed to showing
up with Pumpkin bread.

144
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,720
Okay.

145
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,450
The fuck is, you know, I don't know.
I don't know. Sometimes. Sometimes,

146
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:45,460
I don't know. Sometimes we don't fucking,
we just don't see that out of like,

147
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:49,780
I want to make my own steam dumpling. She
goes, I just buy them at trader Joe's.

148
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,400
You know? Those are, those are
the times, you know what I mean?

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,690
Those are the times we just
want to kind of smile and nod,

150
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,550
just slowly back towards the front door,

151
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,200
get in the car and just never come
back again. Yeah. Then other words,

152
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,690
you'd lie to yourself that that's what
you're going to do for the next 20

153
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,750
minutes. As you drive around,
you know, talking to yourself,

154
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,090
it fucking red lights and you look over,

155
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,990
there's some beautiful
woman half year raise.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,630
Go and look at that crazy bald old guy
and you just sit there and you got to be

157
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,520
like, wow, I'm the, I'm
the crazy bald old guy.

158
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,580
No, it's good. I'm worn me
out here. And then you'd give,

159
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,710
you go back home and then that's it.
That's how it works.

160
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,980
But every once in awhile,
not actually once in a while,

161
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,690
more people than not
can commit to that day.

162
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,280
They can back their way out the front
door and they can go through with,

163
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:44,410
it may take it all the way to the divorce,
you know,

164
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,330
they go up, they get
themselves a to pay, you know,

165
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,650
they painted orange, they get
a red tie, they run for office,

166
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,420
they start people up at truck stops.
Um,

167
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,860
this election is so fucked up that,
uh,

168
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,290
okay,

169
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,250
that's kind of really quieted down.
I have for the last fucking debate,

170
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:09,700
if that's what the fuck
you want to call it. Um,

171
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,160
okay.

172
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,910
My big thing this year is I want to know,
um,

173
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,240
I just fucking lose lose. It's fucking
lose lose at the, at the thing.

174
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,030
And you know, something, as much as
I've been sitting here fucking saying,

175
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,240
you know, Trump's a fucking
racist and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. It's just like,

176
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,930
well, you know, the Clintons
are from Arkansas, so, you know,

177
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,550
I don't think they're too fucking
enlightened down there either. You know,

178
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,020
if Wayne off, I know I'm just
fucking being stereotypical here,

179
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:45,710
but give me a break. Oh,
Bill and fucking I, Hillary,

180
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,170
they grew up in Arkansas
in like the fifties.

181
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,730
You might want to go back and look at
some of those fucking racist, you know,

182
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,950
the racist people
screaming at black people.

183
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,690
Kids go into school for the first time.

184
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,510
You might want to try to pick her
head out or something like that.

185
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,840
Give me a fucking break. You
from Arkansas. I love that shit.

186
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,550
Wear it just because you're a democrat.

187
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:08,720
That just means that you know that
you'd not homophobic, you're not racist.

188
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:10,820
Or I have a byway wear blue.

189
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,220
I just don't fucking or that public.

190
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,200
And then that automatically
means that you're, you know,

191
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:19,320
you want a berry babies in
the backyard and you know,

192
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,960
unless they're fucking blue eyed
white babies, you know what I mean?

193
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,930
Like that whole fucking deer in that,
the corporations and all that,

194
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,080
they're all fucking cunts.
And you know,

195
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,170
I know that cause I'm a condo
and I'm somewhere in the middle.

196
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,240
I like to think I definitely
lean more fucking left. But, uh,

197
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,630
I'm also contrarian and now I live
out here in Hollywood and I just can't

198
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:44,430
fucking deal with these people out
here and that it's, it's driving me.

199
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,090
I don't think it's driving
me to the right. It's,

200
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,360
it's driving me to say things on the
right just to fuck with these people.

201
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,180
Like I love trashing out here. It's one
of my favorite fucking things to do.

202
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,220
Okay.

203
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,851
You know,
I,

204
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,360
last night I was fucking around on
stage and I was talking about that and

205
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,770
talking about how, you know, well,
Hillary's from fucking Arkansas,

206
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,260
everybody and they all kind of
laughed. I go, you know, those,

207
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,580
those fucking fly over states that you
guys all shit on out here, you know?

208
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,070
Yeah.

209
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,160
And uh, you know, of course
it gets fucking whatever.

210
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:16,860
You know what the big thing isn't it
on this ballot is wherever the fuck you

211
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,280
live.

212
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,860
More important than what of that orange
headed fucking racist comment or that

213
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:24,960
devil woman with her fucking issues.
Right.

214
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,730
She lived in Arkansas in the 1950s.
Jesus Christ,

215
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,250
write me a fucking break.
Um,

216
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,473
okay.

217
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,690
Be a or her, you know what the
biggest fucking thing is, sorry,

218
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,630
I'm losing my train of thought
here is those is all the props,

219
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,190
the state propositions, you know,
and this is what pisses me off.

220
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:50,360
So I go to this website to try to
figure out California 17 ballot measure

221
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,870
propositions explained.

222
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,610
All right?
And uh,

223
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,850
all they do is they, they
sort of explained the thing,
but what they don't have,

224
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:04,851
what I cannot find is all the bullshit
that is attached to each one of these

225
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,031
propositions.

226
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:11,031
Like this shit is so fucked up
and I do not understand why.

227
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,230
Okay,

228
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,640
this is never addressed. Why? And all
these propositions like no means yes,

229
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,600
yes means no.

230
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,720
And then there's a little bit of maybe
in there and then if you vote for the

231
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:25,130
fucking Shit, there's some other
measure saying that, you know, yeah,

232
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:29,710
it's okay to a fucking stick, a baby
in a snowbank for fucking, you know,

233
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,100
13 hours until it freezes
to death or whatever our
fucking long would would take.

234
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,350
You know,
I just can't,

235
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:39,230
I can't find anything that says
all the shit that's attached to it.

236
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,460
Why can't the fucking ballot
just be fucking the proposition?

237
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:47,840
Just be written clearly. So regular
people understand it. Yes. Means yes.

238
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,930
No means no.
And there's nothing else attached to it,

239
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,250
you know, like they'll say,
all right. Ah, there we go.

240
00:13:56,251 --> 00:14:01,251
Proposition 51 allows the
sales of 9 billion in bonds,

241
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,003
mmm.

242
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,570
To pay for,
for newK ,

243
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,760
kindergarten to 12th grade and
community college facilities.

244
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,460
The basics, roughly 6 million students
at 10 k two you don't have the fucking,

245
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:21,330
his proposition 51 wants to address the
needs by allowing the sale of 9 billion

246
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:26,331
in general obligation bonds to pay
for buildings in modernizing k 12 and

247
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:27,600
community college.

248
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,580
It's the first school bond measure on
the state ballot since 2006 it's unusual

249
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,010
because it's sponsored
by the building industry.

250
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,501
Okay.
Right there.

251
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,200
The fact that it's sponsored by the
building industry means they're going to

252
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:45,520
charge us up the fucking ass. And in
the end, even though they get 9 billion,

253
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,320
they're going to come in with the
fucking tab of about 15 billion and then

254
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:49,841
they'll be like,
well,

255
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:53,670
we already started against me going to
physically move from talking shit and

256
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,513
told Bluto.

257
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,710
Typically the legislator would be the
path for getting this kind of proposition

258
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:04,640
on the ballot, but it hasn't been
able to do so in recent years. Yeah.

259
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,440
The fact that the building
industry wants to do it,

260
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,940
you already know this is crooked is shit.

261
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,630
What you're voting on about 7
billion in nearly ADC like this shit.

262
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,070
7 billion would be allocated to the K
to 12 thing and in the another 2 billion

263
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:20,240
would feed it for the community college.
I got to read all of this shit.

264
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,020
Supporters include developers,
builders,

265
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,910
school board officials and business groups
and I want to get any of those people.

266
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,790
All right.

267
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah.

268
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,410
Supporters say,
all right.

269
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,040
Supporters say many of our schools need
repairs and upgrades to make them safe

270
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,630
for our children.
That's very vague.

271
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,280
Proposition 51 we'll will improve
education overall and help expand space

272
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,350
communicology so more students can attend.

273
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,770
Opponents say prop 54 would
add to the state debt,

274
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:53,100
which is already more than 400 billion.
How the fuck is California?

275
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,120
400 billion in debt.

276
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:55,980
Yeah.

277
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,380
Bond measures should be passed locally.

278
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,190
Giving communities control
of how the money is spent.

279
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,750
Yeah. Jesus. I mean,
did you feel any closer?

280
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,050
All right, so there's one comment. Close
the border. Eliminate anchor babies,

281
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,350
citizenship and re institute.

282
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,070
Yeah,

283
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,960
and re-institute of all provisions of
prop proposition one 87 the notes talk

284
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,410
about building more schools.
Sorry, I used to always vote yes.

285
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:29,140
And these now Sacramento
has changed my vote.

286
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,870
I always vote no on school bonds.

287
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,770
Quid pro quo baby.
What is quid pro quo me?

288
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,830
Where the fuck is it?

289
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:43,831
Quid pro quo meaning I love that
everybody else is dumb as me.

290
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,600
A favor or advantage granted or
expected in return for something.

291
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,240
Ah, that doesn't get me any closer
to understanding it. Quid pro quo.

292
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,360
Jesus fucking Christ. What it,
what am I on law and order here?

293
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,840
Quid pro quo means and
escape and exchange of goods,

294
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:07,841
goods or services where one transfer
is contingent upon the other English

295
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,960
speakers. Often is this tit for
tat? Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ.

296
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,880
English speakers often use the
term to me a favor for a favor.

297
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,110
Phrases with similar means would include
give and take tit for tat and you

298
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,610
scratch my back. I'll
scratch yours. Quid pro quo.

299
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:28,490
Agha sets the fucking snooty
way of saying that shit.

300
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,110
Let's go back to close the borders
here so I can try to figure out what is

301
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:36,830
fucking point is. Oh, I get it. Close the
fucking borders and then I'll fucking,

302
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,890
then I'll, I'll give money to this
side. I see what the guy saying.

303
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,220
I don't know if it's right or not.
Alright, fuck politics. All right.

304
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:46,220
You know what I try.
I fucking tried.

305
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,920
All freckles has flipped
out about technology and I
figured out how to watch the

306
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:57,921
NHL on my phone because so many in the
room knew how to do it and they walked me

307
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,560
through it and at one point I
started to get upset because they go,

308
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,520
it's not going on. He goes,
what do you mean it's not going?

309
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:04,331
And that's supposed to go on down.

310
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:07,060
And I go and then I started getting mad
about why would it go? Why, why, why,

311
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,250
why would it get on?
It's me if I'm fucking on edge.

312
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:12,630
Just brought it down and bring it down.
Bring it down. You know what I mean?

313
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,230
Like you ever see somebody like revving
up the engine ready to do a burnout.

314
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,010
Then I brought it all the way down,
you know,

315
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,540
before the tire stopped moving and I
realized that was not the tires I was

316
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,920
actually burning up the clutch.

317
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,070
It's one of the most disgusting things
you'll ever see is somebody trying to do

318
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:34,020
a fucking burnout. And I don't know what
happens. I still don't quite understand.

319
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:37,380
I've never done one. I just never
wanted to beat the shit out of my car.

320
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,480
I basically get it with a stick shift.

321
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,750
I don't know how you do
it with an automatic, I've
watched fucking the videos,

322
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,700
but it's basically you get your
premiums up, you let the clutch out,

323
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,300
and then you stomp on the fucking break.
See,

324
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:53,550
your tires are already fucking going.
But somehow if you fucked that up,

325
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,350
you let the clutch out. And you've
revving the engine and Jan, Jan, Jan,

326
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:02,180
Jan, your tires aren't fucking moving
and you burn out your clutch and it's,

327
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I don't know what that smells like,
but the smoke is evil looking. Um,

328
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,230
all right, let's move on here. Oh,

329
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,830
did anybody watched the
Patriots game yesterday? Clear.

330
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,960
Get over there and lay down every always
and about you. Go on, go lay down,

331
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,913
go lay down.

332
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,350
I can't even fucking begin to
tell you how much I enjoyed that.

333
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,360
The fact that the fucking
patriots beat the pills yesterday.

334
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:35,361
I didn't say this because I take
off beforehand because I take a nod.

335
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,150
I get what bill Bellacheck does in
his press conferences where he's like,

336
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm not going to say anything
negative about anybody.

337
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,630
I'm not going to give you any
advantages because you fucking fat.

338
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:49,440
Cats in the media are going to take this
and give bulletin board material for

339
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,120
the other team.
I got to tell you,

340
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,420
watching the fucking buffalo
bills and we played them,

341
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,080
we had a third string quarterback with
a broken fucking hand or whatever the

342
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:58,920
fuck was wrong with them.

343
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,160
How they got in his face before the game
with such a Bush League fucking move to

344
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,110
the point like I've always liked buffalo.
I might be done with that franchise.

345
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,500
Like I used to give a shit. Ah,
you know, they lost four in a row.

346
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:18,030
Now I'm just like, you know
what? Fuck them. You know,

347
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,560
it's like you're that insecure that
you're not going to win the fucking game.

348
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:25,230
That you got to try to pull some shit
like that. And I was just like that.

349
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:28,320
Then I was just thinking, you're like,
you know what? Two great things happen.

350
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:28,981
We lost.

351
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,070
So now we don't have to deal with the
pressure of the fucking undefeated season.

352
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:36,310
All of the extra media hype that comes.
If New England's going undefeated,

353
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,980
if you fucking Indianapolis with old
fucking, what the fuck's his name there,

354
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,960
Peyton Manning, you can be all the way
to 13 and owe nobody say nothing man.

355
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:50,590
They right down the street, them
cows. Right? So he took that away.

356
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,830
And then also I'm like the Patriots
are going to beat the shit out of this

357
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,050
fucking team the next time
because of that bullshit.

358
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,050
Cause I know in house they must
have talked about it and they go,

359
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:03,400
he get 41 fucking points. Whatever
the fuck we scored against.

360
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,390
You haven't said all that.

361
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,900
I'd like to say a lot of positive things
like tie Rod Taylor is like impossible

362
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:08,860
to fucking tackle.

363
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,490
I know the bills had a bunch of fucking
injuries and I'd make those excuses,

364
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,760
but they don't give a fuck
those fucking animals.

365
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,500
They don't give a shit.

366
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,100
They would talk at all kinds of
trash with third string quarterback.

367
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,910
Like they were coming out on the field
getting ready to lose another fucking

368
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,200
Superbowl. I love that. You fucking
ringless I love that you four three.

369
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,270
Hey Buffalo. We're on our way to the
playoffs. See you next year. Fuckos

370
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,540
wow,
I enjoyed

371
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,120
that.
I really fucking enjoyed that.

372
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,160
You know fucking Rex Ryan told
them to do it too. Oh God.

373
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:45,330
I've been waiting to go off on this.

374
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,140
You fucking get out there and you fucking
fucking fucking fucking cause we the

375
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,400
best fucking fucking in the
fucking EFC. Fucking east. Yeah.

376
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,500
Go have another fucking hero.
You're tub of shit.

377
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,870
If you want to talk about cheating, you
know we let a little air out of the ball.

378
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,810
He got fucking that dead stomach.
Gastric surgery.

379
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,510
He's not fees a fat fuck.
He cheated

380
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,240
letting air out of the ball.

381
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,090
He had a fucking choke out three quarters
of his stomach so you could actually

382
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:17,070
see his dick every once in
a while. Ah, sorry. Sorry.

383
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,890
Anyways, um, yeah, I and,

384
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:28,110
and I gotta tell you something else
to fucking watching this world series.

385
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,910
I've gone back and forth,

386
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,390
back and forth and back and forth about
who the fuck I'm rooting for. I mean,

387
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:33,871
how do you do it?

388
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:38,820
One team's waiting fucking
70 not quite 70 years, right?

389
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,560
68 years. Say what it
is yet. I'm 68 years.

390
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,610
The other team has even been the
fucker world series is 71 years.

391
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,160
And I know you guys think of a pill.
You're a fucking red sox fan.

392
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,180
How can we not for the cubs.

393
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:55,650
I was totally for the cubs until I saw
the 30 for 30 on on fucking apartment

394
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,260
and when I watched it, all of
their, hey, let's play too.

395
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,570
You know, hey, you know where the lovable
fucking losers. We always show up.

396
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:07,560
We just root for him.

397
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,370
All of that went out the window the way
that they fucking what the what they did

398
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:14,100
to their kid.
I just looked at that shit going like,

399
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,660
that's exactly what would have happened
if someone in Boston did that. New York,

400
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,010
Philly, Cleveland, these cubs fans
for all their fucking, you know,

401
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:28,011
Mr. Smith goes to watch Washington
fucking a apple pie and Chevrolet way that

402
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:32,280
they did. They're just like
us. They're fucking animals.

403
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,930
I'm not saying there is bad as bills.
Fans are that fucking franchise.

404
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,090
Those costs. The time I was wearing a
patriots hat, it was the bills, jets.

405
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:43,260
I was rooting for the bills.

406
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,510
I'm taking a piss in the bathroom and
pushed me from behind while I was taking

407
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,610
the piss.
What kind of a fucking coward?

408
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,240
Maybe there's a reason in the last
four and a fucking row, you know,

409
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,980
I used to think it was because a madly,

410
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,240
he was just too nice to win a fucking
Superbowl and he went up against Jimmy

411
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,290
Johnson. Let's get him some
hookers in a corvette. Right. Um,

412
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,220
and fucking whatever that other guy's
name is Jerry Jones with his real

413
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,860
housewife fucking looking face.
Good Lord.

414
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,310
The guy always looks like, you know, he,

415
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:23,990
she got like first degree burns on his
face or maybe like slightly like into the

416
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,820
second degrees, but he
was like, all right,

417
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,150
he refused medical treatment and he
just puts some savvy on his face. Um,

418
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,240
I know I'm going hard this week. I
don't know why. I have no idea why.

419
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,230
I'll tell you why. You know, why?

420
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:39,380
Cause last night I wanted to fucking
come home and do my God damn podcast,

421
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:44,060
but my wife, you know, wanting to
watch a scary movie. So I said,

422
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:47,890
okay, let's watch it. So we started
watching that, but they'll cut, took,

423
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,820
took whatever the fucking that thing is.
And I got about like,

424
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,660
I got about 40 minutes into their
movie and it's like, I mean,

425
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,240
I don't want to watch the rest of this.
All right.

426
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,240
I hate watching scary movies because I,
I buy in,

427
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,870
I fucking buy in and I'm just like,

428
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,460
I don't want to watch this
thing terrorizing this
woman in their kid for the

429
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,440
next fucking 90 God damn minutes.

430
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,590
Cause I know neither one of them is
going to die. And I'll eventually,

431
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,850
they're going to figure out how to put,

432
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:17,120
put Doka took back into the fucking thing
and then they're going to do something

433
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:19,820
with the book that lets me know that
there's going to be another one.

434
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,500
Cause they're always, you know, fucking
horror movies can never just fucking end.

435
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,510
You know what I mean?
Every one of them,

436
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,560
they got to get greedy like
Friday the 13th part fucking 97,

437
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,930
you know what I mean? Nightmare
on elm street. You know,

438
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,020
they did like 20 of those hell raiser,

439
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:43,790
15 evil dead parts six.
They just want to keep fucking going.

440
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,800
And, uh, I dunno, I just, I just don't
like fucking sitting there being,

441
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,060
having anxiety, you know?
And with each scene,

442
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,410
you think gradually going to
ramp it up the first time. Oh,

443
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:59,540
it's just a little bit of knocking and
then there's a shadow and then, you know,

444
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,250
I was just like,
this syncs going to,

445
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:04,160
I got a bad feeling this thing's going
to kill the dog and I don't want to

446
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,870
fucking see that.
All right.

447
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:08,750
They already foreshadowed in the book that
that's what's, what's going to happen.

448
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,520
You know, they kind of showed you
basically with the pop up book, fuck off.

449
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:16,250
If you think I'm ruining this, this,
it's this. It's like paint by numbers.

450
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,030
I every fucking one of them I get an
upset because I just hate, so I was like,

451
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't want to watch the rest of this.

452
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,400
So she ends up shutting it off and
then she's like fucking pissed.

453
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,910
She's like fucking pissed at me. And
it's just like, I like Westworld.

454
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,650
My wife doesn't give a
fuck about Westworld.

455
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,510
I'm still on episode two cause I mean,
I didn't want to fucking watch it.

456
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,344
She's like,
Nah,

457
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I want to watch the real housewives of
fucking saint or whatever the fuck it is.

458
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,920
So anyways,
let me get back to the cubs thing.

459
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,590
So right out of the gate,
not only is the country,

460
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,560
it seems for the,
for the Chicago cubs,

461
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,160
it's kind of having this vibe of this
foregone conclusion that they're kind of

462
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,090
going to win this thing.

463
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,700
So I have family or I had family
back in the day out in Ohio,

464
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,410
my grandmother worked for the
Cleveland Press, you know, and um,

465
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,460
way back in the day I had family, you
know, I just had family about their right.

466
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,720
And so growing up I kind of was,
you know,

467
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:23,490
I was always a red sox
fan, but, uh, you know,

468
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,750
I Kinda, you know, through my relatives
also kind of rooted for the Indians,

469
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,150
you know what I mean? Like, I
didn't, I didn't mind the Indians,

470
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,390
even though they were in our
division way back in the day, um,

471
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,110
that and the Tigers, you know what
I mean? Just cause of, of relatives,

472
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,380
cousins and all that shit.
So I was just like, you know,

473
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:43,680
I kinda like the fucking Indians
any now that Steve Bartman Shit,

474
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,060
like the level that they took that too.

475
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,170
That's exactly what would have happened
in Philly and all this shit if it,

476
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,420
if it happened out in la,
that poor kid he got killed.

477
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:52,520
Okay.

478
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,091
You know what I mean?

479
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:58,091
Or San Diego or Sacramento or Fresno
or one of these fucking lunatic fucking

480
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:02,780
cities out here where they take
sports Oakland way too seriously.

481
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,490
San Francisco, you know? Um,

482
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,510
so it made me just kind of
fucking sort of pull back.

483
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,630
And then also it's like I,
you know what,

484
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:21,680
I'm kind of over these fucking cities
that have two professional teams in one

485
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:26,150
sport.
It's like Chicago won a world series,

486
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:29,960
they won it in 2005 and that whole
fucking thing where it's like,

487
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,580
well that was just, there was for the
south side of the city, so, so what,

488
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,800
you need another one for the north side?

489
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,440
Fuck the white sox and the cubs at
this shit. If she, one of them wins,

490
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,450
just fucking jump on a subway or walk
three blocks downtown or uptown and join

491
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:51,350
the fucking parade already.
Same thing with the Yankees and the mets,

492
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,630
the Lakers and the clippers in everything
in fucking New York giants, jets,

493
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:01,330
Yankees meds, fucking rangers,
islanders, Nixon Nets.

494
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,440
Just fuck off with that shit already.
It's a New York team.

495
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,540
If they win by you championship hat and
go down there and just be happy that

496
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,300
especially in New York,
that you're so fucking filthy,

497
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:17,000
stinking fucking rich that you can have
eight teams or everybody else is doing,

498
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,040
doing back flips, that they just
have one in every sport. You know?

499
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,331
I know.

500
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,910
Isn't it amazing that New York has all
those fucking teams and they don't win

501
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:30,200
that much? You think that
Jesus Christ, you got eight,

502
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,020
eight at bats every fucking year.
The fucking Yankees,

503
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:39,970
I swear to God, I like the sugar daddy
of New York City. You know what I mean?

504
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,650
The giants are the son and everybody
else is getting read written out of the

505
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:48,220
will. That's basically how it
works with the sports in New York.

506
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,800
Do you know what New York should get
three teams in every fucking city.

507
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:55,150
Maybe they could fucking do something
other than the Yankees and the giants.

508
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:56,560
I have totally fucking respect for them.

509
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,670
But Jesus Christ the fucking next
should combine with the nets, you know,

510
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,460
make like a fucking dream team.
And those two shits shows,

511
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,170
same thing with the Rangers
in the islanders. You know,

512
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,660
I dunno the jets and the mets,
I don't know what they should do.

513
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:14,490
They should both retire and they
should start playing badminton. Um,

514
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,350
oh chase spelled. Um, so anyways,

515
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:20,030
so I'm really fucking sitting
there and I'm unloving,

516
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,910
seen Terry Francona killing it and it
gets all the way up to three games to one.

517
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,213
All right.

518
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,530
And I dunno, something happened.
Okay. My Cleveland friends,

519
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,800
Comedians,
one of them in particular just starts,

520
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:40,650
he's just talking all this shit in
Blahblahblahblahblah and he starts to got,

521
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,130
we won the basketball, now we're going
to win the baseball. Then you know,

522
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:46,110
you watch,
we're going on a fucking run,

523
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,030
your Yada with no fucking respect that
he's talking to a fan from Boston.

524
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,920
You know what I mean? It's just like, oh,

525
00:30:51,921 --> 00:30:54,280
you're going to win two in one
fucking year. Yeah, we did that.

526
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,760
We did that a couple of times
and then we went every fucking,

527
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,180
we did all of this other shit. I'm not
fucking throwing that in your face.

528
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,790
I'm always the guy going like Anna.

529
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:08,010
Now they'll say they
don't know the team stuff.

530
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,340
I never believe we're going to do
it until we do it and then we do.

531
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,950
Then I'm fucking psyched.
And you'd go back to my podcast.

532
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:16,220
I wasn't even a country beach Seattle.

533
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,580
So these guys are acting like such
fucking cunts. You know what I mean?

534
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,050
Oh, we got Luke Brian. We're
going to fucking do it again
this year. All the Brown.

535
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,220
Oh, you mean the guy that you guys all
burned his Jersey and you're all done with

536
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,250
first. He called that one. Oh,
Paul Versey called that one.

537
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,010
Paul Versey fucking when he was in Miami
and he's Cleveland fans were saying,

538
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:42,770
fuck that guy. Blahblahblahblah
first. He said to him,

539
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:46,430
you guys are all going to be sucking
his dick when he comes back to town.

540
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:50,090
And they were like, no way. That's
never gonna happen while it's happening.

541
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,910
That whole city's on their fucking nice.

542
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,570
So anyways,

543
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,660
so at some point after they went up three
games to one, I went back to the cubs.

544
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,853
The reality is,

545
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,010
is I don't give a shit who wins this
fucking thing because it's going to be

546
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:11,750
great for one city. It's going to
be devastating for the other city.

547
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,490
Um, obviously. But so here's the deal.

548
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,270
This is what's at stake with this
world series. If the cubs win,

549
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,000
the Indians become the cubs.

550
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,990
They become the ones that have gone
the fucking longest. All right?

551
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,460
So they can't fucking lose.
All right? If Cleveland wins,

552
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,600
all right? Not only the
cubs, still the cubs,

553
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,140
as far as my quick research research
showed me the next people in line for

554
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:46,331
second place would be the cult 40 fives
slash Houston Astros that started in

555
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,910
1962

556
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,670
in 1962 the Chicago cubs,

557
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,620
we're already 54 years into their drought.

558
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:01,980
Yeah.

559
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,813
Okay.

560
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:07,830
1962 is 54 years from where
the fuck we are right now.

561
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,580
Right.

562
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,580
So the Astros' are 54 years into their
drought where the cubs were in 1962 and

563
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:18,470
the cubs are now twice
that at one oh eight.

564
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,180
I don't know what the fuck that means.

565
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,810
Does that mean that you should
go play the lottery right now?

566
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,210
54 62 one zero eight.

567
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,060
I have no idea what that fucking means.
It's just, you know, one of those,

568
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:33,320
one of those number things.
Um,

569
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,710
I gotta tell you,
uh,

570
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,510
it's almost fitting that if
the cubs are gonna win it,

571
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:46,020
that they would torture their fucking
fans to this level and it's fitting that

572
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,830
if the Indians were going to lose it,

573
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:52,120
they would go up three to one to
lift their fucking teams hopes.

574
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,760
This is why I think
the cubs are gonna win.

575
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,010
If Terry Francona wasn't in the dug out
the master, by the way, he, he needs,

576
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:04,000
that guy needs a,
a nickname like the assassin.

577
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,920
He needs like a boxer nickname,
like lights out James Tony,

578
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,103
you know,

579
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,550
for the execution or Bernard Hopkins
that he needs a name like that.

580
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,720
It's just said he doesn't look like that.
But that's exactly what that guy is.

581
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,140
All right.
But what I'm saying is

582
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,780
because of what these teams
have done to their fans,

583
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:32,700
it would be fitting that the fucking
cubs wouldn't just go in and win the

584
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:37,200
fucking thing. So their fans could just
relax and finally enjoy. Oh series.

585
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,020
They would have to go down three
to one before they'd come back.

586
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,630
And then Cleveland couldn't
just lose the series.

587
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:44,700
They'd have to go up three games to one.

588
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,180
Okay?

589
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,910
So this is what's crazy about three gear
up, three games to one, and you're like,

590
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:49,810
holy fuck,

591
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,980
you're starting to take the wire off the
champagne bottle at that point. Right?

592
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,180
But then all of a sudden you fucking
lose game five and just instantly,

593
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,180
it's like, holy fuck, if we lose
the next one, it's all tied up.

594
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,860
So now the pressure is on
the Indians. I'll tell you,
the cubs are going in there.

595
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:08,790
They're playing loose.

596
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,720
They got nothing to lose other
than fucking 108 year drought.

597
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,343
Okay?

598
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,950
I don't know who's on the mound.
I don't know what. But, um,

599
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,100
I'm going to say the obvious
cubs gotta go. They gotta stick,

600
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,730
got a score early and make the
fucking Indians tighten up.

601
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,770
That's what the fuck they got to do.
Or a,

602
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,820
that's what's going to happen in game six.

603
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,270
Either the cubs are going to score early.
Indians fucking tighten up.

604
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:39,910
Okay.

605
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,110
And then lose a game and then we get a
game seven. Or if the Indians go up early,

606
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:48,660
it's going to be a bloodbath.
It's going to be a shit show. Um,

607
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,230
okay.

608
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm hoping the first thing
happens because I want to see,

609
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,960
I want to see a game seven against a
team that hasn't won an hundred and eight

610
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:03,790
years in a team that hasn't won it.
Fucking, uh, what is it? 68 fucking years?

611
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,080
68. So adorable to a red sox fan.
That's fucking hilarious. I am,

612
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,760
I don't give a fuck. That's like this.
Whether we were there in like the 70s,

613
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:14,590
right? What was 68 for us?
I was at the met, let's see,

614
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:19,570
1918 to 1978.
That's 60 years,

615
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,530
right? Uh, yeah. 86.

616
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:29,040
I was 1986. So you're just didn't
bill Buckner go fuck yourselves.

617
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,160
You know,
you just did.

618
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,160
Bacter as far as where I'm coming from,
you got to go another fucking,

619
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,980
uh,
another 18 years to 2004.

620
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,390
So I guess I won't root for the Indians.
Nah, I can't. I fucking, I don't know.

621
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,540
My relatives got me into the Indians.
I don't know what to dope.

622
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,920
I don't know who to root for here.
You know,

623
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,500
I'm rooting for farm room for game seven
route for game seven and then they're

624
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:57,740
going to go up against each other and
one team is finally going to win that

625
00:36:57,741 --> 00:37:00,140
critical game seven and get
the monkey off their back.

626
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,250
And then another one is just going to
add another giant cinder block right on

627
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:06,680
the fucking heart. So they've
fans, it's kind of, Oh God,

628
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,590
this one has trained right.
Written all over it. All right.

629
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:13,460
Let me read a little bit of
fucking average advertising
art. Jesus. The appeal.

630
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:17,210
You didn't fucking copy and paste them.
Um,

631
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,690
yeah.

632
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,000
I hope by the way you guys are
watching the series because it's,

633
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:25,000
it's been unbelievable. What a
fucking great series. It's bad. Um,

634
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,570
oh Christ, what am I doing? Come on
bill. Click here. Click there. All right.

635
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:35,410
How many do we got here? All right. Ah,
okay. Here we go. Oh, Lou crate everybody.

636
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:39,850
Gimme the loot. Are you
looking for gear, collectibles,

637
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:43,540
housewares and more and more,
um,

638
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,430
from your favorite pop culture franchise?
We've got you covered.

639
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:53,320
This is how like hipsters and I,
I guess nerds get laid, you know,

640
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:57,730
this is all about loot crates
should be like nerd crate, you know,

641
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,720
and just be like a pocket pussy in there
or something. Uh, we've got you covered.

642
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:06,460
Loot crate offers a range of Geek and
Gamer items for less than $20 a month.

643
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,530
Gamers are weird. They're either total
nerds or they are like fucking jocks.

644
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:12,370
Have you noticed that?

645
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:13,670
Okay.

646
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,390
Like video games kind of
transcend like the whole, uh,

647
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,930
what was it Matthew Broderick movie
war games sort of thing. You know,

648
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,660
we get the underwear on top
of your head and you're like

649
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,740
trying to make a woman
through your computer rather
than just fucking getting a

650
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:31,950
hooker. Like a normal kid who plays sports
with hand eye coordination. You just,

651
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,390
you know, cause what it is as nerds don't
know how to flag down a hooker like,

652
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,120
or an athlete, you know, sends the
signal to his athletic hand, you know,

653
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,170
and just brings him in. All right. You
want to bring your loop to the next level.

654
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:47,890
Get a bigger box with even
bigger loop with loot crate DX.

655
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,300
If you're more than the tie.

656
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:52,900
I would love to see the sizes of these
fucking tee shirts. What do they start at?

657
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,183
Um,

658
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,790
I just picture everybody
goes to comic con.

659
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,800
Looks like a young Burt
for Lanch Bruce for land.

660
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:03,940
She was at fucking guy
with the red glasses.

661
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,350
Who thinks he's fucking hilarious and
writes all the speeches for people.

662
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,450
Um, he's really the craft of writing
jokes and he has those Sally Jessy Raphael

663
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,890
glasses. Um, if you're more than,
than the type to where your Geeky,

664

know where the wild things are,

665
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,560
like the way he has his hair and shit.
Um,

666
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,020
if you're more than the type to where
you're geeky heart on your sleeve than Lou

667
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,160

Go to dollar shave club.com/bird that's
dollar shave club.com/burn and it's

708
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:56,900
actually great shit.
You know what I mean?

709
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,810
You look and smell great when you
go on a date. You know what I mean?

710
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,630
That's good for the ladies.
You know,

711
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,200
maybe there'll be a little less upset
and you're going to make your move that

712
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:11,120
night. Um, all right, what
do I want to talk about now?

713
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,360
Let's go. Let's go to, uh,
oh. I went down to, um,

714
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,630
I went down to lago last night.

715
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,180
Been slugging through
my new fucking bullshit,

716
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,330
trying to see where the, uh, the
new hours going to come from.

717
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,530
And uh, I dunno. We'll see. We'll see.

718
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:33,080
All I know is I don't have any
fucking road gigs till February,

719
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,030
so I can just totally chill out.

720
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,240
I've been working out and eating
like a fucking animal though.

721
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,990
You know what made this Pumpkin
bread and shit? You know,

722
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,700
Rogan gave me some of the Elk Burger.

723
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:46,790
I made it late last night and then it
has slice of Pumpkin bread after it.

724
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:51,590
So it's weird. It's like I'm in really
good shape, but I also got this belly. Um,

725
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,780
but uh,
I dunno,

726
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,940
like I love the fucking holidays and
to me the holidays is your throat down,

727
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:03,020
your cook. You make stuff for your
friends. You know what I mean? Fuck that.

728
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:07,100
I'm not getting a fucking bottle
of champagne. You know what?

729
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,450
I'm going to finish this fucking podcast
and I'm going to go and make some

730
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,860
Goddamn pumpkin bread and
write and I'll show my wife.

731
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,920
I'll show her who's boss,
by the way,

732
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:20,130
you guys really enjoyed that
two hour podcast, Huh? Um,

733
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,600
I think we just went into a zone.

734
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,620
A two hour podcast is a long ass fucking
time and unless you hanging with Joe

735
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,390
Rogan, uh, who I hung out
within a, finally got him on
the podcast last Thursday.

736
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:33,120
If you missed it once again,

737
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,410
he has a new amazing standup
special called triggered. Um,

738
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,470
we talked about everything from hunting
elk and wild fucking bore to uh,

739
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,090
working out UFC shit, election
stuff, stand up comedy.

740
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,610
Um, just had a great fucking time. Um,
it's about his specialist on Netflix,

741
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:57,480
so definitely check it out if you
get a chance. And uh, all right,

742
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:01,650
let's get back to, um,
let's get back to the, uh,

743
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,330
the podcast here. Oh, F
one action in f one action.

744
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,270
I totally missed the fucking race, but I
read up on it. Lewis Hamilton wins again.

745
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:14,070
For those of you sort of keeping score,
now that I've been keeping score, um,

746
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,000
you get 25 points.
If you win 18th or second 15th.

747
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:22,990
The third then is 12, 10,
eight, six, four, two, one,
right? That's the top, bottom,

748
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,590
top, fucking 10 works. Um, Cleo,

749
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,580
you could not be more adorable right
now and what it is she wants fod.

750
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,180
I got up a little bit to do this podcast.
So now she's come over,

751
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,070
she sat down next to me,

752
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:40,071
her ears are down and she's rested her
head on my arm and she's just staring at

753
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,480
me like,
I don't know what's going on.

754
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,700
All right, today I've got another 20
minutes. Just fucking relax. No, no, no,

755
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,730
no. Not coming up on the couch. Go on.
Go lay down. Go lay down. Go lay down.

756
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,570
Up.
Get out of here please.

757
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,570
Yeah.

758
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,340
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
again? It get out of here. Cleo.

759
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:09,930
Get off of the couch. Way
down. Oh, now she's needy.

760
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,450
All right.
Anyways,

761
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,830
so Rosberg had a fucking league
and the last two fucking racist.

762
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:18,000
Hamilton is one boat.

763
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,590
So he's shaved 14 fucking
points off of the lead.

764
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,830
All fucking Nico had to do
is fucking win one more race.

765
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:29,160
I felt if he could have won it yesterday,
he could have wrap this thing up.

766
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:33,180
I'm kind of glad that he didn't cause I
want to see the person fucking wrap it

767
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:37,650
up. Um, so the next race
I believe is in Brazil,

768
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,530
which is not until November 13th.

769
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,230
And I apologize to a f one fans because
I know I got into this shit and then

770
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:49,530
I've just dropped the ball and like
the last four or five ones, but I,

771
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:53,760
I'm fucking living in this God damn
house. I fucked up. I forgot that,

772
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,170
that it was this week and that I actually
figured out through apple TV or some

773
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:03,171
shit that I patiently worked my way
through and actually figured out that I

774
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:08,430
could actually get, uh, was an NBC
sports. Is that the name of the channel?

775
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,070
And I could have watched the game.
She could watch the race.

776
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:12,300
So I got to go home today,

777
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,770
my house around the fucking
corner tape that fucking thing.

778
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,690
By the way, the kitchen is just come to a
grinding fucking halt. I don't know why,

779
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:25,680
but there's still telling us that they
gonna Finish on fucking time. So whatever,

780
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,390
whatever, I'm sure they will
fucking sure they will. All right,

781
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:34,590
let's get out of this. Let's, let's
do some, uh, can I talk about now?

782
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:39,420
Did you guys watch Clemson,
Florida? Fucking amazing
game. I also watched the, uh,

783
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,150
my Clemson, Florida, Florida state.

784
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,100
Then I also watched a Florida
fucking Georgia and, you know,

785
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,810
I was thinking when I first saw it, I was
just like, man, I got to go to that game.

786
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:50,370
I got to go to that game of Jacksonville.

787
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,150
The biggest outdoor cocktail party in
the world is they say, and I'm like,

788
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:56,550
I bet the fans are cool with each
other. They're fucking, you know,

789
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:59,100
cause it's a neutral site,
you know,

790
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:01,980
everybody's just psyched to be
away from their house. Sorry,

791
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,460
I'm fucking you on or near,
um,

792
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,860
Georgia scores first they cut to
the Georgia fans in the stands.

793
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:12,420
And I clearly see this guy turned around
not facing the field and just giving

794
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:16,470
the finger to the Florida fans
above them. And I'm just like, wow.

795
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,840
All right. It's at that level. Okay, it's
a dead fucking level. I die. You know,

796
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:24,240
I really had no interest in
going to that game. I'd want,

797
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,350
I want to go to the swamp.

798
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,770
And I've been to what Georgia home game
between the hedges and I've been to a

799
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:33,730
Jacksonville verse Bangles Games.
So I felt like I'd been to that stadium.

800
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,180
But after seeing it was like fuck when
it looks like fun and I always have a

801
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:40,030
great time at Jacksonville.
Everybody shits on Jacksonville.

802
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,940
It's a good fucking time. If you
take the stick out of your ass, um,

803
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,100
you can go to a gun range,

804
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,400
shoot guns with the without the fucking
silence around. All right, clear.

805
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,370
The only thing I'm going to do is just
sit here and pet you as I do the rest of

806
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:56,230
this. All right. All
right, Westwood Dear Bill.

807
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,790
Uh, glad you love Westworld.
For some reason he wrote
Westwood and the beginning.

808
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,100
Glad you love Westworld.
Uh,

809
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:07,420
I look forward to hearing your thoughts
and the rest of the season season. Um,

810
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:10,150
if you like that and you're
looking for a great movie to watch,

811
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,040
checkout the 13th floor.

812
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,400
It came out in the late nineties
and deals with similar themes.

813
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,620
Are you into reading fan theories?

814
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,980
A common one now that is a non spoiler
is that Ed Harris's character and the

815
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:28,210
nice guy who's new to the park or the
same person and other claims that it's

816
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:33,100
actually all on Mars. Oh, for Westworld.

817
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,590
Yeah. Well I got to get caught
up before people ruined shit.

818
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,180
I'll definitely check out

819
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,690
the 13th floor and I think I'm
going to watch an episode up.

820
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:44,740
So three of Westworld because I think
they're up to five at this point.

821
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,310
I'm going to watch that today and I'm
going to get caught up. And uh, you know,

822
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:51,520
cause my wife fucking cheated on
me with TV. You know what I mean?

823
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,310
When you guys have your shows,
right?

824
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,160
We watched that show below deck
with a yacht scan on their right.

825
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,240
And uh,
it's just,

826
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:04,780
it's a reality show that we can both watch
because they're always in the fucking

827
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:07,960
Mediterranean. They got a fucking yacht.
It's the Shit we always think, ah,

828
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,550
we should do that.
It'd be fucking awesome.

829
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:13,030
And then you look up the prices and it's
like the price of a house to rent one

830
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:14,170
of those fucking things.

831
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,660
You gotta be like Beyonce and Jay z,

832
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:23,470
like both of you can sell out the Rosebowl
on any given fucking night. You know,

833
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,470
you gotta be to that level
of wealth to fucking justify.

834
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,890
Do you realize that two of
them almost worth $1 billion.

835
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,450
So for then the blow 250 grand
on a fucking yacht is like,

836
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,550
let's say you're worth $100 million.
If you're with $100 million,

837
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:44,500
250 grand is like 0.25% of your money,
right?

838
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:47,290
Cause a million is like 1%, right?
So I don't know how to work that out.

839
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,300
It's like 25% of 1% whatever
the fuck that is of your money.

840
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:58,110
And there were 10 times set so
that that's like you and I go, hey,

841
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,870
you want a yacht for a week and you
take a penny out of your pocket and you

842
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:05,560
break it into four fucking pieces and
just hand it to them. Hey, you go,

843
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,440
there you go. Yeah, we'd like,
uh, all the amenities. Um,

844
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,910
anyways, I will definitely
be, uh, be checking that out.

845
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,860
Ed Harris is like,
as always,

846
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:22,570
as always one of the greatest
actors of all fucking time. Um,

847
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,960
I'll watch anything that that guy's,
and I swear to God,

848
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:30,080
the only thing I never saw his
when he was the one where, Oh God,

849
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,343
fuck,

850
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,700
I'm the only one I never saw was the one
when he played the painter and that got

851
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:43,040
nominated or he got nominated for an
Oscar. So I still haven't seen that once.

852
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,780
I got to check that out.
All right.

853
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,390
Old Toys a dear Billy potato head.

854
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,890
I love that.
That's a good one.

855
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,040
Cause that kind of shits on my Irish
heritage and then also makes fun of the

856
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:59,900
shape of my head. Um, if,
if, if you ever have kids,

857
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,250
will you try and expose them to
toys that you enjoyed as a child?

858
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:09,440
You strike me as a matchbox car kid.
I don't force the toys of my childhood,

859
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,274
all my kids,

860
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,930
but I've put a couple army men in their
general area to give them a chance to

861
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:19,520
play like I did. I am a huge, um, uh,

862
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:23,630
Greer of that proponent of that
opponent, of that proponent. Oh,

863
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:27,350
that's what proponent means you're pro,
right. I never knew what that meant.

864
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,700
I just kind of figured that
out. Oh, Ponant proponent.

865
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:36,400
Oh, pumpkin bread pro
pumpkin bread. I get it. Um,

866
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,580
yeah, absolutely. I absolutely,

867
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,160
I absolutely will do that.
Um,

868
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:48,140
my big thing is playing catch and uh,
you know,

869
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,420
I'm going to buy a fucking,
I'm going to buy a, uh,

870
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:59,510
a lefty glove for myself is what I'm
going to do because I can throw a little

871
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:02,990
bit with my left hand and rather than
just sitting there firing it into my kid,

872
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,380
I, I'd fucking a, I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna go with the left hand.

873
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,690
We were doing that yesterday.
We had a football, right.

874
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,710
He's placed in where we're renting
here has his fucking great pool.

875
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,740
So it was halftime of the Florida game.
We're out there smoking cigars and shit.

876
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,810
And we finished that up. We've got the
game turned up loud. So the game became,

877
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:23,960
there was four guys, right? So he
had two on one side of the pool too,

878
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:27,230
on the other side of the pool. So you
had to throw with your opposite hand,

879
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:31,490
first person that sent it into the pool
or if he had a catchable ball and it

880
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:36,110
fell into the pool was uh, I dunno,
whatever the fuck it was. It was,

881
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,320
was that thing,

882
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,450
that word you can't fucking say anymore
because everybody gets offended and it's

883
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,450
not a racial slur, but it is, you
know, you know, you know the word,

884
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,050
nobody said it, but we all knew we had,
you know, without saying, you know,

885
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:55,610
we're older guys, like that's what
it means. Um, so anyways, uh, yeah,

886
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:58,190
I would definitely do that. I
was, I was not a matchbox car kid.

887
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,320
I W I was Corgi cars.

888
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,890
We used to call them core g cause we
didn't know it was pronounced Corgi until

889
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:04,551
we got older.

890
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:08,180
And I'm so old that I remember when they
had rubber wheels on them and I had the

891
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:10,970
giant oil truck. I was big,
I had all the race cars,

892
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,830
I had the Johnny players special,

893
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:18,190
I had the Jackie Steward Elf car and
my mother doesn't throw out shit.

894
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:22,400
So I still have all of them. Um,
I had one of those, you know,

895
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,010
that kind of racing where the car
just looks like a giant doorstop.

896
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,590
Uh, it wasn't Formula One. It
wasn't, it's not an Indy car racing.

897
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:35,340
It's not open wheel. It, you know what
the car looks like, a water slide.

898
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:38,340
Like you could, you could slide from
the fin all the way down to the front.

899
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:43,320
I don't know what kind. I had a
white and red, one of those, uh,

900
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,650
Lincoln logs,
Lego Lego blocks.

901
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,690
Um,

902
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:50,620
okay.

903
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,660
You know, stuff like that. I think it's
big to not have to keep your kids. Okay.

904
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,203
You know,

905
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:01,000
I don't know the guy to get
them outside and you got to,

906
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:04,600
you got to keep them in their own. Like
I don't, I, I have such a hatred of,

907
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:08,560
of computers and iPads
and all of that shit. Um,

908
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,270
and kids just love them. I mean,
they go up to it like, you know,

909
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:17,080
liquid television type of shit.
You know, back in the day, the MTV,

910
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:21,370
I remember that graphic. I used to just
make me want to sit down and watch it. Um,

911
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,010
I dunno, Mr Potato head. I don't know
about that. Definitely like board games.

912
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,070
I think it'd be fun playing cards.

913
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,090
I think it's cool to expose
your kids to that, you know,

914
00:54:34,091 --> 00:54:37,960
so they have like that old school shit.
Like it wasn't always the greatest.

915
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:42,430
Like when like for me,
if I met, uh, some woman,

916
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:47,140
I took her out on a date and she had,
she had some old school stuff about her,

917
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,590
you know what I mean? That, that
stuff that was sort of passed down.

918
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,820
I think that's really like a cool
thing. And I think, uh, like some shit,

919
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:59,500
like playing cards, playing
catch, like going outside,

920
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:03,310
it's just like, you know, riding bicycles,

921
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,610
just like all that shit is going away.
And um,

922
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,810
I'm not one of these old people that
I look at young kids and injury. Like,

923
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:13,990
you know, what are they
doing today? They're fucking
nuts. And these kids today,

924
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:16,830
they don't get it. And it's just like, um,

925
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:22,110
I totally get why they're doing it
because I had to tap out grand theft auto

926
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,800
three in like 2003 or 2004 Id.

927
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,820
I unplugged my playstation and
stick it in the back of the closet.

928
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,070
I literally just one day,
it was like the fifth day in a row,

929
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:38,560
I was just playing all day
long and I could not stop.

930
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,920
I had already beat the game, I got
the cheats, I did all of that shit.

931
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,210
And then I was just going on rampages
every night just shooting up to city.

932
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:51,050
And um,
I just,

933
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,593
you know,

934
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,550
I kinda just lost everything else in my
life that wasn't writing jokes and all

935
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:01,790
that shit.
So that was like 13 years ago.

936
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,780
So I can't imagine how
amazing the Games are.

937
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,760
And um,

938
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,490
like the virtual reality
goggles and all of that shit,

939
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:17,491
I can't even fucking imagine like how you
get your kid to go in the backyard and

940
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:22,000
just have a game of catch back. To me,
that's the greatest fucking thing ever.

941
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:26,350
I think it's a great to
communicate with your kid,

942
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,190
you know what I mean? Cause it's like you
don't, that's another activity going on,

943
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,650
so they're not really paying attention.

944
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:35,980
You can praise him when they're doing
well, you know, build up their confidence.

945
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,610
And then you just slide into how's
it going at school, you know,

946
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:41,650
and then you just read them third.
It's going great. All right,

947
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:44,090
so it's going good to be here. Same
kind of looked down and I, you know,

948
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:44,950
it's all right.
Oh,

949
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,350
it's a matter of what's going on
and they can kind of open up to you.

950
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,990
I think it's like a great way to,
uh,

951
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,200
I think it's really important
early on to be able to do that.

952
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,460
To have your kid be able to come to you
if they have a fucking problem is a,

953
00:56:58,461 --> 00:57:00,280
a is a huge thing. But, um,

954
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,940
how you sit there with a
glove and a ball and uh,

955
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:10,140
how that competes with putting on
fucking reality glasses and you feel like

956
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:14,940
you're going to fucking base jump off of
a building or whatever the fuck they do.

957
00:57:14,941 --> 00:57:19,830
I don't know what the fuck they do with
those six. Um, yeah, that's a, uh, that's,

958
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,640
that's a difficult, that's a difficult
one. I love Lincoln logs. I lie.

959
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,250
He didn't like Lego blocks.
She stepped on him and your bare feet,

960
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:29,670
they fucking hurt. Not the Lincoln logs.
Didn't, but like that plastic shit.

961
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:33,420
I wasn't into that as much as,
uh, the Lincoln logs are cool.

962
00:57:33,421 --> 00:57:37,950
We used to fucking build those things.
We build houses and then we would,

963
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,740
you know what their Corgi Corgi car,
Corgi cars,

964
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:43,170
wherever the fuck are they called,
drive him around.

965
00:57:43,171 --> 00:57:45,540
We'd have traffic jams and
all of that type of shit.

966
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,270
We had names for everybody
that drove the cars.

967
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:53,940
I remember I had all the
fucking race cars and in all my,

968
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,110
uh,
it's weird.

969
00:57:55,111 --> 00:57:58,410
They drove like a formula one car to
work and then they drove the trucks.

970
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,240
I had trucks and racing cars.

971
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,940
Then my other brother,
who's a total fucking gearhead,

972
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,110
he actually liked like
the real looking cars,

973
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,680
like a Volkswagen bug,
like a station wagon.

974
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:18,030
Like he wanted to look like the cars that
you could actually fucking drive. Um,

975
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,230
I know my mother didn't throw all of
those out. Jesus Christ is fucking nuts.

976
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:25,110
They're all up in the attic
somewhere. All right. Election Bill.

977
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:27,990
The election is right around the
corner. A couple of weeks ago. You,

978
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:32,760
you'll eulogize the great barrier reef.
Any last words for this election?

979
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:38,040
Uh, not the country as a whole because
I don't think it will fall apart by an

980
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:38,580
imagined.

981
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,570
This has exposed the side of our country
that we've been able to keep under

982
00:58:42,571 --> 00:58:43,680
wraps for awhile,

983
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:47,940
which is that no one ever pays attention
to anything unless it's an easy talking

984
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,774
point.

985
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,043
MMM.

986
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,110
Not everything is more fucked up
than we know or would like to admit.

987
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:57,200
What's the worst thing that will
happen if either candidate wins?

988
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,030
Uh,

989
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,320
well,
if Trump wins,

990
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,260
the worst thing is we're going to have
to listen to all these European countries

991
00:59:03,261 --> 00:59:07,160
talk about how dumb Americans are,
especially people in England.

992
00:59:07,161 --> 00:59:09,020
And I just want to say to them like,
you know what,

993
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,830
what if you threw out the
person every 48 years?

994
00:59:12,831 --> 00:59:15,560
And I would love to see what the fuck
you end up with. You know what I mean?

995
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:19,770
Some years it's just not a
good draft. If fucking, uh,

996
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:24,740
whatever the fuck his is. Tony Blair,
that guy's been in there since Bush.

997
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,810
Not even saying that guy's good,

998
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:29,780
but you just get somebody in there and
they just stay there until they die.

999
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,090
Doesn't he have like Margaret Thatcher's
job? Oh, the original Hillary Clinton.

1000
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,000
Hillary Clinton can't even
see her fucking name. Wow.

1001
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:40,530
What's the worst that will happen?
Um,

1002
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,190
I dunno if Trump wasn't such a fucking
jerk off if he wasn't such a jerk off.

1003
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,570
It's really what the country needs.

1004
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:51,380
You need somebody who isn't a part
of the fucking system. You don't,

1005
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:53,300
but you just can't have
a guy like that in there.

1006
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:57,410
And then Hillary is just going
to be more of the fucking same.

1007
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,190
It's just going to keep driving
this country towards ruined.

1008
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,820
Do none of them talked about
the population problem?

1009
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,530
None of them talked about the
nationwide heroin epidemic.

1010
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,990
None of them talked about
genetically altered food.

1011
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,930
None of them talked about
fucking global warming.

1012
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,500
Maybe they touched on it for a second.
They haven't said Shit.

1013
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,440
They're not going to do anything. None
of. I'm going to try to stop the banks,

1014
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,710
put them in fucking line that building
another real estate bubble. I'll tell you,

1015
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:25,670
it's fucking hilarious out here is
they are building up la like I've never

1016
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:26,504
fucking seen.

1017
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,640
They bought up the house of Blues right
across the street from the fucking, um,

1018
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,480
from the fucking uh, uh, comedy store.

1019
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,840
They play like $28 million for the thing.
They're going to put these,

1020
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:43,070
these high rise fucking million dollar
multimillion dollar fucking condos in

1021
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:46,470
there. It's like, who the fuck's going
to afford to buy those things? All right,

1022
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,510
and this is the thing, after
2008, after we saw what happened,

1023
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,140
they fucking gave the house.
None of the bankers went to jail.

1024
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:56,600
They gave him the houses back so
they could do it all over again.

1025
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,160
They're building another fucking bubble
and I'm already calling it right now by

1026
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:04,040
fucking 20, 21, 20, 22 or some shit,

1027
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,550
there is going to be a bunch
of empty fucking condo.

1028
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:11,410
Fucking high rises going along
the sunset stripped and they have,

1029
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,340
they've knocked down the rainbow room, the
Roxy, the wicks whiskey house of Blues,

1030
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,630
maybe the comedy store. They're going
to wipe out all of these fucking things.

1031
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,670
There's going to be
nobody in those buildings.

1032
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:24,560
And even if they are in those buildings,

1033
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:27,860
they going to have no fucking place to
go cause they knocked down all the cool

1034
01:01:27,861 --> 01:01:31,670
places to hang out on sunset strip.
It's so fucking stupid. You know,

1035
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:36,700
I was getting gas the other day and
another place on the sunset strip and this

1036
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,870
guy said, I said, hey, you
own the gas station. He goes,

1037
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:43,280
I wish I did this property just sold
for 14 million bucks. And you know,

1038
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:46,220
they're knocking down the two buildings
next to it and they're going to put up a

1039
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:50,390
fucking, you know, 170
unit fucking, I dunno,

1040
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,510
I just don't know where all these
people are going to becoming.

1041
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,770
That can afford to pay. I just don't
know where they're going to come from.

1042
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:02,210
Um, and from what I heard, you
know, at least the ones on Lassie,

1043
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:05,270
Annika that was like oil money,
you know,

1044
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:08,090
like Saudi Arabia and money came in
and they don't give a fuck. I mean,

1045
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:13,040
they get money forever. Um, I dunno.

1046
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:17,750
Uh, what's the worst thing
that will happen if either
candidate comes in is that

1047
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:21,030
they're not going to stop
what's already going on.

1048
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,420
And I gotta be honest with you, I
don't even think like, you know,

1049
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:26,460
all the Bernie Sanders and
all those types of people,

1050
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,790
you would literally need an army of
those people and then they would need

1051
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,370
bulletproof vests to fucking,

1052
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,830
that's how powerful corporations are.

1053
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:36,660
And that's how off the
fucking rails we are.

1054
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,153
MMM.

1055
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:39,560
I Dunno.

1056
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,760
Which is why I'm trying to focus on the
propositions and I wish if anybody can

1057
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:47,480
find a fucking website out there that
not only lets me know what I'm voting for

1058
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,670
but lets me know what is attached to it.

1059
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,390
Like cause who doesn't want to
improve the schools, you know?

1060
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:54,923
MMM.

1061
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,510
But you know, whenever they
have stuff like that, like, hey,

1062
01:02:58,511 --> 01:02:59,890
let's clean up the drinking water,

1063
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,860
then they attach all this
other evil shit underneath it.

1064
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,560
Um,
I don't know.

1065
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,470
I Dunno. It's, it's all very overwhelming.

1066
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:13,160
So it's so fucking overwhelming that
you're asking extend up comedian,

1067
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:16,730
what's going to happen or maybe you just
did cause you want to hear me make a

1068
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:20,570
fucking ass of myself. Um, all
right, here we go. Cool guy.

1069
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,950
Terrible in bed.

1070
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:23,400
Okay.

1071
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,010
Oh Jesus. All right. Uh,
dear Billy Bush bear.

1072
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,180
Uh, I'm a 20 year old
female college student. Um,

1073
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,190
I go to holy cross.

1074
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:41,250
Oh, in, oh, he said is I
go to holy cross. Oh, okay.

1075
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,680
I go to holy cross in Worcester.
Um,

1076
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,440
I had a boyfriend for the first three
years of college and now I'm single.

1077
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,920
I hooked up with a guy that I
didn't know was kind of an asshole.

1078
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,220
He sort of popular in seem friendly.
One drunken night.

1079
01:03:56,221 --> 01:04:01,020
I did the worst thing I
could do. Fed his ego. Um,

1080
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,980
had I known he was a moron in a pompous
Douche bag, I would not have done this.

1081
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,380
I'll save you the reasons
why he's a Douchebag,

1082
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:12,560
but just picture lame eighties preppy
bully who thinks he's God's gift.

1083
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:16,590
Again, I didn't know this because
I never paid attention to them.

1084
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,570
Well after we hooked up,

1085
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,600
he told some people that I told them
he was the best fuck I ever had a this

1086
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:28,020
found its way back to me and
bill. I was shocked. Why?

1087
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,530
Because he was the worst fuck I ever had.
A,

1088
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:36,240
he had no idea what he was doing.
He was, for lack of better words,

1089
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:39,870
not present.
No rhythm and average at best.

1090
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:43,440
I wasn't mad at this because it
was my choice to hook up with him,

1091
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,660
but now he's putting words in my mouth.

1092
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:50,690
I really just want to tell someone how
bad he was and wait for it to get back

1093
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:55,710
around to him. What does my move here,
Bill and or Nia? Well, wait a minute.

1094
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,930
Did you say he was all right?

1095
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,503
Okay.

1096
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,660
One drunk at night.
I did.

1097
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:06,100
The worst thing I could
do feed is stupid ego.

1098
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:07,130
Okay.

1099
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:09,020
Does that mean that you slept with them?

1100
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,160
I can't tell if you buy
feed his ego. Ew. Ew.

1101
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,350
He was so bad. You felt like
you had to say something nice.

1102
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:24,430
Now there's no fucking way. You said
there's no way. You said he was the best.

1103
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:25,264
Fuck.

1104
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,580
Yeah.

1105
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:30,600
Um, I think you're saying, yeah. Yeah.

1106
01:05:30,601 --> 01:05:33,330
I think you're saying that you,
you fed his ego by hooking up with them.

1107
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,910
Had I known he was a moron
in a pompous tooth. Okay,

1108
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:37,950
so he's walking around
saying that you said,

1109
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,500
and you're also saying it's
putting words in your mouth.

1110
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:42,270
So I'm assuming that you never said that,

1111
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,180
so fed his ego means that you
fucking hooked up with them.

1112
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,540
That's what I'm guessing. I
don't fucking know. Christ,

1113
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,340
they speak speaking riddles.
Um,

1114
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,310
I wasn't mad at this because I'm,

1115
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:57,723
yeah,

1116
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:02,750
well, oh, this is a tough one.

1117
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:03,643
I would,

1118
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:10,900
I would call him up. Then
when he picked up, I be like,

1119
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:13,960
why are you walking around saying that?
I said you were the best fuck I ever had.

1120
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:14,950
I never said that.

1121
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,023
Yeah.

1122
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,500
Okay. I never said that. Okay.

1123
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:25,070
And hear what he says and you know
something that might be a thing.

1124
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:27,640
This is the thing, this fucking,
a lot of these guys like this,

1125
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:31,810
a tremendously insecure, maybe he knows,
he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

1126
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,440
So he's walking around saying that so
he can feel better about himself because

1127
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:40,441
he feels that awful about himself and
he feels so fucking awful about himself

1128
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,910
that not only does he got to go that big,
that the,

1129
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,960
the fucking way he feels about himself
is such a big thing that it doesn't mean

1130
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:54,580
that he doesn't even think that that's
going to get back to you or he doesn't

1131
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:56,650
even consider your fucking feelings.

1132
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:02,100
So you can either be the biggest
person and know that this person is,

1133
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:07,621
I'm tremendously insecure and walks around
and probably doesn't like themselves,

1134
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:12,640
which is a fucking horrible feeling
to have and just take peace with that.

1135
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,490
Or

1136
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,630
you can call a guy out,
which I kind of like, okay,

1137
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,023
okay.

1138
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,950
And I, and I, you know, and at
that point you got to listen. Uh,

1139
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:28,580
if you were the best fuck I ever had,

1140
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:32,120
I would've said that to you and just
leave it at that because you haven't sold

1141
01:07:32,121 --> 01:07:36,860
them that he's completely fucking inept.
You know what I mean?

1142
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:41,180
But you're also kind of putting
the guy in check. Um, then,

1143
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:42,710
then you have your final option,

1144
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:48,610
which is you can go around saying that
he wasn't the best fuck I ever had.

1145
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,540
He's fucking terrible
it better than anyone.

1146
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:56,570
What happens is everybody just gets to
sit back and enjoy watching you guys

1147
01:07:56,571 --> 01:08:00,230
fucking do this shit.
I understand why you'd want to do it.

1148
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,243
MMM.

1149
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,750
I Dunno.
I don't do the revenge thing.

1150
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:09,820
I kind of go to the person's that's doing
whatever they're doing that's fucking

1151
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:14,620
annoying me. And I just kind of
chopped the head off there and, uh,

1152
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,750
and then if somebody comes up to me
and says what they said, I would say a,

1153
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,650
I would just say to him personally,
yeah, that isn't true. I never said that.

1154
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:28,410
I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck to do. I,
I'm sorry that this happened to you. Um,

1155
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,550
and at 20 years of age,

1156
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:36,551
it's probably hard to understand a lot
of the shit that I'm saying that of what

1157
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:39,630
that guy feels about
himself. But, um, you know,

1158
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,120
you can't have somebody walking around
saying shit like that about you.

1159
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:46,800
So I would, first thing I would
do, I was confront the guy,

1160
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,430
call him up. I'd be like, why are
you saying that? I never said that.

1161
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,500
Yeah.

1162
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,260
You know?
And uh,

1163
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,150
if you continue to say that and if
he kind of goes around, just believe,

1164
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,230
if you keep taking you to say that
you're leaving me in a position here,

1165
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,190
that I have to tell them the truth.
Okay.

1166
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:10,620
You're not the best fuck I ever
had. All right. I Dunno. It's just,

1167
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:13,480
I don't know that sets, you know, guys,

1168
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:15,400
if you listen to this thing
and you're a young person,

1169
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,730
that's such a fucking asshole thing to do.
All right?

1170
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:23,770
That's totally coming from your own
God damn insecurity. All right. And uh,

1171
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:26,710
as an older, wiser fucking man, you know,

1172
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:30,160
I wished that somebody older told me
that when you hook up with somebody,

1173
01:09:30,161 --> 01:09:34,930
you keep your fucking mouth
shut. Um, you know what I mean?

1174
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,550
You're quiet about it. You know,
it happened. Who gives a fuck?

1175
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:44,410
Who knows? You know what I mean? It's
an insecure fucking move. And, uh, just,

1176
01:09:44,411 --> 01:09:47,830
just sit there and then she did this
and then did dead. She fucked it.

1177
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:50,980
Did this like, that's a really
fucking asshole thing to do.

1178
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,550
Dumb in women.

1179
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,830
If you'll hook up with the guy and he's
fucking terrible or he's got a little

1180
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,220
Dick and all that type of shit. Right. Uh,

1181
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,240
if he's not out there talking
shit for you to walk around,

1182
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:07,760
fucking doing that too.
That's another fucking asshole move.

1183
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:12,260
It's an asshole move either way. And
in this case, the guy see asshole. So,

1184
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,120
um, I dunno, you know something,
if you can hang on until Thursday,

1185
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:20,790
I'll run it by Nia version
again and I'll run it by her.

1186
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:23,410
It's just that she's still
sleeping here, so. MMM.

1187
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,230
All right. Let me go.
That's it for the questions.

1188
01:10:28,231 --> 01:10:30,770
Let me read the last two
advertisements here and then, uh,

1189
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,830
I got some pumpkin bread to
make. All right. Uh, Geek, uh,

1190
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:39,150
buying tickets online for
sports and concerts has been
a confusing process for a

1191
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:39,984
long time.

1192
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:43,530
It's always been hard to find the best
deal for that game or show you want to go

1193
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:46,620
to. And none of those older
tickets sites want to change that,

1194
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,840
but it Siki gets different.

1195
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,920
They've come along and created an amazing
APP and website that makes it easier

1196
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,380
than ever for fans to
buy and sell tickets.

1197
01:10:55,381 --> 01:11:00,381
Siki does all the price comparisons for
you by searching multiple tickets sites

1198
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:05,481
and ensuring that you get
the best possible deal and
seek wants to help you get

1199
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:06,930
the most bang for your buck.

1200
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,070
That's why every ticket out and seek
is given a grade based on value.

1201
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:16,220
You'll immediately see why any seats you
immediately see any underpriced seats

1202
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:19,320
and be able to find the best
deals fit for your budget.
