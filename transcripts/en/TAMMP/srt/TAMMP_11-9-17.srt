1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey, what's going on and spill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:07,170
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,610
Ah,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,590
just checking in on you.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,600
I'm just checking in on just
seeing how your week's going. Okay.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,720
You know a lot of people when
they podcasts for one week,

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:23,890
they don't fucking think about their
listeners for the rest of the week,

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,190
but you know what, not this
guy, I think about you.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,010
I think I think about you.

10
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,120
Or what was it that was
fucking a guns and roses,

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,890
right? All that fucking false
settles singing back then. Oh, Lee,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,833
you,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,210
Ooh,
Ooh.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,100
Everyone will go nuts and they would have,

15
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:54,900
their fucking light is up in
the air already. Right out
of the gate. You can say,

16
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,000
Gee, Bill, you have a lot more
energy than you've had lately.

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,210
What's going on with you while ty,
what's going on?

18
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:05,950
Today's the last day we're
wrapping on the movie front runner,

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,000
storing a Hugh Jackman
directed by Jason Reitman.

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,100
Um,
this is the last day.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,280
I'm very excited because I think
it's going to be a great movie.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,900
And I also get to go home and see
my family is that my daughter away.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,550
Um,
very cool.

24
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,340
I've got a quick little run in New York
and then I'm done and I'm just done for

25
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:31,450
the rest of the year. Other than the Times
I go to New Mexico and Arizona. Okay.

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,790
I mean, I still am a traveling
comedian. I still am a plate spinner,

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,780
but uh, I'm pretty much home til like
the end of January, which is awesome.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,580
So I will be spending that time
with my family and uh, going in,

29
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:49,390
punching up an editing,
some of the first cuts of a season,

30
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:53,450
three of f is for family. That's what I'm
doing, you know, getting into the, uh,

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,120
thanksgiving spirit,
thanksgiving often overlooked.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,310
You know, the second Halloween comes
along, everybody goes, oh shit,

33
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,900
it's the fucking Christmas season.

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,910
But people forget that there's a holiday.
You know,

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,370
the holiday, you don't have to have
any gifts. All you gotta do is show up.

36
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,950
You show up the Wednesday
before thanksgiving,

37
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:20,000
you go down to the local bar and a lot
of the checks that you were too afraid to

38
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,860
talk to are going to be down there.

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,280
A lot of the chicks that were afraid to
be talked to are going to be down there.

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,700
Everybody's looking for
some sentimental sex.

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,503
Right.

42
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,410
Awesome.
What if encounters counters?

43
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,383
Yeah.

44
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,270
Sorry. I don't mean to go.
I'll Harvey Weinstein here.
All of that was consensual.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,950
All right. Jesus Christ. It's
just one accusation after another.

46
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,340
Finally, please. All these famous
people are starting to go like, yeah,

47
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,580
I have no idea who that is or, yeah, I
don't, I dunno. I don't remember that.

48
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,230
Yeah.

49
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,320
You know, which I was surprised right
out of the gate. They didn't do,

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm not condoning their behavior.
I'm just saying legal advice. Yes.

51
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:05,690
Later after the ges has disappeared off
for you throughout the plant that you

52
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:06,890
fucking came on,

53
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,110
you'd think that these people would go
into denial like that fucking Supreme

54
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,140
Court judge. God, I don't know what
you're talking about. I didn't do that.

55
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:19,340
I just went back to my study and I was
reading on how to become a better person

56
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,430
this slowly starting to
do that. Um, but anyways,

57
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:26,211
why,
why bill?

58
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:31,211
Why on such a glorious holiday month
would you bring up such a scandal?

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,500
Um, there should be like, you know what,
you should start doing like a, like,

60
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,010
you know, you have like a dead pool. They
should do. You should do like a pool now.

61
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,880
We just fucking,
you try to bet on who's the next person.

62
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,060
Okay.

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,670
I can't even say anything because it's
not funny to fucking accuse somebody.

64
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,140
That shit.
Uh,

65
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,693
okay.

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,850
I'm trying to think of anybody who I with.
Nah, I ain't going to fucking do that.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,650
Let's, let's get it. Let's
go with something positive.

68
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,770
I went to the best music store.
I've been to an eye since,

69
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,460
I dunno when with the best
commercial on Youtube,

70
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:11,480
which I am going to post off of the Monday
morning podcast, Twitter account, uh,

71
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,020
Portman's music store in Savannah,

72
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:19,580
Georgia is a hands down the best
music store I've been to. Um,

73
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,060
what do you want? You want
a French horn? The got it.

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,440
You want to assume they got it. You
want to Didgeridoo, they got it.

75
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:32,441
Are you an old man and you've got to read
some charts and your fucking eyes are

76
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:36,290
gone. They actually sell readers up
at the, up at the counter a little,

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,470
you know those glasses when you don't
want to just waste your money getting a

78
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,420
prescription, do you just go
out and you get the readers?

79
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:44,900
You just try some on and I think
these are good. These are go right.

80
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,820
They sold those.
Uh,

81
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,340
I went over there and just to get some
drum sticks and next thing you know,

82
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,440
I'm actually thinking of buying a trumpet.

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,830
Okay.

84
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,830
I always loved the trumpet. I always loved
the power of that fucking instrument,

85
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:57,990
you know?
And uh,

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
I actually looked at one for the first
time I had this guy explained to me the

87
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:05,340
whole way that it worked
and I was thinking about it.

88
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,000
And then fortunately I
called my wife and she goes,

89
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,560
you're not buying a fucking trumpet.

90
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,400
Why do wives always do
that? They always, you know,

91
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,440
I'm not saying that she was wrong,
but they always do you that doing that.

92
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,770
You're not buying a boat.

93
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,540
Okay?

94
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,100
You can do get that. Putting a speed
bag up on the side of the house.

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Well, you know it doesn't rain that
much. There's a tree over it, honey.

96
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,640
We're not doing that right.

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,790
They always do that to us,

98
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,490
but what can we always ever sit there
and look at and be like, like why honey?

99
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,400
You're not buying another pair of shoes.

100
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,720
You're not buying any more throw pillows.

101
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,250
Okay?

102
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,860
You already can't sit on the
fucking couch. There's too many.

103
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:58,140
I'm not yelling now.
I am.

104
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,190
Yes, but I wasn't. Oh,
you know what? Fuck you.

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,100
Fuck you fine. I don't give a fuck. I
never didn't want to go there anyways.

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,880
What do you hope to ruin the weekend?

107
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,570
Right?
That's the way it goes.

108
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,970
Why can't we do that? What?
You know, we should just,

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,230
we got to figure out what they do.
Obviously we can't start crying, you know?

110
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,100
No fucking send us to some God damn home.

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,770
I'm going to do that next time. Buying
a trumpet. You're not buying a trumpet.

112
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,460
Dopey.

113
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,970
Hey me.

114
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,130
She was right in another
life, you know. Come on man.

115
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,660
The trumpet with the plunger on the end,
getting that Jimi Hendrix. Why Wah sound.

116
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,320
Maybe that's where, that's probably
where he got it from. Right.

117
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,200
He probably wanted to have that sound
in the guitar because he was probably

118
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:57,490
listening to somebody playing a fucking
horn. I don't know what, but uh,

119
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,600
I always loved the trumpet
and the trombone and the
sac saxophones kind of hacky

120
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:06,280
to like, that's like Lichen Guitar.
Everybody likes fucking guitar.

121
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:09,390
Everybody likes somebody comes to horns.
Everybody likes to saxophone. Right?

122
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,200
Fucking Trump owns the
shit. Right? The trumpet.

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,790
Yeah. But listen to a big band and
those four trumpet players show up.

124
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,820
They fucking, you know, they stand up and
they start playing their little section.

125
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,050
They almost knock you out of your seat.

126
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,073
MMM.

127
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,420
I Dunno man. They were fucking cool.
And they were expensive as shit.

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,920
Like the cheapest one was like that
they had, there was like six, seven,

129
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,630
800 bucks when the parents are always
fucking freaking out when that kid stops

130
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:42,330
playing. The trumpet.
It's like, Dude, you know?

131
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,600
Yeah.

132
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,610
I could have bought a new ride mower.

133
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,990
Okay.

134
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,320
Do you know what stopped me from playing
the trumpet? Other than, uh, just poor,

135
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,090
you know, musical gifts was, I didn't
want to get that fucked up live.

136
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,300
And then the guy behind the
counter told me, he said,

137
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:03,200
all that's just poor technique.
That's just from pressing, I probably,

138
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:07,040
you're ambitious. Sure. Or whatever
the fuck they call it is wrong.

139
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,030
So to make up for it,

140
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,270
you got to press it against your lips and
then you get like that, that, you know,

141
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,461
yeah.

142
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,980
You look like look like somebody beat
you with a trumpet rather than you play

143
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:16,814
one.
Right.

144
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,850
Okay.

145
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,830
And he's like,
now you just want to be relaxed.

146
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:24,660
You want to be relaxed since everything
is that in life, you know what I mean?

147
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:28,350
Do you want to be relaxed? You want to
hit a home run? Don't try and kill it.

148
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:33,090
Just swing through the fucking zone. But
the bat, meet the ball. There it goes.

149
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,450
Right Ben? A little league
field for me. Professional guys,

150
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:40,920
they could hit it out of Fenway plaque,
right? Stop trying to kill it. Golf,

151
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,710
you want to drive it a bunch of yards
there, right? You want to show off?

152
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,170
Okay.

153
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,280
You're on the first tee.

154
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,240
Have you all the fucking white
dude standing behind you?

155
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,131
One woman,

156
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,010
it's somebody of color so nobody can
say you're fucking membership is racist,

157
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,180
right?
You fly them in.

158
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,970
Okay.

159
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,790
Everybody's standing there watching
you. You're waiting to tee off, right?

160
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,260
You feel in the sweat going down the
Becky a ball bag. And what do you do?

161
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:10,830
You grip it a little tighter.
You fucking go back like John Daly,

162
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:15,520
you swing outside your zone
and you fucking go through
your little hat with the

163
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,270
palm. Palm falls off, you fall
on your ass, you white slacks,

164
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,950
get a grass date on them. And
where does the ball go? Huh?

165
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,780
Fucking ricochets off the lady's
tastes and everybody snickers,

166
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,870
everybody snickers and
you're in a bad mood.

167
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,340
You have a bad round and then you fucking
come home. You throw your clubs down,

168
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,620
right?
And then your wife comes out.

169
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,570
And once you to emote
and next thing you know,

170
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:41,770
you get your hands around her throat,
right? Her eyes are rolling back.

171
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,370
She's making dents on the what
you then you know how it ends,

172
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,213
right?

173
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,630
You know how it ends.
It ends with a trip to home depot.

174
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,100
You're buying a pick ax and some
sort of lime and all you had to do,

175
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,680
all you had to do was just relax.

176
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,790
Go up this smile and wave at all
your so called friends that you know,

177
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:06,050
a route and against you. You
know, stay within yourself.

178
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,480
Be Nice and relaxed.
Don't give a shit.

179
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,830
Let the face meet the fucking ball there
it goes right down the goddamn fairway.

180
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,483
But no,

181
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,120
you tried to kill it and one and ended
up happen. An innocent woman died.

182
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,230
Right. And how you're
going to get caught. Huh?

183
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Because of the back of her head that the
imprints going to be on the hood of the

184
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,390
car. They come over
there to dust it, right.

185
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,530
And then they'll still be able to tell
it's the perfect shape of her skull with

186
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:40,120
the little blue, a little pony tail.
You know, and then you just sit there.

187
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:43,490
That's when you break down on
the, on the fucking Stan like, oh,

188
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:46,450
I'm one of those classic uh,
iron side,

189
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,880
the writer with Manny.

190
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,370
You remember those old
stupid court dramas,

191
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,820
the early days of movies
and television shit.

192
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,160
All the had to do was just ask the person,

193
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,560
the defendant a bunch of quick questions.

194
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,390
They'd just be like, you went golfing
that day, didn't ya? Yeah. What about it?

195
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,120
Everyone was watching it one day.

196
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,750
They were watching and you're squeezed
the glove chloride. No, I didn't get,

197
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,100
and then you went home and your
cows. Why? Right. I did it.

198
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,443
Yeah.

199
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,760
[inaudible] my golf game, Shea. Right.

200
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,640
They always did that. And then they
always shook women and slap the,

201
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,180
okay.

202
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,650
You know, when that was the backbone. Oh,
Hollywood. And for some fucking reason,

203
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:42,340
67 years later, everybody's surprised
that people are running around,

204
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,840
grabbing people by their private,
Eh, finishing on a plant.

205
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,680
Um, anyways, I guess, was it the midterm
elections? I don't. What happened?

206
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,780
All I know is I was down on the
sets and somebody said, hey,

207
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:00,380
it's a good good day for Democrats.
And I was just like,

208
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:03,740
uh, what do you mean? He goes
yesterday, man, he said the Democrats,

209
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,710
Democrats fucking killed it yesterday.
And my first thought was, well,

210
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,450
did they elect good Democrats?

211
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,260
Yeah.

212
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,380
You know what I mean?
I know like how people look at politics,

213
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,260
the way they look at their sports team,
you know what I mean?

214
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,360
Where like if it's a bad call, as long
as it goes into the favor of your team,

215
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,590
you're like, God, that was fine.

216
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,970
You know like Hillary supporters
doing that stupid. Thank you Hillary,

217
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,910
which was probably started by her people.

218
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,240
MMM,
okay.

219
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,960
I don't understand what
people on the left are doing.

220
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:40,180
Still trying to push her over the top.

221
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:44,440
At some point you just got to admit you
wasted a draft pick and you got to move

222
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,640
on to somebody else.

223
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,510
Okay.

224
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,260
I've never seen somebody just keep
coming back like fucking Freddy Krueger.

225
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,090
I since probably Richard Nixon,

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,400
that has to be her spirit
animal. My favorite. My fucking,

227
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
what did I just say?
Favorite.

228
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:05,200
That's the thing I hate the most when
people say so and so is my spirit animal.

229
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,740
When you fucking 11, you've
got a pen pal too. Um,

230
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,330
yeah, like if I was her, I would just, I
would look, I would look at Richard Nixon

231
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,600
and be like, okay, this guy lost you.

232
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,930
No one on the radio last on TV.
He was sitting there, you know,

233
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,200
sitting there like how you normally sit,
right? He's got sweat on his upper lip.

234
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,990
JFK comes in all tanned up.
He's got his legs crossed,

235
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:39,330
like he's doing panel on the
fucking tonight show. You know,

236
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,350
all the women are watching going off.
I had to fuck a political dick.

237
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:46,830
That would be the Dick. Right? So
everybody fucking votes, you know,

238
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:51,030
thinks that he went on TV,
Nixon loses the election,

239
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,720
and then he lost the governor's race
and California and literally was out of

240
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:59,710
politics
in that eight years later,

241
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,180
oh, tricky dick came back and
won the fucking White House.

242
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,710
I think that's what
Hillary is trying to do.

243
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,523
MMM.

244
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,510
But just watching everybody on the left,
just ignoring,

245
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,960
completely turning a fucking blind eye
to the fact that Bernie Sanders got more

246
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:20,870
votes and the Di they
admitted it in court.

247
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:25,871
The Democratic National Party colluded
with her campaign to make her the fucking

248
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:28,940
representative. I mean, can
you give me a fucking break?

249
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,680
She's fucking sitting here bitching about
the electoral college. I don't get it.

250
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,600
I get, if you're a woman and you want
a woman to be president, but you know,

251
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,170
can you pick a good one?
Can we start with that?

252
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,323
MMM.

253
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,990
I mean, how much more corrupt
can, I dunno, I just don't get it.

254
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Peoples and being a namerd with
either the bushes or the Clintons,

255
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,960
I, I've had enough with them. I
want a new last name lying to me.

256
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,270
Is that asking too
much? Um, but so anyway,

257
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,400
so I checked out some of those elections
and I'm way in over my head here,

258
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:10,790
but I just saw these weird headlines like,
congratulations,

259
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,740
such and such state,

260
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,070
you elected the first transgendered
person way to go Vermont or way to go New

261
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,110
Jersey. You elected the first, uh,
Muslim, whatever, that this seat guy,

262
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,580
whatever,
I don't know how to say to whatever,

263
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,290
there was nothing in there that you
elected somebody who was qualified that's

264
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,000
going to do a great fucking job.

265
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:36,110
Who happens to be Polynesian or whatever.

266
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,300
I don't understand it. Read the
exact same. Well that's like,

267
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,530
that's like how white supremacy vote.
You know,

268
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,410
they vote strictly by you know,
race or whatever.

269
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,760
Like that doesn't make any sense. Like
can we just vote for people who are good,

270
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,810
who actually have demonstrated that they
can not be swayed by money and they're

271
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:07,670
actually going to do what's going to be
good for the environment that's going to

272
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,860
be good for poor people,

273
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,380
middle class people that's going
to be good for this country.

274
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Don't just fucking vote for somebody
because of their genitalia or,

275
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,720
or you know, I mean I
don't get, I don't get it.

276
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:25,721
This whole fucking idea that
that sociopath's selfish people.

277
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:31,811
Liars are only white male heterosexuals
and that only they are susceptible to.

278
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,620
Um, being weak when they
get positions of power is,

279
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,150
is, is not a good road to go down is the
only thing I'm going to say. You got to,

280
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,820
I don't know how you, uh, figure out
what the fuck somebody going to do,

281
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,010
but like to just be excited that somebody
got in there because of their sex or

282
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,850
their race is a,
is a very shortsighted way to look at it.

283
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,610
You got to look at what the
fuck they did is all I'm saying.

284
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,540
And I did not see that in the
headline. I just thought, oh good,

285
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,850
this person's in there,
you know?

286
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,780
But I feel like that's how we
try to fix shit. Like, oh my God,

287
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,530
there was eight years of Democrats.
Fuck this. Let's do, let's,

288
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,800
let's vote all Republican. Uh,
wait a minute, that doesn't work.

289
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,620
Let's go all Democrat.
That's what we just keep fucking doing.

290
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,450
And now we're going to do
that. I think on a, a, uh, a,

291
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,600
uh,
what do you call it?

292
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,480
Gender and a race thing is what they're
going to do and it's going to be

293
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,450
fucking, I'm telling you, you're
going to see the exact same scandals.

294
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,810
I did not have sex with that woman.

295
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,600
You wait, I wanted to see how this
plays out when they get in there, right?

296
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,860
When the [inaudible] get in there and
they got their own private fuck and

297
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,550
subway, you know everybody's
eating fucking lobster,

298
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,830
you know, and it's all just
sitting there dangling. You know,

299
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,590
you want to be present. Hey Buddy,
you want to be president, right?

300
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,940
And they got to get in bed with all
of these evil fucking corporations.

301
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:09,600
And then when they get in there, they
got to do with those corporations one,

302
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,190
okay.

303
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,130
Right. They got to do what the fuck
they want. And then if they do,

304
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,180
then you end up like, like
Obama, like Bush, like Clinton,

305
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,670
like all of these fucking
people after their president.

306
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,290
Then you go on the fucking
bribe money tour going out,

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,940
air quote giving speeches, right?
Why are you still giving speeches?

308
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:32,640
You're not president anymore.
You know what I mean?

309
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,540
Is Dan Marino walking around with
a football still throwing passes.

310
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,410
He's retired. What the fuck
are you all your collect? Yeah.

311
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,330
Obama right now is on tour.

312
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,930
$69 million toward giving speeches.

313
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,080
Let's say the guy doesn't
give a good speech,

314
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,180
but 69 million in one year.
The Fuck Outta here.

315
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,700
The Fuck Outta here. Who's he going to
go talk to? Huh? What was he talking to?

316
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:07,000
Joe Six pack? I don't think so. Um,

317
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,360
I know that was a very
bleak way of looking at it,

318
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,400
but there's something positive in there.

319
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,060
I think we need is as
everybody represented,

320
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,940
obviously in government,

321
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,730
but you got to make sure
that you're not just voting

322
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,580
okay.

323
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,410
You know, just to get a
woman in. There are some,

324
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:28,310
you gotta make sure they're good
and that is, that is my problem.

325
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,920
Okay.

326
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,560
With the Clintons,
I just think that they're just fucking,

327
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,650
they like, I don't even know what they
are. They just soulless fucking people.

328
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,550
There's gotta be somebody better than
her. All right. But you know, Democrats,

329
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:43,630
if you want to hang your hat around,

330
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:47,770
somebody with Mike Dukakis
is fucking charisma. Who's
his comfortable in his own,

331
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,100
her own skin is Al Gore to fucking loses.

332
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,900
They can't say well to
people lost the election. Um,

333
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,260
have you ever heard me talk
politics as much in your life?

334
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,930
Would you think someone who doesn't watch
Fox News or CNN or MSNBC or anything

335
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:06,850
else who kind of just gets his news from
overhearing one comment from somebody

336
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:10,030
on a set? Well, doing
eight lines in a movie.

337
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,120
Um, anyway, so let's get back into my
wheel house. All right. What happened?

338
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:21,010
This is the podcast.
I fucking talk about what I want.

339
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,310
I talked about buying a trumpet, Ed
and I'm talking about, uh, you know,

340
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,070
make funny for woman gets in the office.
Like, like, what is she gonna like,

341
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,600
how is she going to give it to,
you know,

342
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,840
okay.

343
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,260
She going to get like a
bunch of fucking like j crew

344
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,880
like boy toys running around
the White House. Who knows?

345
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,580
I don't know what they're going to do.
She'd probably go like that.

346
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:51,310
That Ferdinand Marcos chick there who
had like fucking 50,000 fucking shoes.

347
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,260
That's what it is. Guys are into
like fucking, we're animals, right?

348
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,710
Ladies are into stuff.
Maybe that's what it is.

349
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,580
They'll blow the entire defense budget
and I'm like broaches or some shit.

350
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,040
All right. This is some of the
dumbest Shit I've ever said. Um,

351
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,640
I hope it makes you feel better
about yourself. All right. Oh,

352
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,600
last day of the shoot, 84 days
sober. I did it. All right.

353
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,850
I booked this thing. I was a fat
booze bag. I stopped fucking drinking.

354
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,050
I did it.

355
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,050
So can you and I'm so I'm a little
nervous here because now the shoot ends

356
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:29,350
tonight and uh,
so now what do I do?

357
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,530
It's this weird thing where I don't
want to, I don't want to end my streak.

358
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:32,821
I forgot.

359
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:36,910
I can get at least a hundred days then
I'm going through Thanksgiving without

360
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,230
drinking.
But is that a bad thing?

361
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,070
You know what I mean?
Rather than, you know,

362
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,610
drinking and kind of forgetting half the
meal and then waking up at four in the

363
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:51,430
morning, what the TV still on, you know,

364
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:54,850
sweating my ass off and some Thanksgiving
sweater being like, what the fuck?

365
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:59,390
Where is everybody? Did I
say goodnight? You know,

366
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,270
next day you go downstairs, you talked
to your wife, feel like a good morning.

367
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,100
She just looks at you and keeps brushing
your teeth and you're like, oh fuck.

368
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,840
Um,
did you have fun yesterday?

369
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,230
She stops brushing your teeth,
slams a hand down on the counter,

370
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,620
spits out, and that fucking
turns the sink on. It.

371
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,170
Turns it off and then turn
and you're like, oh fuck.
What did I do? What did I say?

372
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,480
I don't want to do that.
I'll do that the day after,

373
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,200
right when I watch all those
rivalry game followed in Alabama,

374
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:44,640
crimson tide against the Auburn
Tigers, um, I'm missing everything.

375
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,030
I don't know what's going on in the world.
Uh,

376
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,770
I had a lot of people send me a,
you know,

377
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,440
tweets and texts and all that shit.

378
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,230
Unfortunately about the fatal crash.
Uh,

379
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,610
sorry, I just clicked this
fucking thing off. Um, uh,

380
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,450
Roy Halladay and uh, yeah,
that's fucking brutal.

381
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,730
That's brutal.
Did she,

382
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:14,750
that guy in Boston sports radio
just fucking went off on him.

383
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,823
MMM.

384
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,051
You know,

385
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:22,860
what's hilarious about that whole clip
is he makes his point in the first like

386
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,820
eight seconds. He says what he feels
about it and then continues to say it.

387
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,200
I almost thought it was like on a loop.
He just kept going, oh, look at me.

388
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,510
I got to play the idea.
I'm waving at the fucking window.

389
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:37,070
He said that like nine times.
Um,

390
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,160
I was kind of done with the guy
when he called Holiday a Jack Wagon

391
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,040
who says,
I

392
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,180
understand you can't curse on the radio.
Um,

393
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,630
yeah,

394
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,020
I dunno. But the weird thing is
that there's, they're blaming the,

395
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,190
they're starting to
blame the plane and uh,

396
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,010
I don't think that's right. I mean,
if it's pilot error both times,

397
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:05,250
I don't think that that, you know,
what's scary is the other one. Right.

398
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,180
And I've even thought about this the
first time, that type of plane crashed,

399
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,340
I guess the test pilot,

400
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,850
he went flying into this
canyon flying low and he,

401
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,330
they're guessing that he thought he was
in this different part of the canyon

402
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,430
that was going to,
it opened up to a lake.

403
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,650
But this one didn't like it started
to get narrow and then he went into

404
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:28,780
basically a mountain
called the sac and he,

405
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,510
and basically the angle that he would
have had to fly out if he pulled back on

406
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:35,580
the stick,
he was going to fucking stall.

407
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,170
So he had to try to do
bang a Uie basically

408
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,970
I would think. Um, yeah,

409
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,980
that's why I like a
helicopter cause you just go,

410
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,150
just stop with those fucking things.

411
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,130
You have to keep like a shark.

412
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:57,910
They got to keep moving forward
other than that's fucking it. Um,

413
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,470
okay.

414
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,430
But I gotta tell you, man, that plane
looks cool as hell. It really does.

415
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,620
It really looks cool. And um, I dunno,

416
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,730
but all of this shit where
people speculate and all
that, just shut the fuck up.

417
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,290
All right. The FAA will
investigate and like whatever.

418
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,630
And then in a certain amount of
time, six months, a year, whatever,

419
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,220
they'll come out with
their official report.

420
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,270
All these fucking people who don't fly,
listen to them talk about,

421
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,680
it was kind of a, I dunno, it was
kind of funny. Like they said, no,

422
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:30,520
this is the third time,
blah blah blah. You know,

423
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,900
there's a lot of times if something's
easy, people will do dumb shit with it.

424
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,470
Like the helicopter that I
want to buy, you know, it's,

425
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,220
it's basically like the Robinson,

426
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:45,610
but they corrected all the safety
issues on it. First of all,

427
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:50,110
having a fully articulated main rotor
system where you could actually push the

428
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:54,640
stick forward and not enter into some
sort of low GI or mass bumping situation.

429
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,450
So there was a guy that got it and he
was trying to demonstrate how you could

430
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:03,340
fly like an asshole,
which is what you should never do.

431
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,230
And he slammed the stick forward and
he went into a nose down attitude.

432
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:12,420
But it was, it's a carborated
engine and the way the fuel is,

433
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,580
is fed in.
When he tipped it forward,

434
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,540
he basically starved the carburetor
of fuel and he stalled it,

435
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,100
demonstrating that he wouldn't
get into one situation.

436
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:27,370
He created another situation
and then he then crashed it.

437
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,810
So, you know, people
will always, I, you know,

438
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:36,460
the very little that I know about
aviation, whenever a new design comes out,

439
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,730
you know, people are always
like, well, let's see,

440
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:44,731
let's let people fly in it and let them
die and then they can fix it and let you

441
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:48,810
warn you about all of this stuff.
But a lot of times it's just people,

442
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,050
it's this weird thing
where they make it safer.

443
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:52,940
Okay.

444
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,370
It make it easier and then

445
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,130
yeah,

446
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,710
someone will then do something.

447
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,243
I don't know,

448
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,460
I'll do something like that,
just slam a stick forward or something.

449
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,730
So I have no idea what that guy
was doing, but it's brutal, man.

450
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:07,440
So obviously condolences out to
him and his wife and kids. Man.

451
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:12,270
It's fucking brutal. Um, all right,
when, what? That's sad frigging story.

452
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,800
MMM.

453
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,720
That guy in Boston radio though.
It was also like,

454
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,770
I feel like as much as he felt what he
was saying, he was also trying to be edgy.

455
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,783
MMM.

456
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,600
You know,
and it's one of these things,

457
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,760
if anything that he was
saying was actually true,

458
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,530
it's like two kids don't need to say that.

459
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,280
Why are you adding to the pain of his
family if you really give a fuck about his

460
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:35,460
wife and kids? All right. If
somebody did something dumb,

461
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,700
everybody knows that they
did something dumb and,

462
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,180
and then they died then shut
up. Just shut up about it. Me,

463
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,530
you should really upsets me.
It upsets you.

464
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,740
Upset you don't even know the fucking guy.
It was such like a car. Dashi and two,

465
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,880
I just felt like for me that
was really upsetting. Um,

466
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,700
anyways, me undies, everybody, uh,

467
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,710
Mian Andy's beyond these. Don't slam
the fucking stick forward to Mondays.

468
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,820
Mondays, if you were in the Cabrini
fucking whatever I want to buy. Um,

469
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,430
why would I go into that?
Why? Why the fuck would I
die? What can I say beyond me?

470
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:19,450
Biondi swing the club.
Nice. No single golf club.

471
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:22,790
Relaxed Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Brds yeah.

472
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,560
Yeah.

473
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,030
You got nothing to run it through the
legs. Cause I'm thinking that fucking,

474
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,270
I'm sorry. You know what? I feel like
Casey case am I just went from a tragic,

475
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,270
tragic fucking story to singing
about underwear right now.

476
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,830
You can't make that transition.
Mandy's, everybody, me,

477
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,230
undies makes your butt me undies.

478
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:45,110
Your button will be proud
to wear and check this out.

479
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,210
I'm not the only one who loves me undies.

480
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:52,510
Listen to what longtime listener and
me undies enthusiast George has to say.

481
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,810
I note from George n a bill
burr listener and be undies fan.

482
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,870
I decided to try it. Mandy's BC. He
goes, I love bear, bear, bear. I sat it.

483
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,480
Okay. Is that all right? I did it.

484
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,210
I tried it on their soft melody
underwear. My Dick liked it. Okay. Um,

485
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,420
I smile every time he sings the song.

486
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:20,150
Although it's so easy to
skip the ads and the podcast,

487
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:23,330
I always listened to bill re Baba
Baba Baba. You guys know this.

488
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:24,590
He loves these fucking things.

489
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:29,060
They're nice and comfortable and he loves
me on these cradling the family jewels

492
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:39,890
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash bird
that's me, Andy's dot com slash bar. Well,

493
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:44,390
that was too short. I should read
what the guy said. All right.

494
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,080
I always listen to bill's reed and I'm
so glad we, Yannis has stuck with them.

495
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:50,870
It's been probably two years since I
bought my first pair of me and he's,

496
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:55,780
and now I have a monthly subscription
because they are that comfortable before

497
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,271
me undies.

498
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:59,480
I used to buy the three pack of underwear
and retail stores until I realized

499
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:01,880
that I wanted to treat my junk
to something more comfortable.

500
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:05,540
And that starts with a great pair of
Mandy's cradling the family jewels that is

501
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,160
just so slick.

502
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,180
The way that is read it reeks of and
that it was rewritten by the advertisers.

503
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,520
I'm sure there's a George n out there,

504
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,430
but I don't think he wrote
it as eloquently as that.

505
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,780
If he did go to Madison Avenue a kid,
you've got a career, you got a field cha.

506
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,830
All right, legal zoom,

523
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,090
All right, let's continue on here.
Um, I had been so frigging, uh,

524
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,290
busy traveling around doing shows and
finishing up this acting gig that I have

525
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:37,340
not watched. One second of my beloved
Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics.

526
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,930
I haven't watched anything. And, uh,
a friend of mine on F is for family.

527
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:46,931
A Cleveland Cavaliers Fan was raving
about how well Kyrie Irving was doing with

528
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:47,931
the Celtics.

529
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:51,950
So I watched a little bit of highlights
last night of the Celtics defeating the

530
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:56,000
Lakers. I saw that Lonzo Ball, is that
his name or is that his dad's name?

531
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,510
I saw that he actually played well and
believe in, not even as a Celtics fan.

532
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm happy for that dude because his
fucking dead is like such a crazy person

533
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,020
that it makes people hate this kid.
The kids never said Shit,

534
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,550
you can't pick your parents. And that
Dude's dad did a lot of good things.

535
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:15,020
He is playing in the NBA,

536
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,300
but um,

537
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,200
I don't know what he's doing.

538
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,960
He's fucking wrestling.
I don't know what he's doing.

539
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,713
MMM.

540
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,120
I don't know what the fuck he's doing,

541
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:32,230
but that's going to be
one of those things.

542
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:36,430
At some point that kid is going to have
to make it very uncomfortable break with

543
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:39,280
his overbearing father. Uh, but anyways,

544
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:42,530
the Celtics won and I'm watching the
highlights and I don't know anybody on the

545
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:46,340
team anymore. We still got, MOC is smart.

546
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,780
It seems like we got rid of everybody
else. Crowder, Avery, Bradley,

547
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,940
Isaiah Thomas. I knew they were all gone,
but it, you know, Kelly, a Lennox gone.

548
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,980
Everybody's fucking God. This is like
two people left from last year's team.

549
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:05,420
That kid green was looking great. What
the hell did he go? I was all, I didn't,

550
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:09,260
I missed all of these
fucking trades. So, um,

551
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,780
I dunno, I'm right back to only being
able to name a couple of Celtic. So, uh,

552
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm excited that, uh, this, I'm
going to get back into them.

553
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:23,270
I'm going to get through my, uh,
my little New York around here.

554
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,410
Thank you by the way, to everybody
that's coming out to my show Sunday night

555
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,580
and uh,

556
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,990
in New York City.
Thank you for getting bit in the tickets.

557
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,400
You're going to watch
me trout some material,

558
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:37,400
fuck around and do some shit that works
and do some shit that doesn't quite work.

559
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,130
And, um, but when I come
back, when I come back,

560
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,400
I am a [inaudible].

561
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,740
It's it. I'm watching the NBA
and NHL package and I can't,

562
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:50,770
I'm so fucking psyched up going out and
buying my nieces and nephews a bunch of

563
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:54,640
gifts. Uh, I'm going to come
back east for Christmas.

564
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,080
Everybody in my family who hasn't met my
beautiful, gorgeous, lovely daughter, uh,

565
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,890
my wife sent me video yesterday of the
first time she was on a swing, which are,

566
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,550
you know, thank God for video.
I would have missed it. Yeah.

567
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,453
MMM.

568
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,760
Uh, it's just awesome. She was so happy.
And then the way she was sitting there,

569
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:15,060
she had like an elbow, like she was
hanging out the driver's side window.

570
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,300
She was so totally chill.
She has like a, like a,

571
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,280
like a relaxed confidence about her
and she's a sweetheart, you know?

572
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,050
So all I gotta do is not be
an angry maniac. You know,

573
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,070
who can do, I'm going to be an angry
maniac, but I'm going to be less of one.

574
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,550
And when she calls me out on it,
when she inevitably learns how to talk,

575
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,590
I'm just going to admit to it, be
like, you know what? You're right.

576
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:40,000
Daddy needs to work on that because a,

577
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,540
I don't wanna I don't want
to ruin what she looks like.

578
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:46,320
She's gonna be mad cause she, I just
kids going to be special. You know,

579
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,250
like all dads, I am a little
biased, but I'm telling you, um,

580
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,370
anyways, which is another reason to not
be boozing around the frigging house.

581
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:57,204
Right.

582
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,313
Uh,

583
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,110
I think that's what I'm going to do.
I think in, in, in the next year,

584
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,050
I'll keep my drinking on the road.
That's what I'll do.

585
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,270
I live this double life
stone sober at home,

586
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,080
pushing her on a swing, wearing
sweaters, smiling and waving.

587
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,200
And then on the road I'll just
be in the gutter after my shows.

588
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,560
It's too sad. I would
never do that. Um, anyways.

589
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:26,880
And I heard that kid for the Bruins,

590
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:31,380
that kid on bu who stepped up last year
was [inaudible] looking very promising.

591
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,020
I heard he's playing really well.
I heard the Bruins of fast.

592
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,930
I know we don't have the greatest
record at this point, but you know,

593
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,130
a long season,

594
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,990
I cannot fucking wait to get
back to my family and just a,

595
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,340
you know,
I don't know.

596
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm not going to do shit for like
two weeks right through thanksgiving,

597
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,610
right until the end of this
month. And then I'll, you know,

598
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:57,330
whenever you'll start getting busy again.
But who gives a fuck? I'm a really,

599
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:00,210
and try to enjoy the holidays this
year. I'm getting into it. All right,

600
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:02,430
I'm going to buy a fucking tree.
I'm going to do the whole thing.

601
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:05,250
Although where I usually buy my tree,
you know,

602
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,660
got all everything got all fucked up
down there, announced. So they prep you.

603
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:11,370
They can't sell the trees there.
Who knows what?

604
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,610
They'll probably knock it down the
building to put up another building.

605
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,770
That's the big move out
here, right? Build these, uh,

606
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,260
I don't know what you call them.

607
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,140
These high rises, luxury
rentals. Do yourself a favor.

608
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,670
Don't rent a luxury apartment when
you can just instead go out and buy

609
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,210
a starter house. Throw all that
money down the fucking toilet. Okay?

610
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,150
Please don't do that unless you want
it. If you want to do it, by all means,

611
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:46,770
go ahead and do it. So, um, I was
reading, I always read drum magazine,

612
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,260
I Read Modern Drummer magazine and,
um,

613
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,020
okay,

614
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,060
I saw this whole article on,
um,

615
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,720
these drummers favorite like
prog rock bands from the 70s and,

616
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:03,030
uh, you know, early genesis, you know,

617
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:07,370
and Peter Gabriel is still in it and
Phil Collins was on drums, King Crimson,

618
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,960
all of these bands. So I actually started
listening to King Crimson, that band,

619
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:16,250
that album red. And, uh, it's
pretty fucking out there.

620
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,340
This shit is pretty fucking out there.
Some of it doesn't hold up,

621
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,240
some of it does,

622
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:25,830
but when they get into the real trippy
keyboard shit using all the effects and

623
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:30,600
everything, um, that definitely
gets a little bit nuts. But, uh,

624
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,100
I dunno, I was always curious of
like, Bill Bruford strumming and like,

625
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:39,930
he was always on, you know, the cover of
those magazines. I know he played in yes.

626
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:41,490
And all that stuff.
He's this amazing drummer,

627
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:45,180
so it was kind of psyched to finally
be able to hear him play. But, uh,

628
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,910
I don't know. I think I'm going
to listen to some of that shit,

629
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,100
if anybody has any good suggestions.

630
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,453
MMM.

631
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,500
I don't know. I can't help but feel
like it's very hipstery a lot of that.

632
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,260
I don't get it to PR progressive. I
don't mind fusion. Fusion is cool,

633
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,240
but progressive gets a
little, uh, you know,

634
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,180
reminds me of Kevin Murphy wants
with what? Kevin Murphy listens to.

635
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:14,600
One F is for family. So I'll just
treat it as like research or whenever.

636
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,130
All right, I'm babbling
here. I'm, once again,

637
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:20,320
thanks to everyone's going to come
out to my show Sunday night. And uh,

638
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,290
thanks to everybody on a front runner,
they gave me a part here in this movie.

639
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,840
I had such a great time on the shoot.
Met a bunch of people,

640
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,570
just awesome people and um,

641
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,070
okay.

642
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,240
I'm really excited to get back to my and,

643
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:38,320
and just enjoy the holidays
and everything. This is a
great time of fucking year.

644
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:41,110
You know, it would have been nice that
I could have said that without cursing,

645
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,380
but I'm not the brightest guy. All
right, go fuck yourselves. Go Celtics,

646
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,480
go patriots. Go Bruins. I
Dunno if we have a soccer team.

647
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't know what it is, but I'm
just, that's it. Man, I'm going home,

648
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm putting on my fucking pajamas and
ain't doing shit for the rest of the

649
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:59,800
fucking year except Christmas shopping
and cooking, thanksgiving dinner,

650
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,400
flying back east,
meeting a bunch of relatives,

651
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,400
giving out gifts to the Alpha fucking
crisis. It's always busy, isn't it?

652
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:09,790
Who gives a shit? All right. Go fuck
yourselves. Have a great weekend.

653
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,280
Enjoy the music here. And uh, also,
um, we got another 30 minutes.

654
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,330
If you knew of my podcast,

655
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:20,620
we always played like a greatest hits
from a Thursday afternoon podcast. Uh,

656
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,270
you know, from a few years ago. Maybe this
year. I don't fucking know. All right,

657
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,183
let's see.
Yeah,

658
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,050
you can be the best

659
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:24,860
it's

660
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,480
going on. It is a bill burr and it is
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

661
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:33,020
November 9th, 2009. And yes,

662
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,940
I am a little late with this one.

663
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:40,220
It is a well into Monday evening
here in Los Angeles. And uh,

664
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,680
I had, I just had a whirlwind
of a week. I really did.

665
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,620
I really did.
It should have been my,

666
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:52,621
my basically my Wednesday,

667
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,580
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, my last whatever that is,

668
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:58,940
five days should have been filmed.
Okay.

669
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,970
With like that MTV style where just as
you start to focus on what the images,

670
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:09,500
they fucking quickly cut to what you
were just looking at from the side in a

671
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,980
black and black and white, you
know, you know what you're about.

672
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:16,460
They used to film up punked and Ashton
Kutcher would be standing there like,

673
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,720
okay, check it out. I'm fucking zippy.

674
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:24,380
Sea Crest is going to get a glazed
doughnut. Right. And then Bam.

675
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,380
Then they go from the side and he'd
be fucking sitting there with his hat

676
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:31,040
sideways. Remember that I had like
a fucking, I had, I had an, I had,

677
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,280
I had like a totally TRL experience.

678
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,500
I had an unbelievable fucking week,
you know? Why do I feel like what?

679
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,350
I actually feel guilty about it like
telling you guys that had an unbelievable

680
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:46,340
week. Like I have to fucking apologize
to you guys during a free podcast.

681
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,930
Fuck you. You know, I got to tone it
down. What? Cause your week sucked.

682
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,110
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why did I turn the fucking fan on?

683
00:41:57,111 --> 00:42:00,800
It's God damn hottest fucking hell in
order. It is about my apartment. No, Bill,

684
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:04,910
what is it? Hang on a sec. Let me turn
this fucking thing on. Come on, turn on.

685
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,730
Um, the problem is is I
live in a desert and uh,

686
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,230
this time of year,
the sun is like three,

687
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:16,820
four hours where it just beats down
right on the corner of my apartment.

688
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,190
And, uh, it's just sitting there naked.

689
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,940
There's no avocado tree or a whatever,

690
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,960
a cactus or any shit to block out the sun.
So it just heats up like an oven.

691
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,740
And then I always try to close
the windows. You know, I've,

692
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,640
I've explained this before because I
say control out in the podcast and uh,

693
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,600
I want my neighbors to think
I'm a swell guy. No, I don't,

694
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,220
I don't give a shit what they
think. I just don't, you know,

695
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:42,650
if somebody steals something,
I don't want them to think it was me.

696
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,500
That's basically it. All right,
so this, this was my week.

697
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,910
Listen to this all you fuckers in your
cubicles. Ah, is it Tuesday morning,

698
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,810
the Grd?

699
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,500
Throw your hands up and give up on me
like I wasn't going to fucking do it this

700
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,870
week. Or at least today. Shame on you.

701
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,500
You could have been listening to this
yesterday. At the end of your job.

702
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,780
You know when you're supposed
to be getting all your
spreadsheets in order, Huh?

703
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,670
Right around the time that egg salad
sandwiches starting to bug you and you're

704
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,630
thinking,
can I,

705
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,620
can I shoot it right into the fucking
staples office chair that I'm sitting on

706
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,210
that sorta has some sort
of foam underneath it? Um,

707
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,243
isn't that the worst?

708
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,200
How would you have a sit down job and
you have a chair you can't fart into.

709
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,570
That's really bad.

710
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,210
You know what you've got and you've got
to wear like two pairs of boxers every

711
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:33,320
time you have Mexican, right? Jesus,
Bill, shit jokes. Three minutes. Right?

712
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,530
Right into the podcast. Huh? This
is how it was going to be. Sorry,

713
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,770
I was just adjusting myself here.
Not that kind of way.

714
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,860
Just adjust and everything cause I,
it's a long fucking story.

715
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,740
What you have to go through the turn
the fan on and keep the podcast going.

716
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,410
I have to stretch the technology
out all the wires. All right.

717
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:53,240
This was my week. Alright, Wednesday,

718
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,380
Wednesday I fly to a JFK
in New York City and um,

719
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,890
cause I'm getting ready
for my big town hall show,

720
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,210
my First Theater Gig in New York City,
right?

721
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:13,870
So I'm on my way there and I land right
around five 30 just in time for the

722
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:16,400
fucking traffic.
And low and behold,

723
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:20,750
the Yankees are playing games six of
the fucking world series. All right?

724
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:23,240
And if they win that night,
they're going to wrap the shit up.

725
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,340
I'm staying in a hotel in Times
Square. I bring my girl along, right?

726
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:32,450
It's a big fucking weak for me, you know?
And I'm sitting there riding and going,

727
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,930
please let the Phillies win. Please
let the fucking Phillies win. You know?

728
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:38,910
And then when game seven so I can walk,

729
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,970
watch all those fucking sad sack Yankee
fans with those satin Yankee jackets

730
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:46,140
that they wear.
You know,

731
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,220
like they're in some biker gang
on fucking happy days. I don't,

732
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:54,600
they're like one of the only teams left.
It's still has those satin jackets.

733
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,220
Um, anyways, but it was not to be right.

734
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,960
Then I started to watch games six and
Pedro's on the mound and he starts off

735
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:08,070
with like an 84 mile an hour fast ball
and it just really had a bad feeling that

736
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:11,070
I was going to watch the end of his career
that night and he was going to let up

737
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:15,420
like 17 Ronson. I couldn't watch
it so I shut it off. So, uh,

738
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,590
I have to do opie and Anthony in
the morning, so I take my vitamins,

739
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,810
I go to sleep or whatever.
Uh,

740
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,760
try not to get sick on the road and
right around right around right as I'm

741
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:31,110
starting to nod off,
I hear the first

742
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:32,640
okay.

743
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,370
Screaming that I would hear
for the next three hours.

744
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,850
I just hear like way off,
you know,

745
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,240
basically where I'm sitting in Times
Square is about a half a block away.

746
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:45,900
So all I hear right is not about rate
and nod off and get a nice eight hours

747
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:48,780
sleep.
Right before I go to do the morning radio.

748
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:52,210
All of a sudden I just
hear like [inaudible]

749
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,180
Yeah,

750
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,310
look at 27

751
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,170
woo.

752
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,780
Right? Couldn't really make
it out. Wasn't that clear?

753
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,670
And then I started hearing from her father
started horns blowing and it was like

754
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:10,290
the whole fucking stadium. I guess they
want it. I figured it out at that point.

755
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:14,160
That's like the whole fucking
stadium decided, what do we do now?

756
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,270
Let's go to time square and keep bill
up for the next fucking three hours.

757
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,620
And that's what they did. And it
was so loud. It's so ridiculous.

758
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:24,150
I was actually sitting there

759
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,400
with my head in between two pillows
like I was having a fucking like,

760
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:34,140
like a head sandwich. Right? It was
so fucking loud and so ridiculous.

761
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:38,730
I was actually laying there laughing.
Um, and what are the fucking odds, right?

762
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,190
One of the,
one of the biggest red sox fans,

763
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:46,140
one of the guys who hates the Yankees
the most. Okay. I live 3000 miles away.

764
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,670
What are the fucking odds?

765
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,900
There's one random day I'm going to fly
in and they're going to win the world

766
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:55,920
series and that is going to decide to
celebrate half a fucking block away.

767
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,420
So, uh, that was my first night. Um,

768
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,730
and the next night I did a Gig for a,

769
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:05,640
actually I didn't highlight
this gig because I was
trying to sell tickets for my

770
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:08,670
town hall Gig.
And um,

771
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I actually on Thursday I opened for this
up and coming comedian that I'm sure

772
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:18,570
all you guys [inaudible] you got to know
about soon a guy by the name of Dane

773
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,320
Cook. I don't know if you've ever
heard of him. Just uh, you know,

774
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:25,020
up and coming guy, you know,
just, just trying to plug away,

775
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,360
I opened up for him at Madison Square
Garden, I a 10 minutes and it was,

776
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:34,720
wasn't like the, the, the
theater at Madison Square Garden.

777
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:39,721
It was where the next play and I'm trying
to think the last time I worked with

778
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:41,711
him on the road,

779
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:46,711
I think maybe we did a college
gig together about 15 years ago.

780
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,980
Way Back when we were starting out in
Boston. So it was, uh, I gotta tell Ya,

781
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,970
it's been a long time since I did a gig
that wasn't like, if I do Letterman,

782
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,920
I get butterflies,

783
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:00,490
but it's been a long time since I've done
a standup gig where I got that wasn't

784
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:04,330
going to be on TV and I
actually got butterflies. I, uh,

785
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,770
I was standing back there
waiting to go on and I was like,

786
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:10,030
legitimately

787
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,680
not like nervous to the point that
there was going to fuck with my set,

788
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:16,570
but I was like,
I don't know what it was.

789
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,880
I stumped because I kind of got to
this like Madison Sky Canyon and uh,

790
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,280
fortunately I had the presence of
mind to be like, you know what?

791
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:28,180
When are you ever going to get to do this
again, bill? I'm going to go with never,

792
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,330
I'm going to bet I'm going to pet the
long shot on this one and guess what?

793
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:37,630
You're never going to get to do this
again. So, uh, or most likely, you know,

794
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,530
never say never.

795
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,580
So why don't you go up there and fucking
enjoy it and right before Dan does is

796
00:48:42,581 --> 00:48:43,780
shows in the round.

797
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:49,950
So it's like 20,000 fucking people and
I'm sitting there looking at the stage

798
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:53,740
and I'm trying to figure out
who am I going to look at.

799
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,820
So fortunately before I
went out there, I go, Dan,

800
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,890
exactly how does this theater in the
round work? And he goes, it's no big deal.

801
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:03,070
He goes, it's just like, it's like four
theaters. There's one in front of you,

802
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,880
one of the right, one of the left and one
behind Ya. Just break it up like that.

803
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:11,650
Then all of a sudden it didn't, it, it
just made sense. And I went out there,

804
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:13,690
he actually had a great car.
I mean I was freaking out.

805
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,090
I knew I was going to be doing the Gig
for about six days and I was just going

806
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:16,924
along,
my God,

807
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,080
is this going to be a bunch of Facebook
hotties and I'm going to go up there

808
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:23,380
saying [inaudible] every other word and
they're just going to be looking at me

809
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:26,830
like Wednesday and coming on, this
guy is angry. But they weren't.

810
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:31,210
They were fucking awesome and
they totally listened. And, uh,

811
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,990
I was probably,
uh,

812
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,160
one of the best 10 minutes sets I
think I've ever had as far as, uh,

813
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,180
how many times you got to do a 10
minutes set and you get to look up at a

814
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:43,420
Stanley Cup champion banner,
you know,

815
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,420
by the way, why is Madison Square Garden?
Um, I'm not trying to be a dick here.

816
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,820
Why is it considered a basketball Mecca?

817
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,840
They always say that like a Michael
Jordan would go there. It's, you know,

818
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,760
it's a basketball Mecca.
Lebron James. It's,

819
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:03,790
it's a basketball and then we say that
it's a basketball Mecca. All right.

820
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,290
Now fans of the New York Knicks.
All right.

821
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,630
And you're a true fan right now if
you're still watching those bumps. Okay.

822
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:15,640
He going through a real rough patch.
Um, I wanna I want you to justify,

823
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,140
send me an email and tell me,

824
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:22,141
explain to me how Madison Square Garden
is considered a basketball Mecca.

825
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,170
How,
okay.

826
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:29,630
The Knicks haven't won a
championship since 1972.

827
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,810
I think they won their
other one in like 69 or 70.

828
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,450
They've won two championships. The
fucking spurs have won. Like what?

829
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:42,170
Four five.
How is Madison Square Garden?

830
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:45,980
A basketball Mecca if that's a mecca.
What was the old Boston Garden?

831
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,510
We won 16 there.

832
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:48,870
Okay,

833
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,110
well say like the La Forum,
the La Forum,

834
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:55,790
they won a five, six, seven.

835
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,820
I don't know what they want their, they
want a good, they weren't like nine.

836
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:02,180
I think they won nine out there. Okay. If,

837
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:06,230
if if Madison Square Garden, I'm not
gonna, I'm not being a dick here.

838
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,230
New York City is a
basketball Mecca that wow,

839
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,150
a Rutger park or whatever the
fuck it is with a goat. Right?

840
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,550
He used to fucking, uh, uh,

841
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,470
lift up a refrigerator and put it on top
of the back board is not how the year

842
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,490
the urban myth goes or whatever the
fuck it was. Lew Alcindor. Right.

843
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:30,170
All those guys came from
there. I understand that. I
understand all those players,

844
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,230
but there's only been the fuck,

845
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,950
there's two championship banners
hanging in Madison Square Garden. Okay.

846
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,660
So I'm going to kind of be a jerk here
and say that it's not a basketball Mecca.

847
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,980
I don't think you've earned the
right, what? College basketball maybe,

848
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,330
you know, I dunno. I think you'll like it.

849
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:50,990
I think you guys really
need to win a lot more.

850
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:55,740
The fucking Chicago Bulls
when six in the 90s well,

851
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,260
it's the first three at old Chicago
Stadium and then the other three.

852
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:00,750
What at the United Center? Is that how
it went? I don't, I don't fucking know.

853
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:05,370
All I'm saying is, uh, you guys need to
bring that down a little bit. You know,

854
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,250
that's like you ever see like when
you see a restaurant, they, they,

855
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:13,110
they'll say a welcome to
two world famous blah, blah,

856
00:52:13,111 --> 00:52:17,940
blahs. And you sit in there really,
really, they know about this in Portugal.

857
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,780
They don't, you're just saying
that and I think that fucking,

858
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:26,781
you know what Madison Square Garden is
just like Ray's famous pizza in New York

859
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,700
City.
Every fucking one claims to be.

860
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,290
Yeah,

861
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:35,290
there's a couple of co, there's a
couple of comedy clubs. The Ward,

862
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,510
the world famous fucking Yuk, Yuk, slap
a knee, whatever the fuck they call them.

863
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,380
It's like, it's not world
famous. It's not alright.

864
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,620
It isn't okay. Did I did? I
did. I beat that to death.

865
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,440
I really got off the rails here.
Let me get back to my fucking story here.

866
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,060
All right.
Um,

867
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,980
so the first night I go Yankees won the
world series and their fans keep me up,

868
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,330
um, for like three hours.
All right. And uh, oh,

869
00:53:00,331 --> 00:53:04,290
I actually congratulated the Yankees
on, uh, on the radio the next day,

870
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:07,720
which is probably very surprising to a
lot of people if you'd like to hear it.

871
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:12,690
Go to the Wa just Google Bill Burr
Opie and Anthony show a Yankee rant.

872
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:14,310
For some reason they called it a rant,

873
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:18,390
but I was actually congratulating them
and I met everything that I said and it

874
00:53:18,391 --> 00:53:21,420
might've sounded like I was being
a little sarcastic, but I wasn't.

875
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,270
Anyways,
let me plow ahead.

876
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,840
So the next night I opened for Dane
at Madison Square Garden, right?

877
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:31,890
I'm fucking is pictures of like
Frank Sinatra and, and an Elvis,

878
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,980
I'm talking to the security guard
has been there for 40 years.

879
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:38,250
He's pointing out where Mike Milbury went
into the stands and beat that guy with

880
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:42,930
his own fucking shoe. Right? The guys
ever seen that. And of course not.

881
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,700
You're not hockey fans.
Actually look,

882
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:49,140
look up Boston Bruins fight fans.
Just look that up.

883
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,990
There's a Bruins rangers game and
I think it was Terry O'Reilly.

884
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:55,050
Somebody grabbed this stick and they
hit him with it thinking, you know,

885
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,470
typical fan, like the,
like, that's not a real guy.

886
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,990
He's on skates. I have fucking chuck
Taylor's on. He can't catch me.

887
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:04,860
I don't know how he did it,

888
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:09,390
but Terry Riley climbed up the fucking
glass and grab this guy and then the rest

889
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:12,550
of the Bruins followed him
in the stands. And, um,

890
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,530
this is how far we've come as a society.
Back then.

891
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:21,450
That was probably a story for about five
days. There were lawsuits or whatever,

892
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:25,050
but you never heard about, there was no
fucking ESPN. It was ed came and it went,

893
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,590
there wasn't suspended
for life, you know? No.

894
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:31,920
Latrell Sprewell kind of shit.
Nothing. They went up there,

895
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,020
they beat fans with their own clothing,

896
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,930
and then they went back on the ice and
they finish the fucking game as far as I

897
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:41,430
know. Um, anyway, so
then Friday night I, uh,

898
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,730
I did my first theater Gig and I
want to thank everybody who came out.

899
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,040
There was a huge milestone in my career
to be able to perform in a theater in

900
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:54,870
New York City and sell the thing
out. Um, everything went awesome.

901
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:59,190
I got a standing ovation and, um, had, uh,

902
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,670
three killer comics on in front
of me, Joe De Rosa, Paul Versey,

903
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:04,620
and then there was this girl,
this contest winner.

904
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,570
And of course her name escapes me at this
point because I talk on my cell phone

905
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:13,140
too much and I can't remember
any fucking thing anymore. Oh.

906
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:16,830
And speaking of that Shit,
uh, not, I'll stay on track,

907
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:20,190
they'll stay on track because I was
making a couple of corrections from last

908
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,023
week. But, uh,

909
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,410
so Saturday night comes Saturday
night I was up in Boston,

910
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:28,760
I did the comics,
come home with a cam,

911
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:30,600
Elian Denis leary and
all that type of shit.

912
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,310
And that was in front of 6,000 people.

913
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:37,311
So basically over three days I went
on in front of a almost 25,000 people.

914
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,780
And,
uh,

915
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,930
now I'm sitting in my bedroom talking
to myself and do an orange fucking

916
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:50,310
microphone. So you know, I'm coming down
a little bit, getting back to reality,

917
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:55,410
you know, how's that for a fucking
weekend? I can't believe it.

918
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:59,130
Unbelievable. I can't believe it.
And then he says unbelievable.

919
00:55:59,131 --> 00:56:01,650
Just in case you didn't realize
that it was unbelievable right now.

920
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:05,610
You know what's funny about me? I'm
actually self conscious right now that a,

921
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:08,480
I talked about so much good shit
that happened to me. That's,

922
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:13,080
that's what it's like to be a fucking
German Irish Catholic from Boston.

923
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:16,380
That's what it is. Oh my God. A bunch of
good stuff happened. I should feel guilty,

924
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,890
you know? And I almost said, fuck you
to you guys. Like you're actually,

925
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:24,040
you give a shit. Either way. I really
got issues. All right, let's uh,

926
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,330
let's make a couple of corrections. All
right. Last week, that racist movie,

927
00:56:28,331 --> 00:56:32,790
I was trying to remember the name of it's
birth of a nation and I want to thank

928
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:35,820
the 87 people who brought
that to my attention.

929
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,480
And I also mentioned I was going to
read a book about how to speak better on

930
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:42,450
stage using,
using my voice correctly.

931
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:46,500
And people wanted to know the name of
the book that I was reading actually lied

932
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:50,250
to you. I'm not reading it.
I keep starting the book,
but it's really involved.

933
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,040
It's just select your daughter from
his emotional and you're never bored.

934
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,680
And I'm just like, oh
my God, I hate school.

935
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:59,850
And then I close it and then I'll read
like slashes autobiography or like,

936
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,540
what's the guy from the red hot
chili peppers? Anthony Kiedis.

937
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,990
I'm sort of skipping around his biography.
Um,

938
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:12,240
but the name of the book is called
freeing the natural voice by Kristen link

939
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:13,074
ladder.

940
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,500
Yeah.

941
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,850
All right. L I. N. K. L. A. T. E. R. M.

942
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,840
I just been doing a lot of shows and a,

943
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,850
I have a tendency to yell from my throat
rather than down here by the fucking

944
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:30,340
diaphragm. You liked it here? That
that's fucking Ray's famous pizza.

945
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,610
That's an awful burger from a diner.
And that's uh,

946
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:41,500
some bar pizza that I got up in
Boston trying so hard to get in shape.

947
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:45,320
I just don't think it's going to happen.
Fuck that pat.

948
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:48,500
The whole fucking goddamn summer
to get in shape and I didn't do it.

949
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:51,740
I've been a fucking idiot like
usual and waiting til the last week,

950
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,100
like one of these chicks on the
shows right now. I just don't eat.

951
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,390
Then I show up in a strapless
dress with my fucking, my fucking,

952
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:03,020
I was just say clavicle showing. Is that
set though? Is that a word? Collarbone.

953
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,850
There you go.
What does the clavicle,

954
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,970
is that that thing on your
back that looks like a sale.

955
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,330
What is that your shoulder blade?
Is that call the clavicle?

956
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,970
I don't fucking remember when it radius
Ulna. Tarsal metatarsal Phalanges.

957
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Um, anyways, let's uh, let's
plow ahead here with the podcast.

958
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,670
So I'm actually now I'm like hardcore.
There's no turning back.

959
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,820
I have to drop like 10 pounds before my
special or my big fucking TV kitchen,

960
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,730
kitchen, TV sized head is going
to look fucking ridiculous on TV.

961
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:36,541
So I really got it.

962
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:40,620
I got to get the booze weight off and
I'm actually just went for a bike ride.

963
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,610
Um, I was hiking up one of these parks
out here, out here, Griffith Park,

964
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:48,900
you know the observatory. Did you guys
ever see a, that James Dean movie?

965
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,650
Then he filmed something up
there or Charlie's angels.

966
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,490
And when those four skinny whores are up
there with their botox in their fucking

967
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,330
twats hanging out, remember that last
scene that, that, that's the observatory.

968
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:06,350
So the other day I was hiking up to it
on foot and I see this fucking like 55

969
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:10,710
year old guy,
white hair pedaling up the hill.

970
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,550
Like he's in a fucking Viagra commercial.
And I'd go look at that son of a bitch.

971
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,970
You know, when he had all the,
all the, he had all these sheep,

972
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,770
he had the whole getup on, you know,
the whole Lance Armstrong outfit.

973
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:21,500
Like he's gonna,
you know,

974
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,540
ride through Paris and throw his hands
up right under the OCTA triumph. Right.

975
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:29,570
Rather than, he's just riding up
a hill in the middle of a desert,

976
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:33,590
sucking in bus fucking fumes. But I was
impressed and I was like, you know what,

977
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,070
if that old bastard can do it,
you know, and I got to admit,

978
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,720
55 in La is like 32.
The way these people work out out here.

979
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,730
All right. And, uh,

980
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:47,840
I'm sorry to the people in the middle
of the middle of this country and a down

981
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:50,900
south. All right. I just love
it. People do that when they,

982
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,480
when they insult you and then they say
they're sorry, but you know, they're not,

983
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,343
you know,

984
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,680
I get that a lot at the end of my
show is I didn't think you were funny.

985
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:02,600
You know? I mean, I'm sorry I
didn't, and I'm always like, okay,

986
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:07,670
yeah, yeah. Cause you know, it's
like, I know other people did,

987
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:11,630
but you know, it's like, you know,
I'm sorry, I just, I just didn't,

988
01:00:11,631 --> 01:00:16,610
why do you keep a pile? You're
not sorry. You're not sorry. Okay.

989
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:17,031
I got it.

990
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,450
You don't like me and I don't give a shit
because you already paid for a ticket.

991
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,300
You paid to watch me ignore you.

992
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,730
And I find that I find that humorous.
Um, and he was, let's plow ahead.

993
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,780
So I figured I gave myself 10 days to be
able to fucking make it all the way up

994
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:35,290
to this Goddamn Hill and uh,

995
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,340
just did it today and it made
it all the way up to the top.

996
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,970
I'm not gonna lie to Ya. I feel like
I'm going to fucking die. But I, uh,

997
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,400
I actually made it up there.
So now I don't know what to do.

998
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,540
I thought that that was going to be my
project. I would just do that every day.

999
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,130
And every day I get a little bit farther.

1000
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,010
And while I would focus on
the carrot in front of me,

1001
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:54,890
I would just drop this booze weight,
right?

1002
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,420
But what happens the first fucking day?
I go all the way up the God damn thing.

1003
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:04,130
It's now what do I do?
You know what I gotta do?

1004
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:07,280
I got to join a gym and I
got a Tro to weights around.

1005
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,940
That's what I got to do. You
know what? In the mail today,

1006
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:15,560
I got a free 30 days at Gold's gym.
Anybody work at a gym?

1007
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,200
How was this free?
30 days going to work out for me.

1008
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:23,480
Sign up for three 30 for free.
I can't even fucking talk.

1009
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,780
The Hell is wrong with me.
I know what's wrong with me.

1010
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:30,650
I fucking flown like 200 hours on a
plane the last goddamn two months.

1011
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,650
You should have seen this fucking douche
bag putting his coat in the overhead

1012
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,290
compartment on my flight out here.

1013
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,520
I couldn't tell if this guy had the
biggest Yamaka on I'd ever seen in my life

1014
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,250
or he had just shrunk his jazz hat,
you know,

1015
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:53,630
you know those little jazz hats that
those black guys were and then the white

1016
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:57,410
guys were when when they get into jazz
to try to act like they get it to,

1017
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:02,120
you know those ones, they're the
little African colors, you know,

1018
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,060
and you just sit there and
talking about a Charlie Parker,

1019
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,130
you know, and your version of salt
peanuts or whatever the fuck it is.

1020
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,350
And
I don't know what it was.

1021
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,980
Any Jewish people listen to

1022
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,740
this shit? Huh? Let me ask you a question.

1023
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:27,060
Is it technically still a Yamaka when
it almost goes to the front of the guys

1024
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:29,880
hairline in all the way to the two ways.
I mean, this thing, it looked like a,

1025
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,830
like a, what does that thing
the Mexicans do? They use the,

1026
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,470
uh, the Tortilla, right?

1027
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,440
How fucking ignorant and I have
every goddamn culture out there.

1028
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,520
I thought a Yamaka was, it was
a beanie. Is that incorrect?

1029
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,720
I call him a beanie for a long time and
I always used to get looks. I was like,

1030
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:51,300
yeah, the guy had the fuck and
I had the fucking beanie thing,

1031
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,310
the a and then I get looks and it's
like, oh, it's cause I cursed. That's I,

1032
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,460
I say fuck when I'm trying to gather
my thoughts sometimes the fucking, uh,

1033
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,450
beanie rather than saying the, um, Oh gee,

1034
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:04,740
what is that thing called the beanie?

1035
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,160
I put the fucking in front of it
and then it adds an extra edge to it

1036
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,930
inadvertently. And people like, oh my God,
he doesn't like Jewish people with hats.

1037
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,450
Um,
is it a beanie or as a beanie?

1038
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:18,990
That thing with the little propeller
on top of it and another question.

1039
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,850
Did anybody ever have those?

1040
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,600
Does anybody old enough to actually
answer that fucking question?

1041
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,190
Is that one of those Hollywood things,

1042
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,450
cartoon things that they just acted like
people used to have those back in the

1043
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,760
day, I know kids used to wear
those little raccoon hats.

1044
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,720
You know back when there
was game all over the place.

1045
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,040
You know mothers made pies and
stuck them on window sills.

1046
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,070
Stanley, if you're going to
shoot it, you bet it cook it.

1047
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,210
We're going to have to eat it.
Right?

1048
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,940
The white people ever say
that or did we just waste?

1049
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:52,930
Have we always just wasted shit?
We've always had the MTV

1050
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:57,360
cribs approach to fucking nature
having way white people didn't.

1051
01:03:57,361 --> 01:04:00,240
Buffalo bill used to just ride
around shooting buffalo in the head,

1052
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,700
laughing his ass off to that Fu Manchu
that connected to his sideburns. You know

1053
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,350
what? How much more did you increase
your odds of having your leg sold off,

1054
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,650
sold off, sought off
what you drank, brandy,

1055
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,920
if you had that little
fucking that Fu Manchu,

1056
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,820
what does that one called as far as the
facial hair masking? A lot of questions.

1057
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,500
Maybe I should have done some research.

1058
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,960
The only person I've seen with that is
that Guy Lemmy from Motorhead and then

1059
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:33,790
afterwards, the dude from Metallica
had it. He had it for a minute there.

1060
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,000
James Hetfield,
why don't we get to the questions here?

1061
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:38,650
I seem to be asking a
lot of questions here.

1062
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:42,940
Why don't I get to some of your questions
and I'll try to answer them a question.

1063
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,520
Bill,
I have two questions.

1064
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:50,590
I can't help but notice these fucking
annoying commercials and ads about selling

1065
01:04:50,591 --> 01:04:52,900
your gold.
Um,

1066
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,470
I wondered whether or not you thought
this was a conspiracy to round up all the

1067
01:04:56,471 --> 01:05:01,210
gold still owned by individuals so
that when the dollar completely tanks,

1068
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:06,010
the people won't have anything
of worth for themselves. Uh, no,

1069
01:05:06,011 --> 01:05:07,210
I don't think it's a conspiracy.

1070
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:11,200
I just think that those guys late night
are doing a much smaller version of the

1071
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:16,201
scam that bankers did originally is
what they're doing is they're taking,

1072
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,550
and they're just giving people
a piece of paper for it.

1073
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:24,820
But it's not as bad as when the
banks, the banks did it. They said,

1074
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:28,210
give us your gold and we'll give you
these little pieces of paper that are

1075
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:31,420
redeemable anytime you want,
you can come back and get your gold.

1076
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:37,390
And needless to say, eventually, uh, you
couldn't claim your gold anymore. And uh,

1077
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,620
they just sort of cap it.

1078
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:40,780
Okay.

1079
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,920
No one knows where it is cause
you can't audit them. Um, so yeah,

1080
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,180
that's what those guys are doing.

1081
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,430
They're anticipating I probably the
tanking of the dollar, they get the,

1082
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,191
I don't know if you guys,

1083
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:52,870
have you seen those commercials
where they're just like,

1084
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,920
I just do a bit about it. You
know, if you got an old class ring,

1085
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:00,460
if you've got a broken bracelet,
if you got some busted jewelry,

1086
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:05,110
sandy in your gold and we will give you
cash for it, that's what they're doing.

1087
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,530
Um, and for those of you
think I'm a fucking moron,

1088
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,910
if you had a sandwich shop and somebody
walked in and tried to buy a sandwich

1089
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,870
sandwich with some rubles,
you tell him to go fuck themselves.

1090
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:21,310
But if somebody who came from a country
that used to use rubles but at a handful

1091
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:25,480
of gold, you know, you still would
be like, dude, what the fuck?

1092
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:29,260
I don't know what gold is trading it,
but you'd know that the gold had value.

1093
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:34,510
Okay. That's the great thing about
gold all around the fucking world.

1094
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,710
You can get yourself a god damn sandwich
with a piece of gold. I challenge you

1095
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:43,520
to buy anything with the fucking
ruble. Go ahead and do it. Um,

1096
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,610
or some defunct the yen. Did they
have that anymore in Japan? Bill,

1097
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:51,460
you're getting in over your head. Shut
the fuck up. Just keep moving. So no,

1098
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:52,780
I don't think that that's a conspiracy.

1099
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:57,340
I just think that that's one of the
oldest scams in the book. And uh,

1100
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:01,420
JP Morgan and the guys had,
was it Jekyll's island or
whatever? Federal Reserve.

1101
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:05,890
Those guys perfected it.
God bless him. Shame on us.

1102
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,510
Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool us
for fucking a hundred years and a yeah,

1103
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:13,210
we're fucking morons. Okay, next one. Um,

1104
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:16,390
also I'll be coming to Cleveland to see
you and wondered if the same guy that

1105
01:07:16,391 --> 01:07:19,810
opened for you in Pittsburgh, we'll be
offering for you in Cleveland as well.

1106
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,550
Um,

1107
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:22,420
okay.

1108
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:26,270
Oh, that was Doug Synn. Yay. Doug. Seen
Yay. Getting some props. Ducks in. Yeas.

1109
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:30,610
Hilarious. I kind of rotate my
openers. Um, when I go to Cleveland,

1110
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,580
who's it going to be?
Ryan Dalton and Jason Law head.

1111
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:37,030
Actually a two guys that I've known
for about five years right now.

1112
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:41,680
They're based out of Cleveland. Travel
all around. Absolutely fucking hilarious.

1113
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,060
And A, I lose half my liver every time
I go out there and work with them.

1114
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:49,450
So I love those guys and they're going
to be open and they're fucking hilarious.

1115
01:07:49,451 --> 01:07:54,280
So, uh, if you're wondering if I'm going
to have a funny opener. Yes, I am. Um,

1116
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:57,070
next question.
Bill is a say of bills and the Sabres fan.

1117
01:07:57,071 --> 01:08:02,071
I think I have it the worst with two lost
Stanley cups and for lost super bowls.

1118
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:07,420
And 11 years, 11 years without a playoff
appearance. Do you think I'm right?

1119
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,960
No, I don't. I do not. I think you
definitely have it bad. But um,

1120
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,670
for the longest time everybody talked
Boston and then we won a bunch of shit.

1121
01:08:17,671 --> 01:08:18,560
So that was over.

1122
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:23,150
And they have been talking about the
cubs Blahblahblahblahblah but I think the

1123
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:26,870
worst city to be a fan in
right now is Cleveland.

1124
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,820
Very quietly.

1125
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:34,130
Those guys have gone my entire
life and nobody has won anything.

1126
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,800
The Cleveland browns have
never won a super bowl.

1127
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:42,080
The Cleveland Cavaliers have
never won an NBA championship.

1128
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:47,081
And the Cleveland Indians haven't
won a world series since 1948 so,

1129
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,630
and less your in your seventies.

1130
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:52,190
Okay.

1131
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:56,810
Um, for all extensive purposes, the
Indians have never won a world series.

1132
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,930
Do you understand that? Cause you gotta
be like at least like eight years old,

1133
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:02,480
nine years old to remember
a fucking world series.

1134
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:03,980
Now some douche bags going to email me.

1135
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,000
Actually always chicks do your job when
the Tigers won it in [inaudible] 68 who

1136
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:12,080
gives a fuck? You know what
I'm saying? Don't be a cunt.

1137
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:17,060
All right. Um, so I would
say that they have it worse.

1138
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:20,450
Um, but yeah, you guys are,
you know, you're right there.

1139
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,640
You're right there with them. That's
one of those things. It's like,

1140
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:26,930
do you really want to win that argument?
Remember long time ESPN, long time ago,

1141
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:29,180
ESPN did, who has the,
who had the worst curse,

1142
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:34,181
the Boston red sox or the Chicago cubs
and they did this stupid trial and they

1143
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:38,780
had like George Wendt from cheers who's
a Chicago guy. He's arguing to be like,

1144
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:42,260
no, we're more miserable. And
it's just like, all right,

1145
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,210
you want to win that contest?
That's all you.

1146
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,570
Who the fuck would want to win the
misery contest? It's really beyond me.

1147
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:52,450
So congratulations. You didn't win it.
I think people in, uh, Cleveland, um,

1148
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,290
our world, I think, how do
you think those guys feel?

1149
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:57,710
Have to fucking guys with world series
rings this year. It used to be, uh,

1150
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:02,270
used to be on the fucking Indians were
half the guys in the world series, right?

1151
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:06,830
Cc Sabathia. Ah, fuck.

1152
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,500
Who was the other guy? God dammit,
I had them right at the tip.

1153
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:14,390
I got to stop talking on my cell phone.
Manny Ramirez.

1154
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,750
Okay. We'll see how the last couple of
years, Manny Ramirez, red sox bought him,

1155
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,080
right cc Sabathia the fucking a Yankees
bought that dude via the brewers.

1156
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,370
Who else did, Jim told me play
on the Phillies last year.

1157
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,170
Yeah.

1158
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,660
I mean the Indian should've won it.
They should have won it.

1159
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:36,290
But the way baseball is is a, you
know, it's not competitive anymore.

1160
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:39,890
That's why I'm kind of a,
I think I'm tapping out on baseball.

1161
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:44,300
I don't give a shit anymore. Uh, I dunno.

1162
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:47,510
In my world competition, I
was right. Actually wrote an
email to a guy about this.

1163
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:51,920
I met my world. Competition is our
best guys. First. Your best guys,

1164
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,070
best team wins.
That's to me is competition.

1165
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:59,810
I don't think competition is our
best guys. Plus your best guys,

1166
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:03,920
verse whatever the Fuck you
have left. Stupid. You know,

1167
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,480
she met when you were kids and you'll
be choosing up sides, you know,

1168
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,780
and right off the bat of two of the best
guys were on the same side or in the

1169
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:14,070
end it seemed uneven.
People feel,

1170
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,150
and when I was from, and it was
called smug teams, Smu, see k,

1171
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:22,260
I've never heard that anywhere else. I
was like, suck with an eminent snuck.

1172
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,080
People ignore smoke.
TMZ teams are smug. Hey,

1173
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:28,120
what the fuck that's,

1174
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,870
that should have been said like
during the little rascals era,

1175
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:34,050
but some reason it was said during
my childhood digs a smug teams.

1176
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,260
So then you had to break them up.
You had to break up the evil empire,

1177
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:41,640
the fucking, the fucking Yankees
or the red sox Dodgers or whatever.

1178
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:44,310
Any one of these teams. I mean the, the
Yankees are in a league of their own,

1179
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:45,144
but you know what I'm saying?

1180
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,730
Red Sox and all them are just as
much part of the fucking problem.

1181
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,540
They would break up any of those kids
know enough to break up those fucking

1182
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:55,560
teams. All right. Anyways, plowing ahead.

1183
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,770
Um, let's read, uh,

1184
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,400
what the fuck was I going to read here?
Um,

1185
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:09,150
questions. I already did this.
This is called broads over
there. Broads over there.

1186
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,670
I don't know what the hell it
says. Let's read this one. Bill.

1187
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,920
I had been a fan of yours sometime.
Just want to tell you that.

1188
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:16,800
I think you're a great thank you.
Why don't I fucking delete those?

1189
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:22,350
I think your comedy of up to put the
all right.

1190
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:26,600
Anyways, the reason I am writing you
is to tell you a funny story. Uh,

1191
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:30,030
my girl dating five plus years
now and I live in Tucson,

1192
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:34,740
Arizona and she's always bitching at me
saying, we never do anything anymore.

1193
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,420
Well, my job is very consuming of my
time and I realized that she was correct.

1194
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,710
So what do I do?

1195
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,920
So what I do is I try to come up with
something we could do together that would

1196
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:45,270
be entertaining and unique,

1197
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,810
something different that is not
an average night out in Tucson se.

1198
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,900
The guy's using his brain,
trying to surprise her. Anyways,

1199
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:56,190
I've been telling her about your comedy
and showing her clips of you, uh,

1200
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:58,800
that I found on your myspace
page for the past few months.

1201
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:01,080
She really seemed to enjoy
it and laughed hysterically.

1202
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,690
So I planned this great evening
for the 20th of November. Um,

1203
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,800
which goes something like this,
head up to temp Eav,

1204
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,790
have a nice dinner and head over to the
Improv and watch your show a your eight

1205
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:13,530
o'clock show.
Um,

1206
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:16,260
while I bought the tickets and thought I
would surprise her with the whole thing,

1207
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:21,030
she loved the idea and she
was very excited and I was
pleased to see her excited

1208
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,760
about the event.
Well,

1209
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:27,300
we were telling our friends about
it and she sort of says this, well,

1210
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:31,890
it's his evening and I'm just
thought of tagging along. Uh,

1211
01:13:31,891 --> 01:13:33,460
I got to admit that,
um,

1212
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:37,080
I was a little upset at this point because
I intended this whole thing to be a

1213
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:38,490
gift from me to her,

1214
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:42,210
which is funny because this is very
similar to the story that you told on

1215
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:47,211
October 19 on the October 19th podcasts
when you took your girl in the corvette

1216
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:50,490
up the PCH.
She just sort of shut a,

1217
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:53,430
she just showed it sort of shut me down.
Um,

1218
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:57,240
so my question to you is
why is it never enough?

1219
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,490
Ah,
what a great question.

1220
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:03,210
Do you realize you just asked the question
of properly every guy on this fucking

1221
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,550
podcast. Um, hold on.

1222
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:08,260
I'm just going to pause here while
the women rolled their eyes and I go,

1223
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,770
that's bullshit. That's
not true. It's just you.

1224
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,980
You got to use your imagination.
What did like surprises?

1225
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:21,010
They just fucking
shut up.

1226
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,200
Just shut up.
What'd you do?

1227
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:28,780
You just shut up and take off all those
fucking layers. It's not the 18 hundreds,

1228
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,733
you know,

1229
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:34,240
with your panties and your panty hose
and your slip and you're fucking skirt.

1230
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:39,730
All right. What am I talking
about? I Dunno. Um, anyways,

1231
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,900
uh, I lost my place. So
my question to you is,

1232
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,750
why is it never enough?
I can do everything she wants,

1233
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:51,370
but she was still find a way to make
me look like an asshole. Making me a,

1234
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,540
making it seem like I'm dragging her
around and making her do all that stuff

1235
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:56,410
that I want to do.

1236
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:01,360
I guess that is why I relate to your
comedy because it seems that she is only

1237
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:06,010
happy when we do all the things that she
wants to do. Uh, you don't want to talk,

1238
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:10,780
you don't want to talk about with Brunch
Street Fairs in the candle store. Uh,

1239
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,110
nevertheless, we are going
and really looking forward
to seeing you in person. Uh,

1240
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,400
I hope to see you have to show selling
some cds and DVDs. All right. Um,

1241
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:23,020
why is it never enough? I
don't know. I don't know why.

1242
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,440
I don't know if it's an
insecurity that they are,

1243
01:15:26,441 --> 01:15:29,860
they're always questioning whether
you truly love them or not.

1244
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:35,050
Um,
I have no idea.

1245
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,180
I don't know why. I mean, I would think

1246
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,310
okay.

1247
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:42,160
That, all right. Look, look,
look at me. Okay. I want it.

1248
01:15:42,161 --> 01:15:43,630
I rented a corvette for the day,

1249
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:46,600
core Vectren verbal and I
drove my girl all around La.

1250
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:50,950
We went up the fucking Pacific
coast highway, looked at
the ocean, we had lunch.

1251
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,790
I took her out to this
beautiful bar late at night.

1252
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:58,030
I drove through the Hollywood hills
with the top down, looking at the stars,

1253
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:01,540
looking at the lights out over the city.
I thought it was a very romantic thing.

1254
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:05,170
And then I got on the podcast and she was
just like, yeah, that was really just,

1255
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,100
that was really your thing. I
just did that for you. You know,

1256
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:13,660
I just thought of that there
in a $70,000 automobile,

1257
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:14,763
you know,

1258
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:20,750
seeing views that people fly six
hours to see and just, you know,

1259
01:16:20,751 --> 01:16:25,430
just got a free lunch out of it and
free fucking drinks and you have a watch

1260
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,370
surprises right there.
You just spit on my own microphone.

1261
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,000
You ever had a price is right. You
have watched the prices, right? Sure.

1262
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,810
We all have. Okay. Getting
a corvette, I mean like,

1263
01:16:35,811 --> 01:16:40,280
and then go into that
restaurant and driving up to
PCH and looking at the lights

1264
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,200
and going up to the fucking bar in
the hotel with John Belushi. Oh, deed.

1265
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,900
Isn't that, that sounds like one of
one of those showcases. She's like,

1266
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:52,430
get your bid on. Are you going to bid?
Oh, you're going to pass, you know?

1267
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,560
Oh Dude. You know what? Speaking
of that, I was watching,

1268
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:00,020
I was watching the prices
right the other day and uh,

1269
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:03,350
I had like a white guilt
moment. Okay, this,

1270
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:07,320
this black dude goes up to go spin
the big fucking wheel, all right?

1271
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:11,060
And you know, you know, deal. If for those
of you who don't live in this country,

1272
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,830
you basically,
you spin the wheel,

1273
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:17,840
whoever comes close to a dot closest to
a dollar without going over guests to

1274
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:20,540
then go on and bid on the big surprises,
all right?

1275
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,390
That's for people in England and Australia
and all that shit who email me if you

1276
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:25,430
don't know the show.
So basically

1277
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,650
they have every denomination from 5 cents,
10 cents,

1278
01:17:29,651 --> 01:17:31,630
1530 40,

1279
01:17:31,631 --> 01:17:34,780
45 50 55 60 all the way up to $1.

1280
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:40,890
So this like 55 year old black dude
spins the wheel and it stops on 30 cents.

1281
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,940
Okay?
Now you can decide to stay or spin again.

1282
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:54,820
Now I'm not a fucking math
petition, but I think, uh,

1283
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,820
you want to hit on 30 cents, right? You
want it? He's looking out at the crowd.

1284
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,190
I'm like, is this guy fucking kidding
me? And I'm kind of laughing going,

1285
01:18:03,191 --> 01:18:06,070
all right? He's a little bit old.
He's a little bit older, right?

1286
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,850
His family's going to straighten it out
for him and he looks out in the crowd.

1287
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,550
I don't know if they told them.
I don't know what the fuck they told him,

1288
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,730
but he goes,
I'm going to stay.

1289
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:21,430
He stayed on 30 cents and I'm looking
at drew Carey going like, all right,

1290
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:24,730
I know what Bob Barker would do. Bob
Barker would be like, okay, wait a minute.

1291
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:29,140
You sure you want to stay on this?
30 cents is really low.

1292
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,320
He would have helped him through it,
but drew Carey just went like,

1293
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:35,740
he's going to stay on 30 cents. All
right, let's bring up the next person.

1294
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,970
So the dude is standing there with the
30 cents up above them and I wanted to

1295
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:42,820
laugh my ass off and be like,
what a stupid fuck.

1296
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,510
But then I felt guilty because it was a
black dude and I'd be white laughing at

1297
01:18:46,511 --> 01:18:49,930
this black guy. Like he's a
moron and that's one of the best.

1298
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,080
The worst thing about racists is a ruined
your ability to be able to laugh at a

1299
01:18:56,591 --> 01:18:57,424
moron

1300
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:59,860
because he's another color.

1301
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,430
Then all because it's all of a sudden
it becomes this ugly thing. You know,

1302
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,700
I give a fuck what color you are.
If you're playing a game,

1303
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,370
we are trying to come close to a
dollar and you stop at 30 cents,

1304
01:19:09,371 --> 01:19:11,530
you're a fucking moron.
And I should be able to laugh.

1305
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:15,910
And I was laughing and then I felt bad.
And then I actually thought, oh shit,

1306
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:19,060
someone's going to take that clip and
they're going to put it up on youtube and

1307
01:19:19,061 --> 01:19:22,180
then someone's going to write a bunch
of racist shit underneath it rather than

1308
01:19:22,181 --> 01:19:26,590
sticking with the subject
that this individual who
happens to be a black dude is

1309
01:19:26,591 --> 01:19:28,270
a fucking moron,
you know?

1310
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:32,380
Or at the very least didn't understand
how the game worked. Look at that.

1311
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,420
I had to get, still had to give
him the benefit of the doubt,

1312
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,390
a fucking game show that's
been on 40 fucking years. Um,

1313
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:43,180
Jesus Christ. How did I get on that
subject? All right, let's get back here.

1314
01:19:43,181 --> 01:19:46,540
So my question is why is it never enough?
You know what?

1315
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:47,980
My girls got the flu right now.

1316
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:51,850
How funny would it be if I actually called
her in here right now with the flu to

1317
01:19:51,851 --> 01:19:55,510
ask her this question.
I'm really jeopardizing my relationship.

1318
01:19:55,511 --> 01:19:58,990
Should I do it everybody? I think I'm
going to do it. Hang on one second.

1319
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:02,170
Let me see if I can get
her in here. Hold on. Amia.

1320
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,293
Yeah.

1321
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,870
Alright. She's coming
in. Don't say anything.

1322
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,690
I'm watching miss finessed
my way through this. Yeah,

1323
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:24,310
it's come on in for a second.
Alright. Making her way in.

1324
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:28,210
Ladies and gentlemen, making her
triumphant return to the podcast.

1325
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:34,780
Look at you. You're officially
sick. Officially sick pajamas,

1326
01:20:34,781 --> 01:20:39,250
socks. Is that orange juice
or you got any booze in there?

1327
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:45,430
Okay. Yes it is everything.
Don't worry Cleo. We'll get it.

1328
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:50,020
All right. Here's a question for you.
Here's a question one of my listeners had.

1329
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:53,830
All right,
I'm not trying to be hostile here.

1330
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,900
This is the female question.

1331
01:20:55,901 --> 01:21:00,901
I know we had a big battle about that
dude who punched that chick in the face,

1332
01:21:01,181 --> 01:21:04,930
right? Yes, we did. Rihanna,
Chris Brown and Chris Brown.

1333
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,130
We had a big argument on the plane
about that. It's really bad. Um,

1334
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,690
all right, so we talk about that
argument or should we get into this?

1335
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:17,740
Why don't we get into this and then we'll
do the argument. Then we'll wrap it up.

1336
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,320
Then we'll segue. There you go. All right.

1337
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,290
I'll read this to you
and then you have to get,

1338
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,980
we have to come closer to the mic
here. Um, don't look over my shoulder.

1339
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,690
She reads way faster than me. It makes
me self conscious. All right. Basically,

1340
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:34,600
there's this guy, he's got a
girl. I'm going to paraphrase.

1341
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:37,530
My listeners don't have to
listen to this shit again. Um,

1342
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,770
they'd been dating for five years.

1343
01:21:38,771 --> 01:21:41,800
She always complains that they never do
anything because the job is very time

1344
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:46,300
consuming. He admits this is,
his job is very time consuming.

1345
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:51,700
Okay. All right. We're on the same
page. We're ready to go. Okay. Listen,

1346
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:52,534
she starts coughing.

1347
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,260
Don't make me,

1348
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:57,260
I've been doing this door everyday,
all day long. I make a lab,

1349
01:21:57,261 --> 01:21:59,820
so she starts coughing.
You're terrible. She's like,

1350
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,930
oh, listen to you. Suddenly

1351
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:11,380
he's selling. You worked in a mine.
Listen to that. That's horrible.

1352
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:17,640
God, how did I ever find you
attractive? Oh my God, I'm
choking you. No, I'm joking.

1353
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,930
I told you are adorable. All Right, nice.

1354
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,640
Any easy, easy. She says,

1355
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,170
Oh my God, this is horrible.
You sound horrible.

1356
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,520
I'm listening. All right. Stop doing that.
Be a performer here. Okay. All right.

1357
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:37,620
Jerry Lewis would have just suck down.

1358
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:43,410
Um,
anyways lady.

1359
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:50,700
See what a great sense of humor she's
got even with 105 degree. So no,

1360
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:52,730
it's not that he doesn't take her,
she say,

1361
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,330
she just said he doesn't take her
anyway. Do you understand that? Yes,

1362
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:59,220
I understand. Okay. He
has a time consuming job.

1363
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,560
She complains that they
don't go a lot of places.

1364
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,100
She's claiming that they don't go anywhere
and he admits that he works a lot and

1365
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,790
might not have enough time here.
Okay.

1366
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:11,380
Just don't side with the broad cause she
has a Twat here. All right. Really? Yeah,

1367
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:14,780
I know I had to go there. It makes
the guys laugh. All right. Uh,

1368
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,740
so anyways,
so then he just,

1369
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:20,400
so he decides he's going to take her
somewhere so he sees that I'm going to be

1370
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:24,610
common in town. Right. He starts showing
clips of me, uh, my, my space page.

1371
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,360
Of course she starts laughing cause I'm
fucking hilarious, right? We know this.

1372
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:32,290
And Hanson. Thank you. All right. So
he goes, all right, this is perfect.

1373
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:34,540
So he gets tickets to
my eight o'clock show.

1374
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,980
He's going to take her out to dinner,

1375
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,950
he's going to take her out to the comedy
show. She says, that's not a good idea.

1376
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,180
He says, yeah, till we site. He
feels like he's fixed the problem.

1377
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:48,450
So the next night they're talking
about it to their friends and uh,

1378
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:51,130
he says where he's going to go
and what they're going to do,

1379
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:54,640
what should we have done and what
shouldn't. We do? Remember that?

1380
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:58,460
No reservoir dogs. Oh yeah, totally.

1381
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:02,800
Like telling jokes are Gig when like
a bunch of girls in a school yard.

1382
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:08,170
Um, sorry. I know. I
do bad impressions. Um,

1383
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:13,000
terrible, terrible. I know.
So, uh, anyway, so then he
finally ends up saying it to,

1384
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:16,900
uh, he brings it up. She brings it up in
front of her friends and she said, well,

1385
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:21,340
it's his evening and I'm just sort of
tagging along. All right. And he's,

1386
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,031
he goes,

1387
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:25,240
I got to admit that I was a little upset
at that point because I intended this

1388
01:24:25,241 --> 01:24:28,800
whole evening thing to be a gift
from me to her. Okay. Right.

1389
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:30,850
So he goes,

1390
01:24:30,851 --> 01:24:34,030
it reminded me of when you took your
girl out in the corvette and you said the

1391
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:36,070
same thing, right? Yeah. So he says,

1392
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:41,071
my question to you is
why is it never enough?

1393
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:49,480
I don't think that it's okay. I
love it. Your tongue tied. Look at,

1394
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:50,860
see what you're doing right now.
No.

1395
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,020
Say what's your exact say
exactly what you're thinking.

1396
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:57,550
Don't do this is you try to figure a way
to spin this shit. Don't spin it. Yeah.

1397
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:00,610
I'm not spinning it because
it's not like it's not enough.

1398
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,970
But I think where she's coming from,
it's not like

1399
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,090
the whole

1400
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,820
he get done. No, no,
no, no. I, like I said,

1401
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:14,900
it comes from this point of insecurity
that you guys never feel loved enough.

1402
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:17,710
Can he listened to me?
It's hard, but yeah. Okay.

1403
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,430
He is a fan of yours first.
She,

1404
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:26,320
she became a fan of yours but
he is like a long time fan. So,

1405
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:30,070
even though she would enjoy
seeing your show, of course it's,

1406
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:34,810
he has more of a connection to you
and your, your comedy than she does.

1407
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:36,520
He has more invested because he's,

1408
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:40,630
he likes you and she just heard of you
I guess when he introduced her to your

1409
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:43,780
clips on youtube and stuff.
So in a way it's like,

1410
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:46,990
oh well I like it and I'll show it to her
and now she thinks it's funny so we'll

1411
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:50,050
make a night out of it. But it's not as
if, I don't know what else she likes.

1412
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:53,200
I mean, I'm sure she likes
going shopping and whatnot.

1413
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,650
So basically the fact that he didn't
say, he didn't say, Hey, you know what,

1414
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:58,120
I have the afternoon free.

1415
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:02,470
You want to like go to the farmer's
market or go like window shopping or

1416
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:06,950
whatever. That would have been an
evening or an afternoon all about her.

1417
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:11,570
That's like the difference. And
so can I interrupt right now? Yes.

1418
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:15,060
It's a relationship. There's
two people. It's not a birthday.

1419
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:16,430
Uh Huh.

1420
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,340
I understand. If it's a birthday,
it's all about her. She goes,

1421
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,600
you never take me anywhere.

1422
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:25,130
So basically the problem here is
the place that he's taking her to,

1423
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,350
he can actually have a good time at,

1424
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:30,890
he should actually take her to
something that he doesn't want to do.

1425
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,381
No,

1426
01:26:32,381 --> 01:26:37,381
I think the issue is that she would have
maybe preferred it if it was 100% all

1427
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:40,130
about her.
Like if it was,

1428
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:43,510
so you guys are selfish
specifically that she wanted to do?

1429
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,780
I don't know if she saw for [inaudible].
Well, it sounds like she's a little,

1430
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:48,990
she's being a little
bratty about it now though.

1431
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,910
I'll take that. That was
very, I, you know what,

1432
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:54,180
I appreciate that they know what the
fact that usually we actually admitted at

1433
01:26:54,181 --> 01:26:56,860
least to the, now I can
listen to your opinion. Yeah,

1434
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:58,400
a lot more open mindedly okay.

1435
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,640
Yes. Okay. I mean she's being a
little bratty to throw that in there,

1436
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:04,980
especially to her friends.
But

1437
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,410
what do you think I would do?
What do you,

1438
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,750
what do you think I would do
if you did that? If, if you,

1439
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:12,390
if you made that comment in front of your
friends. Okay. And then I've already,

1440
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:15,450
I've, I've already stopped
talking to us. We're coming home.

1441
01:27:15,451 --> 01:27:17,070
All we hear is this silent were of her

1442
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:17,983
Prius

1443
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:28,090
C it starts off Julie Somehow.

1444
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,590
Um, I don't think I was being bratty
though when I made the remark. I wasn't,

1445
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:33,600
no,
I understand it now.

1446
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:36,960
What it was was I love the
corvette long before I loved you.

1447
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:42,480
So it really was something
more about me then.

1448
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,790
Well, I don't as, as, as I
smiling too much that day. Is
that what bugged, you know,

1449
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:48,650
listen,

1450
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:52,880
as awesome as it was to ride in
a corvette down the PCH Malibu,

1451
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:55,820
that was fucking amazing.
It was not the,

1452
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:59,000
one of the things that I had on
my mind as something fun to do.

1453
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,870
When you mentioned it, I was like, yeah,
that, that sounds awesome. We did it.

1454
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:03,770
It was even better

1455
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,480
and no, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wait a minute.

1456
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:09,530
As far as your days that you've had out
here in La, where does that one rank?

1457
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:13,670
It's like number two to my birthday.
See?

1458
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,800
Oh, random day in October. So
that was a fucking big time score.

1459
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:21,580
And you still had to be like, wow, that
was really kind of your thing. Why?

1460
01:28:21,581 --> 01:28:22,720
Why would you do that?

1461
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:26,480
You just said that I wasn't being
bratty when I sent it in and now you're,

1462
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,210
now you're,

1463
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:30,570
no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I have memory problems. Wait, what?

1464
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:33,330
When did I say what? I wasn't, I sent,
you weren't being bratty with what

1465
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,121
before?
I said,

1466
01:28:34,121 --> 01:28:36,850
I don't think that I was being bratty
when I said the thing about there and you

1467
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:39,400
were like, no, no, no. I see where
I see where you're coming from.

1468
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:44,590
You just said it and that's not what
I meant. Oh Great. How convenient.

1469
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,730
Look at me.
I can't remember anything from,

1470
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:50,330
I don't have any short term memory
anymore, so I don't know who that guy was.

1471
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:53,450
Who was who. I don't even know if I
was agreeing with you. You know what?

1472
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,950
I'm never taking the stand if I ever
kill anybody because I'm not going to be

1473
01:28:56,951 --> 01:28:57,410
able to

1474
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:01,130
honesty. It was a nice thing
that you did and it was,

1475
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,290
it was unnecessary for me to say that.

1476
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,550
It wasn't that you guys
have to hang on a second.

1477
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:10,580
Why kiss my sick girlfriend blah.
There you go.

1478
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:14,510
It wasn't necessarily see that guys,
I didn't have to slap her around.

1479
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:18,950
I didn't have to call any of them
names over there like Chris Brown.

1480
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:19,990
Oh I know.

1481
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:23,590
And it was unnecessary for her to say
that cause he was trying to do a nice

1482
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:23,771
thing.

1483
01:29:23,771 --> 01:29:28,771
Yes he is more of a fan of you than she
is making it more of an better and more

1484
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:33,040
interesting fun night for him than for
her even though she would have enjoyed it

1485
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,360
but it was unnecessary.

1486
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,590
No, not what most women just
automatically see that with the idea.

1487
01:29:39,591 --> 01:29:43,280
So then would she gets self conscious
and feel like she had to call [inaudible]

1488
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:46,680
call it out before they said it would.

1489
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:50,190
She may be say that because
she's kind of embarrassed

1490
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:55,760
that th that that like, yeah like
cause if he said it, you know,

1491
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:58,990
what are you doing? Oh he's taken me.
See this guy bill Barry says cunt,

1492
01:29:58,991 --> 01:30:03,460
every other word. That's what he's doing
on this romantic night. God Damn it.

1493
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:04,480
I think she might be right.

1494
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:07,990
You know what? Yeah, I bet. What
have happened was, oh, what did,

1495
01:30:07,991 --> 01:30:10,300
what does your boyfriend doing?
Oh, what are you guys doing? Oh,

1496
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:12,520
we're going to dinner and then
we're going to a comedy show.

1497
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:16,600
And I don't think that's necessarily the
first thing on a woman's mind when it

1498
01:30:16,601 --> 01:30:17,980
comes to a romantic evening.

1499
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,870
Okay. Last question. Tell me,

1500
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:23,200
you didn't feel like you were dating
Paul Newman when we were driving up the

1501
01:30:23,201 --> 01:30:26,070
fucking PCH with the top down.
That was pretty impressive. Uh,

1502
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:30,850
you didn't feel like Nia
Woodward? I did. It did. Exactly.

1503
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:32,230
It's a fucking great idea.

1504
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:36,160
Ballet like ran up to us and we
pulled into the, uh, parking.

1505
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,100
Oh and put it in a special spot.
And God pat back then underneath that,

1506
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:44,760
that overhang. So the shade would be, was
be all nice and cool. It was pretty hot.

1507
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:47,430
You know, they don't do that when you
pull up in the Prius, do they? No,

1508
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:49,920
they do not stick that
bitch right out in the sun.

1509
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:58,170
Um, all right. So let's, let's get, let's
get onto, let's get onto our argument.

1510
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:01,470
So, right. We're, we're flying
back from New York City.

1511
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:06,360
How amazing was I a town hall? You were
amazing. Standing Ovation. That's right.

1512
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,290
If fucking right.
Amp,

1513
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:11,520
how insecure my that I had to make
you say that for the sixth time you're

1514
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:15,810
insecure, but I know exactly. All
right. So let's plow ahead here. Um,

1515
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:20,790
so we're flying back from, uh, where
are we at Boston at that point.

1516
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,720
Yeah. And uh, I don't,

1517
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:26,130
I don't know if we'd already watched
the youtube clip or whatever.

1518
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:29,760
Riana had gone on TV
talking to Diane Sawyer,

1519
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:35,070
breaking it down. Yup.
Talking about, um, you know,

1520
01:31:35,071 --> 01:31:39,150
getting the shit kicked out of her by
that dude with the beaver teeth. Right.

1521
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,250
He really looks like a bug to beaver.
He does.

1522
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:47,890
He has no business being a pop star.
Um,

1523
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:53,100
he bitter too. Right? Did, why wouldn't
you? You got to utilize your weapons.

1524
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,010
So we're sitting there and it's this real,

1525
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:58,560
it's this really sad interview and
she's just like, I just felt silly.

1526
01:31:58,561 --> 01:32:02,620
It's stupid. So to be,
so this is what I did.

1527
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:06,280
So it started off as a joke and I
said, all right, this is my impression

1528
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,650
because wrong.
All right,

1529
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:13,540
go on record as saying that
I feel that this is so wrong.

1530
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:18,490
It's so wrong. All right, well this is
the deal. I was talking about how they,

1531
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,140
she was just saying that,
you know,

1532
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:25,260
I found an inappropriate text message
and then things escalated and then next

1533
01:32:25,451 --> 01:32:29,570
thing you know, he caved in my cheek and
started biting me and Blah, blah, blah,

1534
01:32:29,571 --> 01:32:30,970
blah, blah. And I was
just like, you know what?

1535
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:34,810
She left out a lot of the details and
cause what I've learned with arguing with

1536
01:32:34,811 --> 01:32:39,040
women is when women argue when you're
there or not winning or they're not

1537
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:40,810
getting you to admit that you're wrong,

1538
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:44,200
that some point they make this switch
in there where they're just like,

1539
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:48,640
I'm just going to make this person as mad
as I possibly can by using every ounce

1540
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:52,240
of information that I know about him.
So truth,

1541
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:56,740
you know what? That's as
good as a, yes. Anyway,

1542
01:32:56,741 --> 01:33:00,730
so this is one of those in the moment
jokes, I can't remember what they said.

1543
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:03,450
I said,
this is my impression of,

1544
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,170
of the conversation before. I can't
remember what, how I did it though.

1545
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,293
I was like,

1546
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:14,470
wish you seen from Barbados but for some
reason I started doing this really bad

1547
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:19,471
Jamaican accent and I good Yaman Yaman
who who'd be sending you the text man,

1548
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,590
Yo fuck you bitch.

1549
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:28,680
I ain't go say not Joe man who gave you
the text message you fucking buck tooth

1550
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:29,081
to be,

1551
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:32,950
I can't remember it somehow talked about
his teeth and you will laugh in your

1552
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:36,040
fucking ass off.
I can never recreate that.

1553
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:38,920
That's why I had to tap out and you
will laugh when you fucking ass off.

1554
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:41,530
And it was totally wrong.
And,

1555
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,960
but then like halfway through it,

1556
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:48,961
I started making my point of how I'm so
sick of every time a woman gets the shit

1557
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:52,300
kicked out of her, not every time, but
all of these women they always get,

1558
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:56,620
they always get to show guys in that
bad light of all these guys who beat the

1559
01:33:56,621 --> 01:33:57,460
shit out of their women,

1560
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:02,670
but they never show when women fuck
over guys ever in those situations ever.

1561
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:08,140
Like, you know, the situations that I've
seen where, you know, a friend of mine,

1562
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:08,770
you know,

1563
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:11,830
she slammed the door into them and then
just called the cops and said that he

1564
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:16,750
hit her and they without question, arrest
him and then that fucked up his job.

1565
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:19,780
And now everybody looks at him like he's
a wife beater. He never even did it.

1566
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,740
How come Oprah never does shows about
that? That was our big argument.

1567
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:27,100
And then she somehow,
you know me the way I say shit,

1568
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:30,400
some I would seem like I was advocating
that the guy did nothing wrong.

1569
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:36,150
And you know, all women are
these horrible manipulative. Yes,

1570
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,120
you're not, you're not horrible
manipulat preachers, but you guys,

1571
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,940
you definitely manipulate.
Can I burn a joke here that,

1572
01:34:42,941 --> 01:34:46,300
that fucking milkshake joke up? Burn
it. I don't have that many listeners.

1573
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:48,460
I'll still probably do it on my special.
I don't give a fuck.

1574
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,490
So here's a little teaser,
kind of like when you see a movie trailer,

1575
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:54,670
this is kind of a bit I'm
doing on my, uh, my special,

1576
01:34:54,671 --> 01:34:58,160
this is what my girlfriend did
one night when I was driving home.

1577
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,570
This is how much they manipulate or as
I call it, lie to get what they want.

1578
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,790
I was driving home and I
was looking at this fucking,

1579
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:09,740
there was this diner and I was driving
home and it was late and I was like,

1580
01:35:09,741 --> 01:35:10,910
you know, hey, you know,
I'm gonna stop there.

1581
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:14,990
I'm going to get one of those milkshakes.
And you would just like, oh my God,

1582
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:24,080
fuck you. It's hilarious. Let's
not forget. At the end of the day,

1583
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:27,920
my job is to like make those people
laugh. Okay, Nia, you don't understand.

1584
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:30,650
These people work hard all week.
These were Americans.

1585
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,580
They need to come out and forget
about their problems now, whatever.

1586
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:38,210
I don't have one of my Mel Blanc.
I got one fucking voice. I do.

1587
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:41,420
Nice reference. I watch cartoons. Really?

1588
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,640
Is that all it takes to
impress you on a first date?

1589
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:48,350
That's how you ended up with me.
He knows who does the voice of bugs bunny.

1590
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,610
This guy is a keeper.

1591
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:54,140
I think this guy will
be able to provide what

1592
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,790
hung out when I hooked up.
We'll save that for another one.

1593
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:03,260
But you got you gotta Tell Him, Huh?
You had to be impressed with my skills.

1594
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:06,890
Well you see that they
just won't give it up.

1595
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,550
This guy was fucking cock
blocking me on an Olympic level.

1596
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,720
He saw I was going to hook up.

1597
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:16,780
He actually tried to split a cab with you
on the way home and I got around that.

1598
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,560
Got around that. What happened?
I fucking put the cards.

1599
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:25,910
I went all in just like world series
of poker. I went all fucking in.

1600
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:31,430
She, she was trying to be all coy with
the Little Sammy Davis Jr had on trying to

1601
01:36:31,431 --> 01:36:33,830
play all hard to get her thinking.

1602
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,930
You were dealing with the
sophomore in fucking college.

1603
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,370
Like I didn't have any fucking lines

1604
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:44,710
and they're douchebag kept coming over,
cock blocking me. He invited. We were,

1605
01:36:44,711 --> 01:36:46,940
we were all set. I was hanging
out. I'm gonna tell right now.

1606
01:36:46,941 --> 01:36:49,340
We were hanging out right.
Me and this other dude,

1607
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,670
and all of a sudden Nia shows up, right?
And I can see, I can see the vibe.

1608
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:57,260
I see the look on her face. I know she
wants it now. I don't know. He just,

1609
01:36:57,261 --> 01:37:00,710
you know, shut up. You
look great. You came up,

1610
01:37:00,711 --> 01:37:03,260
he had a nice big smile and
you're being flirtatious.

1611
01:37:03,261 --> 01:37:06,740
And I immediately liked you,
right? So you went to the bathroom,

1612
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:09,080
you're with a friend.
I'm with a friend.

1613
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,000
Every guy knows what
you're supposed to do.

1614
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,540
Take that fucking battle
ax out of the picture.

1615
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,580
Okay. Take one for the team. I can't
remember. Who the fuck are you with.

1616
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:23,460
So if it's one of your friends, I
apologize. Um, whatever. Alright,

1617
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:29,150
a a war memorial. Um,
so what is this fucking,

1618
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:32,660
he goes the opposite route. I said, look,
you went to Beth and I said, listen,

1619
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:36,440
I'm really doing well with this girl.
All right, so a duty, I hate to like,

1620
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:40,940
he was like a chick. No, I had to be like,
so if I'm not paying attention to you,

1621
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:44,600
don't get upset. This is how like female,
this dude was, right. So I fucking,

1622
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:48,260
he is what? He ends up doing.
Okay. The fucking guy ends up,

1623
01:37:48,261 --> 01:37:51,380
it's worth going to leave,
you know, I'm thinking, okay,

1624
01:37:51,381 --> 01:37:54,440
he's going to try to peel off with,
uh, your girl who's not a battle ax.

1625
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:57,960
And he just, he invites another
dude over and goes, hey,

1626
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:01,830
you guys all want to get something to eat,
remember and member.

1627
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,950
And he invited us over. Now we're
sitting there. It's me. You,

1628
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:09,030
you're not so battleaxe friends and three
other fucking cops are sitting there

1629
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:13,680
and I'm trying to hit on you. Yeah. And he
keeps jumping in. Then he goes, Hey Nia,

1630
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:16,800
where do you live? Oh, I live up
that way. You want to split a cab?

1631
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:21,170
Right. Remember that? And
I had to be like, no, no,

1632
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:24,610
no, you didn't. It was over at that point.
I made the move. Remember that? I said,

1633
01:38:24,611 --> 01:38:26,920
are you at least I bucked before
he fucking said that shit.

1634
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,090
He was doing everything.

1635
01:38:28,091 --> 01:38:31,450
I remember I didn't have any cash and
I pulled out my credit card. I said,

1636
01:38:31,451 --> 01:38:33,850
you guys just give me the cash or just
put it on my credit card. And he goes, oh,

1637
01:38:33,851 --> 01:38:35,590
he's just trying to get the miles.

1638
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,950
Remember that anything could Duke
to make me look like a shithead

1639
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:43,090
for the whole thing. I thought you were
like Bam, I'm paying for the whole meal.

1640
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,133
No,
no,

1641
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,010
no, no. They gave me money cause I
didn't have any cash. You paid for mine.

1642
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,040
This is how I got you.
What you were sitting there and I said,

1643
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:53,160
look how we at least going to be able to
split a cab because I wanted to go over

1644
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:56,070
and have a drink with you. Right. And I
was like at least be able to split a cab.

1645
01:38:56,071 --> 01:38:58,110
And then you like, why? Why
do you want to split a cab?

1646
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:01,830
Just putting up the roadblock. And
that's when I went all in. I said,

1647
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:06,570
cause I want to kiss you Bam.
Right? Yeah. And then that was it.

1648
01:39:06,571 --> 01:39:09,560
I didn't fucking talk to you after that.
Yeah,

1649
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:12,750
you sat there with that little stunned
look on your face. Then what happened?

1650
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:16,290
And we walked outside. Damn Damn Dad.
Then we walked out. That was the shit.

1651
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,590
That was one of the greatest I used to
the fucking guys like that used to always

1652
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:20,190
get me,

1653
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:24,600
I fucking nailed that stuck the
landing like a male Mary Lou Retton

1654
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:30,330
and you know what the best part
was. Then I stood up, we all, and I,

1655
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:33,690
at that point I was like, fuck
it. I said what I wanted to do,

1656
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,830
all this shit is in,
I don't need to talk to her anymore.

1657
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,030
And I sort of peeled off,
right?

1658
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:41,730
And then everybody got up to leave
and then you kind of touched me on the

1659
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,710
shoulder, said, don't worry. She
goes, you say like, don't worry,

1660
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:45,750
we're going to split a cab up
time. And then I'm like, oh,

1661
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:48,810
this is going to be great because now I'm
in and now I'm going to get you get to

1662
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:52,260
watch that little fucking cock block,
get his balls knocked on the, on the,

1663
01:39:52,261 --> 01:39:54,720
on the fucking sidewalk. And that's
what happened. He came out right?

1664
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:59,010
Clapped his hands. Remember that
came out just like you, just like,

1665
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:02,220
so you guys ready to go? Yeah.
And you were like, ah, yeah,

1666
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:05,940
actually we're taking a cab. And he
was, and he was so in cock block mode,

1667
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:08,520
he's still didn't have said, no,
no, we live right near [inaudible].

1668
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:13,080
And you were like, listen, we're
taking a cab and we're going uptown.

1669
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:14,490
You leaned over and you said it,

1670
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,030
and then that's when he realized that
everyone realized he was a cock block and

1671
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:21,060
Douche. And then what did he do? He
goes, oh good. Yeah. I mean, yeah,

1672
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,740
he just fucking peeled off.

1673
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:25,890
Yeah. Huh. Then what happened?

1674
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:28,110
We can't talk about that.

1675
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,690
My other fucking classic line, we're
fucking real. June was a masterpiece,

1676
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:37,650
fucking masterpiece. Then we got
in the cab and you said, I thought,

1677
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:40,860
I thought you were going to kiss me,
and we fucking drive it like a maniac.

1678
01:40:40,861 --> 01:40:43,530
And I go,
I can't the cabs jumping around too much.

1679
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,790
I go a kiss you at the first red light,
right.

1680
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:49,470
Rag it out and we're trying
to make this whole like,

1681
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:53,040
I was fucking seducing
you and it worked right?

1682
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:58,030
Then we hit the fucking red
light. I put one on you, Bam.

1683
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,490
Right.
Couldn't feel your fucking feet.

1684
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,390
I'm gonna make this story last nine hours
long. And then you know what happened?

1685
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,690
Then I sat back and I was playing
mister fucking cool again,

1686
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:15,691
like a fucking Walt Frazier in 1972 oh
the callback to the next from an hour

1687
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:17,800
ago, right? Then what happened?

1688
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:21,610
We stopped again and I'm sitting there
looking out the window and you go,

1689
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:24,430
it's another red light right now.
And then,

1690
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,440
and then we heard that cheesy saxophone
from every fucking sexy movie in the 80s

1691
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:34,180
right? And then you were going,
I'm not going home with you.

1692
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,700
I'm not going home with you. Now,
whenever they say that, guys,

1693
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,920
you know they're not going home with you.
You know that shit.

1694
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:43,630
So what you have to do is you have to
constantly make them feel like it's safe

1695
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,130
and they're in control.
So before,

1696
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:48,640
actually before you said you weren't
going home with me, I felt you vibe.

1697
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:52,810
I knew the deal. So I just said, listen,
I know we're not going home together,

1698
01:41:52,811 --> 01:41:55,480
but I'm really am a good time with you.
I'd like to have another drink with you.

1699
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:59,200
All right. I know a nice
bar. Ba, Ba, ba Ba and Bam,

1700
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,610
right?
You didn't go home with me.

1701
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:07,720
We had like fucking eight more drinks
and made out for like the next five hours

1702
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:12,160
and that fucking hell's kitchen
bar had a great time. There you go.

1703
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:13,820
So there's a little story people,

1704
01:42:13,821 --> 01:42:18,790
there's your little backstory hour in
one fucking minutes. There you go. Oh,

1705
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:21,490
you know I've got, damn it. I
didn't get to this. You want it.

1706
01:42:21,491 --> 01:42:23,230
You want to hear something
that's going to make your uh,

1707
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:28,570
your fucking privates crawl.
Sorry, I was disgusting.

1708
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:31,150
I'm out of funny shit and that's
it. I'm, I'm overtime right now.

1709
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:34,660
Listen to this guy. You know I was talking
about that, that cut down there at the,

1710
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:37,600
at the diner that one day. Remember
that guy? Go back to Jersey.

1711
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:40,480
You fucking faggot.
Whatever the hell he said.

1712
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,133
So people,

1713
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:47,300
people were talking about, people would,
talking about like all the, uh, you know,

1714
01:42:47,301 --> 01:42:50,690
all the assholes and the confrontations
and some people had the confrontations,

1715
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,870
some people won the fights,
some people lost the fight,

1716
01:42:53,871 --> 01:42:55,310
some people won and got sued.

1717
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:59,390
I let people walked away and had the
fucking anger like I did. So he goes,

1718
01:42:59,391 --> 01:43:03,320
a podcast, the bullies point of
view. This is from the bully.

1719
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:06,170
Listen to this. This is
really interesting, Bill.

1720
01:43:06,171 --> 01:43:08,810
I just listened to your last two podcasts
and listen to the stories of these

1721
01:43:08,811 --> 01:43:12,500
guys that went. They want to beat
people when they're bullied. Well,

1722
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:16,100
I think I'm the bully.
I've got a hundred stories,

1723
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:17,750
but I'll give you two short ones,

1724
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,210
right?
Fat People Bother me.

1725
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:26,410
These guys, awesome.
Fair people bothering me.

1726
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:31,620
Smelly people do to combine the two and
give me lots of alcohol and I go off.

1727
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,820
So I'm down the,
uh,

1728
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:38,350
down the hatch and Manhattan and fat
smelly and Fet smelly guys come in.

1729
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:43,470
I can't help but tell them that they are
an embarrassment to the white American

1730
01:43:43,961 --> 01:43:46,600
race. This is where he becomes
like this area in psychopath.

1731
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:48,430
I guess this isn't funny anymore.
And he goes,

1732
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:52,400
and I'm tired of picking up their slack
if he's just saying that to be funny.

1733
01:43:52,401 --> 01:43:53,570
That's fucking hilarious.

1734
01:43:53,571 --> 01:43:55,880
For one white person to say
that to another white person.

1735
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:00,500
You're an embarrassment to the white race
and I'm tired of picking up the slap.

1736
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:04,010
Take a fucking walk. At least
he goes, they don't say a word.

1737
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:08,510
So I slapped one right across
the face. He goes, why?

1738
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,920
I'm not sure. What's that movie you
love there with, with Christian Bale?

1739
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:17,600
American psych. Yeah. I think this is the
guy I'd love to see his business card.

1740
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:20,960
He goes out, there's six of them.
I have four or five guys with me.

1741
01:44:21,110 --> 01:44:23,810
But they wouldn't have known that.
They wouldn't have known that.

1742
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,150
And they just walked out.

1743
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:29,570
They just walked away out the door
probably to grab some fried food.

1744
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:34,010
Uh, but the point is they
didn't do anything. Did I
feel bad about it? Not really.

1745
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:37,070
A, it's a pretty funny story
to tell when I'm drunk.

1746
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,570
Oh, these stories are hilarious.
I don't even know if the true,

1747
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:46,730
but these are fucking making me laugh.
A written element story too.

1748
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:50,180
So I'm at a bar with a couple of
guys and there's a midget in, uh,

1749
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:52,400
for some reason I don't
notice the little man,

1750
01:44:52,401 --> 01:44:54,740
but my friends do in the
midget jokes commence.

1751
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,350
And one of the little men's friends
says something to my friend.

1752
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,900
I told him to shut the fuck up
and poured my corona on him. Uh,

1753
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:04,150
he didn't know what to do. About 10
minutes later, I ordered a shot and saw,

1754
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:09,800
saw him near the bar and toss that
in him too. He did nothing. Why?

1755
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:13,000
Because 98% of the time, people, uh,

1756
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:17,480
people don't know how to react and clam
up. It's not just your listeners, a you,

1757
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:18,720
it's mostly everyone.

1758
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:23,360
So don't feel bad about freezing up
and missing your opportunity. Um,

1759
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:25,730
and you're right that we don't
always get what we deserve.

1760
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,040
I've been kicked out of more
bars than I can remember.

1761
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,420
I've had sex with more women than I can
remember and showed all of my friends

1762
01:45:32,421 --> 01:45:34,640
pictures of them.
Where did it get me

1763
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,760
to a six figure salary?

1764
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,340
Wait a minute. You just want it to
be fake. You want it to be fake.

1765
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:51,320
Nia. Have you ever seen an
asshole who takes what he wants?

1766
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:54,590
Not Banging the hottest
fucking women out there ever.

1767
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,800
Thank you. All right, let's continue.

1768
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:01,700
One more thing just so this will
make you feel great. All these, uh,

1769
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:02,910
all these guys in your podcast,

1770
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:05,990
keep talking about picking up girls or
being scared to talk to them or being

1771
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:10,700
rejected, rejected, rejected.
Listen, kids, I love this.
He's talking down to them.

1772
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:14,240
Most of you are in college or
your senior years of high school.

1773
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:17,450
Fucking go out there and crush some pussy.

1774
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:22,070
Have trouble talking to girls. Here's
what you do. Go to your classes.

1775
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:26,630
Come back to your dorm room and take a
nap or play Madden or do whatever till

1776
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:31,631
around 1:00 AM go get a fake id or chalk
your id and move on to the bar about

1777
01:46:33,051 --> 01:46:37,910
one hour before they close. Scope out the
action in search for blood. Be a shark.

1778
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:42,680
Look for the over inebriated,
the overweight, the low
self esteem. Make it happen.

1779
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:46,850
He's screaming now, make it happen. He's
given a little halftime speech here. Uh,

1780
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:47,660
be blunt.

1781
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:51,810
Ask a girl if you can grab a little
stick a hand down a chick's pants when

1782
01:46:51,811 --> 01:46:56,230
you're on a dance floor, be
aggressive. All that shit works in the,

1783
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:59,790
I'm not gonna lie to you putting
your hand down. Some girl's hands on,

1784
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,600
but you just don't fucking
do what you just saw.

1785
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:05,970
You start doing other areas
that are gateways to that area.

1786
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:13,590
Lies, lies, lies. Yap. What if he
turns you on? What if you worked out?

1787
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:16,470
What if he was a dick and he was shredded
and he just knew it was going to be

1788
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:20,310
some great fucking stress relieving cock?
Nia,

1789
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:23,910
uh, uh, you know what
you're doing right now.

1790
01:47:23,911 --> 01:47:26,990
Right now you'd be in talk show audience.
Nia, let me tell you about that.

1791
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,000
Anybody puts their hand on my ass.
They get an ass kicked.

1792
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:37,260
You're full of shit in here. All right.
Whenever you're sick, I'll let you go.

1793
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,520
Um, oh and never play up the nice
guy thing. Uh, you go in there,

1794
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:45,300
look like you've done this a hundred
times. Scared of performing. Don't worry,

1795
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:49,080
they won't remember it anyways
and chances are they've had worse.

1796
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,500
All right, so this guy's cocky.
You know, I love about him.

1797
01:47:52,501 --> 01:47:55,860
He's cocky for good reasons and
also cocky for no reasons. I mean,

1798
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:03,810
I know well, he's a, he slaps fat people.
He makes fun of Friends of midgets.

1799
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:06,810
Any fucks?
A girls who are too drunk to say no,

1800
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:09,000
and now he makes six figures.

1801
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,440
Come on. You know we was, she was trying
to be funny, but you know he did a song.

1802
01:48:15,441 --> 01:48:18,600
You know? Now you've got the
attitude. You don't care if she comes,

1803
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:21,470
stays laser praise. You ever see
them? I'm that guy. [inaudible]

1804
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,580
you know what's funny?
You know what's funny about you?

1805
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:30,210
You already have that look on your face
when you meet a guy who doesn't give a

1806
01:48:30,211 --> 01:48:33,870
fuck the same way I didn't.
You got that look on your face.

1807
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,300
That fucking look that.

1808
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:39,990
Let me know that someday you are going
to be in my bedroom, which you are.

1809
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,600
I just didn't count on me falling for you.
That's where I fucked up.

1810
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:47,550
That's where you turn the tables on me.
Huh? Cutie Pie. All right, that's it.

1811
01:48:47,551 --> 01:48:50,580
That's it for the podcast.
You're fucking twats. You guys,

1812
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:56,820
