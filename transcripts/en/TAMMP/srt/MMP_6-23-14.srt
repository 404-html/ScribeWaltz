1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,010
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,110
June 23rd, 2014. How's it going?

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,410
How I yeah,
what's up and all of that shit.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,000
Um, I don't know. What do I start?

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,570
I don't even know where to begin.
Um,

6
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:27,190
I taped my special Friday night in Atlanta
at the Tabernacle and I want to thank

7
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:30,820
everybody who came out. I had
a wonderful time. As always,

8
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,920
there were a couple of glitches as always.

9
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:36,670
A couple people screamed out and as
always, what the fuck are you going to do?

10
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,160
I had a great time and I'm,

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,210
I'm really looking forward to putting
that special out and coming up with my new

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:44,990
hour of material.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,710
And right now I'm trying not to freak
out because essentially when this thing

14
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:52,460
comes out in a couple of months, I
have no APP. I mean I have an act,

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,210
but it will be an act that potentially
people in the crowd have seen.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,250
So I have to try some. Uh, I don't
know what the fuck I'm going to do.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,180
Well, you know what I normally do when
I try to build the new hour. No bill,

18
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:08,300
we don't know. Nor do we give a
shit. Well fuck you. It's my podcast.

19
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,660
I'm going to talk about it. Um,
when I like to do basically I,

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,240
I basically I take off all
rules of like hack deed shit.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,610
I don't give a fuck. I will,
I will talk about anything.

22
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:23,390
So I am now just looking what's go,
what's,

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,510
what's going on in the news.
A little ageist thing here.

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,310
It's like Jay Leno was bit
right. We, it takes like the uh,

25
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,670
the headlines except he actually has
a staff of writers combing through to

26
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:41,570
actually find funny ones. I on the other
hand, we'll be going down to the clubs,

27
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,400
just throwing anything I
can up against the wall.

28
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,170
Why the fuck is it so hot in here?

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,840
Jesus Christ and I can't open the fucking
windows because my neighbors are going

30
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,760
to freak out. I'm taping this Sunday
nights. Everybody's home right now.

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,160
God dammit
Jesus.

32
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,590
It's not one fucking thing.
It's another, you know what?

33
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,790
I was going to do it in the bedroom,
being over.

34
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,470
My wife wants to go take a bath and relax,
which you know,

35
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,500
is that wrong? No, it's not wrong.
You don't know is it, is it,

36
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:15,970
is it pathetic that I can't do a podcast
and then in the next room without

37
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:19,810
disturbing her because I scream and yell
and rant and rave and all that shit.

38
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:22,300
I had to put that in. I guess
that is pathetic. So I am,

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,740
I'm out here in the living room.

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,490
I can't open the fucking windows and
I tell you that heat's getting to me

41
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:32,290
already. Oh, it's getting to me.
Um, what would you rather do?

42
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,720
Would you rather freeze to death?
I'll get myself a dilemma here.

43
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:39,070
We'd rather freeze to death or a, I'm
not going to say burned to death. Every,

44
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,620
everybody's going to
choose freezing to death.

45
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,480
Although there'll be a couple of dishes.
Woo. Boozing, good at be painful.

46
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,520
So it would to get the pain over with.

47
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,050
Okay.

48
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,520
You know, hit me with some sort
of scientific facts or whatever.

49
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,020
He'll just say some science shit.

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,440
They don't even have to be faxed when
it comes to my scientific background of

51
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:03,460
which I have none. You know,
I took two goddamn classes.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,630
No, I didn't even do that one was
chemistry and I was just like,

53
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,020
I'm not fucking looking at bugs,
you know?

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,060
I know it's not bugs,

55
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,540
but I had to follow through with that
sentence cause that's the first thing I

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,250
thought of when I was looking, looking in
the petri dish. What are you looking at?

57
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:28,750
Huh? Oh that's biology. So I
was still wrong. Chemistry.

58
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,040
You know what I love about this fucking
podcast is how dumb you guys think.

59
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,930
I am not how dumb you think I am,

60
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,280
but like how much smarter like this shit
that you guys, right? I swear to God, Yo,

61
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:43,450
Yo, Yo, you fuck it. Animals just
like make all right, but whatever.

62
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:48,340
Maybe that's my job. My job's to
make you feel better. I don't know.

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,860
I have no idea. Um, but
anyways, yeah, my science,

64
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,800
my science backgrounds,
horrific. I took a,

65
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,240
I just didn't give a
fuck when I was younger.

66
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,460
They shouldn't try to teach you
that shit when you're young.

67
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,650
You know you're too busy staring at
the fucking hot chicks and class.

68
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,070
You sitting there with the fucking Rod,
you know,

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,030
trying to memorize a periodical chart.
You can't do that. And if you can,

70
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,830
you know what?
I don't even know what the fuck you are.

71
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:19,030
You're not even a human being.

72
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,110
How are you not looking at the check
that develop the quickest, you know,

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,850
with the tits over there or Jordache
jeans would have a Sass on whatever the

74
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,690
fuck they had back when I
was a kid. That's what you're
looking at. Or even worse,

75
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,400
you had some Hadi for a fucking teacher
that you wanted to bang, you know,

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,240
that'd be tell you about that time. I got
trouble. I got in trouble long time ago.

77
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,980
I was taking this French class

78
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,300
and the teacher I had was beautiful and
she had a habit of wearing dresses where

79
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:54,130
she had a slit halfway up the
side of her fucking leg. You know,

80
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm in the eighth grade. What am I
supposed to do? Well. Long Story Short,

81
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,900
one day she came and she had a slit up
bolt on both sides of the dress, right?

82
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,650
So she would be writing on the board
and in when she would step back.

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,300
And did I ever tell a story came out when
she would step back so you could see,

84
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,673
you know,

85
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,890
she'd step one leg back and then somehow
you could basically see halfway up her

86
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,441
leg on her inner thigh on the leg closest
to the blackboard and like the fuck

87
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:27,640
egg. It was over. All
right. No blood in my brain.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,710
I'm just going. All I'm doing is
thinking how to say in French,

89
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,690
please step back again.
See me play.

90
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,650
I have no idea. I don't. I'm not even
fucking listening. And to this day,

91
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,830
I don't know, I never had just one of the
worst. I've had a teacher yelled at me,

92
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,320
she called on me,
all right,

93
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:52,030
and I'm trying to fucking answer her and
I'm trying to bullshit my way through

94
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,150
and she realizes that I haven't
been fucking paying attention.

95
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:59,750
And she flipped out calling me a liar.
It's screen. To this day, I swear to God,

96
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,540
something was going on in our home
life because it's like, yeah, I mean,

97
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,520
you should just called me a fucking
liar and moved on. She just fucking,

98
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,970
she berated me for like the
last 20 minutes of the class.

99
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,183
MMM.

100
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,140
I remember Jesus.
I'm rubbing my head now thinking about it.

101
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,040
I was just sitting at,
you know,

102
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,190
you know any times I've thought
about that fucking moment, my life,

103
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:23,830
and I just wished that I had the
emotional maturity to be like, you know,

104
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,620
you weren't paying attention to where
are you? And I'd be like, no, I wasn't.

105
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,350
I wasn't. Why don't you, you know,
not come to class. All right.

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,790
We're with two slits up both sides.
You're dress obese.

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,560
You know what your inner thigh is way
more interesting than watching you. Uh,

108
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,660
go g, suite two A and all
that. I fucking crap. Okay.

109
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:47,380
Send me down to the office. What do
you want? What do you want from me?

110
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,690
I'll give a f. Yeah, whatever. I'm not
passing this class anyways. Am I, am I,

111
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,250
I, you know what, fuck this.

112
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:58,090
I want to thank you for dressing the
way that you do because that shit you're

113
00:06:58,091 --> 00:06:59,470
writing on the board is not interesting.

114
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,390
It's not nearly as interesting
as a what's going on downstairs?

115
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,530
There.
Okay.

116
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,160
And quit acting like you don't know what
you're doing and you're yelling at me,

117
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,550
you're getting on me. You're having
a bad time with your fucking husband.

118
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,890
That's what it is. What's a matter?
He doesn't want to touch anymore.

119
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,550
So now you've got to come in here all
gussied up. Get us all hot and bothered.

120
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,230
Right. And then fucking scream and yell
at me cause I'm not paying the, yeah,

121
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:24,700
you're not even going to be yelling at me.

122
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,370
You're yelling at your fucking husband.
Can you imagine?

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,330
I actually have probably when and got
half of that up. I don't fucking know.

124
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,140
You know, I have to mention I had paid
off. I guess I had really bad add.

125
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,950
Okay.

126
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,820
Yeah, I can't, you don't,

127
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,360
you only time I can focus is if
I give a fuck about something.

128
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,850
All my life is in jeopardy.
You know,

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,490
like I went on a motorcycle ride today
with a buddy of mine and we drove all the

130
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:53,750
way down sunset all the way down and
all the way back. And I got to tell you,

131
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,160
uh, I don't see the enjoyment
and riding a motorcycle.

132
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,900
I don't get it. It, it always looks
awesome. But once you're on there,

133
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:07,430
all you're thinking is I'm going to die.
That's a fucking range rover.

134
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,030
Jesus Christ. Get the fuck
away from me. You know,

135
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,910
the whole fucking,
you can't look at anything.

136
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,220
All you're doing is making
you driving down the street.

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,480
You're making sure that
nobody's pulling out somewhere.

138
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,180
No one's going to open a door up.
You get up to a fucking stop light.

139
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,220
You got to look in your rear view mirror
to make sure it's nobody rear ends you

140
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,230
and pushes you out into traffic.
Fucking horrific.

141
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,640
You're going around a turn.

142
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,550
You got to look your way through the God
damn term and they make sure the other

143
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,460
ass hole across the street, you
know, come on the other way.

144
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,480
Is it going to wipe you out? But I
gotta tell you my focus is incredible.

145
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,900
I guess that's the only way I can focus.

146
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,720
Okay.

147
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,280
Or if there's like something,
something is on, uh, on the line.

148
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,610
Other than that, I just started staring
at bugs on the ceiling or whatever.

149
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,770
I don't know what it is I do. I'm out
of my fucking mind. So anyways, uh,

150
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,330
what was I talking about? Oh yeah. So
I take my special this weekend and um,

151
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,490
you know,
that's the fun part though.

152
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,390
The horrific part now is I have
to go back and I got to uh,

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
go in during the editing
process and that's not
something I liked doing. I said,

154
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,610
I got this weird thing where if
I videotape myself with a club,

155
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,940
I could sit there and I can watch it
and I can laugh and I can enjoy it.

156
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,460
But the second I know you
guys are going to see it too.

157
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,900
I get all in my head and everything I'm
doing, I think, Jay, why did I do that?

158
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:35,920
What am I doing? Blah, blah.
Why did I say this? You know,

159
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,490
why is my weight on my right leg
right now instead of my left?

160
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,470
Like it's fucking torture. So I got
to push my way through it because, uh,

161
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,650
you know, I, I'm trying to make sure,
you know, with each special, you know,

162
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,570
you want to be a little bit better
than you were the last time.

163
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:53,110
You want it to look a little bit
better than the last one. So, uh,

164
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:57,520
I didn't realize with that also
become, comes to pressure of, of uh,

165
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,920
I dunno, trying to, trying to keep
going up. I don't fucking know.

166
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,110
I don't know, whatever.
It's behind me. Okay.

167
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:09,350
So now basically what I'm doing
is I'm looking over these, uh,

168
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,370
I'm trying to watch the news, which I
can't do because I don't know about,

169
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,660
I don't know where you
guys live in the world,

170
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:19,230
but we don't really have news over here.
We have a little bit of it,

171
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,790
but for the most part it's basically,
uh,

172
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,290
the Democrat news and the Republican News.
It's really fucking sad.

173
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,970
Um, I used, I liked the
way they used to lie to us.

174
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,340
I liked it back in the day, you
know, when they just had that person,

175
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,410
that fucking older white guy who had
that sound in his voice that just sounded

176
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:49,770
like he fucking, you know, was giving
you the straight deal, you know,

177
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,280
as opposed to now we got
all these personalities that
are like bigger than the

178
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,780
news, you know, all those silly concent,

179
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,010
Fox News and all those dip shits on CNN.

180
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,350
Who's that guy with the
fucking silver hair on CNN?

181
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,060
What does he, what does he call
his show? Ah, Jesus Christ. I,

182
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,770
I can't remember when he got the, he got
the one calls it the, the situation room,

183
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:21,010
which you remember opie and Opie and
Anthony is to always make fun of the

184
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,210
situation room.

185
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,700
Okay.

186
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,350
And you got what's his face going?
Yeah.

187
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,820
This is the no spin zone
that bill O'Reilly jerk off.
This is the no spin zone.

188
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:34,100
It's like, dude, the your and your
entire fucking show was you spin in it.

189
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,120
There's no such thing as a no spin zone.
Right now I'm spinning.

190
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,550
How I think news is that this country,

191
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:45,300
so you guys agree with what the fuck I
say there's no such thing like I'm going

192
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,820
to give you a strike dark.
Even if you wanted to.

193
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:52,260
You couldn't cause you getting it off
that fucking whatever the fuck it is.

194
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,790
That ticker thing that you get
it. Yeah. You weren't there.

195
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,090
You don't know what happened. It even
if your were there, I'm going to get it.

196
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,360
It's going to be what happened.
Cut with your childhood.

197
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,620
That's what's going to happen.

198
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,520
Cause it goes into your brain and then
it's fucking in there and it's stepped on

199
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:10,120
like drugs. It's not the pure shit
that just happened so I can't watch it.

200
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,650
What the fuck does that guy called
his shell? That's silver haired guy.

201
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,560
It's something arrogant.
Something arrogant like he's giving you,

202
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,790
do you know what the fuck
is supposed to be happening?

203
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,350
Anderson Cooper three 60 is that what
it is? I thought it was worse than that.

204
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:32,170
Three 60 is not bad. Right? He's spinning
around is he tells the news today.

205
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,890
Hey Jeff. Uh, sorry. Terrible
joke and, but you know what?

206
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:39,860
I'll put that in my act. I
need jokes. Anderson Cooper,

207
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:44,060
three six look at net worth. Who
the fuck would look up his? Oh No,

208
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,720
it's just guys make a year or two. I did
good. Well what did you do? The shoot?

209
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,010
Any read teleprompters?
I could do that.

210
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,230
Yeah.

211
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,600
I thought he had something. I thought
it was called something worse than that.

212
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,810
Anderson Cooper, three 60
sounds like one of them.

213
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,570
My ex game tricks. You get a backside
fakey followed by Anderson Cooper.

214
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:04,404
Three 60

215
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,030
okay.

216
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,970
Jesus Christ. Insert homophobic
joke. They're like, what would,

217
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:13,830
what would an Anderson Cooper,
three sixties that's skateboard look like?

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,430
Oh that's, you know what? That's too easy.

219
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,380
Full coverage from Anderson live
in Baghdad. I got to tell, oh,

220
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,150
I know what annoys me is when he
goes out and he tells us stories.

221
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,850
Got a fucking helmet on.
You know what I mean?

222
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,750
Jesus Christ. A helmet won't even help
you on a motorcycle. Okay, you're out.

223
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:39,980
You're in a fucking war zone.
Take it off and show your great hair.

224
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:43,040
You son of a bitch,
Anderson Cooper,

225
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,250
three 60 spinning around
live here in Baghdad.

226
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,130
Republicans do everything wrong. Um, oh.

227
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,600
Keeping them honest.
Is that, is that what,

228
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,360
is that what he does?
Why am I asking you guys,

229
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:02,750
why didn't I do my fucking research
on this thing? Keeping them honest,

230
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,790
gay conversion therapy.
Oh,

231
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,850
Jesus Christ. I can't imagine
the tension there, dude.

232
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,660
How fucking retarded are you that you
actually think that you can stop somebody

233
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,840
from being attracted to what they're
attracted to and then also thinking that

234
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:24,660
it's unnatural. You know,
I don't understand that.

235
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,020
Okay.

236
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,680
Unless you're talking about pedophiles,
but even them,

237
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,040
it's the way they're wired is something
happened to them and then they try to

238
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:36,180
undo that wiring. That's noble work. But
I mean, at the end of the day, I mean,

239
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,500
we all know what needs to happen.

240
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,490
You got to take them out behind the barn
and give him the old fucking old yellow

241
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:45,430
treatment. All right?
So you can't help it.

242
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,580
I know it's not your fault. You want
to help. You want to fuck a kid?

243
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,040
We can't have that. Okay. Maybe

244
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,370
someday in the future. I
don't know when, but not now.

245
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,570
When would you, I don't know when
you would, but it's, it's, it's,

246
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,950
it's not gonna happen. So you
get done. It's over. Quit.

247
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,510
You cry and be a God damn man.
Right. And then that's it. So

248
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,480
keeping them honest, gay conversion
therapy, look at this fucking Weirdo.

249
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,280
How do they try to convert
you from not being gay?

250
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,800
I bet they just have you sitting
there, right? If it's a gay,

251
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,220
a gay man and they'd be
like, all right, okay,

252
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,970
we're going to do something
different here. Okay. And want you,

253
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,070
I want you to do is, uh, think
about having sex with a man.

254
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,520
Okay. And Are you doing it?
Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it.

255
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,450
I just keep thinking about that.
You haven't sacks, you know,

256
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,050
he smells like old spice, you know,
whatever you're into, blah, blah, blah.

257
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:46,680
And it gets the fucking due to Ra aroused
and then he just has some naked woman

258
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:51,630
come in and do like a flying scissor
kick and put her snatch rightness face.

259
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,860
Right. Gets that stank or on him.
While he's still has an erection

260
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,700
thinking that maybe that would take,
you know, other than that, I don't,

261
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,543
I don't know how you'd do it,

262
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,360
but what's funny about that was then if
they wanted to convert me to be engaged,

263
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,620
they would do the exact same thing
except the flying scissor kick would be

264
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:17,470
somebody package coming flying at my face.
I mean,

265
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,710
I want to go on a limb and say that,
that that's not going to work.

266
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,310
Okay,

267
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,610
dude.

268
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,570
How isolated are you as a fucking human
being that you're actually part of a

269
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:32,250
group that's trying to do
some shit like this? I mean,

270
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,530
I guess people looked at Orville
and Wilbur Wright like, yeah,

271
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:37,830
you out of your fucking mind.
You're trying to fly.

272
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,120
That's crazy.

273
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:45,130
So maybe they think that they're doing
that except with like sexuality. You know,

274
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,390
funny about the early planes is when
the people didn't understand that the

275
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,790
flapping of the wings was to gain speed.

276
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,070
So they tried to have like the
like, well I get, I don't know.

277
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,480
Isn't that what they thought?

278
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,740
Okay.

279
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,630
Isn't that something else that I haven't
read about that they thought that the,

280
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,290
it's got something to do with
the flapping of the wings

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,800
before they realize like, no, we just
need the somehow gained some speed.

282
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:14,440
We got to build something that somebody
can run with. Oh, Jesus. I look,

283
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,650
fuck you guys. I already told you I
didn't take any science classes. Okay, go.

284
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,630
You know. Anyways, Jesus is fucking
podcast is all over the place.

285
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,500
Uh, let, let's, let's do a little
advertising here. All right.

286
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,363
Um,

287
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,180
convert your kid back to being
straight kit. No kidding. All right.

A dollar shave club.
Everybody,

289
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,590
the big companies think we're stupid.

290
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,810
Every year they roll out some ridiculous
shave technology gimmick and expect us

291
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:50,130
to shell out big bucks for it. Yeah,
they got that new, uh, ball thing.

292
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,240
Oh, they got it. They're vibrating.
Handle roller pivot, ball,

293
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,400
back scratcher, ag timer, laser
pointer, corkscrew, all of that crop.

294
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,040
Um, do we really need that people
personally, I know that I don't,

295
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,270
I know that I don't, I know that I
was fine with two fucking blades.

296
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,310
One sucked unless she had a
straight blade. Uh, what do
you call a straight razor?

297
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,880
Or if you had one of those,
what do they call a safety raises?

298
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,080
Those things are fine, but if you just
talking about Gillette style razor,

299
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:26,280
which is what these people are selling,
okay, I need to fucking plates personally.

300
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,660
That's what I'm thinking anyways.

301
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:30,780
He said we were shaving just fine before
any of that junk and I definitely don't

302
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,400
need to spend my hard earned cash on it.

307
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,470
the fact that they're going to bring
it to your door, this is a no brainer.

308
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,660

your face after the disruptive act of

314
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,120
shaving. And you know something. Nobody
ever teaches us how to shave. Okay?

315
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,420
Nobody ever tells you about
putting something on your
face before you lather it

316
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:22,040
up. He gets dragged that razor
across and nobody has it.

317
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:27,000
Talks about any sort of a after
shave. So good for doctor cabby. Uh,

348
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,340
All right, so what am I going
to talk about now? Oh, so
today, so I came back, uh

349
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,730
Oh, by the way, you know,
it was awesome. After I,

350
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:23,000
after I did the taping at the
beautiful tavern, Ecker theater tavern,

351
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,810
Tabernacle theater in Atlanta.
Um,

352
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,970
Jason Law head, he, uh,

353
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,440
was looking for a place where you could
go out and smoke some cigars and it

354
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,930
turned out right in part
of the same building,

355
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,931
part of the Tabernacle is a new
cigar place called a Winston cigars.

356
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,110
And a,
I went in there and I had a great cigar.

357
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,910
They kept the place open late for us. I
want to thank everybody over there for a,

358
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,950
for letting us hang around and all of
that shape. We had a great time and uh,

359
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,070
definitely gonna stop there
again next time I come back.

360
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,110
And if you live in Atlanta
and you like cigars,

361
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:06,550
you want a cool place to hang out that

Got To hang out with a couple in there
from Worcester. So, uh, it was a,

364

388
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,590
You never know who drops in. Um, so,

389
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,220
so anyways, I haven't been
drinking. So today, uh, I was
like, all right, you know,

390
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,800
I've been on the road and Shit and
getting ready for this, a taping.

391
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm going to take my wife up. She
wanted to go to the beach, right?

392
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,050
So I got my little motorcycle
riding in the morning.

393
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,200
I didn't die and uh,

394
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,230
came back and I took her out to
the beach and I went over to a,

395
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,970
Oh, I did my workout over there,
right over there on muscle beach.

396
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,120
I stood there and a little banana hammock
showing off my fucking pasty body.

397
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,290
Now they got a,

398
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,680
they got pull up bars and they got
rings and they got the rope over there.

399
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:28,580
I hate the fucking new rope now.
They used to have like a real rope.

400
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,370
Now this one's made like, I don't know
if they put some protective thing on.

401
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:34,620
It felt like I was almost
made out of plastic. Um,

402
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,340
okay.

403
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,020
I guess for the weather
or something like that.

404
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:41,180
So it wouldn't disintegrate like the
last one did. But I did all right.

405
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,000
I did all right on it,
man.

406
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:46,610
I was able to go almost all the way
up to the top without using my legs.

407
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,530
Then I got to tell you for 46
and a bed and a fucking bed.

408
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,180
So after that we drive up to Malibu and
I'm thinking malleable. This is fucking,

409
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:57,670
you know, with all these rich people are
and everything, this is going to be nice.

410
00:24:57,671 --> 00:24:59,200
We go to the beach and I tell you,

411
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:04,201
I can't even begin to
describe the fucking animals,

412
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,590
the absolute fucking animals
that were at the beach.

413
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,960
I made. It is fucking
horrific. Fuck Dude. You know,

414
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:20,080
it's fucking hilarious is seeing people
from my generation and the generation

415
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:24,280
before, like the tattoos
that were in, you know

416
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,190
like dude, I saw this
guy in the beach, right?

417
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,030
And now that everybody's older and out
of shape and has kids and shit, this guy,

418
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:34,480
you know those fucking
stars that everybody had.

419
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,730
Everybody got him in the early 2000 they
were like red and then they had like

420
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:43,810
some sort of darker shading in him. I
mean I have a friend that has two of them,

421
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,800
I think one on each elbow.
So there's some fucking guy,

422
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,870
roughly the same age as my buddy.

423
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,500
He's got one just to the
inside of both shoulders,

424
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,570
which was sort of a weird place for him.

425
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:57,310
But if he had more tattoos that look fine,

426
00:25:57,311 --> 00:26:02,080
but he had no other tattoos in that
area. It was just weird. It's like,

427
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,560
what are you, are you like a
general in your own life? White?

428
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:07,930
Why do you have those fucking stars
there? Right? So we sit in there,

429
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:11,170
you could tell he used to be in shape.
You know,

430
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,290
they used to have the packs,
but now that kind of looking down,

431
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,490
staring at the floor,

432
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,610
big stupid pot belly and he's sitting
there as his kids are running around and

433
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:24,860
these eaten these digging into this bag
of chips and then not ships, you know,

434
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:27,610
all those things that look like the
onion rings but then not onion rings.

435
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,320
It's like if you had a potato chip,

436
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,740
but it was a fucking shaped like an
onion ring that he's just sitting there

437
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,770
eating those things.
So this other dude come by.

438
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,330
Okay.

439
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:37,930
I know,
Dude.

440
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,960
I am obsessed with trying to stay
in shape and not become what I see.

441
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,650
Okay. At the fucking beach. This
guy comes by, or Latino Guy, right?

442
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,430
Fucking big giant belly and
tattooed on his stomach.

443
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,900
You know, like Tupac had thug life.
This guy for some reason had Pasadena.

444
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,460
Oh, it was awful. It was fucking awful.

445
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,240
There were two hobbies on the
beach other than my wife. Uh,

446
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,550
there was like the fucking model couple
guy in woman in front of us who look

447
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,030
like they were,

448
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,350
they were shooting up fucking guests
ad and then all the way down the way,

449
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:21,280
there was some chicken,

450
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:25,930
a fucking pink bikini who was
working out on the beach total like

451
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,980
exhibitionists. It was great.
It was great. I kept saying,

452
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,260
I need to go and look what she's
doing now. Look what she's doing now.

453
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,490
She's doing,

454
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,130
she's doing a leg lifts with the weights
on her ankles and she kept looking over

455
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,450
going like, Oh God, no.

456
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,410
I love when women get mad at other
women who were fucking prancing around

457
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,880
showing that clam. It's
fucking hilarious. Yeah.

458
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm trying to think of
the guy version of that.

459
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,480
Okay.

460
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,780
What,
what would a guy be doing?

461
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:56,870
I guess I'm trying to think of something
that a guy would be doing in that

462
00:27:56,871 --> 00:28:01,070
version that would, that same scenario
that wouldn't make me laugh my ass off.

463
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,010
Do we think guys would do that?
Would ever bug me is, is uh,

464
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,010
I guess walk up and just start hitting
on your girlfriend or your wife or

465
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:11,810
whatever. Right in front of you. I
guess that would be the only thing.

466
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,230
Other than that, if they walking
around peacock and I don't give a fuck,

467
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,450
I think it's hilarious. You know, and
plus you're young. Go ahead. Exactly.

468
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,180
Go fuck around the surf.
What? You still can.

469
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,570
So anyways, we're sitting there, Alan,

470
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,890
the families do what kind of people
go to the beach as you can tell.

471
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,850
I'm not a beach person, so I
never went. Just fucking animals.

472
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,140
These fucking people brought a table down.
They've got a large cheese pizza.

473
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,980
They just sitting on the beach
getting fatter. You know,

474
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,110
it's like you're going to take
your shirt off in a second.

475
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:53,640
You're going to slam you gonna fucking
down four slices of Pepperoni mushroom,

476
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,200
Jesus Christ. You know? And I
would love to, I don't know.

477
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:01,900
I would love to act like, you
know, people try to act like it.

478
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:05,110
It's only in America where
everybody's all fat. Uh, we are,

479
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,130
we are pretty God damn fat because
that food is such fucking poison.

480
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,493
MMM.

481
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,980
But it's, it's still a shit
show everywhere else, I
dunno. And in its own way. Oh,

482
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,820
speaking of that, do
you know what I was, uh,

483
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,700
I was in Utah last week and I took this
picture and I put it up on Twitter and I

484
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:25,750
was in the gym,
right?

485
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,530
The hotel gym and they had a couple
of ellipticals and then they had a big

486
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:33,510
window when you looked outside.
And right across the street was a,

487
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,930
this fast food place. So I took a
picture of it and just Hashtag like,

488
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:39,250
come on man,
you know,

489
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,950
like I'm trying to lose weight here
in the attempt me with this shit.

490
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,340
So the fast food place sod and then
tried to write a joke about it,

491
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,150
like trying to draw me until the horse
shit the fucking poison that they're

492
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:53,830
serving.
They always say,

493
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,840
why don't you come over here afterwards
and do some fucking Hamburger Charles?

494
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,830
Get it. That's what they
hashtag you get it. You know,

495
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:04,100
acting like they're the cool,
okay

496
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,213
fucking

497
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,640
dailer of poison. Right. And I just wrote
him back. I was like, no, I don't get it.

498
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,630
Why would I work out and then go over
New York restaurant and eat that poison

499
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,980
kind of defeats the purpose of working
out. No, and they never wrote back

500
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,680
stop back then. Like,
you're cool. You know,

501
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,550
it'd be cool if they just
came out and said, listen,

502
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,590
what we're serving you is
absolutely fucking horrific.

503
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,810
There's barely an ounce of nutrition
in this shit, but God dammit,

504
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,380
it is fucking delicious.
So I don't have it all the time.

505
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,430
Just every once in awhile,
if they just came out and said that,

506
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,510
you know, I don't fucking know. I'm,
you know what I'm talking about here.

507
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:55,420
I'm just trying, you know, I'm just, I'm
just trying to get to another podcast.

508
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,820
That's all I'm trying to do. Um, you know,

509
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:00,910
I really thought I was going to have a
big feeling of relief when I finished my,

510
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,510
my special I could get on with my
life here and, uh, I don't know,

511
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,380
kind of feel love.
I feel a little melancholy.

512
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,150
I'm really going to miss those jokes.
I really am, man. I fucking, I, I,

513
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:18,151
that was my favorite hour and a half
a shit I've ever written and uh,

514
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:18,970
I dunno,

515
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,770
I might have to pull out those couple
of those every once in awhile somebody

516
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:26,920
requests one or something,
I might have to do that.

517
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,710
Okay.

518
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,030
I got this helicopter
joke, man. Wait, wait DC.

519
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,730
It's one of my favorite
jokes I've ever gotten to.

520
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:35,400
There's just so much fun to
fucking do it. You know, it's a,

521
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,020
that Steve jobs bit than I did.

522
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,360
I did that one on night and
too many stars that was up.

523
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,130
That was a sad one to let go.

524
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,480
I just loved when I was walking around
acting like he was eating a pair that was

525
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:46,620
so much fucking fun.

526
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,140
Just acting like an arrogant ass trashing
somebody that's accomplished way more

527
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:56,910
than I'll ever accomplish. You know,
those are the funniest moments.

528
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,660
And uh,
and stand up

529
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,120
is when you get to do shit like that
and just act like a fucking idiot.

530
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,980
And people actually laugh and that's a
God damn it making fun of Oprah's fun.

531
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,000
How was it?

532
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,540
How was it not fun to make fun of somebody
as successful as her who has like 50

533
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:18,950
fucking houses and her own TV network?
It's just fun. Do you guys know?

534
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:20,810
I had at one time I had a meeting.
Right?

535
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,220
Okay.

536
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,080
And uh,

537
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,600
I was meeting with the casting
director of, uh, of uh,

538
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,190
what does it dreamworks. Right. And
I know this sounds like a big deal,

539
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:35,600
but this shit happens all the time.

540
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,960
All the time when you're out
here from the day you get out,

541
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,320
you get a meeting with like
fucking back in the day,

542
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:45,350
like castle rock was doing all
the sick contract. Oh my God,

543
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:47,060
I got to meet it with castle rock.

544
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,170
They have like nine sitcoms on and they
just meet with you and you think you're

545
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:54,170
going to get on a Sitcom and you're lucky
if you get an audition within the year

546
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:57,200
that just always meet new people.
Right? So this is all is, it's a,

547
00:32:57,201 --> 00:32:58,160
it's just a meeting,
right?

548
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:03,080
So I go over there and I'm sitting
in the waiting room waiting to meet,

549
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,660
uh, with this big time
casting director. Right?

550
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,070
And all of a sudden I hear a,

551
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,040
okay,

552
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,300
this woman sing,

553
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,500
okay,

554
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,160
and goes,

555
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I hear this woman go and Spielberg
like that and I'm thinking like,

556
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,193
Holy Shit.

557
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,400
Yeah,

558
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,670
am I going to see Steven Spielberg? He's,
he's at the top of his fucking chain,

559
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,150
but you never see the top guy. So I'm
like, rubber neck and, and all this shit.

560
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,020
And I look,
and he's not there,

561
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,310
but the person who sang that,
it was Oprah Winfrey

562
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,630
and she walked by and I'm sitting
on the couch going, oh my God,

563
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,710
I have made fun of you on
like 50 fucking podcast. It's,

564
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:54,150
she walked by with her entourage
and a for half a second. We both,

565
00:33:54,151 --> 00:33:54,871
I was looking at her,

566
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:58,500
she actually looked over at me and
she just kept going for half a second.

567
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:02,820
I was so arrogant. I thought she
was going to stop and be like,

568
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,390
you're that punk ass who did that
fucking bit about me. You know,

569
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,640
it was going to start yelling at me.
And she didn't,

570
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:13,260
she just looked at me like I was a lamp
and she just kept walking and I was like,

571
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,660
oh yeah, that's right. She
has other things to do.

572
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,050
Evidently she was just saying
goodbye to Steven Spielberg.

573
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,920
How funny is it that she
doesn't just do that on a show?

574
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:29,430
That she actually really
sings stuff that she's saying

575
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,661
in real life does,

576
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:35,800
did you ever see that hilarious impression
that Maya Rudolph used to do of Oprah

577
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,080
and she used to do that thing where
she would sing to like the crowd. Okay.

578
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:45,580
And everybody gets a new co would do like
that thing that she actually does that

579
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:46,870
in real life.
You know?

580
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,080
Isn't that nice as a little
Hollywood story for your people?

581
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:54,910
I dropped two names in there
without you even noticing. Um,

582
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,900
all right. I don't know what to
talk about because hockey's over.

583
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:02,530
Basketball's over. I'm trying to get
into baseball. Oh, I will tell you this.

584
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,710
I'm actually thinking about getting
the baseball package and um,

585
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,800
as a red sox fan,
you know what I really missed doing?

586
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,300
Watching Yankee Games,
believe it or not.

587
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:19,050
I absolutely love watching the Yankee
telecast more so than I like watching the

588
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:22,360
red sox won.
I don't even know why.

589
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,310
I think because I lived in New York
for so long and I would just want,

590
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:26,850
and this is both,

591
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,550
this is when I lived during the height
of the curse of curse of the bay when I

592
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:34,030
was there.
So I fucking hated the Yankees.

593
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,400
So I went to Yankee
stadium a zillion times.

594
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,580
I watched all of their fucking games just
sitting there rooting against him and

595
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,140
must have saw Clemons pitch like
50 fucking times. I saw them.

596
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:50,640
I saw the 98 Yankees. Um,
which is legendary now. I mean,

597
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:53,970
I don't think there's been
a team like that sense. Um,

598
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,050
but I got to be on it. Like, I don't
know, there's something about it.

599
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:00,180
Like I did it for so fucking long.

600
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,390
I think I've actually watched wire to
wire more Yankee regular season games.

601
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:08,310
Then I have red sox games because I mean,
I was in New York for like,

602
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,210
I don't like 12 years.
And you know,

603
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,320
when I was a kid growing up, I mean,
the first 10 years of your life,

604
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,930
I mean you just run around
throwing sticks and mud and shit.

605
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:23,370
You're not really paying attention.
And then from 10 to 20,

606
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,160
I dunno, I would watch him, but you know,
you'd getting drunk for the first time,

607
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:31,320
you're trying to get up some girl's shirt,
you're busy.

608
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,400
So then I just basically had from
like 20 to 27 and then I moved.

609
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,950
Um, but I stayed in New York for like,
you know, fucking 12 years. So I, uh,

610
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,910
but I got to tell you,
I love watching them now because they're,

611
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,020
they're announcing team is,
it's the shit.

612
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,260
All Right, it's Michael
K, he's steering the ship.

613
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,210
And then I love when
there's nothing better.

614
00:36:56,211 --> 00:37:00,400
When you have former players that are
actually really good broadcast is,

615
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:03,800
and they have Paul O'Neill,
the former Yankee. Great.

616
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,620
And they have al Leiter.
So you have one, uh,

617
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,750
one of the great hitters of the
last 20 years and champions.

618
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,210
And then you have al Leiter a pitcher.

619
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,410
So you got a picture in here and just
the combination of the two of them. Man,

620
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,320
it's Al Leiter is hilarious.

621
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,500
Fucking hilarious.
And I,

622
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,190
and this is a thing I always
loved Paul O'Neil and uh,

623
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,430
every my money and my family actually
fucking love the guy because he was so

624
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:33,200
hilarious to us cause we all have tempers.

625
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,310
And the funniest thing about Paulownia
was the amount of times I saw that guy

626
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,110
come up to bat,

627
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,010
hit a fly ball to right field
and the second he hits it,

628
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:47,150
you'd see him put his head down and go
fuck and throw the bat down and it would

629
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:51,410
be a home run intellect
the third row. But he, he,

630
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,600
he was such a perfectionist. Like the
fact that he didn't get all of it.

631
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:58,540
He was mad.
I guess what the,

632
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:02,240
he didn't drive it 30 rows in
and then in every fucking time,

633
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:06,320
whether he got a hit or whether he didn't
get a hit when he ran out to the field

634
00:38:06,321 --> 00:38:08,990
and he would go out to right field,
he would immediately,

635
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,660
I guess he'd throw the ball around,
but once that was over,

636
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:15,230
he would be out the in between like
batters, it's in between pitches and shit.

637
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,400
He'd be out there practicing his swing.
I don't know. There's just certain guys,

638
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:22,100
even though they play on the team that
you hate, you can't fucking hate the guy.

639
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:25,800
The guy was great. So I was watching on
one of their telecasts recently and um,

640
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,793
they actually,

641
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,150
they cut to some footage of Al Leiter
facing Paul O'Neil and was hilarious and

642
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,780
of Paul and Neil gets a hit.
And then the last two that they showed,

643
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:41,440
Al Leiter struck him out and
he's like, oh, I struck yard.
I didn't even know that.

644
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,800
And then he looked over at
Michael and he goes, yeah.

645
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:47,680
And Paul didn't get that mad.
Was fucking great.

646
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,780
So I'm actually thinking about
getting the, uh, the baseball package,

647
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,320
cause I actually have a package where
I get the nes and network and I get the

648
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:59,680
yes network thinking that I'd get
the fucking games and I don't,

649
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,060
they blocked the whole thing out because
they say force you to buy, you know,

650
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:07,170
so I get the Milwaukee brewer home games.
It's such con

651
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:13,460
there's such fucking cunt.
Why can't they just,

652
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,400
you know, you know, I guess
it's my fault for moving away.

653
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,310
Do you understand what I'm
really bitching about here?

654
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,290
That basically for a hundred
something bucks that no, Boo Hoo.

655
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,770
Now I have to watch all the baseball
games you want to strike all of that.

656
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,470
God bless whoever came up
with that package. Um, uh,

657
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,270
what am I going here? All
right. World Cup soccer.

658
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,200
If you guys been watching,
I hate to say this man,

659
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:39,480
I haven't watched one second of it.
And I actually,

660
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:44,220
for as much as I make fun of a
[inaudible] football, the real football,

661
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,870
uh, I, you know, I, I totally respect
it. I think it's a beautiful game.

662
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:51,870
I just wish I had and I'm driving by the
bars and I'm seeing all the flags out

663
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:55,110
in the hearing. People
screaming and yelling. I wish
I had the time to watch it.

664
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:57,570
I know that there's some games tomorrow.
I think Brazil, please somebody.

665
00:39:57,571 --> 00:40:00,900
I'm actually going to try at
least maybe to tape a game.

666
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,820
I got to get into this shit's once.
It'd be four years.

667
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:07,500
The whole fucking world's going
nuts. Uh, but hey, you know what?

668
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:09,900
I said that the United States
is going to win it. I said,

669
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:14,880
the fix is fucking in and we are one o
one one. I haven't watched a second of it.

670
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,710
I know that we tied Portugal today,
which to me seems pathetic.

671
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,190
All right.
Portugal's barely in Europe.

672
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,100
It's like Spain felt bad for him to like,
all right,

673
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:29,640
here's a little landing strip. You
guys can fucking live over here. Okay.

674
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,320
You can have your little football team.

675
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:34,140
He once every four years we'll let you
run around and sing you songs and where

676
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:38,100
you scarves. But other than that,
your pipe the fuck down. All right.

677
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,240
Now if all you Portuguese people were
going to get mad at me, um, right,

678
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,380
all the mean shit you want.

679
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:47,200
And then also tell me where I can do a
show in your country and I'll fucking do

680
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,034
it.
All right?

681
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,400
You guys can go there and you can fucking
heckle me by singing your soccer songs.

682
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,820
He football songs right in the
middle of it and I'll give you shit.

683
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,540
And in the end, you know,
we'll trade jerseys,

684
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,730
you'll give me a soccer jersey and
I'll take off one of my button downs.

685
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,950
What the fuck was with that
guy who scored the goal today?

686
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:10,840
And he started sucking his thumb.
Can anybody explain that to me?

687
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,380
I don't understand soccer.
Every time you start to love it,

688
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:18,230
somebody does some shit like that. And
then you just, you just got to walk away.

689
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,720
So anyways,
we are one all in one.

690
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:21,980
Okay.

691
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,340
So we're gonna play Germany
next and basically if we tie,

692
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,530
if us in Germany tie, uh, we
move, we automatically advance.

693
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,050
We're one on one,
one Germany's one on one.

694
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,660
And in Portugal and in Ghana
I think is in our, in our, uh,

695
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,300
whatever division, whatever the fuck
you call it, quadrant. They both are,

696
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,830
have yet to win a fucking game. So, um,

697
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,170
I dunno, I, I, I'm,

698
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,640
I want us to win the World Cup so bad
just because I love what I was talking

699
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:59,530
about last week. Just how much world would
fucking heinous, but I gotta tell you,

700
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:02,320
man, I think we're going to win and
one, eventually we are going to win one.

701
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,480
And I don't mean that
like, well shit, you know,

702
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,240
they're going to play it
every four years forever.

703
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,750
Eventually everybody's going
to win one. I mean, I think,

704
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:11,970
yeah,

705
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,230
we're on our way to winning one.

706
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:14,580
Okay.

707
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,800
As in I think we'll win one by 2030.
All right.

708
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,000
Which is saying something, considering
how far behind we were. And in 2030,

709
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,570
if you want to know,
I will be 62 years old.

710
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,740
That's how fast it goes.
You know,

711
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,980
Jesus and I'll be working on
another fucking special. Um,

712
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,420
hopefully, maybe it'd be my year off.
All right, let's plow ahead here.

713
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,460
Um, anything else here?
Did the all in tour.

714
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,070
Oh, youtube fucking video of the
week. I was watching this, uh,

715
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,860
the dead weather concert.
I don't know how to private p.

716
00:42:53,861 --> 00:42:57,040
R. I. V. E. I started watching
this thing. I was trying to,

717
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,290
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

718
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,740
I was doing something and all of a
sudden I just started watching Jack White

719
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:04,300
videos and I got to this,

720
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,890
I can't believe I didn't see the dead
weather live because I got to tell you the

721
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:12,400
lead singer that, or at least what
I've been watching, that woman,

722
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:16,300
I hope I say her name
right, Alison Mosshart, uh,

723
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,060
is a fucking rock star. I'm going
to go see that band. What is it?

724
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:23,710
The kill that she's in. Very rarely do
you see a legitimate fucking rockstar.

725
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,320
And she's definitely one without a doubt.

726
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:28,810
So that's one of the youtube videos
of the week. Just fucking watch it.

727
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,400
And what's cool also is Jack
White's set up, uh, his drum set up,

728
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:37,420
how he has everything all level,
kind of like the way buddy rich did.

729
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,780
But he's is a wonder why actually buddy,
which is symbols will level.

730
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,050
That's right. This is some drum kick
shit. You can fast forward through this,

731
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,620
but he has like,
it looks like he has a rack,

732
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:52,530
Tom and then two different snare
drums all at the exact same lab,

733
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,780
all at the same level that you
would have your snare drum. Um,

734
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,160
and then on the A to his right side,
he's got three floor toms.

735
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,370
The Way Tony Williams used to have him.
Right. You guys all know it, right?

736
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:06,940
When he had that yellow yellow kit,
do you know I saw him at the regata bar.

737
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:10,360
I saw Tony Williams and
I knew he was awesome,

738
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,490
but I of course didn't understand
everything he was doing.

739
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:16,360
And in between the break I walked
right up and stood next to his drums.

740
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,970
That classic Yellow Kid.
I saw him,

741
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:23,971
I saw Louie Bellson shook his
hand and I saw a Roy Haynes.

742
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,270
I saw all these great jazz drums.
And of course,

743
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:31,470
Tony Williams like died a couple of years
later, unfortunately from a heart. But,

744
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,304
uh,

745
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,150
anyways, what the fuck? Why am I talking
to you guys about old jazz drummers?

746
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,410
Jesus Christ. Uh, let's, let's
get to some questions here.

747
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,720
Um, oh, by the way too, if you
want to, if you want to, um,

748
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,000
send in some questions or whatever, uh,
which you want to follow us on Twitter,

749
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,560
it's at the [inaudible]
podcast on Twitter. All right.

750
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,710
And all the videos that I recommend
and all the shit that I talk about,

751
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,280
I'll definitely, uh,
have the links up there.

752
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:04,080
It's way more organized than it ever
used to be. All right. There you go. Ah,

753
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,950
Bill, bunch of emails from people who
were at the taping, couple emails,

754
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,300
calling out Douche bags at the
first show for being loud. You know,

755
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:13,890
I didn't mind that, you
know, the first show,

756
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:18,891
they told everybody to stay in their
seats and we realized that that was wrong

757
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:22,770
because I was doing well over an hour
and people were drinking. They had it,

758
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:26,460
they had to go to the bathroom.
It wasn't fair. So, um,

759
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,070
so on the second show I was, I
just said to the people, you know,

760
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,940
who was shooting and things like, look,
people walk around all the fucking time.

761
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:35,520
I still have a good set.
I don't give a shit.

762
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:37,800
Just let them do what they
want to do. I don't, you know,

763
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,140
let's just make it more like a show.

764
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:43,170
And that's what we did in the second
show when even better. So anyways.

765
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:48,300
All right bill, in response to
male whore verse a female whore.

766
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,070
Um, all right, dear Billy Buffalo, uh,

767
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:56,310
I am a proud woman who loves other women.
Nice,

768
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,720
Nice.

769
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,720
[inaudible] I found your handling of
the whore gay son verse a whore for a

770
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:06,510
daughter.
Question to be spot on.

771
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,650
I also agree with the gay
man who wrote in last week,

772
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,610
if I was sitting around a table and this
question was posed, you know, it's funny,

773
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:15,720
I don't even remember what I said.

774
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,340
I'd feel it was addressing current
issues that are generally ignored, uh,

775
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:24,030
discussions that are usually
avoided in fear of discrimination,

776
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:28,740
but in actuality depriving important
dialogue. Yeah, absolutely.

777
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,200
You should be allowed to be
ignorant. Is Long, you know,

778
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,860
as long as you're not like acting on it
and like trying to hurt somebody should

779
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,080
be allowed to say the
things that you feel.

780
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,080
And if they end up being, um, you know,

781
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,990
I ignorant not mean dumb,
just ignorant.

782
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,330
Like you just want to expose
to some other information.

783
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,690
You got to have people get them out and
then that's how you move on to the next

784
00:46:56,821 --> 00:47:01,620
level. Like, no, actually
it's like this. Oh, I didn't
know that. And then, you know,

785
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:05,500
hopefully you change for
the better. Um, so anyways,

786
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,760
discussions that are usually avoid
it, blah, blah, blah, blah. She says,

787
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:13,110
I never knew my father, but I would hope
he would answer that question honestly.

788
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:16,860
Frankly,
I don't like labeling either as whores,

789
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,960
but it's the easiest way to sum it up.
I agree with you wholeheartedly. Uh,

790
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,960
caused somebody a whore that's really bad,

791
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,520
a hose kind of funny whore to
actually say it has really bad.

792
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,220
Um,
she continues to say,

793
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:37,450
I'd be remiss not to mention that Nia
spoke emotionally as a straight woman,

794
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,690
but did not consider why the question
is important to gate children.

795
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Oftentimes gay teens experiment
prematurely after having
repressed feelings for

796
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:49,120
their early,
for their ear,

797
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,080
early adolescents or from their
early adolescence. I don't know.

798
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,940
The truth is though,
emotional,

799
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,260
emotional changes and repercussions of
early sexual encounters affect the female

800
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,460
much more severely. This is not to say
that boys can't suffer the effects,

801
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:06,190
but as you and Nia have both
pointed out in the past,

802
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:10,380
women are more sensitive to certain
things that men are not. Um,

803
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,440
I was with you all the
way until, till, um,

804
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,400
why you say that the,
uh,

805
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:21,810
the sexual encounters affect the
female much more severely? Um,

806
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,720
I don't think that that's something
you could ever prove or disprove.

807
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,100
Like that's something that I always
go round and round with my wife with

808
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,290
somebody says, you know, it's
easier for guys to lose weight.

809
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,460
You know, I, it's like, well,
you would have to be a guy,

810
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,210
okay and then be a woman and then live
the exact same life and eat the exact

811
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,044
same food.

812
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:49,990
To really sit there and try and guess if,

813
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,440
if whatever is easier and whatever.
I mean,

814
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:57,150
I think it all kind of balances itself
out is far as easy and difficult.

815
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:57,984
It's like,
you know,

816
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,770
I dunno that just that whole fucking
reoccurring thing that this is a bad

817
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:08,370
experience but it's worse for women.
Um,

818
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,280
or this is this experience.
It's easier for guys.

819
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:15,540
It's just always like there has to be
something out there where it's even,

820
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:18,450
or there has to be something out there
where it's worse or aren't they both?

821
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:22,860
It's just kind of a big shit sandwich
out there. And the big game is, you know,

822
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,320
trying to block that out isn't it?

823
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,640
I would actually say that,
uh,

824
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,670
the guy's pain is that we are not
allowed to talk about our pain

825
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,030
at all.

826
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,140
Where you guys can have painful shit
happened to you and it's okay for you

827
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:46,430
literally to break down
sobbing and weeping,

828
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,820
which is so healthy for you to get it out,

829
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,140
to get it out of you. I mean, it
doesn't get it all out of you,

830
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:58,730
but it gets that the buildup,
the, the like, you know,

831
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:01,310
you have a cook oatmeal and you'll walk
away and you'll leave it too high and it

832
00:50:01,311 --> 00:50:05,330
fucking boils over. Yeah. That
shit. You can get that off.

833
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,540
I think through crime,

834
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,560
like the funny thing about crying is it
is a natural emotion for both men and

835
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:19,350
women. But we're told that
we can't do it. And I, it,

836
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:21,230
it's a fucking horrible thing.

837
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,693
MMM,

838
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:23,700
okay.

839
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,200
It's a horrible thing.
So I'm now,

840
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:28,100
I'm not saying that that makes you guys
have it easier, but I'm just saying that

841
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,230
that is, that is something
that I don't think that, uh,

842
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,820
is taken into consideration. And I just
feel like, you know, every time I see,

843
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,560
you know, I, that's a
reoccurring thing, but I,

844
00:50:37,561 --> 00:50:39,140
I agree with everything
else that you're saying.

845
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,670
I guess she probably thinking I'm a
dick now, but I'm just just saying that,

846
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,320
you know, like, um,

847
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,380
okay.

848
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,380
I Dunno if you're a guy and you know,
you got to cry,

849
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,280
but you don't want to embarrass yourself.
Just go take a shower.

850
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,630
Nobody's going to notice.
No one's going to hear you.

851
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,140
And if somebody would have ripped
back the fucking thing, the, the, the,

852
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,750
the shower curtain,
like in psycho,

853
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,150
you could just act like you
got shampoo in your ride.

854
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,810
Just don't start talking or I'll
still realize it, but you know,

855
00:51:10,811 --> 00:51:13,610
just have your head under the water and
just sort of look at it. I'm like, wow,

856
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,580
I'm showering. Get away from
me. You weirdo. Um, yeah,

857
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,440
you can cry out. A lot of childhood
pain is a guy in, in the, uh,

858
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:26,440
in the shower without anybody
knowing. All right, dear Billy,

859
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:30,760
ginger nuts.
Jesus Christ.

860
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,050
Can you fucking, you know, can you come
at me from a different God damn angle?

861
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:38,830
Everything's red hair red.
Pubes fucking pasty. I got it.

862
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:43,690
You think I haven't heard this my whole
fucking life? Jesus fucking Christ.

863
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,660
I gotta hand it to you guys.
You know,

864
00:51:46,661 --> 00:51:49,810
you have found 700 different
fucking ways to attack me.

865
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,030
I'm referring to the question raised,
uh,

866
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,680
whether it would be better to
have a daughter who Jesus Christ.

867
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:59,710
This fucking question really has been
living on whether it'd be better to have a

868
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:03,070
daughter who were a whore or a
gay son who was also a whore.

869
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,190
The best analogy I've ever
heard with respect to the whole,

870
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,420
why is it dean bad for a female to
be a whore but not a male is this?

871
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,410
If you own a key that opens,
opens lots of locks,

872
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,690
then that that is pretty cool,

873
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:21,760
but if you have a lock that
is opened by a lot of keys,

874
00:52:21,761 --> 00:52:26,170
then that is a shitty luck. You know?
It would've helped if I read it better.

875
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,410
She owned a key that opens lots of locks.
That's pretty cool,

876
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,410
but if you have a lock that
is opened by a lot of keys,

877
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,710
then that is a shitty luck. I
actually, I don't like that one.

878
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,560
I like my analogy because
I'm a self centered cunt.

879
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,810
I just think it doesn't take
any fucking skill. The love,

880
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,880
the skill level for a woman
to get late is just like,

881
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,780
what do you have to do? Lay on your
back, spread your legs. Who wants it?

882
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,230
I'm not saying you're going to
get somebody desirable, you know,

883
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,900
but the fucking work we,

884
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:04,340
this is something to try this one time
I told you I did this with my wife where

885
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,970
you just turn the tables one
night, have her hit on, you,

886
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,500
have her come up with an opening line.
You Watch,

887
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:17,340
you watch how much they bomb. He watched
the flop sweat. They got nothing.

888
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,280
You think you have nothing. They when
it comes to that shit, most of them are,

889
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,520
are like their game is where your
game was. You were like 12, 13.

890
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:30,090
The first few times you were trying
to talk to some girl in your grade,

891
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,400
you got nothing cause you
never tried it before.

892
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,410
That's where they're at
at like 35. Um, anyways,

893
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:41,820
free Billy. They they a golden
little play on the movie title. Uh,

894
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:45,180
Billy four times. Congrats on the
completion of your fourth special.

895
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,980
I can't wait to watch it with my friends.

896
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:52,080
We will all crowd around the tree TV like
one of the Roosevelt's fireside chats.

897
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,861
Okay.
This person,

898
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:57,861
a free willy reference and then hit me
with a little bit of a depression era

899
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,110
ship. Uh, my question to you is
how will you celebrate beers,

900
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:07,830
burgers. Uh, what did the coming
weeks have in store for you?

901
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,480
Please don't say working on your next
hour because no one likes a goody two

902
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:16,080
shoes. Yeah. You know why? Cause you're
still fucking up in your life aren't,

903
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:18,950
you know, it's funny, as I opened
this podcast talking about this, um,

904
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,430
okay,

905
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,530
I am going to drink,
but I also,

906
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:26,550
I don't want to put on the weight that
I took off for this special, you know,

907
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:31,260
I'm looking good for
me. All right? And, uh,

908
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:35,700
I actually have started this new
workout. I found this dude on, on,

909
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:40,650
uh, Youtube. I fuck, I think I told you
guys about them last week. This guy,

910
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:43,260
uh,
frank [inaudible],

911
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,860
frank Madrano fitness,
this guy,

912
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:49,650
he's a Vegan and all he does is,
uh,

913
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,020
his own body weight and he's
absolutely fucking shredded, shredded.

914
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:59,850
So, um, I'm going to try to, you know,
I've been eating a lot more vegetarian,

915
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,360
but I still, you know, I'm one of those
guys, I mean there's no fucking way,

916
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,270
you know, I'm still going to
have a couple of steaks a month,

917
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,030
but I'd like to try to
eliminate a lot of that other,

918
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,980
I dunno a lot of that.
You know what I,

919
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,680
this is what I liked about
eating vegetarian for two to,

920
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,770
I would try to go two days
a week and it was hard, man.

921
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,770
At first you don't know what to eat,
you don't know where to go.

922
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:26,360
You don't know how to make
anything of sucks. But uh,

923
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,810
the cool thing about eating vegetarian,
I would go back to back days,

924
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,610
Jesse eaten all Veggie.

925
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:36,140
What was great was it affected my
eating the other five days because it,

926
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:40,790
it really, it like reset your
cravings and I'm telling you man,

927
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,620
like when I get into that fucking sugar
salt thing, like back in the day, man,

928
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:47,420
I would go on like,
I don't know,

929
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:51,020
I would go on like a two and a half
month bender of just eating poorly.

930
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:53,210
I would still, you know, take
my dog on hikes and stuff. So,

931
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:54,800
and I never really let it get too bad,

932
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:57,500
but in that two and a half months
I put on like fucking 10 pounds,

933
00:55:57,501 --> 00:56:00,230
15 pounds or something like that.
And then I'm just, ah, fuck,

934
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:04,670
I got to tell you to get this shit off.
And um,

935
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,950
that great thing about,

936
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,320
okay,

937
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,260
or even just one meal a day,
if he's just do it all Veggie,

938
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:15,450
it fucking balances you out and
you stop riding that rollercoaster.

939
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,220
Sugar, salt, sugar, salt, sugar, salt. And
I fucking hate going to the gym. I fuck,

940
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:23,500
I don't like working out. I
mean, I like it, but I don't,

941
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,240
I don't like having to do it
because I'm a tub of shit. And,

942
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,074
um,

943
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,510
I can't recommend it enough if
you just start eating that way,

944
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,630
dude. If you go veggie two days
a week and you go for a walk,

945
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:41,600
ride a bike or do something like that,
the fats got nowhere to hide.

946
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:46,940
He's got nowhere to go. It has
to fucking leave, you know,

947
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:51,170
and then if you just sort of
decent the rest of the week,

948
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,240
you know, and I tell you, you
know, I saw I'll, I'll fucking,

949
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,920
I'll crush a pizza,
I'll order a fucking,

950
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,860
I'll order a pizza and a fucking
slam that I'll make cupcakes,

951
00:57:03,861 --> 00:57:05,270
like the twinkle toes that I am.

952
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,280
And I lead a bunch of
those in that type of ship.

953
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:10,460
But then I do the two veggie
days in a row and all of that,

954
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,370
it gets settles down again. Like
the, it's almost like a fire.

955
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:17,740
It doesn't get out of control. So
that has been working for me. And, uh,

956
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:22,400
I've been doing the pullups climbing
the rope and the dips in the pushups.

957
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,480
And, uh, I just liked that type.
I at this point in my life,

958
00:57:26,481 --> 00:57:29,030
I just liked doing that better
than a throwing the weights around,

959
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,640
but I'll always still like doing that
because I came of age in the eighties and

960
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,390
that was always fun, you know,
benching. So what am I going to do? Um,

961
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,800
I going to, I'm going to fucking party
with the all guys, smoke some cigars,

962
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:49,660
but uh, I am, I'm not a goody two shoes.
What I am is I'm somebody who fucking,

963
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:53,830
I already lived the life, dude.
I did all of that. Okay. And uh,

964
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,450
I'm too fucking old to keep,

965
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:58,540
to keep putting on 1520 pounds
and try and take them off.

966
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:03,010
I don't want to look like the fucking
horse shell that I saw at the beach today.

967
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,170
I don't want to be those people.
All right?

968
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:08,140
I don't want to be sitting here with
my fucking shirt off with my tits,

969
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:13,030
staring at my fucking toes, you
know, eating a bag of crisps.

970
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:16,040
I don't, I don't want to
fucking be that guy. All right?

971
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,660
You can do that in your 20s have at it,

972
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,060
and you can wake up the next day
and still fucking be in shape.

973
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:24,050
But I can't do it at my age.
So, uh, there you go. Um,

974
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,880
I dunno.
I rode a motorcycle today.

975
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,680
That's about the dumbest
fucking thing you could ever do.

976
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:32,100
So is that enough for you? Um, okay. Bill.

977
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:36,830
We'll the military hurt my comedy career.
Um,

978
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,370
hi bill. I'm an 18 year old standup
comedian in Atlanta, Georgia.

979
00:58:40,371 --> 00:58:44,870
I started when I was 17 and so far I
enjoy it while it can be shitty at times.

980
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,280
Um,
however,

981
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:50,060
I've always wanted to join the military
when I was young and still do to this

982
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:50,240
day,

983
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,750
I've been considering joining the army
and trying to become a green baret for a

984
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:56,780
long time now after I finished college a,

985
00:58:56,781 --> 00:59:00,950
this isn't a decision I made because I
played a couple games of call of duty and

986
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:01,784
thought it was cool.

987
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,910
I've just always wanted to do
something exciting and adventurous.

988
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,510
I realized that it's very hard
to become one. Uh, oh yeah.

989
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:12,490
I watched that thing on
Netflix and that was a,

990
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,520
that wasn't to be a green baret that was
to be like an army ranger or something

991
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:18,250
like that. I forget what it was
like, called like 11 days a health.

992
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,980
It was fucking brutal.
Um, anyways, he said, I

993
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,950
realize it's very hard to become one and
there's a chance I might not make it,

994
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,360
but I am pretty much training every
day and still have another four years.

995
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,670
However,
if I were to pursue this goal,

996
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:35,930
it would also mean I will not be able
to do stand up until I'm about 28 or 30.

997
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:39,350
I would like to continue with
stand up comedy once I get back,

998
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,890
but I am worried that I might be
a little too old to start by then.

999
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,900
Any suggestions? Jesus Christ?
Uh, well first of all, um,

1000
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:52,930
being a comedian is also an exciting
life and an adventurous life and

1001
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,200
mmm.

1002
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,230
I guess it all depends on what type
of adventure that you want to have.

1003
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,153
MMM.

1004
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,260
I mean, becoming a green baret is pretty
fucking bad ass. And that is a very, very,

1005
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:08,580
very small,

1006
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,663
uh,

1007
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,740
I guess club to be a member of.

1008
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,983
MMM.

1009
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:23,840
You know, so I wouldn't have
a say don't do that. I mean
it was fucking guy. I mean,

1010
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:26,420
if they're unbelievable,
they're fucking unreal. I mean,

1011
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,280
I was still stupid action movies,

1012
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,890
these actors flipping
over cards and everything.

1013
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:35,060
I mean like the true like actions, like
those navy seals, the green berets,

1014
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,870
the army rangers. I mean those guys are,
are there are fucking unbelievable. So,

1015
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:39,704
I mean that's a,

1016
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,030
okay.

1017
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,280
Um, I gotta be honest with
you. I don't, you know,

1018
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,590
I don't see any regret on either one
of those, cause I would just, whatever,

1019
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,230
whatever one you want to do more,
I would look,

1020
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,320
the great thing is you got four years to
get through college before you have to

1021
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,630
make this decision.
So I would continue doing standup.

1022
01:00:56,631 --> 01:01:00,550
I continue doing your workout and uh,

1023
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:01,850
yeah,

1024
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,070
you know, in four years,
just figure out, you know,

1025
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,170
you got four years to figure
out which one you want to do,

1026
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:09,800
but I can't give you advice
like that as far as a,

1027
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:13,850
you're 28 or 30.
Um,

1028
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,210
okay.

1029
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,860
Yeah,
I mean that's later than most of you,

1030
01:01:16,861 --> 01:01:19,860
but you're already doing it now and
you can also do it all the way through

1031
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:23,850
college and there's nothing stopping
you from doing it while you're in the

1032
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:28,470
military on your, your, your
weekends off or some shit like that.

1033
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:29,850
Um,

1034
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:31,270
okay.

1035
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,531
All right.

1036
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:35,040
Let's just say if you actually got into
the military and you didn't get out

1037
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:38,750
until you were 28 or 30,
I would say,

1038
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:39,703
uh,

1039
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:42,300
if that's the situation you were in,

1040
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:46,560
what I would do is I would just look at
comedians that started late and made it,

1041
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:51,570
and that's who I would focus
on. Um, I've always done that.

1042
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,810
I didn't always do that. I learned
to do that, so I stayed positive,

1043
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,453
you know what I mean?

1044
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:57,883
MMM.

1045
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:03,850
And it really is like, did
I, the business that I'm in,

1046
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,940
the worst thing that you can do was give,

1047
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,100
okay.

1048
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:13,080
You know, the other people, the
power mentally to just be like, well,

1049
01:02:13,081 --> 01:02:16,260
I'm too old. They don't want me. You
start thinking that way, then they don't.

1050
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:20,880
You just fucking, you go
out, you do your shit.

1051
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,130
And it's, it's really, uh, yeah,

1052
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,300
like even the way you're looking at this
and the way I just realized this now,

1053
01:02:28,301 --> 01:02:32,220
like it's not what the fuck can you not
walk on a stage and take a mic out of a

1054
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:35,610
mic stand at 28 or 30,
you're going to be a goddamn green.

1055
01:02:35,611 --> 01:02:39,810
Baret Jesus Christ should
probably repelling from a
fucking helicopter and come

1056
01:02:39,811 --> 01:02:40,644
through the ceiling.

1057
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,840
Um,
course you can.

1058
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,400
Course you can, you can fucking
do it. Because what it really is,

1059
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:51,640
is it's what you're doing then
is you're becoming an artist. Um,

1060
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,040
and then all that is,

1061
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,980
is that's just your own personal journey
and you're just trying to keep becoming

1062
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,380
a better artist and all
that other fucking crap,

1063
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,970
um, comes, you know, and if you
just keep working on yourself

1064
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,690
and try and get better and
better and better and better,

1065
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,170
eventually you become undeniable
and they got to let you in.

1066
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,610
That's basically what it is.

1067
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:13,980
Or You just go out and you make
your own shit and who gives a fuck?

1068
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,590
And then they'll come over to you.
Hey, what do you make an over there?

1069
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:20,400
I'm making this stuff. Okay. We'd like to
be involved. All right. What's the deal?

1070
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,690
Well, we're going to own it.
Hey, go fuck yourself. Oh, okay.

1071
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,150
Um, it's been my experience. Yeah. Dude.

1072
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:30,560
So you've got four years.
So I would,

1073
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:33,470
I would continue working out and
keep doing the standup in four years.

1074
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,520
Four years is a long time when
you're only 18 years old. So, uh,

1075
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:42,380
see what you think in the end. But,
uh, those are two very noble, um,

1076
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,120
you know, uh, uh, goals to try to achieve,

1077
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,080
I'm not gonna lie to you. I watched
that 11 days of hell and just, I mean,

1078
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:54,110
I was just wondering if, if, you know,

1079
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,190
just to see if I can make it through it.
If gotta be mentally tough enough,

1080
01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:02,450
forget about physically the mental where
down to those fucking guys yelling at

1081
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:06,830
you and the impossible situations that
they put you in both as an individual and

1082
01:04:06,831 --> 01:04:10,370
then in the group dynamic.
It's just, it's unbelievable.

1083
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,860
11 straight fucking days of that.
Um, I would love to do that, but I,

1084
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,740
I don't, I dunno. I'm
enough of a fucking psycho.

1085
01:04:18,741 --> 01:04:23,330
I wouldn't need to, to,
uh, to be in the military,

1086
01:04:23,331 --> 01:04:26,690
if you know what I mean. You know,
especially when we're at war.

1087
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:30,710
The last fucking thing I need to do is
break one of the only commandments I

1088
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:31,544
haven't broken yet.

1089
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,750
I guess I don't know
that I would come back.

1090
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:40,670
I don't know that I'm mentally strong
enough that if I went to that fucking

1091
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:45,540
place that I could somehow
come back. Uh, I dunno. Um,

1092
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:46,850
I'm out of my fucking mind.

1093
01:04:46,851 --> 01:04:50,750
So I have a tremendous amount of respect
for anybody who successfully becomes a

1094
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:54,710
soldier and can handle the demands
that are put on you. All right. Okay,

1095
01:04:54,711 --> 01:04:59,120
here we go. Catholic
girlfriend. Hey Aaron burr.

1096
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,080
Sorry if that history of reference
was a little too high. Brow. Oh,

1097
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:08,340
he full. Do you mean high brow? Like you'd
be like, I don't know who that is. Why?

1098
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,500
Hi Bro.
You know what?

1099
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,720
I'm not even going to take that person
cause you give me making fun of the

1100
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:14,870
listeners and making fun of
yourself. I have no fucking idea. Um,

1101
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,370
I love Aaron burr and he was right.
Okay. In a Hamilton's a cunt.

1102
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,470
He knew what he was getting
himself involved in.

1103
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:25,450
Any fucking lost fucking crybaby. Now
he's on the $10 bill. Where's Aaron Burr?

1104
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,110
Everybody hates him because he won.
You know, he's like the original Colby.

1105
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,040
I'm sorry if that history reference
was a little too high brow,

1106
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:38,041
but Aaron Burr was essentially the
biggest client in the early United States

1107
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,480
history. Small world. Right.

1108
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:41,890
Okay.

1109
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:46,510
I would love to hear you justify that
he was, he was one of the biggest cons.

1110
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:50,170
How about the people out there who
are committing genocide on the native

1111
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,320
Americans? What do you need though?
He was a Dick at dinner parties.

1112
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:58,950
Agreed to have a dual and had it
the fucking balls to walk out there.

1113
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:03,520
Any wins because Hamilton was cheating.
He fucking quick,

1114
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:07,510
whatever they did the quick cocked his
fucking gun. So when he brought it up,

1115
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,830
it was already, he did. Some do.

1116
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,040
Tried to do some little shady
fucking move before he brought it up.

1117
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:15,580
Stripe it should it fired.
So fuck him.

1118
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,550
Unfucking real.
I'm fucking real.

1119
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:24,470
Do you realize if Aaron Berg fucking lost,

1120
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:27,600
he would be on the $10 bill and then
you would have said that Hamilton's a

1121
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,870
biggest content.
Who the fuck would you be?

1122
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:33,050
Do you be talking to that guy
in the rangers? Um, anyways,

1123
01:06:33,051 --> 01:06:36,740
I've been seeing this girl for around
six months now and I'm seriously nuts

1124
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:37,221
about her.

1125
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:40,970
I love spending time with her and can
see this relationship even leading to a

1126
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:43,070
ring in a few years. Oh, congratulations.

1127
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,520
But the big problem for me
is we're not having sex.

1128
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,540
She's very religious,
which

1129
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,080
now all the age,

1130
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,450
she's very religious,

1131
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:57,710
which does not bother me because she
doesn't care that I'm not extensively.

1132
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,830
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Um,

1133
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:01,990
okay.

1134
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,720
You know what,
why don't I look that word up you guys,

1135
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:10,010
when you want me to take a guess here,
even though I'm not ostensibly

1136
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,280
I, you know, I can't even guess what the
fuck that means. What does that mean?

1137
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,120
You go twice a year.

1138
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,800
Can I even spell it? Uh, stents.

1139
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:27,670
Well, there it is. It figured it out.

1140
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:33,100
Thank you computer apparently or
purportedly, but perhaps not actually.

1141
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,220
You know what God says, why? Why,

1142
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:38,920
why do you try to become smart
when that's the fucking answer.

1143
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,310
Um, you know that that's a
great line to give a cop.

1144
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,530
Okay.

1145
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:53,510
You've been drinking tonight apparently
or purportedly, but perhaps not actually

1146
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:03,070
fucking flashlight to they head.
Um, to all outward appearances.

1147
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:05,143
Okay.

1148
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:09,550
So I guess that's a fancy way of saying
apparently is this guy a hipster and

1149
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:13,480
he's sick of all the hipsters
saying, apparently, apparently.

1150
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:18,680
Um, where am I? Cause she does not,

1151
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,060
wait, let me read this now. Now that I,
I just learned what ostensively means,

1152
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,720
which, okay. But the big problem
for me is we're not having sex.

1153
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:29,390
She's very religious, which doesn't
bother me because she doesn't,

1154
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:32,390
it doesn't care that I'm not extensively.

1155
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:33,760
Yeah.

1156
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,400
I have to go back and look it up again.
I don't understand what this means

1157
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:41,530
to all outward appearances.
You're not religious.

1158
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,590
Is this like some fancy way of
saying that your mysterious anyways,

1159
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,720
it's her choice and it
didn't bother me for a while,

1160
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:52,630
but I guess my fucking hormones are
starting to get the better of me.

1161
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,810
We're both in college right now and
come from different backgrounds.

1162
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:59,350
She does community service
and I'm a Frat shithead.

1163
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:03,550
I break it off if I didn't feel
as strongly about her as I do,

1164
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:08,770
but I'm not sure how much longer I can
put up with my most intimate partner

1165
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,040
being porn hub and a bottle of lotion.

1166
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,030
Should I tell her how I feel or
just quit being a selfish bastard,

1167
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:21,010
a selfish bastard? Are My concerns normal
or am I being a con? Um, first of all,

1168
01:09:21,011 --> 01:09:25,150
you're not a Frat shithead if you actually
have empathy as far as the stereotype

1169
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:26,980
goes,
you're actually a very mature person.

1170
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:29,860
You seem like you know what you
have and you don't want to lose it.

1171
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,933
MMM.

1172
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,910
Oh,
how do you say I respect your,

1173
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,430
okay,

1174
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:41,140
your religious views,
but

1175
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,750
how does the bearded baby Phil
about the occasional hand job,

1176
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:52,820
does she know the, you're
watching? I tell you,

1177
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:57,080
it's not a good thing to only be watching
porn and not having sex with somebody.

1178
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:57,983
Uh,

1179
01:09:59,150 --> 01:09:59,650
okay.

1180
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:03,220
I Dunno. Are you starting to become
more of a serial killer? I have no idea.

1181
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,780
Hey Nia.

1182
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,270
You know what I, I gotta I gotta
Bring Nia and for this one,

1183
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:12,210
yeah,

1184
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,310
I got to bring her right for this
one. Hang on one second. Let me,

1185
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,240
let me hit pause here.

1186
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:17,620
I don't want to hit pause.

1187
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,580
All right, the lovely near everybody.
Hello. All right, here we go. Um,

1188
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,500
here is the question. So
this kid, he's basically,

1189
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,500
I'm going to paraphrase here so listeners
don't have to listen to it again.

1190
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,670
He's got a Catholic girlfriend.
Um,

1191
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:39,940
she's very religious.
Just to pull the microphone back.

1192
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:44,380
You're breathing into it
there. Sorry. Sorry. I think
I had turned up too much. Um,

1193
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,050
anyways, uh, you know,
Catholic girl, very religious,

1194
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:54,820
does not want to have sex before marriage.
And he's saying,

1195
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:59,200
you know, they've been
together for awhile. He loves
or spending time with her,

1196
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:02,500
can see actually given her a ring in a
couple of years, but the big problem is,

1197
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:06,580
and not having sex, she's very
religious. Um, he's not religious,

1198
01:11:06,581 --> 01:11:10,750
but she doesn't care. He said it's her
choice and you know, to not have sex.

1199
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:14,190
And it didn't bother me for awhile,
but I guess my hormones are starting

1200
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,090
to get the better than me.

1201
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,910
We're both in college right now and
I come from different backgrounds.

1202
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,830
She does community service and I'm
a frat boy, shithead Frat Shit.

1203
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,820
Eddie said I break it off if I didn't
feel as strongly about or as I do,

1204
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:29,970
but I'm not sure how much longer I can
put up with my most intimate partner

1205
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:34,110
being porn hub and a bottle of lotion.
Should I tell her how I feel?

1206
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:38,490
But just quit being a selfish
bastard on my concerns. Normal.

1207
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,840
Or Am I being a cunt? No,
you're not being a cunt.

1208
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,220
I think he's actually being really great.
That's what I thought. Yeah. I mean,

1209
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:51,110
you should definitely tell
your girlfriend, but be
prepared but don't play.

1210
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,260
How does he do it? Because what I would,
what I would, if I was in that situation,

1211
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,910
I would try to say, you know, it's,
you know, it's just a hand job.

1212
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:06,160
It's just a handy, just a handyman. No, I
think you should tell her I was feeling,

1213
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:09,890
but I would just walk out with my day.
You gonna keep interrupting me.

1214
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,470
Can you help me out all week?

1215
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:19,420
That sounds like something you would
do actually. Uh, she'd laugh. Uh, no.

1216
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:23,310
I mean, you tell her how you feel, but
don't frame it in the context. Like,

1217
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,770
I'm fucking dying over here. What
are you doing to me? Oh my God.

1218
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,950
Don't make it like a guilt trip. Just
say, just, just so you know, I'm,

1219
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:35,230
I'm really having a hard time with this
because I love you so much and I really

1220
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:39,100
want to have sex with you,
but I know you don't want to,

1221
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:43,140
I don't want to pressure you. They
make love I'd rather than sex. Well,

1222
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:47,500
however you want to it. Love is
gross. No, it's not. It's gross.

1223
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:51,070
Make love. Yeah. I mean, I don't
know. It's gross. It's just,

1224
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,930
it's very like old fashion.

1225
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,110
It's like what you say when you're trying
to like be nice about it or something,

1226
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,290
you know? Yeah. Fuck. You
don't want to say that.

1227
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:03,400
That's my favorite line in the movie.
What? Tom Robinson Bull Durham.

1228
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:07,120
We don't fuck a word. Oh yeah.

1229
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:11,140
Um, but yeah, just, just
tell her and the thing is,

1230
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:13,840
she's probably feels the same way.
She might be frustrated.

1231
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:20,140
He has been looking at Becky,

1232
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,150
she's been listening to this southern Rep,

1233
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:29,590
white and black people in the south.
They pronounced in certain words,

1234
01:13:29,591 --> 01:13:32,650
they just pronounced the beginning
with the first couple of letters. Yeah.

1235
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:35,540
Yeah. You drop off.
Like, if it, if a word,

1236
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:39,110
it has like two like syllables.

1237
01:13:39,111 --> 01:13:43,400
You got to just do the
first one to start on a new,

1238
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,640
uh, but anyway, yeah, just, just,
just be honest with her about it. But,

1239
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:50,870
but just,
you know,

1240
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:55,120
make it clear that she knows how much
you love and respect her and that's,

1241
01:13:55,130 --> 01:14:00,050
that's all you can do. But how does
he do it without her feeling pressure?

1242
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,370
She might feel pressure.

1243
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:05,000
She probably already feels pressure
from society or whatever. So, you know,

1244
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,320
she's already feeling the pressure,
but he just said

1245
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:10,930
Tara and be like, listen, I'm not
trying to put any pressure on,

1246
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:14,110
I'm just telling you where I'm at.

1247
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,420
Because if he keeps going to porn hub,

1248
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,960
what happens is with porn is you have
to keep going further and further and

1249
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:21,160
further down the fucking hall.

1250
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:24,060
Well when they finally have sex,
she's going to be like, what?

1251
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:25,050
What do you want me to do?

1252
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:30,750
You know she's going to be freaked out.
Cause that's the other thing,

1253
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:35,220
you watch too much porn and like porn
becomes like your reality about what

1254
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:40,200
everyday relationship sex. And so there's
all kinds of like, I, it's, I don't know.

1255
01:14:40,201 --> 01:14:42,600
I mean obviously kill me,
but it's like,

1256
01:14:42,601 --> 01:14:45,000
be careful what that porn
shit cause it's awesome,

1257
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:49,050
but it will really like put you on another
planet if you're not careful about it.

1258
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:52,530
And you just start thinking like people
should be performing like porn stars and

1259
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:55,170
you should be performing like porn stars
and you should be able to do all these

1260
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:59,250
crazy shit. These people are paid
to have sex. That's their job.

1261
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:03,840
That's not your job. So just, I
dunno, just be careful with that.

1262
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:07,560
I just feel it was like, well what
the fuck is he supposed to do though?

1263
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,780
This is the thing you masturbating.

1264
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:14,600
Yeah, I know. Thank [inaudible] wasn't
around when I was fucking that age.

1265
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:15,620
Jesus Christ.

1266
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,320
How did you watch porn at that age?

1267
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:21,480
You would like sneak old VCR
tapes from your older brother. Um,

1268
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,840
no. Like how did you do it with
nobody had a porno in my house.

1269
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:29,350
No fucking way.
We had one VCR in the family room.

1270
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:34,780
Fucking watch it. It was impossible.
I used to sneak and watch.

1271
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:39,460
Do you remember a Emmanuelle?
It was like the soft core,

1272
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,820
like Cinemax show.
It was like from Europe,

1273
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,510
it was from Europe and it was all like
soft lighting and it was all about this

1274
01:15:46,511 --> 01:15:49,400
girl and manual who would have
these like sexy adventures.

1275
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,490
Like she's going on a train to Paris and
then like she looks over and you know,

1276
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:57,450
she the a guy like bang in
the fucking, I dunno, could

1277
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:00,700
literally and figuratively,

1278
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:06,390
no. Uh, the first time
I saw a porno, uh, uh,

1279
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,210
a buddy of mine had it,

1280
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:13,280
buddy of mine got one and we were all
on our way out and like five of us just

1281
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,170
sat there and watched it

1282
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:21,110
and then just got up and went out like 17.

1283
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,190
I watched a porn at a sleep over, but we
were like in eighth grade or something.

1284
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:28,370
Like she stole it from her dad
and it was like a seventies porn.

1285
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,430
It's always just like everyone's
a hairy and it was just this guy.

1286
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,040
Like it wasn't the ones, the one
that I saw I, where'd it go? Me Out?

1287
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:39,680
The one that I saw, I swear to God,
I swear to God this happened. Okay.

1288
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,890
The dude who was he,

1289
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,140
he was working at a restaurant and
he was getting laid and he's fucking

1290
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:49,880
everybody. And they had this fucking old
ugly lady comes in, was giving him shit,

1291
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,300
you know, make the chicken sandwich
and I want extra mayo on it. Yeah.

1292
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,320
Oh God. Oh No, this is even worse.

1293
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:01,830
Can instead of just having
a guy jerk off onto the fuck

1294
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:06,900
sandwich, I swear to God, you know,
or Twista re chicken, you know,

1295
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,690
you can just buy one that's already
made. Yeah, he fucked it. Oh my God,

1296
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,750
this was an a porno.

1297
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,600
See nowadays that that would
have been considered BCL no,

1298
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:19,660
it was considered like they
were trying to be funny.

1299
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:23,230
I was and they were trying to be like
funny cause they play like there's weren't

1300
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:28,400
wink apparently this wacky music when
he was doing it right. And I was like,

1301
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,220
you gotta understand.
I had never seen a fucking porno.

1302
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,040
And it went like the
first time you saw a need,

1303
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:36,230
especially back then where as like,
uh,

1304
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,300
like the most overtly like sexual thing.

1305
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:43,301
Like when I was a kid was Brooke shields
the one button on a shirt and you know,

1306
01:17:44,881 --> 01:17:48,470
went from that to watch
people actually fucking,

1307
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:51,740
and then there's dude's stuck his
dick in a chicken that's discussing,

1308
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:55,120
remember when we went to go see that?
Um, what's that? Quintin Tarantino.

1309
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:56,120
It was grind house.

1310
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:00,110
It was like the two movies and then in
between they had the fake trailers and

1311
01:18:00,111 --> 01:18:04,640
one of them was Thanksgiving and they
show that quick little like two second

1312
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:08,300
thing at the end of it of a guy like
fucking a Turkey remembering and everyone

1313
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:11,540
in the movie theater went
through it in like fabric.

1314
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:16,550
Like I would not be surprised if they
got that idea from that very porno that

1315
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:17,960
you watched.
Yeah,

1316
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:21,890
because back cause I think Eli
Roth directed that like trailer,

1317
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:25,520
that fake trailer or something.
But yeah, that's discussing. Yeah.

1318
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,880
Like no we're not lacking in.
And I remember like the videos.

1319
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,940
Then after that the video store
came out and then the video store,

1320
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:33,350
it had the back room with ours.

1321
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:35,620
It had those so funny they
had these saloon doors.

1322
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:40,100
He had to walk through end to get into
the back room and there wasn't me being

1323
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:43,940
like a beaded curtain in some areas
like that was like the sexy area.

1324
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,440
It was whether it be the
current one and I have to,

1325
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:50,030
it was so early on I don't
think that there was categories.

1326
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:53,520
They just had porno. It was
all straight porn. Yeah.

1327
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,550
Growing up in a suburb,
right.

1328
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,800
It was just all straight porn.
There was no,

1329
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:04,610
there was no like categories like uh,
you know,

1330
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:09,050
whatever fucking doggy style
ones or it's more like,

1331
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,050
I feel like it's like
race or racial identity,

1332
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:16,710
like Asian boy agent Paul or have an
evil bondage, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1333
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:21,260
There wasn't just Debbie,
it was just people fucking on camera.

1334
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,640
That's all it was.

1335
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:27,970
It was a man and a woman fucking or
man and two women fucking are two guys.

1336
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:30,230
Fuck it.
A woman and that within the occasional,

1337
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:34,340
and then the chicken thing was a bit like
it was supposed to be this funny thing

1338
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,970
and that I had and it was funny because
it was the first one I have a solid,

1339
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,240
I was sitting like what
the fuck? Right. Um,

1340
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:43,700
but then I was also site
cause I actually saw some,

1341
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:48,320
I is actually saw porno a we getting
bagged and shit and it wasn't until years

1342
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,200
later, wait a minute, I
think I was hanging out,

1343
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:55,720
I was still living with Bobby Kelly and
we were talking about the first, yeah,

1344
01:19:55,730 --> 01:20:00,140
the first pornos that we saw. I remember
telling that and he was just going,

1345
01:20:00,141 --> 01:20:03,830
what? And I go, dude, I swear to
God. He goes, what was the name?

1346
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,620
Like I don't know what the name of it was.
My buddy just had it. I, but you know,

1347
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:07,980
you know

1348
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,680
who would know, you know, who would know
the answer to it is David's [inaudible].

1349
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:15,340
He would know. I bet if you asked
them or if we tweeted him and said,

1350
01:20:15,341 --> 01:20:19,590
do you remember ever seeing a porno from
circa whatever year that is. And a guy.

1351
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:24,390
If I bet he would know, you realize
you just blew up his Twitter account.

1352
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:28,530
All right,
we're going to end with this dilemma.

1353
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,530

01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,080
I'm still fucking up and I'm
getting better. Uh, dilemma.

1406
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:37,691
Hey Bill,

1407
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:42,550
would you rather be morbidly obese to
the point where just walking around is

1408
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:43,384
exhausting?

1409
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,840
I'm talking over 350 pounds and you
weren't allowed to lose the weight.

1410
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:49,391
I love that.

1411
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:53,830
You already answered or would you rather
be stuck in prison for the rest of your

1412
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:54,150
life?

1413
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:58,570
Oh, God. Stuck president. Rarely.

1414
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,450
It's a shallow way.

1415
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:06,240
Um, I feel like though, hey, easy, easy.

1416
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:12,420
If you're 350 pounds or whatever,
that's my fault. By the way.

1417
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:16,800
I'm not good with the mixture. Oh, okay.
Uh, it's like you're already in prison.

1418
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:21,090
You're in prison, in your own body. I
think they're both prisons, aren't they?

1419
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:25,860
I mean they are, but I mean it's
like, oh, I see what you mean.

1420
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,470
No, no, I'm agreeing with you. Yeah.

1421
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:32,530
You just had a nice little
metaphor there and I ruined it. Um,

1422
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:37,800
but I rather be obese. It'd be in prison
for the rest. No brainer. Yeah, yeah,

1423
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:41,850
yeah.
But I can't just make it a fun.

1424
01:24:41,851 --> 01:24:44,640
You'd have getting that fat.
That's the thing.

1425
01:24:44,641 --> 01:24:48,180
It would be really fun to just be like
eating all the good shit that you can't

1426
01:24:48,181 --> 01:24:52,140
have in prison. They don't have good food
there. So maybe I would rather be obese.

1427
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,780
I don't know.
Jesus Christ,

1428
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,510
you might just, somebody's obese listening
to this right now. They're basically,

1429
01:24:57,511 --> 01:24:59,980
you are basically saying, Gee,
I would rather be in prison

1430
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:02,770
for the rest of my life to be you.
I definitely rather be

1431
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,310
silly like objective thing that's
new for you to get on a plane,

1432
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,480
talk about it and people
shouldn't get offended by it.

1433
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:15,740
Get on a plane with your two seats and
your giant seatbelt and you can fly

1434
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:19,280
anywhere in the fucking world
and go get even fatter. Right.

1435
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:23,190
Do you have to buy two seats if
you're like over a certain weight?

1436
01:25:23,191 --> 01:25:24,690
What's the weight requirement now?

1437
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,230
Whenever it is like the Kevin
Smith is over it. Right?

1438
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:29,520
Cause that's how why he got,

1439
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:33,480
he had that whole problem with JetBlue
or southwest because they thought

1440
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,390
southwest. Cause they were
like, yeah, you need to buy.

1441
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:43,200
I don't think he was that big
though. Like two seats big. I Dunno.

1442
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:47,660
I've never met him. I met him. He wasn't
two seats big when I saw him. Yeah,

1443
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:52,050
I dunno. Maybe they're just
being decks. Look the only time

1444
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:56,070
southwest is a great airline,
but I don't like, uh,

1445
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,890
I don't like all the jokes that they tell.

1446
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:01,340
I get it that they're trying to make it
lighten it up and with a cool company,

1447
01:26:01,341 --> 01:26:04,790
but it's like my life
is in hands right now.

1448
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:09,470
I would, I would. I thought you meant
the stewards and this, even that.

1449
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,700
I don't like being sad. I don't
like it either. I've kind of,

1450
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,720
what I find,
I find when you're going someplace,

1451
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:19,020
if the person at the top
is doing their job right,

1452
01:26:19,021 --> 01:26:22,920
everybody beneath is also in line and
they come off like the rod a line.

1453
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:25,340
It seems like the,

1454
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:30,030
the vibe on a southwest flight is
that this is substitute teacher.

1455
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,150
I don't like that. You
know what I mean? I like,

1456
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,640
I liked feeling like shit is in order,
you know?

1457
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:40,880
Have you seen on Virgin Airlines that
there's safety video is like this full

1458
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:43,570
scale music,
video production fucking thing.

1459
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:45,250
It's like a little kid that wraps into,

1460
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,510
there's like a little Asian girl
that wraps a little black kid.

1461
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:51,050
That's awareness suit. I was like in those
break dancers you can't get away from,

1462
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:53,270
it's a whole can't get away.
I was actually like,

1463
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:56,750
I was actually finding myself happy for
the people that were in the view that

1464
01:26:56,751 --> 01:27:01,430
they were got work and exposure on
this level and I was, I was like,

1465
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:04,130
how much money does Richard Branson have?
He really made,

1466
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:09,370
I hate the mood light behind the music
behind the scenes video of how they made

1467
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:11,750
the thing on it.

1468
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,150
So when Williams or where are you
saying you hate the mood lighting?

1469
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:15,830
Where on Virgin?
Why?

1470
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:19,700
What do you mean you walk on and you
just going to get an STD on the fucking

1471
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:22,760
thing. I Love Virgin Airlines. I love it.

1472
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:27,650
That all mine like origins.
Cool. I I don't, I jet blue's
cool. Jet Blue is good.

1473
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,680
You get to watching ESPN the whole
way across the country. I liked that.

1474
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:34,280
I liked being able to watch all my
stupid like Bravo, real housewives.

1475
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,410
I the only airline I really don't
fucking like other than the,

1476
01:27:37,411 --> 01:27:42,110
just the crazy ones that I used to fly
when I was starting out. Like that was it.

1477
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:46,340
Ata or some shit. Oh, I don't know. All,

1478
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:50,390
all trans something.
Try and err. Yeah. Yeah.

1479
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,140
You know the airlines I've flown that
don't even fucking exist anymore at this

1480
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:57,080
point. We just got swallowed up. Uh,

1481
01:27:57,081 --> 01:28:01,440
I flew people's express in
the age. What is that? Oh,

1482
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,340
it was like the precursor to value
jet man. It was fucking shady.

1483
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:08,130
I remember values yet. Um,
they had that fire. Um,

1484
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,580
unfortunately,
uh,

1485
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:14,060
I need to go back. Um,
I would rather be obese

1486
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,280
eastern airline

1487
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,310
my, but yeah, my mom has to work for
eastern choose to fly. She was a PE

1488
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,840
anyway. And northwest, none
of these exist anymore.

1489
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,470
None of them are you. They'll get bought
out or they went out of business. Uh,

1490
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,340
wait, can we go back? So got
a flight. Franks airline.

1491
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:34,970
Can we go back to that? Sounds like like
a corner store. Like a place like a deli.

1492
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,920
Frank's like a deli. Sell
hotdogs. I made that up.

1493
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:44,730
Rather be obese and free than in a,

1494
01:28:44,731 --> 01:28:47,840
in exactly apologize to
people who were overweight,

1495
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,800
apologizing. We're in the age of apologize
and take a fucking joke. Fatty. But

1496
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:00,530
you and your fat shaming. But you
know what? The fat, shame, shame,

1497
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:03,270
shame,
American in the Frat people.

1498
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:08,250
Shame is such such a fucked up
industry that I would not want it off.

1499
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:11,340
You have no, I wouldn't get off
your, I wouldn't want to be,

1500
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:15,570
I wouldn't want to be in prison. That
was, that was a stupid answer. Said that,

1501
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,200
that was my main answer. We got it.
But I admit that, hey, I want to,

1502
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:23,340
I'm going to start a new segment on here
where I felt shame somebody every week.

1503
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,130
Cause I know cause I'd make it work.
Why don't you shame other people too.

1504
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:30,060
Can you shame just shame. Can I finish
across the board and I'd finished here?

1505
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:31,930
Sure.
So the jingles,

1506
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:35,550
consider that chain of fools where they
go chain chain chain. I'm gonna Shame,

1507
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:39,640
shame, shame, boop, boop,
boop, boop and other songs.

1508
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:42,620
Shame on you. I don't know that I'll
have somebody sing the high pod. Yeah,

1509
01:29:42,621 --> 01:29:47,520
add those cupcakes. You really are
just going to go with this idea. No.

1510
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:50,010
Your nods. Yeah. Yeah. I'll wait.

1511
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,990
I'm going to show that it
works through that on news.

1512
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:53,300
They used to do this shaver,
remember?

1513
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:56,580
And they'd have this like graphic of a
finger pointing and it was the reporters.

1514
01:29:56,581 --> 01:30:00,450
I'd be like, they would go up to
like slum lords that he used to. No,

1515
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:02,820
they had their own,
they had their own little like jingle.

1516
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:06,780
But I'm telling you is that they, yeah,
they were like burst into places and say,

1517
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:09,930
I hear, you know, we hear that you're
charging, customers were bup, bup, bup,

1518
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:11,370
and don't you think that's wrong?

1519
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:15,550
And they'd have to like get the owners
to try to like fess up. I, yeah,

1520
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,550
it was a finger wagging and that was it.
That was it.

1521
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:24,780
I don't know if there's a religious nuts
out there that can try to like make gay

1522
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:29,040
people straight and they're trying to
show like that they think that that works.

1523
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:32,690
Right. Oh, and I kind of liked
those people where I think shaming,

1524
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:36,040
I've actually had iPad,
that's what they do on the biggest loser.

1525
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:39,840
And I thought when they scream at them
and make them cry, make them puke.

1526
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,050
I can't believe somebody just
hasn't dropped of a heart attack.

1527
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:47,580
I know they've been writing articles
about that show and how it's really fucked

1528
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:50,970
up. You know, I wa I used to watch it
all the time cause I was like, I found a,

1529
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:55,950
and you'd sit there and cry with them,
laugh and you did a bit about it.

1530
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,400
I remember because that's,

1531
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,090
that's what you were talking about
how like they had so much fun.

1532
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:01,350
Like they're living the life,
they're the,

1533
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:04,980
they're the real rock stars because while
you're sitting there like, you know,

1534
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:06,810
eating salads and having to work out,

1535
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:10,380
they're just like doing whatever they
want and living the life. Oh my God.

1536
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:14,090
That was a, wow. That was a
while ago when you did that bad.

1537
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:18,060
But I used to love that show after
awhile I was like, all right, I get it.

1538
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:21,390
I get it. I'm over it. But no,
I really, I really liked it,

1539
01:31:21,391 --> 01:31:23,010
but people will have a serious problem.

1540
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:25,200
The woman left the show
cause she was sick.

1541
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:30,840
She was sick of them sweating all over
him. She made her money. She's back.

1542
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,860
I think that last season she's been back.
She left for a little, everybody's back.

1543
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:39,350
This business is shrinking by the day.
There was a homeless on there.

1544
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:43,470
All the, all the movie stars
are doing TV shows now.

1545
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:48,150
I know I want to watch that Halle Berry
TV show that I need to want the pilot.

1546
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:53,151
Just emotional people are grabbing every
dime they can get before my business

1547
01:31:55,411 --> 01:31:57,180
turns into what the music industry did.

1548
01:31:57,181 --> 01:31:59,920
You realize how fucking lucky
I am that I can, I actually

1549
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:04,960
have a live show that I can go
on the road. How lucky I am.

1550
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:06,460
Thanks fucking Christ.

1551
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:10,670
I think like live shows are going to be
something of the past because it's like

1552
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,330
they've been going on forever.

1553
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:15,900
No, no, no. I think people will always
want to do that. I mean maybe they'll uh,

1554
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,180
you know,
be funny is if

1555
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,200
is if somehow like what
do they call those things?

1556
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:25,200
They did that creepy thing
with Tupac and Michael Jackson.

1557
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:29,520
Oh, the Hologram shit that they're doing
like at Coachella and like award shows

1558
01:32:29,521 --> 01:32:30,121
where like,
yeah,

1559
01:32:30,121 --> 01:32:33,570
all of a sudden two POCs shows up
and does like his entire discography.

1560
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:38,440
Spencer people tripping their
balls off. I know, right? I know.

1561
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:42,060
And people, you could hear people when you
see footage on youtube, you'll be like,

1562
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,030
and then they're like,
oh wait, it's a hawk.

1563
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,190
Well I would never say
that that wouldn't happen,

1564
01:32:52,191 --> 01:32:57,191
but I would think at some point you're
going to want to leave the house.

1565
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,550
You're going to want to have to
leave the fucking house. But I,

1566
01:33:01,551 --> 01:33:05,300
I gotta be honest with you,
like live shows,

1567
01:33:05,301 --> 01:33:09,830
if people look live shows would stop. I
will tell you this. So I love that movie.

1568
01:33:09,831 --> 01:33:14,030
I did walk her shame. How at this
it's simultaneously released on

1569
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,410
yeah,
I fucking like,

1570
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:22,330
I would see more movies if I could just
sit on my ass here and pop in God's

1571
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:24,620
Zillow or some shit like that.
I definitely would.

1572
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:28,880
And Godzilla is something that I didn't
go see. But if I was sitting at home,

1573
01:33:28,881 --> 01:33:31,560
I was fucking watched that shit.
We still need to go see him.

1574
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:35,660
Maleficent is it still in
the movie theater? I want to
see that movie. Yeah, I did.

1575
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:36,493
And now I don't.

1576
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:40,010
I was glad cause they stopped showing
commercials and I stopped giving a shit.

1577
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:43,060
Like I was into it. They got me,
they had me rest and all that.

1578
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:45,890
I go see that Alison Wonderland
looking evil. Which shit,

1579
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,520
I'll go see that snow white and the
seven dwarfs.

1580
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,530
All right. It's about the evil
queen, but yeah, yeah, exactly.

1581
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:58,010
Oh it's hurts perspective. When
we had Juliana is the, uh, she's,

1582
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:01,100
she's the queen and we had
a wrong the whole time.

1583
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,390
Well we get to understand what happened
to her and the whole bit and why she's

1584
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:10,340
that way. And can I say something
about that evil witch she childhood.

1585
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:13,670
Tell me about it. Cause her
childhood was a long time ago. Okay.

1586
01:34:13,671 --> 01:34:16,130
At some point it happens in your thirties.

1587
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,420
You have to stop taking your childhood on,

1588
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:21,740
on people and you've got a fucking man up.
Okay.

1589
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,610
So that's what I would
say to that, which, okay,

1590
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:26,210
can we please go see this movie
so we can talk about it then?

1591
01:34:26,211 --> 01:34:30,620
Is she standing there stirring
her fucking steal fucking pot.

1592
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:33,890
Whatever the hell she's doing with bat
heads in it. Coldron all right. Listen,

1593
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:38,150

and on. We gotta, we gotta wrap it up.

1594
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,800
We've got to wrap it up.

1602
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,230
