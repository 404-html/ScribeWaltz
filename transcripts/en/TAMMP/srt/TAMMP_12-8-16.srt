1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Dunes, Amazon, Amazon, and
then, um, they're going to do
something with a Promo Code.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,900
If you put promo called Baron, you got
it for five bucks on my website. Do I,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,840
do I have that? You want me to
just say what is that thing?

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,070
The whole fucking thing. Just a
little bit. Okay. Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,710
All right, we're ready
to go. Alright. Hey,

6
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:25,710
what's going on? It's bill bird is
time for the Thursday afternoon.

7
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:30,510
Just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast. Dan, just checking in on. Yeah,

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,390
just checking in on. You probably
think of what Jesus, Bill,

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,070
you went a little fast on that one.

10
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,920
You usually fucking stretch it
out a little bit longer. What,

11
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:42,570
do you have a special guest in the
studio or something? Why? Yes, yes I do.

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:44,580
I have,
uh,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,630
the Great Jim Florentine
in studio here who has a,

14
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,350
a new stand up special coming out that
will be available on iTunes and Amazon

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:56,550
called a simple man, ladies
and gentlemen, New Jersey Zone,

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,620
Jim Florentine and filmed the New Jersey
of course, and filmed in New Jersey.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,810
So how does the, the, the,
uh, the royalty of New Jersey,

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,370
it's got to go Bruce Springsteen,
Jon Bon Jovi, Jim Florentine,

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,820
maybe Artie Lange, no,
rich boss, rich foss.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,810
How did I forget rich? The Duke of fucking
Trenton, whatever the hell he lives.

21
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,440
South Plainfield I heard is that he had
put out a CD I heard was fucking great.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,990
Yeah. And he's the guys
pumping them out like a maniac.

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,810
I think that's a great thing.
And uh,

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,420
I love that you put it on Amazon and I
think the more specialists in more areas

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,530
so nobody gets too much power, if you
know what I mean. There absolutely.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,920
That's got a good deal somewhere and he's
like, fuck you, you're not owning it,

27
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,910
you know,
and all that stuff.

28
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:42,930
So I liked the new model that's coming
out and basically to own your stuff,

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,510
you don't, that's what I'm hearing
through the music industry.

30
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,650
Like if you own Spotify and all
those other streaming sites,

31
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,210
basically enough to pay some big royalties
coming soon in like two, three years,

32
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,090
just like satellite radio
before they weren't paying shit.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,980
They putting all the comedy
bits won't get a dime.

34
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,810
Then all of a sudden when they
merged, the governments are, well,

35
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:03,000
you have to start paying royalties.

36
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,990
They passed along to the consumer and
now you get nice checks from sound

37
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:09,080
exchange through because of the
satellite radio, Internet, radio,

38
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,560
and now the streaming sites to Spotify is,

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,220
all of those are gonna have to
start paying it about two years.

40
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,760
So if you own your shit fucking time,
I know. So if you own your master,

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,400
if you own the master and then you
also do, you know, you're a performer,

42
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:25,230
you get double checks. I swear
I saw a thing one time, uh,
there was, what was that,

43
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,220
that documentary and that
heavy metal band that just,

44
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,100
they came to la like the week
before Nirvana's album came out. Uh,

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,680
nevermind that just, you know, as, as,
as the, the, the, the, the legend goes,

46
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,980
that was the album that destroyed the
whole thing rather than 50,000 bands.

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,910
I'll sing the same fucking
song. Um, so that failed.

48
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,080
And then they moved back to like Indiana
or wherever the fuck they were from.

49
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,780
And hair metal still
survived another three years.

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,520
Then they tried to get into
grunge and all this shit.

51
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,740
And then they were just old
and they never really made it.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,130
And they made this documentary in
at one point towards the end, the,

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,760
the biggest lesson in all of it. One of
the, the, um, the members said, he goes,

54
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,660
what I've learned,
he goes,

55
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:09,661
your better to have 100% ownership
and just sell 20,000 copies,

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,160
then you are to have no ownership
and sell like 20 million copies,

57
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,520
you'll actually make more money if
you own it. That's how bad they are.

58
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,170
They fucking rip you off. They just, they,
they rip, you know, they've, you know,

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,710
all of that shit all the way back to
the blues guys and all that, you know,

60
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,690
every fucking artists, they just, they,
uh, that's what, that's what happens. So,

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,580
and then also, yeah. And also like
those eighties videos with the,

62
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,340
you know the go feed with the hot
chick in it and they were, you know,

63
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,420
dance around on stage and doing whatever
those videos will like a half million

64
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,160
to $1 million to budgets on those.

65
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:45,160
So that came right off the top
of any money they sold. Oh yeah.

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,640
The record company put that money up.
So just to make a go.

67
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,880
And it was the same video as the guys
performing onstage and it was a hot check

68
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,040
and he starts out in black and white,
black.

69
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,640
And so when the rest of the band kicks
in and all of a sudden it was in color,

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,500
it was the ballot, they look tired.
You know it was Bon Jovi on the boss.

71
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,830
He looked tired cause he was looking at
the window and drive and know who is the

72
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,820
first w Bon Jovi cause you
do also do that metal show.

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
So that was [inaudible] 86
when that album came out,

74
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,330
a video was maybe 87
somewhere around there.

75
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:21,331
I think New Jersey was his big
record came out like 84 85 bond at.

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,690
That's slippery when wet. How old
was slippery when wet was probably,

77
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,920
I think 84 now. That was like 85 86
okay. Yeah, somewhere around there.

78
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,420
And then New Jersey came out after it up.

79
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,410
Slippery when wet as you give love a
bad name. Yeah. Wanted dead or alive.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,940
All of that shit. They start the,
I'm tired on the tour bus journey.

81
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,250
Did member journey with uh,

82
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,910
Steve Perry had that bad mustache
and faithfully oh yeah. Yeah.

83
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,860
Remember he had the mustache?
Yeah. That, so that was,

84
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:51,370
that started the original tire. I'm
tired. I'm on tour and I'm exhausted.

85
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,450
What about when he was at
that San Francisco giant game?

86
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,610
They started playing the journey song
and all he had to do was smile and wave

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,800
and then he acted like somebody,

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,120
he acted like someone who is just a fan
of the band rather than the guy singing

89
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:08,140
it. And he just, he just went over
the fucking top with it. And it was,

90
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,330
I just felt like it was a moment that,

91
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,840
I don't know if he's not
selling tickets or whatever.

92
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,610
It's like he should just played that cool.

93
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,240
And he tried to be too regular and then
everybody just eviscerated him on the

94
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,190
fucking Internet. Did you
ever see that? Yeah. Oh yeah.

95
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,440
Cause I've seen him at giant.
I'm a big giant fan,

96
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,890
so I'll go out there and
I've seen him a game.

97
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:25,180
So he goes to like every game when his
kids, he can't hit those notes anymore,

98
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,050
so he knows I'm just laying low. Let the
Asian guy take over and do it. You know,

99
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,840
he's just collecting the
royalties off of go. Yeah.

100
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,520
So he doesn't need to do any of that
stuff. He doesn't care. Yeah, he, he's,

101
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:37,520
he could have been back in journey 10
years ago, but he's just like, I come on,

102
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:40,330
I'm not going to barass myself.
That's a smart move.

103
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,330
So I'll just do it once at a baseball
game. Yeah. Like, yeah, like Robert Plant,

104
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,190
Robert Plant knows he
ain't, ain't, no he hasn't.

105
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,460
He knows he's not going to hit those
notes. You don't have to tune down to la.

106
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,850
He sounded great in 2007
I know he sounded amazing.

107
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,870
You know what they got offered $14 million
for two two hour shows a thing in the

108
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,790
desert. What was the thing? If you

109
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,510
like a couple months ago,

110
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,250
you've got 14 million for two two
hour shows and Robert Plant started to

111
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,580
everybody else's app when it's like
of course, and he said no. Yeah,

112
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,430
I think he bought a bunch of
apartment buildings is what he did.

113
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,890
So he's making all this fucking
money. That's what I heard. Yeah.

114
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,410
I heard he's a really good businessman,
but why can't he just come out and go,

115
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:15,800
look,

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,880
this isn't going to be like 1976 I'm not
going to be able to hit all the notes,

117
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,710
but I'm going to go hang on.
My friends were going to jam,

118
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,180
have a good time and don't expect
much Elijah if you've thrown,

119
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,450
I have to be honest with you.

120
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:31,010
I think he's protecting the legacy
of the band by not doing it.

121
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,370
I mean, I think they did
that last one. I don't think.

122
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,050
I don't think they could do it
better than they did it in oh seven.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,020
And he's always said, if you,
if you're just, you know,

124
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,950
if this is just a money grab Ben
there, done that. What did he say?

125
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,250
I'm just an old hippie,
blah blah blah.

126
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,710
Like he just doesn't see the reason to
do it. Now what I would do if I was,

127
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,430
the rest of them I'd get, I'd
get, uh, Jason Bonham on drums,

128
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:56,600
John Paul Jones and Jimmy page and I would
do a journey did and who gives a fuck

129
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,910
while they tried to do that after
too, you know, first of all,

130
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,860
Jay page and plant don't get along at all.

131
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,540
Like when they were rehearsing for that
2007 show, which Jason, I'm told to show,

132
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,620
told the story on that
metal show when it was on,

133
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,380
they were at each other's throats,
page and plant.

134
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,100
They just don't like each other. I
think it's more a plant, you know.

135
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,900
So after that they were hoping they were
going to do a reunion and plants said

136
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,870
once again, nope, I'm not doing what it.
So they actually audition Steven Tyler,

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,230
Sammy Hagar.
That's right.

138
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,510
And Myles Kennedy had the Gig Miles's
from all to bridge and slash or solos

139
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,610
thing, and he had the Gig and
they were ready to deal with it.

140
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,730
And then they just said, you know what? We
can't, we, let's just put it to the side.

141
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,570
We can't do that. We're not going to
sell us as led. Zepplin oh my God.

142
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,030
So it was called, but Myles Kennedy out of
nowhere, it got that Gig. But it did, uh,

143
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,850
Steven Tyler,
my hearing.

144
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,300
Then in my headphones,
I'll see la,

145
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,890
should we be concerned about the alarm?
Is it a fire?

146
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,360
I'll run out there. And how do
you know what it is? Oh, oh,

147
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,543
oh.

148
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,820
One of these times it's going to be
an actual, it's like when you were in,

149
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,950
when you're in a club and you hit,

150
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,660
hit it on a hot chick and you hear the
alarm go. He's like, I don't give a shit.

151
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:07,110
I ain't leaving by Labor.
Does nine guys read it?

152
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,670
Everybody to take my spot.

153
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:11,760
So I don't know if there's a fire up
one of those nine just pulled it to

154
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,770
absolutely to get me away from her.

155
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,780
So I understand plants thing where he
doesn't want to do it. He's like I'm not,

156
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,850
I don't want to do it from the guys
probably worth 300 million so he doesn't

157
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:27,870
need to do at this point. You just wish
it was a fan? Maybe just a few shows.

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,390
Yeah, cause you know
what I like when, when,

159
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,190
when Jason played in 2007 I thought he
was finally himself where he was like,

160
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:38,650
he didn't feel like he had to
do what his dad did, but he, he,

161
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,220
he was thrown in the teeth
through in so much shit.

162
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,600
A lot of it was some stuff that
his dad did live, but like he,

163
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,820
his personality was on it. I thought
he really fucking owned it on that one.

164
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:51,540
So I was kind of psyched to see them
go around. It's probably better.

165
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,890
It's probably better that they don't do
it because you know it didn't work well.

166
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,490
I remember that live aid when they
had the two fucking drummers and shit.

167
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:00,270
And that was only five
years after they had played.

168
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,600
But I heard Paige was so fucking upset
that he didn't play guitar for a while

169
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,280
after bond died. Like to the
point he had to tried to record,

170
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:10,780
remember how to fucking play. Um, that's
right. Cause then the story was um,

171
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,190
Paul Rogers came over one day
and was just hanging like three,

172
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,410
four years later and said, hey
dude, you can pick up their guitar.

173
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,070
Let's see if we can write some songs. And
they started the firm after that. Yeah.

174
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:21,240
So why doesn't he just fucking,

175
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,630
why don't you just come up with a new
name and just still do Zeplin shit plays

176
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,381
some firms stuff.

177
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,280
That fucking Jimmy page product project
with John Paul Jones and fucking,

178
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,380
I know what Jason, well member when
memoir now page was so pissed off at uh,

179
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,020
at Robert Plant that had got David
Coverdale and did the Coverdell page.

180
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,010
They did one album cause governor Chris
Robinson, they went out with him. Yeah.

181
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,860
Robert Plant hated David Coverdale
cause he thought he was a led Zeppelin,

182
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,120
you know, just so Robert Plant clone,
he looked like him. Sounded like, um,

183
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,080
and then pages.

184
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,100
So I'm going to get your arch enemy
and we're going to start her own band.

185
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,360
What do you think of that?
Well yeah, I think that'll
do a lot of damage, but yeah,

186
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,400
it did. It definitely didn't
help the guy 10 years younger.

187
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,930
They can still hit the fucking notes.

188
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,460
Well van Halen pulled it off cause
remember Sammy and Dave did that toward a

189
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,870
Sammy Hagar,
David Lee Roth tore together.

190
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,810
They hated each other cause of Van
Halen weren't talking to either.

191
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,150
And then right after that tour it,
I got back with Sammy.

192
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,880
So I guess Fannie Allen's like, what
are they? They're selling out arenas.

193
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,601
We should be doing this.

194
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:16,080
And they put Sammy back in the van
Sammie's back in the van now? No, no,

195
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,100
this is a while ago.

196
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:20,370
But Sammy and Dave cause to van Halen
brothers would just blowing them off.

197
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:20,761
They go,
okay,

198
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,970
let's the two old singers of Van
Halen and let's do a tour together.

199
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,770
And they do a tour and
they hated each other,

200
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,250
that whole tour because Sammy
and Dave hated each other.

201
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,170
They hated each other since day one,

202
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,810
but they just did it for the tour and
they were supposed to like rotate headline

203
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,500
in every night and Sam was trying to blow
them off the stage and, and Dave was,

204
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,970
and it was all the egos and all this shit.

205
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,840
So I would think Sammy would win
though. Did he win? Probably,

206
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,180
but Dave was still a voice of Van Halen.
I'd rather hear you know, and love again.

207
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:50,040
And you know,
Main Street then is this love?

208
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,790
Yeah. I always thought Sammy
Hagar, you, when you look at his,

209
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,980
I was just talking about
this in my last podcast. Um,

210
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,010
this is such like fucking white
guys in their forties talking. Um,

211
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,220
I always thought he shouldn't
had fucking joined the band.

212
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,480
There was no upside where it was like,
you're not going to follow Dave.

213
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,580
You're not going to be like, uh, you
just, it's just one of those things like,

214
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:17,880
why would you, why would you go
there? It was like Steve Young going,

215
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,670
I have to fucking Joe Montana,
no matter what the fuck he did,

216
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,000
he was always going to be not Joe Montana.
And even though he y one,

217
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,950
one a get the monkey
off my back or whatever,

218
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,550
I thought he should have just stayed
with his own fucking band. Man.

219
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,390
That guy was incredible
for live and all that.

220
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,110
I liked the direction of his solo
shit before that is this love.

221
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,000
And they're the keyboards and they were
all walking around in the fucking flesh

222
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,880
colored, uh, flashdance suits,
whatever the hell they were wearing.

223
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,910
Yeah. Um, you know, he um, he had
a great solo career before joining.

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,380
I know we really didn't have to,

225
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,200
I don't think he really thought
it was going to take off.

226
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:52,120
I don't know what I just said.
Let's start, start jamming.

227
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,100
And then by van actually got bigger

228
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,030
at that point they sold more records,
which Sammy, but that was the MTV days,

229
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,550
more like Dave was like the last of the,
you know,

230
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,980
Panama and jump and stuff like that.
But then when van Halen,

231
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,190
like 86 is when they put their first one,
I would,

232
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,740
would a Sammy there had all the videos
and stuff like that so that I sold a lot

233
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,110
more records. And Dave, all right, let's,

234
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,150
let's try to bring this
back into like this century.

235
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,250
I want to do something fucking hilarious.
It hit me the other night.

236
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,970
So a buddy of mine passed away, right?
We're at that age, people fucking die.

237
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,290
And uh, so we, we did a,
uh, a benefit for them.

238
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,750
So I got all these
fucking comics together.

239
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,090
There was a guy I did stand
up with from 90 to 99.

240
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,470
This Guy Pete come and just a great guy.

241
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:35,500
And then he became a writer and did all
these wonderful things and unfortunately

242
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,910
had a heart attack and died.

243
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,190
So I got all of his buddies from
fucking back in the day, you know,

244
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,320
like Austin, Boston, guys like, you know,

245
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:47,140
some guys who are like not
doing standup really anymore.

246
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,670
And we all fucking came out was hilarious.

247
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:51,730
We're all standing around fucking
dad jeans and bad hairlines and shit.

248
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,530
And I'm looking around going like,
wow man,

249
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:56,620
we have fucking old before the
show us just like Jesus Christ.

250
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:57,940
This crowd looks kind of young.

251
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,810
I hope this is going to go out right
in the fucking, it went perfect.

252
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,930
Perfect night. Uh, except
for one fucking dude,

253
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,570
but he was on some medication
and he was drinking bud lights.

254
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,240
He repeated a couple of jokes. It
was fucking hilarious. He, he had,

255
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:15,010
he had one guy at a tough set.
So I was on stage and um, I've,

256
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,520
I was making fun of fat
actresses complaining and Shit.

257
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,400
And then I was just going to be,
look at me, I'm fucking among bald,

258
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,151
redheaded male.

259
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:25,600
You don't think there's a glass ceiling
on the parts I can get out here and shit

260
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,610
like that. Right. So at the end of my set,

261
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,190
I'm doing the meet and greet
and this guy came up to me,

262
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,250
didn't even want to like
picture or anything.

263
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,760
He had one of those before and after
fucking hair club for men cards,

264
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,110
I guess he did it. He goes, dude, he goes,

265
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,300
I could get you your
hair back if you want it.

266
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,850
And it was the club that the guy was
like bald like me and then had like the

267
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,450
fucking, oh, really? I was just like, I
said to too. I'm like, no man, I'm good.

268
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,290
And he kept fucking showed it to me. I,
if I was just like, dude, I like, I go,

269
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,780
I liked the way I look. I don't
need that wavy shit. Right.

270
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,050
And he just fucking put his head down.
He walked out like a scolded child.

271
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,890
I felt like a fucking asshole. They, I
don't need that fucking well, what you,

272
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,560
at some point you're like, yeah, thanks
man, but I'm good. You know, like you,

273
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,580
you give them that, but then when
they keep pounding away, well,

274
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:09,100
it's one of those six dude, I had
hair at one point in time. I saw it.

275
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:12,220
It got me okay. I think I always said
if I was going to be the next Brad Pitt,

276
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,480
it would've happened before.
Like I had to wait till you were 48 Oh,

277
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,990
if you only had fucking hair. It's like,
no dude, it's, it's, it's a wrap. Yeah.

278
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,300
And then you can't put it on
now. Everybody knows. You know,

279
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:25,160
you had to do it in that transition stage
where you were losing a little, but,

280
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:28,180
and I was like, did he do something with
his hair? You can't do this. So many guys,

281
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,960
there was so many guys hanging off the
fucking ledge and all of a sudden pulled

282
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:34,810
themselves back up like this. So many
fucking guys. I just, I never, uh,

283
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,100
I just didn't give a shit like this,
this certain point of like,

284
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,860
you just gotta you know, just, you
just play the hand you're dealt,

285
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:45,010
you're going to look way fucking better.
Although some people that I know,

286
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,680
they got some really good ones, but, um,

287
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,100
I just don't, I don't
know. I, I don't get, dude,

288
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,670
I wouldn't even do that laser eye
surgery. Yeah, I won't do that either.

289
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,480
I'm waiting til like 100%.
You're fine. Yeah, exactly.

290
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,520
There's a couple cases of guys foggy and
he can't see, and, and then they say,

291
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,760
if you're over fucking 45, it only lasts
for this amount of years. And then what?

292
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,100
You're going to do it again?
Fuck that.

293
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,860
I know when they're operating
on your eyes. Yeah. Fuck it.

294
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,910
Fucking sitting there looking at it as
it doing it that that's too much. So,

295
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,220
but you did the right thing with
that guy, you said, Nah, I'm good.

296
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,190
And then he kept pounding away.
Some guy wanted it laughed.

297
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,350
I thought it was right. It was fucking
hilarious. And then when you say, dude,

298
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
Walked away. I was just like, dude,

299
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,900
I don't need that wavy shit because it's
always the guy with the wavy fucking

300
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,870
hair. It's never anybody with like
looking like those guys and that was it.

301
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,470
Always this, they never have that Beatles
hair cut. It's always the fucking wavy.

302
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,350
It was just like, yeah dude, I'm
good. And then just kind of put his,

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,180
that had happened to me.

304
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,060
Some guy wanted me to do it on
Ohio thing like this Ohio state.

305
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:47,640
I'm not a big college football fan
when I do all age. Ah, yeah, yeah.

306
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,810
I was doing a Gig and he's like, dude,
my friend's going to snapchat this.

307
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,500
Can you do this with me? I go, no. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go, first of all,

308
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,110
you're on fucking snapchat and you're,
you're like 40 years old.

309
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,720
You shouldn't be on snapchat. And
second like, I'm not doing that.

310
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:02,270
That's fucking corny. He's like, come on
man. I go, no, I'm not. I'm not doing it.

311
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,800
I'll take a picture with you.
I'll do whatever,

312
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,090
but I'm not the one all h I all
know it gets weird with that shit.

313
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:09,650
Like there was someone
in the line last night,

314
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,000
like I had like eight people back and
he's facetimeing with his friend and he's

315
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:16,340
got his friend's head pointing at me.
I'm like,

316
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:20,780
I'm looking at this person from like 30
yards away on the phone looking at me

317
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,490
and I just kept yelling to the guy,
just go and sorry,

318
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,260
I'm not going to talk to
that guy fucking phone on.

319
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,540
And he wasn't listening to it.
I was like,

320
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,930
can you tell that psycho back there
with his friend on the phone? I am not.

321
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,250
I'm not. It's bad enough when somebody
just hands you a fucking phone. Hey,

322
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,190
can you say hello to my fainted fucking,
you know what I started doing? I just,

323
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,180
I just did. I just channeled Patrice.
I would just start hanging up on them.

324
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,100
I just go right. Just hang it up. I had
a relative of mine will kept doing it go.

325
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,980
He used to, I used to call
it, he's calling, you know,

326
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,040
it's one of these guys I've talked to
like once or twice a year. Hey Bill,

327
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,420
how you doing? Blah Blah.
Hey, you know what I mean?

328
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:54,690
Are you home telling you
remember someone selling?

329
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,390
He would just hand the phone to them
and the person on the other end,

330
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,240
it didn't want to talk to me either.
Right.

331
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,750
And it was just the worst fucking
thing. So I would go, I don't do that.

332
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,960
Don't do it without any, would hand it to
me and the, hey. And then I just finally,

333
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:09,080
I just started fucking hanging up
and it just stopped it and he would,

334
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,790
he got so fucking mad at
me. It was just like, dude,

335
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm asking you not to fucking do
this and you're still doing it.

336
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,770
You're leaving me no choice
here. And then he tried it. Oh,

337
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,570
what do you think you too. You too
good for that. Yeah, you are too.

338
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,730
Everybody's too good for them.

339
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,020
I want to talk to a complete
fucking stranger who doesn't
want to talk to you on

340
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:31,220
a phone. People used to do it to me like,
hey, say hello, my friend. I'm like, Hey,

341
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:34,610
how you doing? This isn't Jim Florence
and I'm a yeah, it is. He goes,

342
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:37,580
what are you doing in St Louis? Like
I'm doing a Gig. There's no way.

343
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:39,470
There's no way you were saying.
I'm like, all right. I go,

344
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:41,570
I'm not going to argue with you here.
Take the phone to phone back.

345
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,790
I'm not arguing with and go to my website.

346
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm at the fucking funny ball and
whatever gives a shit. No, it never, uh,

347
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,070
it never fucking ends well, but
um, anyways, how's your, uh,

348
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,270
I know your team.

349
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:58,320
Don't tell me the dolphins had just went
to the Dolphin Raven game last week in

350
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:01,590
Baltimore. They got their ass kicked
to have ravens are always tough, man.

351
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,760
They did. The dolphins never played
good against physical teams. Never.

352
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,490
They just didn't, not a physical team,
you know, and it can push it around.

353
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,760
They got that in Dhamaka soother.
Yeah,

354
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,820
he's good because he gets
double and triple team. Then
other guys can get sacks,

355
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,610
but I just, they're just not a good
physical team. They just, uh, you know,

356
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,880
Tana Hill, they had some guys out
in the offensive line, disliked.

357
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,660
They're seven and five, so
I can't complain. I didn't
think that back. Good. Yeah.

358
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,700
This new coach,
I think he's pretty good.

359
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,480
What are the bills that bills are six
and six? Love it. They're out there.

360
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,950
They cannot make the playoffs.
You got to go lease tenant six,

361
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:38,110
11 and five and just to get a
wildcard this year. So there are,

362
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:40,920
I want to again go back to
being a defensive coordinator.

363
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,140
He get a Superbowl ring.
No, I know. He's just,

364
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,660
he's got too much of an ego and he's
got his brother there. What it is,

365
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
as well as making fun.
You know, in New Orleans,

366
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,580
they didn't let me do what I wanted to
do. Really. You had the worst defense,

367
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:51,301
you know,

368
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:55,170
in the history of the NFL for two years
in a row and you're trashing him on the

369
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:59,500
way out. That's a good thing to do.
Yeah. He's only made, he's, yeah,

370
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,240
he's been a coach for like 12 years.
Rob Ryan hit one of his teams,

371
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,340
made the playoffs once
and they got knocked out.

372
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,590
The first game was New Orleans
against Seattle a couple of years ago.

373
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:11,370
Other than that, never even
made a playoff. Did Rob
has been a head coach? No,

374
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:14,430
he's never but a defensive coordinator.
Cowboys. He's with the Raiders.

375
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,890
He's been all over the
place. Yeah. And I think,

376
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,140
I think rex does most of
the heavy lifting when it,

377
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,150
cause he always has
good defenses and then,

378
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,070
but now we actually has
a decent quarterback.

379
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,380
He just doesn't have anybody to
fucking throw to and tie Rod Taylor,

380
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:29,280
you cannot sack that guy.
It's unbelievable. He's
fucking amazing. I know.

381
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,150
Constantly getting out of
the way. Um, but you know,

382
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,980
and then the dolphins gift that they gave
us a Mario Williams, Mario Williams, uh,

383
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,450
they got released and he's terrible.
I don't know what happened then I'd do it.

384
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,940
He's on Miami now.
He's got like two tackles the whole year.

385
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,230
So buffalo new to get rid of him.
Uh, but yeah, Buffalo's out again.

386
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,210
It'll be 17 years,
no playoffs.

387
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,660
But they're bad or they're
better than than they were.

388
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,240
And Rex goes in and just sells,
as you know, does is all bullshit,

389
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,680
you know what I mean? Like I'm
not here to lose. Really? Wow.

390
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,660
I didn't go there to kisses.
Kisses rings. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

391
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:04,980
I'm here to make the playoffs. Oh,
that's good. Good, good to know.

392
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,160
You know I love this week was Brian
Cashman set after the Red Sox,

393
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:11,670
I guess sign some deals with
something he said. He just went, wow.

394
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:16,671
He goes to like the Golden State warriors
and I fucking died laughing like,

395
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,680
dude, they'll fucking
talk about the, well,

396
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:23,580
how would that expression to pot calling
the kettle black? You fucking assholes.

397
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:27,430
You invented that shit. How the fuck
you going to sit there and say it?

398
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
Like he should have been like,
wow,

399
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,360
those guys are ripping us off just
cause the last few years. Well,

400
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,170
it's basically since George
Steinbrenner died. Yeah.

401
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,910
The Sun's way more conservative and is
trying to do it with the farm system,

402
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,850
which I respect and I love. But Brian
Cashman was part of that of course,

403
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,710
a fees like a fucking
free agency war criminal.

404
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,220
And now he's fucking wagging his finger
at the fucking red sox for doing what

405
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:54,490
the, that what they did.
Now having said that, I,

406
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,060
it's the thing that turned me off about
baseball and I felt the red sox in oh

407
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,790
seven became the Yankees, you know,
when they signed all those people.

408
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,280
So it's been difficult for me to
get back into it. But I guess,

409
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,140
but also you gotta realize
yesterday the Yang,

410
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,120
the Yankees sign Chatman to close
or four years, 86 million for,

411
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,820
for a closer. And w w where did he play
again? Remember he was with the, um,

412
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,220
the reds.
He was with the Yankees last year.

413
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:21,460
They traded him at the trading deadline
that the cubs won the world series where

414
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,250
he throws 105 miles an hour.
He went to the cubs.

415
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,020
He was a free age and Yankees just
resigned. I'm going back four years,

416
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,630
86 million. He was there, but he was
one of the guys though who? Chapman.

417
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,810
He Chapman was originally with the reds.

418
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,370
He got in some trouble off the field and
the Yankees got 'em for half a season

419
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:41,110
trade.
And I'm that a cubs and reds.

420
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,030
What kind of trouble does
somebody get into it?

421
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,140
You fucking trade away 105
mile an hour pitcher. I know.

422
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,680
He just didn't die. He didn't
exude the uh, the what,

423
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,390
what we like to give to our fell. What did
they say? The, the persona of our team.

424
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,180
We have a code.
We have a code here in Cincinnati.

425
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:01,030
Why don't you throw it out the fucking
window? The guy still 105 miles an hour.

426
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,100
Exactly. Let him do what he
wants. He's going to grab
some titties. A fucking nuts.

427
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,300
Hooters. You know, it's
funny, as I was saying that,

428
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,380
I was like [inaudible] now
that going to be a thing,

429
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:15,670
you know the fucking Internet now
was he advocating social south?

430
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,180
You know that happens now if you little
fuck oh yeah, absolutely. You have this,

431
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,230
this like I didn't look into special.

432
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:24,760
I film like a little over a year
ago or year and a half actually.

433
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,560
It's been and this stuff on there.

434
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,020
I led a look back cause I was trying
to trying to do a trail and I'm like,

435
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:32,140
Holy Shit. I said that. I
go, it's probably what I
said a year and a half ago.

436
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,770
It was like, I can't believe he said that.
Right. And how quickly it could wait.

437
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,700
Where did you film it? In a George Street
playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

438
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:42,640
It's right down the street from the
stress factory. He was going to say, yeah,

439
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,560
it's like a 600 theat the seat theater.

440
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,000
It was Vinnie upset Navine health
center of any help promote it.

441
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,670
I had to get them at work. A man
and when his beak. Yeah, absolutely.

442
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,930
Because if any runs that town,

443
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,940
that fucking guy and he
was going to do a set,

444
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,310
he was going to open the show and
do 10 minutes to warm up the crowd.

445
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,570
Of course he was late and he didn't.
Uh, so yeah, I'm sorry. Goals,

446
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,550
that would have been like video.
I'm trying to have a good special here.

447
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,390
I know I had a backup just in case,
so, but yeah, so I cut Vinnie and on a,

448
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,190
basically they sold tickets to the stress
factory, so, oh, that's cool. Yeah.

449
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,960
So you kept everything.
Yeah. We're friends. We've,

450
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,290
we started comedy back together years ago.
What year did you guys start?

451
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,930
I started in 91. I started in [inaudible]
92. So he started in 91, too. Ah,

452
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,760
yeah. Yeah. 91. And he was probably
already married with like 19 kids. Yeah,

453
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,630
he had already, he was married
with three kids. He owned a Flores.

454
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:34,000
He was a fucking maniac.

455
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,270
I was booking like this open mic
thing on a Monday night, a strip club.

456
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,590
I remember when I,
when I met him in the mid nineties,

457
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,790
he was such an angry man. He was,
you could feel it off of him. It was,

458
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,650
he was going through that, that first, uh,

459
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,720
first go around and uh, then the,
he's just become the exact opposite.

460
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,860
Now he's like, fucking Santa Claus. It,
he used to just be like in the 90s, dude.

461
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,250
And, and I, I was an angry,
fucked up dude. So I,

462
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,190
every once in a while I would meet someone
who matched my anger or surpassed it.

463
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:07,330
And I was always just like, I, and I'm not
gonna fuck with that guy. Like I have, I,

464
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,640
we have a running joke mean oop,
uh,

465
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:14,480
from opie and Anthony and a whatever the
fuck they calling it now. Um, he, uh,

466
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,860
we recognize both of us were like this
fucking level of anger and just how

467
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,910
everybody got thrown under the bus on
that show. And eventually it was arguing.

468
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:25,680
I had a big army with Patrice on that
show. And, uh, I just, we both had,

469
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,550
I think he was the one who brought it up.
He's like, to the first time I met you,

470
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,190
I sense this fucking anger. And he was
like, I'm going to stay away from that.

471
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:33,610
I was like, I do not see what
the fuck I was. Because if you,

472
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,610
if you listen to the a is show,
you'll never find a clip of us.

473
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,420
Will it be everybody trashed and
everybody, we never lob one at each other.

474
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,430
I don't know what, there was just
something about the guy, I'm like,

475
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:47,150
this guy is a skies like he,

476
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:50,920
he might be even angrier than I am. So I
just completely stayed away. No, that's a,

477
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,150
that's a good move. No,
Vinny was very angry.

478
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:57,740
I remember it as a comic because Vinny
had the comedy club like in 94 he had the

479
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,470
stress factor was, it was another
little spot. So at a hotel or whatever,

480
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,730
and my friend, this Guy Eric and manic
local comic ago, he's, he books it.

481
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,070
Go give them your card and
he goes, Hey, I'm a comedian.

482
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,710
I lived in New Jersey cause I love
to do you call it, here's my card.

483
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:11,840
And when he goes to Chicago, he goes,
yeah. And it was a nice card at,

484
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:14,540
as a headshot on it. Vinny just
ripped it up right in front of them.

485
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,340
We just walked away.
Why?

486
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,130
And then he just stopped and then he
came back and thought it was funny.

487
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,790
And then the other dude was so pissed at
them. He's like, what a fucking asshole.

488
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,380
You know, Shit like that. And that's
just the way Vinnie was just a component.

489
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:28,850
The only boss, he was just
fucking around. That's hilarious.

490
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,580
I don't know if he was or not. He
just, but yeah, he was, he was angry.

491
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,670
That's why I liked them. I
loved, you know, I love the
angry dudes. Well, you know,

492
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:38,000
when the first time I did,
uh, the stress factory,

493
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,340
I worked with a already Fletcher.
Remember him? Yeah. He's,

494
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,770
he's still a friend of mine. He
tells everybody we are. So I, uh,

495
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:50,570
he's in Florida now. Yeah,
he's in Florida. So we
worked together and you know,

496
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:51,950
of course I didn't draw anybody,

497
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:56,951
like Vinny was giving me a shot and I
made fun of the club and I was just no

498
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,820
name comic. And I think it, cause he,

499
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,880
I didn't realize he built most of it at
the time. Now it's a really nice club.

500
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:05,150
I remember when he first opened it. I
mean it was, it was, uh, it was a dump.

501
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,310
So I fucking made fun
of it. And, uh, but I,

502
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:12,740
I still killed and making fun of
the club was killing and all that.

503
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:15,140
And then I remember he called my manager
at the time just being like, yeah,

504
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,760
you know,
you didn't get the job done.

505
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,280
He didn't get the job done
and he fucking wouldn't,

506
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:23,570
he didn't work me for like
seven years after that. And uh,

507
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,970
I don't think he fucking worked me until
after opie and Anthony maybe a little

508
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:30,560
before that.
He started to work me.

509
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,740
Was that what it was in the hotel because
he used to have it in a hotel before

510
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:37,940
we moved it to the same, I helped paint
that place when he moved it over there.

511
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,040
I was there when it, when it was, he
couldn't have been over them one too. Two,

512
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,030
three fucking years.

513
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,180
He had the creepy bicycle hanging from
the fucking ceiling and that stage was

514
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,060
fucked up. It was, it was, I can't, I
can't remember, but it was, it was a dump.

515
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,240
But then what happened over the years?
Then he redid the floor,

516
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,480
he got the smoke eater and all
of a sudden it was amazing.

517
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:03,960
It went from like this fucking d
level room to now like that's a play.

518
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,690
I love that place. Yeah. That's
one of my favorite clubs.

519
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,620
Vinnie probably wishes I got to that
part sooner in that fucking story.

520
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:11,401
Cause he's primary calling.

521
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:15,030
You're fucking trash and a club on the
God damn podcast or whatever he has.

522
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,530
He is normal now.
Like he's on the committee.

523
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:21,330
He was running for council and as
town and stuff like that. Yeah, he's,

524
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:25,620
he's um, he's evolved.
Yeah. That's funny though.

525
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:30,090
This when you get to be our age,
like the one of two things happens.

526
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:31,530
Either you fucking evolve,

527
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,180
you chill out and you learn how to like
enjoy life or you are literally the

528
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:39,600
exact same fucking person
you were. When, when,

529
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,650
whenever I see people either,
either way they become dads or whatever,

530
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,040
they just changed. They've
mellowed, they're not as angry,
they're happy, blah, blah,

531
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:47,281
blah.

532
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,850
Or they literally the exact same fucking
person they were when I met him in the

533
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,410
90s. Yeah. And you don't
want to be that guy.

534
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:55,980
I know that like when I got married
and had a kid and move to the suburbs,

535
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:56,671
I'm like man,

536
00:27:56,671 --> 00:28:00,420
I'm going to be tough and that talk to
neighbors and hang out with them and talk

537
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,040
fucking, you know, school districts.

538
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,730
And then I got to go basketball camp and
sit next to them at chuck e cheese and

539
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:08,370
I love doing that.
I love how my more normal neighbors,

540
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:12,090
we walk our kids to the bus stop
every day we hang up, I go over there,

541
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,890
they come over my house.
It's fucking great.

542
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,110
I love being around other
parents and stuff like that.

543
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,790
I thought I was just
going to be a nightmare.

544
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,600
I wish I knew when I was
younger than that. That was uh,

545
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,590
you know that that actually I would
think helps your comedy because I always

546
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:27,850
thought like, you know, when we were
coming up, you just sell my God,

547
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,090
get married and have a kid. That's it.
It's all, yeah, your career's over it.

548
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,010
You're not going to make it.

549
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,920
That's what always cracks me up when
they talk about like the pressure,

550
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,930
like women have it becoming
pregnant. Like, if like,

551
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,630
how do I keep the career and
blah, blah, blah, blah, and,

552
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,800
and I understand that in the real world.
But like in show business,

553
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:47,520
I think everybody, man or woman,
if you're on the performance side,

554
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:50,190
it's just like that. I, I'm,
I'm fucking done. I like,

555
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,170
you just feel like I have to be at a
certain level of selling tickets for my

556
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:58,530
wife to still believe in me.
Because if you still like, you know,

557
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:00,060
not selling tickets,
they're going to be like,

558
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:04,890
you're doing this comedy thing on the
weekend. I need, I need a solid paycheck.

559
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,100
I need to know that there's money
coming in. Like I, you know,

560
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:09,570
how many fucking guys did you see though,

561
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,710
that that kid just fucking took him right
down to the mat? A ton, man. You know,

562
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:14,790
I always,
when I first started,

563
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:17,240
I remember Ray Romano was married
with two kids at the time.

564
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,210
Like how can he juggle both? I never knew
how he could do that. Yeah. I'm like,

565
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,730
how could it be funny and have a
family life and shit like that.

566
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,440
And I always thought,
there's no way I can have that.

567
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,230
I probably would have screwed it up in
my twenties and thirties once I got into

568
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:31,800
my forties I'm like, all right, I could
do it. Absolutely would have fucked it up.

569
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,250
I would have been a fucking
lunatic. And uh, you know,

570
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:38,140
I think there's a reason I waited
so, so, I mean, most of it was fear,

571
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,380
but a lot of it was I was a
fucking lunatic. Yeah. Same
Way. Same with, I'm like,

572
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm going to screw this up.

573
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:45,820
I'm gonna fuck some girl on the road I
shouldn't be doing. You know what I mean?

574
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:48,000
As you get older, like that's,
it doesn't even, you know,

575
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,740
it's not even part of the equation.
When you have a bad set,

576
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:53,920
you take it home with
you. Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

577
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,180
Maybe if you know me fucking
doing the dishes all the time,

578
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,290
I know if I would've just got,

579
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,680
if you would allow me to take
a nap and I had to watch a kid,

580
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:05,200
you know how to work that
night, yell out shit. So No,

581
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:07,600
when I look back to all the
fucking shit that I went through,

582
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,990
the I really did not have
to go through. And, uh,

583
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,790
that's what verse he cracks me up.
You know, Paul Versey. Yeah, yeah.

584
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,010
Like I just was like, dude,
where the fuck were you?

585
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,760
I wish there was a version of you might,
maybe there wasn't.

586
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:22,480
I just didn't pay attention. Like he
has the most fucking normal life. Like,

587
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:24,680
and then he just goes on the
road, you know, as a comedian.

588
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:28,510
Then he comes home like completely
fucking normal and like,

589
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:33,080
he's like an 80 year old man and like
a 35 year old body and like it, like I,

590
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,830
he has like comics over and they
always say that like younger comics,

591
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:38,500
like his fucking age always going
over there like, oh my wow, dude.

592
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,660
So you just like, you
know, you got a wife,

593
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:44,410
couple of kids and see she's cool with you
going out and uh, he's like, yeah, yeah,

594
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,870
that was doing standup when I met
her and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

595
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,260
So I always think of like whenever I look
at the way I always tell him, you know,

596
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:54,310
cause uh, I always go, dude,
you're fucking doing it right.
No, absolutely doing it.

597
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,110
You, you did it. He's doing it. Like
that's the way Ray Romano did. Ray Romano,

598
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,550
who got married at the regular age,

599
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,140
started a family at the regular fucking
age and all of that and uh, still hit.

600
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:06,560
And you know, it's great to, was he,

601
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,580
he got 'em he got in before Seinfeld
hit that big payday on the syndication.

602
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,590
Cause I have a theory that
after they had to pay Seinfeld,

603
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,110
that Hollywood all got
together and was like,

604
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,460
how the fuck do we owe a stand up
comedian? Half a billion dollars?

605
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,810
How does this deal work?
Never give this deal out again.

606
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,490
Well Ray Romano is still has it.
Well he's the last one cause that was it.

607
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,390
Nobody ever got the, I don't think
anybody's gotten it created by,

608
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,150
it was a combination of the creative by
a performer, a producer and a writer.

609
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,230
Checky pull those four fucking
checks off the same goddamn show.

610
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,180
And then there wasn't the,

611
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:52,990
the influence of the Internet and video
games and all this shit. You know,

612
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:55,810
I've been making fun of that stupid,
those fucking virtual reality.

613
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:56,531
It's that thing.

614
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:01,180
You put the phone up to the glasses and
the level with which people are freaking

615
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:04,030
out. Like, Oh, I go, oh, like,

616
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,730
like you don't know you're still
in your living room. Right.

617
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,850
I fucking hate that's right up there
with the people when they're blindfolded

618
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,160
and they're uh, they're feeding them
all of garden and they, they'll,

619
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,350
when they can't tell, oh my God, it's
so decadent. It's like olive garden.

620
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,560
It's like a seventh grader can
make pasta like that. Yeah.

621
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,960
And the only people that
eat it all of garden,

622
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:29,800
it's right outside of a hotel and you
have no choice. It's business people.

623
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,670
You don't have a car and you'd have to
walk through. And I was broke. I used to,

624
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,140
and I loved it because they kept bringing
the bread and would just fill you up

625
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:38,620
slowly. My bread, I fucking
love that. I know I gotta.

626
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,600
I gotta wait until eats it a club
eight o'clock. So if I eat it too,

627
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,970
I'll fill up til eight.
And then I get a free meal at the club.

628
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,460
It was a long time. That was a class
he plays to bring a date for me.

629
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:50,060
They had wine. Yeah. You know, come on.
Even another glass of wine. Here we go.

630
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,050
Angel Hair, pasta, watching
your weight. So when uh,

631
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,640
when does this special come up? Friday,
December 9th. Friday, December 9th,

632
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:01,660
which is tomorrow. Um, I
guess, I don't know. Now.

633
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,360
It tastes way people listen to podcasts
and uh, we're going to have a look.

634
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,170
Do we have a link that I can, um,
text out here? Do we have anything?

635
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,050
Bueller? Okay. It is, can
I have it so I can say it?

636
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,610
Jesus Christ. I know we didn't
play in this, so this isn't
on you. I'm just saying.

637
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,940
All right, this is, this is the level of
professionalism that I have on my, uh,

638
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,100
my podcast. Well, you got,
you got any road date?

639
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:29,930
Is there anything you want to
plug coming up? Um, now just,

640
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:34,130
I'm doing a stand in New York City, New
Year's Eve. Nice. Yeah. I love that club.

641
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,690
Yeah. That's a fucking great
cloud. That's great. It's kind of,

642
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,790
it's like the seller 2.0 yeah. Just go
down there man. It's like, you know,

643
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:43,730
sometimes there's 10 people on a Thursday,
which is fucking beautiful.

644
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,710
I love that.
Yeah.

645
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,200
And just do what you know and just
record your sets and work it out.

646
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,320
And so I loved it. So I love
playing that place. And,

647
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,880
and Bennington is going to host at night.
Ron Bennington.

648
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,220
He's doing standup again. Yeah.
So he's a host at nine years.

649
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,090
I didn't even know he did stand up.
I guess he did it back in the day.

650
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:01,670
I guess he had a club down in
Florida when he was on, I don't know,

651
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:03,170
I don't remember this,
but that's what we're were saying.

652
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,560
And then I did this thing with
Bobby Kelly called creeps were kids.

653
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,240
It was made a bunch of the comics.

654
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:11,120
We had kids and we did a whole show on
Bennington hosted and did stand up on it

655
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:14,540
a couple of months ago. It creeps
with kids grades for kids. Yeah.

656
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,690
He wants to take that
around the country. He, uh,

657
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,780
I did one of his Ron Bennington,

658
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,550
whatever the fuck he call you on
mass and it was going to say exposed.

659
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,440
It just flashed the crown. Yeah. He's
a fucking great interviewer and all,

660
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,960
all of that.
I had no idea you did stand up.

661
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,750
I would love to see because he's funny.
He's fucking hell. He's great man.

662
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:37,050
Ron in Fez did. They don't do that shit
anymore. I don't know. Feds just um,

663
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,390
basically just quit. Or he did the Robert
Plant. Yeah, he just said, you know,

664
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:45,740
we peaked. He had done, he had his 14
million or whatever the fuck he had. Yeah.

665
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:49,340
So Ron does it with his
daughter. Oh, all right.

666
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,260
I got to get back east,
dude. I don't even,

667
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:54,050
I don't even know what's going on anymore.
Yeah, it's, it's every, every week.

668
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,080
It's something different. Opie's on in the
afternoon. Now Jim's on in the morning,

669
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:02,000
which Sam Roberts and Opie and Anthony
are talking again. I know, I see.

670
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm wondering now is if they ever
do like if they ever have, you know,

671
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:07,760
like the rock and roll hall of fame,
how backstage,

672
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:10,370
how weird it must be with those bands
that had all the problems and then they

673
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:11,420
got to walk out together.

674
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,110
Like if there's ever like a radio hall
of fame at some point they got to bring

675
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:19,060
opie and Anthony. Jimmy I know.
So they all got to be there. Uh,

676
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,740
I'll hope when they get back together.
I think enough time has gone.

677
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,910
I don't know if enough time has
gone by, but uh, you know, I dunno.

678
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,690
I think they will at some
point. You know, I think he,

679
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,390
I think I'll be an Anthony at least.
Well and then hopefully Jim,

680
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,860
hopefully you'll be to trio back.

681
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,040
Why can't they do like the Mike and the
mechanics thing? We, you just go out,

682
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,560
you fucking do a couple of solo records.
Then you reform is genesis.

683
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,260
I know. I guess that doesn't work
with radio. You're going to kind of,

684
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,040
you can't just do little fucking,
hey,

685
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,560
we're going to be opening an Anthony for
six months and then we're doing that.

686
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm going to do my side project.
I never had a good head for business.

687
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,970
How did you deal with the election?

688
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,880
Were you one of those people crying when
you sell a Hillary didn't break through

689
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,700
that final glass ceiling? No, not at all.

690
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,940
Did you watch it at all? I watch it. Yeah.

691
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:07,380
I fell asleep like around like one 30
and then I was down at Disney world,

692
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:10,530
my kid, and then everyone was crying
the next day at Disney. You know,

693
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,940
what am I going to tell my kids? I, I want
him to, Mike woke up, I go, Trump won.

694
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,140
He goes, okay. That's what I
told them. Yeah, I don't, uh,

695
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,250
this always happens. It always happens.
Like I remember after, after Bush,

696
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,600
it was just,

697
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,860
fuck anybody wearing a red
tie was everybody in and
all the blue guys came in.

698
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,610
Right. Same Bullshit happens,
right? Same fucking bullshit.

699
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:37,440
They forgive the banks still got
Guantanamo. We're not end the fucking war.

700
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,870
Beauvoir no, none of the fucking bankers
go to jail. And then it's like, hey,

701
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:45,900
it's still blue guy, ty fault.
Nothing but red tie. Like,

702
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:50,250
like this is going to be,
I have to tell you was fucking hilarious.

703
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,090
Was out of all the celebrities and it
was so many of them just, you know, um,

704
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,280
campaigning,

705
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,010
which is so fucked up to me cause I'm
old enough to remember what you didn't

706
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:03,950
tell anybody who you voted
for. And I think that they
actually hurt the camp. Uh,

707
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:09,150
it's just so weird. Like
why would I listen to, to an
actor, tell me, I know Jay z,

708
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,450
like even if I'm a Jay z Fan, am I going
to fit well? Who's he voted for? Okay,

709
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:15,450
I'll vote for him.
Like he pays attention.

710
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,310
They ain't fucking guy trying to keep his
fucking billion dollar business going.

711
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,610
Like he has the fucking time.

712
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,120
I don't have the time and
I'm not doing shit right.

713
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,860
I don't have time to keep up on it.
So,

714
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,780
but the funny one I just saw it
recently was Scott Bail, who I love, um,

715
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,530
the, the most like, you know,
make America great again.

716
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,120
I just loved how vague it was. Let's
make America great again. It's so,

717
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:44,970
he goes out, I guess at the
Republican National Convention,

718
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,380
Scott fucking bales there.

719
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Why to match whoever the fuck
are the blue blue guys have.

720
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:54,150
So he goes out there, this
is what he said. He goes,

721
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:58,140
we're here not only to
make America great again,

722
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,970
but more importantly,

723
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,660
make America America again.

724
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,770
And he got a fucking applause
break. Like what the fuck is? Yeah,

725
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,730
what does that mean?
Let's make toast toast again.

726
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,780
What does that mean? Don't put butter on
it. Just just toast to thing and like,

727
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:18,480
what the fuck does that mean?
Now you can read all the way into it.

728
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:22,200
That means like, let's make it all
for fucking white people only again,

729
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,700
which is far as I can tell.

730
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:28,701
It really still kind of is for as much
as much as the people on the red red tide

731
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:32,570
site are complaining, it's still pretty
great for fucking white people. I don't,

732
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:33,930
I don't know what their problem is.

733
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,960
I think it's other white people with
all different types of ties working in

734
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:41,470
banks fucking them over. And for some
reason they, I don't know what they think.

735
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,600
It's a taxi driver.
I have no fucking idea.

736
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:47,140
But like make America America again.

737
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,050
Yeah, it's, it's ridiculous. You know, the
Hillary stuff, you know, people are like,

738
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:57,820
how can women voted for Trump? Like why
would a woman vote for Trump? I have to,

739
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,250
all that stuff came out of grabbing the
posting and all that stuff. It's like,

740
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,084
okay,

741
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,450
every girl that voted for fucking Trump
knows four guys that talk exactly like

742
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:10,000
him. They've known him since high school.
They don't have since gray. And He,

743
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,730
and they're over every
Sunday for football.

744
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,730
They were over for Thanksgiving and
they go, no new year's Eve party.

745
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:18,430
They all know that guy. They don't hate
them. They still hang around with them.

746
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:21,960
How I felt until all those women
came forward. And I was like, Oh,

747
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:24,750
I maybe the Hillary campaign
paid him until that one's,

748
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,500
the one lady goes, um, you know,

749
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,070
he started hitting on a corner and started
hitting on it and she goes, come on,

750
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,830
get real, get real. Cause he's so
fucking old, which is hilarious.

751
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,190
It's just exactly like what kind of
fantasy you live in that I'm so pathetic.

752
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:42,650
I'd hook up with a fucking skeleton
like you. So she goes, get real.

753
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,380
And then she goes,
he,

754
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:47,440
then he had his hands in his pocket or
something to thrusted as generalists

755
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:48,610
toward me and said,

756
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,970
get re and was just so
fucking the detail of it.

757
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,100
I was in the car, my wife and I was
like, oh my, I was like, that happened.

758
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,260
That definitely fucking
happen. Oh yeah, yeah.

759
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:02,380
He's been doing that stuff for
a long time and, but whatever.

760
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,010
But the women had no problem with what
Trump said, all of that stuff. He said,

761
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:09,850
you know, grabbing the pussy, it was a
pig. He did all of that and none of them.

762
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:13,510
That didn't factor anyone's decision.
Or like I know six creeps just like that.

763
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,150
That's the same way I think
my husband talks that way.

764
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,750
But I feel like if you're a woman in
your pussy isn't going to be near enough

765
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,220
Trump to be grabbed.
If he's going to give you a tax cut,

766
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,740
I think you're going to go with
it. Like I know, I don't know.

767
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,640
Proof people do what's good for them.
That's absolutely vote.

768
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:34,060
Like I would sit there, hey,
this guy's people yelling
Edward at the rally. I, yeah.

769
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:38,020
You know, I'm not into that,
but, but, but Hillary, blah
blah. So it's like, it's like,

770
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:38,970
so you don't care.
Like,

771
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,930
like most white people do not give a shit
about racism because it doesn't affect

772
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,430
them. You know what I mean? Yup.

773
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,220
That's the kind of thing that I would
love to say back in the day on Opie and

774
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:52,370
Anthony. Then they would talk
about like, you know, uh,
affirmative action. You know,

775
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,820
these white chairs can you in
the fuck school. It's like, dude,

776
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:58,120
if you can't beat out the inner city
kid who probably had fucking Shitty or

777
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:00,070
books 20 times,
you shouldn't be fucking go in there.

778
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,550
That's like when people are
out here, they'll run into
a bad club owner out here.

779
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,510
We like fucking La is not working out for
me. It's like, dude, if you can't get,

780
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,520
if you don't make it in this business,

781
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:13,240
cause a one fucking club owner or
something like that, then I mean Wa yeah.

782
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:15,720
Who gives a shit about that?
Yeah. It's just like it does this,

783
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:18,610
this is a Zillion fucking clubs
is a zillion doors to get through.

784
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,970
If you're just going to let give this
one person all of this fucking power.

785
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,680
It's that same thing like,
you know in the city,

786
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,260
there's a law in New York City is
11 clubs that do comedy every night.

787
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:28,830
I tell young, calm, so it would
just get in one or two. It doesn't,

788
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,730
don't worry about the other nine
and then eventually we'll get them.

789
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:31,330
And who cares?

790
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,120
That danger fields said you're not in
a room who's right for that room and

791
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:39,320
nobody knows nobody. Nobody's right
forever. I'm don't take that personally.

792
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:42,440
Go with the go work at the fucking
stand or stand up New York,

793
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,520
you'll do better there.
Anyway,

794
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:47,960
I did a pop in spot there about a year
ago at Dangerfield and it was like,

795
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,310
it was literally like no time had
gone by in that. Nothing had changed.

796
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:54,130
Their UB obviously different faces shower.

797
00:41:54,131 --> 00:41:55,790
He was still a way to
there as far as I know,

798
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,740
and I fucking went up in front of
this crowd and just fucking ate it.

799
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,330
Ate it like I was a fucking three years
into the business. Just went up there.

800
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,010
They finally fixed the sound. Do you
remember at that club, the fucking reverb?

801
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,840
REVERB was cranked up?
Yes.

802
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:16,841
So fucking high for like fucking eight
years and there was this little mixer up

803
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:17,930
there and it was awesome.

804
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,890
He had to do was just fucking fade
something up or down or turn a knob and

805
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:24,140
nobody did it for eight years.
I just remember whenever,

806
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,860
if you did a bit that
was loud and it bombed,

807
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,900
how they would be that fucking echo.

808
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,380
Like when Dean Martin would
sing at Capitol records,

809
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,170
it had like that fucking echo
thing going on and it made it like,

810
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,010
it's almost like a bomb twice cause they
got to hear the echo of whatever they

811
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:42,730
just, they didn't fucking
laugh at. But uh, dude,

812
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,010
I haven't done the clubs back then and
so, uh, I've been out here for a while.

813
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,180
Well that room was, you know, they don't
tell you what the cover charges. You know,

814
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:54,050
a kid comes in 22 years old
when his girlfriend, some
chick, he's trying to bang.

815
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,320
Yeah, let's go to Dangerfield
Rodney Dangerfield yet. And
they, oh yeah, come on in,

816
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,470
come on, sit down, sit down
the cover charges like $19.

817
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,470
This is like in 1995 like 19 ahead and
the drinks are like $19 and it's a two

818
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:09,260
drink minimum. So you know,
you're the comedians up.

819
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:10,820
Then all of a sudden he's like,
Oh let's get out of it.

820
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,760
It's socks cause nobody's laughing.
You were in a pitch pitch black dark,

821
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:16,280
you can't see a fucking thing
in front of you. And then a kid,

822
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:20,060
the 19 year old kid that's trying to bang,
this chick gets a check for like $102.

823
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:22,650
He's been in the club for
30 minutes. Wow. 100 today.

824
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,520
And you just hear screaming in the
back though. You got to pay what?

825
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:27,980
I didn't know it cost $19 again at $19.

826
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:31,400
They don't tell you when nothing's
posted. Oh God. And then they do,

827
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,010
you know if you're going to a great
club though, it's a great class.

828
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,800
A little laid out. I don't want to shit on
all these. No, no, no, no, no. It's, it's,

829
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,280
it is for a comp and especially in New
York City where you could actually do 30,

830
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:42,860
25 to 30 minutes,
you can't do it at a most of the clubs.

831
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,630
Well Jim Norton was the guy that
got us all in there. He all,

832
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:48,740
you got to all of us on opiate Anthony
and he got all of us to do danger fields

833
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,490
before that because he was,
um, he was one of those few,

834
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,110
well I guess cause he was a Jersey guy,
but I was like,

835
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:57,500
somebody that's New York comics,
we're just content to just do,

836
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,430
you know the New York clubs,
you know the comic strip and that was it.

837
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,580
And do their 20 minutes and it's just
like, dude, don't you want to expand this?

838
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:06,450
At some point you're gonna
have to do back then,

839
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,240
remember it was 45 minutes to close,

840
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,090
then it became an hour and now
you gotta do like an hour plus.

841
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,920
But back when we started out
as the opener did like 10,

842
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,110
eight to 10 brought up the feature,

843
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:23,111
who did 20 and then a or 25 maybe
25 maybe a half at the most.

844
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:29,260
And then the headliner did 45 that was
your show. 90 minutes. So it's, yeah,

845
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:32,400
it's 1530 45 and I remember thinking,
Oh my God,

846
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:35,190
I don't fuck do you do 45 minutes?
How do you get that?

847
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:37,770
Last 15 minutes together.

848
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:40,590
Now it's like you gotta you gotta do
like a fucking hour and 10 minutes,

849
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,670
hour and 15.

850
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,220
Uh,
um,

851
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,180
what's his face last night? Uh,
Jesus Christ. I'm getting so old.

852
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:53,500
It just spaced on his fucking name.
The guy from black flag,

853
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,600
Henry Rollins, Rollins, he's the
one who spoke spoken word thing.

854
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,510
I got to stop fucking talking to myself.

855
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,680
I've got to go to those headpieces cause
I really think it's fucking with my

856
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,610
memory. Henry Rollins, right? I fucking
went to see that guy do debt, dude.

857
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,390
He does like two and a half hours
and it's just like he and he's like,

858
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:11,710
it's fucking unbelievable. And
he's intense, right? The whole two,

859
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:15,720
whenever that whole fucking at the
time it was funny. Droves. It goes.

860
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,990
I was with Jerome, I'm like this
fucking guy, dude. He comes out,

861
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,050
it's like when they go, ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome Henry Rollins.

862
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:25,590
They barely get the s of Rollins
and he's fucking out there, right?

863
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,360
And he comes walking out and he does
this bow and his fists are clenched and

864
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:33,960
then he takes the mic out of the mic
stand and he's such rapid the cord around

865
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:38,130
his fucking head. It was just, it was,
it was the guy was fucking amazing.

866
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,670
And um,
I made two rows.

867
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,210
I laughed my ass off cause cause we were
watching the guys, God, Jesus Christ,

868
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,190
the guys go fucking intense. And he goes
like, yeah dude and he's stone sober.

869
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,750
I was like, Yo, I gotta
tell you something.

870
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,690
I don't think I've ever seen a guy who
needs a drink more than this guy this

871
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:54,630
fucking like and he doesn't take on water.
Like he doesn't take a break.

872
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:57,540
I heard like he won't even
reach for water during his set.

873
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,190
I'm telling you it was like
just full on for two is yeah,

874
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,890
it was like a, I'm trying
to think of a band. Yeah,

875
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,390
I guess it would be like if you'd
never heard of ACDC, you know,

876
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:14,310
they don't play any ballads and if there
was no talking between songs and it was

877
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:17,700
all coal out of rosy,
right back and forth,

878
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,790
or even like raging against the machine
who doesn't talk when they were,

879
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,960
they were just, I've been to a million
old shows and it's just pure. No,

880
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,100
they don't talk and I just go one the one
song to another, to another, to another.

881
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:32,520
That's another band that their singer
won't do it. No, he won't do it.

882
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,170
There's so many of those fucking band.

883
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:39,750
There's millions and millions of
dollars on the table for them to do like

884
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:43,650
festivals over in Europe or the 80,000
people and do a tour to states and the

885
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:47,700
guy just won't do it. Well, here's,
this is the thing. If you're in a band,

886
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,720
okay,
and you start seeing your lead singer,

887
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,300
like reading a real estate
book or something on business,

888
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,280
you've got to burn that fucking thing
because he's going to invest his money

889
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:01,410
wisely and then he's not
going to need to do it.

890
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:03,920
And then you're going to be fucked.
I just can't imagine like,

891
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,313
mmm,

892
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,381
I can't in,
first of all,

893
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,720
I can't imagine the pressure of the
lead singer where it's like, what if,

894
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:12,720
what if the drummer fucked up
and it doesn't have his Goddamn,

895
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,680
it doesn't have money.

896
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,820
And it's just like you could just go
do a fucking tour just to help him out.

897
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,610
You got the pressure of him going,
come on man,

898
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:23,430
I'm going to lose my fucking house.
Him and his, and he'd be like,

899
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,220
during the 90s we made enough money.
You never shed at work again.

900
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:30,100
Well I was bad with money. Yeah,
well that's just do three kings,

901
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,800
that's the thing,
which is mostly what journey.

902
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,250
They all invest their money and that's
why Steven Perry has a lot of money.

903
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,730
They were like the first rock band real
really like put their money away and had

904
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,660
good financial planning and stuff.
So they didn't have to do that.

905
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,460
They didn't do anything for a
while until I got the Asian singer.

906
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:50,020
They had another guy in every four, but
they didn't have to do it. Um, but yeah,

907
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:53,400
a lot of bands like, but this guy in rage
against machine, he just, they have a,

908
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,130
they have a band meeting once a year.
He doesn't even have a cell phone.

909
00:47:57,131 --> 00:47:58,990
They have to like call
somebody to call somebody.

910
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:00,340
It's almost like when they were,
you know,

911
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,160
like trying to find
bin Ladin he shows off.

912
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:05,570
They talk about rage against the machine
and you want to put this remaster I

913
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,250
whatever. Yeah, okay to hang for a couple
hours. And he goes, oh, I'll see you guys.

914
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:13,630
And then you don't see them for a year
when I like looked as about 80 million on

915
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:17,980
the table. If we do about 50 dates.
Nah Man, I'm good. I'm all right.

916
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,590
Jesus.
Well,

917
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,620
well supposedly supposedly the rumor what
guns and roses they got back together,

918
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:26,470
you know, slash going through a divorce
and I don't even know if it's final yet,

919
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,210
but he had no prenup.

920
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:31,870
Married for 20 years in La with two kids.

921
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,450
He was going to lose more
than 50% of his money.

922
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,750
And supposedly the cut is axle gets 50,

923
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,210
uh slash gets 25 and duff gets 25 and
slash we'll pay his other guys in the

924
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,580
band.
UFC Still Guy Richie forward us,

925
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:48,520
he's got his drummer and all that does
he read the keyboard at that comes out of

926
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,060
axles money.

927
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,060
But supposedly what I heard is a doff is
given some of his money to slash cause

928
00:48:56,951 --> 00:49:00,480
Duff's made so many good investments has
so much money that he's like dude are

929
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,211
you going to need it?

930
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,700
Cause he's trying to pay this divorce off
of whatever the money is gonna have to

931
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:04,040
pay it.

932
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,540
Tufts actually given slash some of the
money and that's one of the main reasons

933
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:10,600
they got back together.
The axle never likes slash his wife.

934
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,920
So as soon as they got married 20 years
ago, whatever that everything fell apart.

935
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:18,280
As soon as they broke up they started
talking again and they've got the band

936
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:21,730
back together. But supposedly duff has
given a cut to slash to help him out.

937
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,860
Jesus Christ, 20 years.
California is a mother,

938
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,210
20 years and no prenup to kids.

939
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,200
How does it work? Like if you got married
in California, but then you move to,

940
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,890
to Washington and then
if it falls apart there,

941
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,870
do you then go by the laws of the state
that you got married in or the state

942
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:44,710
you're in there? I don't know. I don't
know how that works. Yeah, dude, it's,

943
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,130
did you see what happened in the
beautiful woman there on, uh,

944
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,450
you know the two gay guys, the guy of Al
Al Bundy from married with children. Uh,

945
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,430
what the fuck's the name of that show?
Alternative lifestyles. Mato Mato family.

946
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,680
Family. Yeah. That fucking show. Did you,

947
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,960
did you see what's what
she's going through? No,

948
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,080
she was with some guy and they were
gonna do that fucking in vitro,

949
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,510
so I don't know.
And he's Oh yeah.

950
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:11,620
And he's so in for the embryos named him.
Dude,

951
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:15,820
if that was my son, I'd be like, you
fucking piece of shit. Get a fucking job,

952
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:19,150
get a fucking job through that is dead.

953
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:23,230
Is the conti hust bitchy as fucking thing.

954
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:24,940
I've seen somebody doing a long fucking,

955
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:30,020
he named the embryos people do
me you fucking piece of shit.

956
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,360
You think of it as a waitress in
Hooters? Would it be then when us, no,

957
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:38,360
he just knows she has money and he
wants child support and he wants child

958
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:38,810
support.

959
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,210
That happened to something like my wife
was telling me that happened to some

960
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:45,590
other woman, same font. I
think fucking things like,
dude, that is just like, yeah,

961
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:49,040
that a woman from the view,
the black chick from the view that quit.

962
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,540
What's your name? A star
Jones. Was it? She did.

963
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,790
She had a baby with this
dude or whatever like that.

964
00:50:55,791 --> 00:51:00,110
Star Jones was the one who fucking got
a stomach stapled and it was like, Nah,

965
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:03,920
I just been doing cardio.
Yeah, grapefruit. Yeah, I
had, I was our, yeah. Oh,

966
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:07,130
so she's at a number of, but she had
the other chick who was the other one.

967
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:11,470
Rosie O'donnell then called the route was
like, now you lang, you fucking get it.

968
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:16,640
Yeah, you got it stapled.
You know what's amazing,

969
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,320
rex? Ryan's getting fat
again. Like how do you,

970
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,380
how you fucking push that band right off.

971
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,430
He said that his brother ever since his
brother got in town that did squat and

972
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:29,210
they keep it, they can't stop eating. That
was as cues 20 heart, his brother after,

973
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,790
you know, it's funny like, yeah, if
you move to buffalo, you're in trouble.

974
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:36,480
There's no healthy place to eat. Yeah.
I think that was it duff, is it Duffy's?

975
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,040
Duffys the anchor bar and did the two
places that claim that they invented the

976
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,770
winks. Yeah, there's debt. Those two,

977
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:46,610
if he goes to Minnesota and they got
those juicy Lucy's, you know the Burgers,

978
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:50,060
we put the fucking cheese in the middle
of it. There's a lot of tough cities.

979
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,350
New York. You could actually eat healthy
though. You know he has rex Ryan.

980
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:55,430
If he's not going to fucking,

981
00:51:55,431 --> 00:52:00,431
if he's going to stay skinny needs to
coach a team in like self-involved cities

982
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:05,660
only. Yeah. Like if he was the La Rams,
rams, rams, giants and jets, he be good.

983
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,500
San Diego, San Diego.
That's a, yeah, yeah, yeah.

984
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,670
He'd meet some that might fuck up his
marriage. So this is so many beautiful,

985
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:16,360
cool chicks down there. You might
have a fucking problem. You know,

986
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,790
they're all walking around in
sandals. He's into fee, you know,

987
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,880
you walking around with no
shirt on and shit, you know,
so. All right, we're gonna,

988
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,970
we're gonna wrap up here. Do it. It's
always so great to see. I'm so proud, man.

989
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:32,630
You've got this special coming out once
again called a simple man. Simple man.

990
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,790
Simple man. You can see it
starting tomorrow, December 9th,

991
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:41,330
2016 if you listen to this 20 year and
the years in the fucking future, um,

992
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:46,730
iTunes in on Amazon and uh, was
taped in New Jersey. And uh,

993
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,310
you said you taped it how long ago?
Like a year and a half ago.

994
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,590
It was about a year and a half. I'll see.
You already got your new hour. You Ready?

995
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,310
I'm ready. I'm ready. Don't want an
f in about a month, dude. I'm not.

996
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:56,900
Mine's coming out in January.

997
00:52:56,901 --> 00:52:59,750
I taped it in October and I've just been
sitting around waiting for this kid to

998
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:03,770
show up. So, uh, oh. And the ones that
kid to the floodgates are going to open.

999
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,400
I know. Hundred. Hey, you haven't been
changing a diaper. What's up with that?

1000
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,020
I don't want to be the front
and you won't be there.

1001
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,270
I thought I was going to be to
cause all my friends, like, Oh men,

1002
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,860
you and I have a kid.
You're not gonna be doing kid jokes.

1003
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,320
You start tucking my shirt
in and wear a sport coat.

1004
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:20,330
You know when you go on stage, the dad
shit with the fucking gap jeans. Yeah.

1005
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:22,060
Well that's the thing.
When you first, you know,

1006
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,100
the first six months is hairy
man has no sleep. Everyone's

1007
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,870
cranky.
You're up every two hours.

1008
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,990
You'd have to take shifts or whatever
like that and you just got to make sure

1009
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,950
you're almost like don't put on that
extra that dad weight in the beginning.

1010
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,020
Yeah, no, I'm actually trying,

1011
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,070
I'm trying to drop a bunch of weight
before the kid gets there just because

1012
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,750
we'll put them, we're going
to be so exhausted. If you,
whatever your work out is,

1013
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:45,420
you're going to fuck that
I'm taking a nap. Yeah. Well,

1014
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:48,930
that's why I think I'm not working
on the road until February,

1015
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:53,820
but once I'm in February, in February,
I would like to, uh, you know,

1016
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,090
just start going back out again because
I figure I'll have my hour together by

1017
00:53:57,091 --> 00:54:01,720
then enough to actually have somebody
paid to see me do standup again. And um,

1018
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:06,000
the game plan is to, uh, you know, do my,

1019
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:07,410
I still do my two weekends a month,

1020
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,040
so I figured I'll just go out and just
sleep when I'm on the road, do my show,

1021
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:15,600
go back, go to sleep and that, that'll
be my thing. And then with my wife,

1022
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,220
I'm just going to one day a week,

1023
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:21,240
I'm going to give it like a fucking
spa day where she just goes and fucking

1024
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,560
probably sleeps during the
massage or whatever. I just,

1025
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:29,570
I feel like my big thing is that I keep
her fucking chill and happy the best I

1026
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,250
can then that that'll get through this.
Absolutely. Yeah. That's what I did.

1027
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:36,690
I'd slept on the road. I did all my work
on the road to how old's your son now?

1028
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,110
He's six. He just turned six. Six.
Yeah. Fuck of the year's going.

1029
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,720
Holy Shit. Six years old and when he
plays drums and stuff, he's played drums.

1030
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:46,590
He sings.

1031
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,560
He's going in the recording studio and
next week that would cut two songs as if

1032
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:54,330
he's got two originals ones called evil
pumpkin because he had a dream about a

1033
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:56,430
pumpkin and you already wrote
the lyrics forward and let me,

1034
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,390
let me want the heaven is a ballad
because he was a Motorhead fan.

1035
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:03,270
He never got to meet Lemmy, so he sings
about it. He's a, he's a, he's insane.

1036
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,360
Jesus Christ. Dude. You're
raising them, right? Oh yeah.
Taking them a dolphin games.

1037
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:09,720
He's been to three games already this
year, is that right? Oh yeah. He loves it.

1038
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,330
Dolphins game. Oh, I turned
them down in Miami twice.

1039
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:15,960
We went to a ravens game last week down
in Baltimore. He almost meant Marino.

1040
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:18,880
He's Big Marino Fang, some
friends, we'll Marino.

1041
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:21,000
So we're trying to get on the field.
We code it and so he's like,

1042
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,970
you got to meet you. I'm like,
luck. Yeah. He already met Ozzy.

1043
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,090
He's pissed and he hasn't met Angus Young.
Oh my God.

1044
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,520
That's a tough one to pull off.
I don't know if I can do,

1045
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,650
he can't get rid of Nero's ACDC guys.

1046
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:35,470
Brian Johnson when he was in a band
you could, but that's tough to get.

1047
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,870
We had um, a once on that metal
show. I met him once and that's good.

1048
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:43,740
Brian Johnson at all an Angus. Wow.
Yeah, Angus was on. How was that?

1049
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,390
It was great.
Right when black ice come out.

1050
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:48,180
That was like a 2008 we first
started doing the show. Yeah.

1051
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,320
And I ran into you at the forum.
Yeah, we went to the show. Yeah. Uh,

1052
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,630
I'm a huge ACDC fan. What would they
like? I know Brian's cool as well.

1053
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,170
First of all, my son saw ACDC
with Brian Johnson and axle,

1054
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,630
so he's seen him with two
different singers, which is great.

1055
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:04,860
And He loved both of them. Well, axle
did a great job. He did an amazing job.

1056
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,100
I saw it twice in one week. It was so
good. You know, what's amazing about,

1057
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:12,030
about axles voices to fact that he
was a hermit and didn't tour forever.

1058
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,640
He still has it.
It's amazing how that guy,

1059
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:18,570
I give him the comeback player of the
year between guns and roses doing two and

1060
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:20,340
a half hour shows and,
and pulling off the bond.

1061
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:24,670
Scott and the Brian Johnson
ACDC stuff. He's like, I hate
supposedly he, he had uh,

1062
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,540
you know, he just realized all these
guys die and David Bowie, you know,

1063
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,070
everywhere all these rock stars dying.
He's like,

1064
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:34,060
what am I doing seriously at this point,
let me just let me go back out there.

1065
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,150
Let's get the band back together
and go have fun, play stadiums.

1066
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:39,940
And then went and then he was a
huge ACDC fan at Bon Scott Fan.

1067
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,370
I was his favorite band growing up.
He actually made the call,

1068
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:45,070
he called them and said, hey, if you
guys need any help, just let me know.

1069
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,160
And they go will come down and audition
and next thing you know, he had the Gig.

1070
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,460
Wow.
And the bonds got shitty.

1071
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,620
They were pulling out like the
stuff they haven't done in years.

1072
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:55,960
If you want blood, you got
it. They were doing live.

1073
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,370
Oh did they live wire killer shit.
Yeah.

1074
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,400
Cause they hadn't played
that since bond died. Yeah.

1075
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,130
And they did problem child the last night.
I sold it last night at a tour,

1076
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:08,020
cliff Williams retired to bass player
and they played problem child on the

1077
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:09,220
encore to go,
we haven't done this.

1078
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:12,900
When we rehearsed it a
couple times they're going
to just did the prophet tired

1079
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,380
from the day I retire from the band.
It was his last show in September. He,

1080
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:18,120
I think he got that,

1081
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,130
he's really close with Brian
and I think Brian got the shaft,

1082
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,320
you know what I mean?
And they lit both live down in Florida.

1083
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:27,070
They hang out in pubs, they drank and
shit like that. And it felt like Ah,

1084
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,370
you know when I'm out man cause
it's just Angus left in a band.

1085
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,240
Like what are you going
to do now? Oh God. So who,

1086
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,430
who do they get through replace him
that nobody, cause the tour just ended.

1087
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:39,040
So I didn't know what, you know, they'll
just hibernate for a couple of years.

1088
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,130
So the band right now is Chris Slade,

1089
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,980
Malcolm Young's brother Angus,

1090
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,680
axel, axel and no bass players. Yeah.

1091
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,780
So Angus is the only one, the original
guy in the band. So they can't come back.

1092
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,580
They have to use axle.
They can't come back.

1093
00:57:57,581 --> 00:58:00,640
We're like a tribute singer from Texas,
you know,

1094
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,040
and an appetite for destruction band.
They ain't no way.

1095
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:07,150
They're not going to do arenas.
Um, man. So he stuck with it.

1096
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:11,730
He had to come back. What happened? Brian?
Brian, he's hearing God. Yeah, yeah,

1097
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,520
yeah, yeah. I know. Well, you
know, looking at 68 years old,

1098
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:19,180
he can only do two shows a week.
Angus wanted to do four or five.

1099
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,760
You don't want to sit in a hotel.
You got a crew of like 300 people.

1100
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:24,190
It's expensive to be out on the road
and I can just wants to play, you know,

1101
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:26,770
every other night.
Brian can only do it two nights.

1102
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:30,010
Did you know it's a physical show
to do one, two and a half hours.

1103
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,930
It's the singers. The big
thing. You can play guitar.

1104
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,370
Angus l does fucking flop around on
the floor and shit. The guys that,

1105
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:38,170
he's like 61 61 yeah.
Yeah. And he's still,

1106
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:41,000
he's still still weighs
96 pounds and still,

1107
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,270
I know he never drank or
did drugs back in the day.

1108
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,220
Used to drink milkshakes and
shit just out and burn them off.

1109
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,080
Smoke four packs of cigarettes a day.
Yeah, that was his vice, Huh? Fuck.

1110
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,420
So I don't know what's going on but,
but Brian based,

1111
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:55,000
so as soon as they found out something
as almost like a marriage, you know,

1112
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:57,360
you're married like 30 years
and all of a sudden you know,

1113
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,700
you see your wife was talking to an
old boyfriend on Facebook. That's it.

1114
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:03,910
We're divorced. See, something's going
on. Like they were just, I think I liked,

1115
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:08,170
they were looking for an excuse to let
Bryan goal because anger Angus still

1116
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,480
wants to do it is Sangha [inaudible]
all the money that's out there,

1117
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:12,940
he could play till he's 70 years old.
He could still run around.

1118
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,070
So Brian was basically winding
down. So he's like, all right,

1119
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:19,510
I got to get him out somehow.
Get somebody else in and continue this.

1120
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,340
What they really should have done. Just
said, Brian said, hey, I'm going to,

1121
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,560
I'm going to retire after it is,
and then, you know, good luck to,

1122
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:30,650
those guys are going to get a new lead
singer and they're gonna carry on.

1123
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,110
The fans would have bought that, but
there are a lot of them aren't buying it.

1124
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,200
There was a lot of tickets, like they
were only doing about 10,000 people.

1125
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,760
Like a lot of people returned to tickets.
Like,

1126
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:40,580
fuck that you guys fucked
over Brian Johnson. I don't
give a shit who's singing?

1127
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,960
We're not coming to see the band. So who
knows what they're going to do now that,

1128
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,450
cause you know Jim Rowers to one who
broke that brewer hung out with Brian

1129
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,240
Johnson like a week after the shit went
down and basically went on his podcast

1130
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:54,890
and said, Brian's like, they fucked
me. I said, I have a hearing problem.

1131
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:55,700
The next thing I know,

1132
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,480
I hear on the news that the tour is off
and I'm out at a band and two days later

1133
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:02,870
they shipped all my shit to my house.
Like a ups or a bail.

1134
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:06,210
You U haul truck shows up with all
my equipment. Is that true? I, yeah.

1135
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,031
Well that's what he told.

1136
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:10,190
Borrower and brewer talked about it
and Brian had a back off. No, no,

1137
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:14,600
it didn't go down like that, but
you know it did. He just said, look,

1138
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,710
I got to hear him problem.
I'm just telling you that it's,

1139
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,430
it's eventually going to be a bigger
problem, but you know, whatever.

1140
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,320
We have 10 shows left.
Obviously I'm going to do one,

1141
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:24,320
but I got to figure this shit out and
they just said the next day, all right,

1142
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,460
he's out of the band. Goodbye. He's
retiring. He can't play anymore. Jesus,

1143
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,270
that makes me happy. I'm a
comedian, you know? I know.
Just on us to deal with that.

1144
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,270
Just to us, that level of shit. All right,

1145
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:38,450
well that's the Thursday
afternoon podcast. I got to
read some advertising here.

1146
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,170
I will not make you sit through
listening to me. I don't care, man.

1147
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,030
But if you go to Jim florentine.com
put the Promo Code [inaudible],

1148
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,770

If you don't, if you don't go to iTunes,

1149
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,410
there's a sort of doing
that. Okay, well shit.

1150
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:55,010
Guess what I'm doing when I get home?
Well I'm going to lamaze class.

1151
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:59,160
The last fucking one we didn't
get into that I'd fucking out.

1152
01:00:59,161 --> 01:01:03,700
I did want to know is birthing natural
birthing classes. You know what,

1153
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,470
we went to it like an infant
infant care thing and I, you know,

1154
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,970
they taught us how to change a diaper
and shit. Like, so like I, you know,

1155
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:16,010
I had younger brothers and sisters so
I knew how to do it, but then like a,

1156
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:19,190
you know, I just hadn't done in a while.
So that one actually was just like,

1157
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:22,280
oh yeah, okay. It's good to teach how
to ramp the kid up and that shit. Okay,

1158
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,760
I get this. But that fucking, this is
the last one to dude, I'll tell you this,

1159
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:31,370
this is the last one. And uh, I wish it
was a pub right across the fucking street,

1160
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:34,790
cause I would go out and
celebrate that this fucking class.

1161
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,250
I mean the ladies Nice who teaches it?
Everybody in the class and nice,

1162
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:40,490
but he's just a fucking waste.
It's what the fuck are we doing?

1163
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,000
I did the same thing when my
wife at the time and at one,

1164
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,460
I remember one time she goes,
I have a headache. She's like,

1165
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,870
I don't know if I'm going to be able
to make the class tonight. Are You mad?

1166
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,420
I'm like, I got no, no, don't
worry about it. She goes, no,

1167
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:53,180
I don't want to miss this one. Uh, you
know, if you, if you really want to go,

1168
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:54,980
we'll go. Like I'm not, don't worry
about it. If you've got a headache,

1169
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:57,170
let's just stay home. Who knows? It
could be something worse. I'm like,

1170
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:01,210
fucking beautiful. You know,
cause you have to take the
bullet and go, yeah, no, go,

1171
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,080

there and like, okay look,

1172

the room that went to fucking school for

1173
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:10,160
this for eight years. I'm just some
fucking asshole. How am I going to help?

1174
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,370
It's the stupidest fucking,
it's the stupidest thing ever.

1175
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:15,680
It is six doctors in there to
know what the hell the doin.

1176
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,440
And I'm just standing there.
It's the only fucking procedure.

1177
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,040
What medical procedure that you're

1178
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,210
fucking in there. I worked in a dental
office, Mike, my dad would tell him,

1179
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,670
get out of here cause they're going
to see blood. You're gonna Faint now.

1180
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:29,220
I've got two patients in the fuck
out of here. I don't need you here.

1181
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,930
One more dude. Just the amount of
fucking times I look at that clock, dude.

1182
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,320
It's like, it's insane. It is
insane. It's like two hours, right?

1183
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:42,030
So no one seven oh two seven oh four
don't look, don't look seven oh six fuck,

1184
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,320

a film strip, a little video.

1185
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,080
And I'm psyched again. It's like
I'm in high school again. Oh good.

1186
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:53,010
A fucking film strip. I could just
fucking chill out and not think, well,

1187
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:55,500
mine was shown like natural birth,
like an a in the bathtub.

1188
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,483
And they had like there,

1189
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:00,730
the woman was putting VHS tapes in
from women from like the 80s that had,

1190
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,690
you know, kids at home and their
bathtub and they're showing,

1191
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:07,460
they're showing the kid coming out
and he's big, hairy pussies, you know,

1192
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,260
like these bushes that are
really high because it was,

1193
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:14,050
it was so seriously from like the 80s
there were on like a camcorder and filmed

1194
01:03:14,051 --> 01:03:18,820
on him. Like you gotta be
fucking kidding me. Oh,

1195
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,480
at least that's funny man. I
fucking like, dude. It was funny.

1196
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,910
There was showing like, you know, if

1197
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:30,260
the woman's having trouble they can make
an incision basically along the taint.

1198
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:31,800
Yeah, I know. Sorry guys.

1199
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,910
Either vertical or like fucking at
an angle and I'm looking at it and I,

1200
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:39,510
and it's just as drawing and I
was going like, Jesus Christ,

1201
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:44,160
why is the clit so big? And it was the
asshole. Like there was drones so bad that

1202
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:50,730
my wife was dying because they just sort
of like drew a Bush a little bit like,

1203
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:54,150
and then they just had like this black
hole and I couldn't tell if she was

1204
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:57,810
laying on his stomach or on her back.
And I was just like, it was fun.

1205
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:59,710
It was like a week later I said,
I said, yeah, and it's still,

1206
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,640
why did they draw the clips?
No,

1207
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,380
I figured out in the class
and then I laughed to myself.

1208
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,830
Then I told my wife and she was
fucking dying laughing. I was like,

1209
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:11,040
what did that look like? A
fucking asshole. It didn't,
they didn't draw it right.

1210
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:16,300
All right, this is way off
topic. Um, uh, I was, uh, s uh,

1373
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,850
Have a nice weekend. Get consent.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

1374
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:17,990
[inaudible]

1375
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:53,670
right. It's one of those deals
every year. There's that Douche.

1376
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:59,100
Then there's always the Doshi west to try
and top everybody's stories. You know,

1377
01:14:59,101 --> 01:15:01,140
you can be sitting there
with the fucking astronaut

1378
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,410
each somehow try to top
them or correct them.

1379
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:08,940
Okay.

1380
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,440
Well, actually I thought, uh,
according to, uh, you know, when,

1381
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,590
I don't know what video games,

1382
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:15,930
some fucking astronaut video
game that Douche played,

1383
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,310
he'd actually try to question a real
artist who even knows an astronaut at this

1384
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:21,660
point,
aren't they all dead?

1385
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,280
Okay?

1386
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,250
Did the people who are on the space
shuttle where they consider it astronauts

1387
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,410
because I didn't consider them astronauts.

1388
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:32,130
You're not an astronaut if
you're in a plane. Okay.

1389
01:15:32,131 --> 01:15:37,131
And I know it's a big one and I know
it's got rockets on it initially.

1390
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:40,703
All right?

1391
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,950
Okay.

1392
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:46,950
But all I know is that the
astronauts that I grew up on with,

1393
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:50,740
we're fucking,
they were at the top of a missile.

1394
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:54,490
That's what day did,
you didn't stare that fucking thing.

1395
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,500
I mean how they got back,
they had a little capsule.

1396
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,630
Think he just leaned to one side.

1397
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:02,050
You kept rolling back towards
the earth hoping you'd reenter.

1398
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,950
Right then the parachutes came out
and they couldn't fucking find you.

1399
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:09,940
Cause all we had was binoculars. You
know, where is he? I don't see you.

1400
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:16,270
All right. Hang on the star, not, they
ain't not, not the star board. Right.

1401
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,750
And you're fucking sitting there in
the water, clinging to a sting ray.

1402
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:22,701
If you lucky,

1403
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:27,701
you landed on an island and then you
met a genie who called your master,

1404
01:16:27,811 --> 01:16:30,480
but for some reason you never fucked her.
But other than that,

1405
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:34,830
that's what an astronaut was even
didn't flying a fucking plane, you know,

1406
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,080
Wheaton spaghettios or
whatever the fuck they did.

1407
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,880
And then land and get towed to the gate
by a fucking Toyota Tundra. All right.

1408
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:43,170
That's not an astronaut.
To me,

1409
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:47,130
that's a very impressive pilot.

1410
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:52,140
Very impressed.
You went a lot higher than the jumbo jet.

1411
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:55,650
I flew to Syracuse. Sin
Hat's off to you, sir.

1412
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,800
[inaudible]

1413
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,880
your thoughts do.
My question is in here somewhere.

1414
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:38,360
I am nowhere near a conspiracy
freak or anything like that,

1415
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:42,830
but I do admit I get a hard on for any
documentary on that secret military base

1416
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:47,200
in Nevada that is called area 51
the government is suppose, well,

1417
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,670
I mean believe in aliens.
Like

1418
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:55,550
I don't know that.
That's really not that crazy.

1419
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:03,350
You know, you think like how
big the fucking universes.

1420
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,960
There's just life on one planet,
no life anywhere else.

1421
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:13,040
Despite the fact that they see evidence
of water on Mars at some point.

1422
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,430
You know, I'm telling you
guys, we're not that special.

1423
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:22,360
If you're God and you made
the whole university the,
I'm just going to sit back,

1424
01:18:22,361 --> 01:18:27,130
watch in one fucking planet. Maybe
that's why the earth is so fucked up.

1425
01:18:27,131 --> 01:18:29,410
I don't think he's been watching
us for the last couple of thousand.

1426
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:32,470
He wasn't last time he reached
out. Reach out, reach out.

1427
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,970
All right.

1428
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:38,440
When's the last time he fucking did that
was the last time he fucking was in a

1429
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:40,390
burning Bush going, hey, hey, you there,

1430
01:18:40,391 --> 01:18:44,320
you there with the long fucking Kirby
stick next to the sheep. Come over here.

1431
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,980
Come over to the burning Bush. You know,
when was the last time we did that?

1432
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:52,960
I think he's been watching another earth.
I'm flipping through the channels,

1433
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,920
you know,
can imagine how clear his fucking,

1434
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:59,710
how big do you think
God's flat screen TV is?

1435
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:04,840
How clear is that picture?
I bet even if you make it to heaven,

1436
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,110
you know,
you don't even get to see it.

1437
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,670
Like he comes out of his office and he
tried to peek in real quick and like the

1438
01:19:12,671 --> 01:19:17,260
human eye, you can just, it's just too
much of a fucking glare. Right. Um,

1439
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:22,560
so anyways. Yeah and if you believe in
aliens, I mean, I mean, I don't know that,

1440
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:26,630
that, that we can reach
one another. You know,

1441
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:31,180
that whole flying saucer
fucking over shit. I mean,

1442
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:34,780
how long can you go with, with
artificial breathe, you know,

1443
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,710
some sort of atmosphere in there.
It was like on Star Trek.

1444
01:19:38,711 --> 01:19:41,590
I mean they just had this
limitless supply of fucking oxygen.

1445
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,093
Oh

1446
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,630
well just fucking flying through space.

1447
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:51,891
Now look at them.

1448
01:19:51,891 --> 01:19:54,860
They landed on a lot of planets that
at oxygen they would just land on these

1449
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:58,710
planets and they just had oxygen. I think
what they did was they opened the day,

1450
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,690
landed the star ship enterprise and they
just opened the windows and they got

1451
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:05,660
some more oxygen and then they flew
away. Right. Isn't that how it works?

1452
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,700
Anyways?
Um,

1453
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:14,190
the government supposedly is housing and
researching crashed Ufo goes and uses

1454
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:17,610
deadly force to keep regular people out.

1455
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:21,990
Do you have any opinion on the
subject? I think I just said, I mean,

1456
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:25,110
I don't fuck do I think they
actually have the bodies of aliens?

1457
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,293
Um,

1458
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,510
did you realize like the level of secrecy
you would have to have if you actually

1459
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:36,300
had that shit? That would be like one of
the things before they went in the room.

1460
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:37,134
It's like,
okay,

1461
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:41,910
we're going to let you in this room and
you got to understand when you go in

1462
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:42,361
this room,

1463
01:20:42,361 --> 01:20:45,930
the doors closing and you're never getting
out because you're going to see some

1464
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:49,770
fucking shit in here that I
don't give a fuck. You're not.

1465
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,120
If you have one shot a Nyquil, you're,
you're going to be blabbering about it.

1466
01:20:55,340 --> 01:21:00,330
You can't do it. So I, I don't, I
don't know. I don't fucking know.

1467
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,870
Um, anyways, he goes, what
your bullshit meter say?

1468
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:07,470
I think there's way too much of a veil
of secrecy around the place to think

1469
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:11,100
otherwise. I used to know someone
who was a career air force pilot.

1470
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,240
Whenever the subject of that base
or those mysterious for flights,

1471
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,200
serious lights over Phoenix
scene in 1997 came up.

1472
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:24,300
He completely removed himself from the
conversation. Uh, those mysterious lights,

1473
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,130
I don't even know what you're
talking about for all you know,

1474
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:30,090
they're just testing some
psycho fucking weaponry,

1475
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,450
you know, were looking for when the new
Yankee stadium came out and like, oh,

1476
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:39,450
eight or oh nine and they will,
like, we'd have 2013 technology.

1477
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,830
All right.

1478
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:45,830
If those fucking morons that run that
place can have shit that we're not going

1479
01:21:46,161 --> 01:21:49,650
to have, you know, they can be
four or five years ahead of us.

1480
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,390
Can you imagine what the government is?
I mean, they got to have shit from like,

1481
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:59,310
I dunno, 2014 I have no
fucking idea. I Dunno. Anyways,

1482
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:00,630
he says quite frankly,

1483
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,290
the evenings lapse would end right
after the topic was brought up.

1484
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,950
I believe in life outside of our universe
to think that we human and Oliver's in

1485
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,910
habit and so the only life
anywhere is just plain ignorant.

1486
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,490
I 100% agree with that.
Uh,

1487
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:18,900
I'm sure you've heard
stories about President Nixon
secretly showing you fos and

1488
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:22,350
aliens to his favorite
comedian Jackie Gleason. Uhh,

1489
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:26,700
that's a complete crock of shit. Uh, what
would you like? He's going to do that.

1490
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,320
All right. Now I'm know I'm
not supposed to show you the

1491
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:36,090
Arrow when we call. It was a bad
Nixon impression right there. Um,

1492
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,790
what would happen if you were
shown some stuff like that?

1493
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,690
I imagine I would immediately
be microchipped or shot
in the back of the fucking

1494
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,330
head.
Would you tell about it?

1495
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:47,970
I would want to know about that.

1496
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,360
That if I actually found out about that,

1497
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,550
it would blow my fucking mind.
I,

1498
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,423
you know what it is?

1499
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:02,740
Look maybe that maybe your Air
Force Guy Buddy that has seen some,

1500
01:23:02,741 --> 01:23:05,770
because I would say that like all
converse. No, but you know what,

1501
01:23:05,771 --> 01:23:07,510
he laughs right up until that moment.

1502
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,760
If he wasn't laughing at all throughout
all your conversation, then I would,

1503
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:16,060
I would believe it more because I
know if I knew some shit like that.

1504
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:17,400
Okay.

1505
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,650
And then I would sit there and listening
to people talking about God and Holy

1506
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:25,130
Shit that we believe down here that
didn't include aliens. I would,

1507
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,730
I would feel like a fucking alien.

1508
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:28,110
Okay.

1509
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:30,450
Cause that would be like, ah,
yeah, we're just a speck of dust.

1510
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,330
They are people and there's all
this other stuff out there and uh,

1511
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:41,210
yeah, I mean it would drive me
nuts after awhile. Um, yeah. No,

1512
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:45,800
I'm not cut out for that fucking, uh, the
kind of secrets I can keep our like, uh,

1513
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,023
you know,

1514
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,110
you know,
it stays in the locker room kind of shit.

1515
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,053
You know what I mean?

1516
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:57,920
You live your life or you want to
fucking live your life, you know,

1517
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,160
and until like if you're a look,

1518
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,520
if you porn shit into the water supply,
you know,

1519
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,750
if you're dealing with stuff like that,

1520
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:09,920
if you fucking vandalizing
the neighborhood I live
in, then go fuck yourself.

1521
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,360
All right. But you know the
other bullshit, I looked
the other way, but if the,

1522
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:18,370
if I knew there was fucking aliens,
yeah,

1523
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:21,910
no does look up to fucking stupid.
There's no way they would tell it to me.

1524
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:25,540
If I was in the air force. How far into
the air force you think I would get?

1525
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:28,030
Do you think I'd get anywhere beyond
the guy with the two sticks guide in the

1526
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:28,864
fucking plane and

1527
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:34,030
no.
Okay.

1528
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:43,130
[inaudible]

1529
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,960
Hey, what's up? It's a bill.

1530
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,910
Um, and this is the Monday
morning podcast. Hey, what's up?

1531
01:25:13,911 --> 01:25:17,750
This is build bar, you know, like,
it's going to be somebody else.

1532
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,130
On my own, my space page. Would you
guys be disappointed if I did that?

1533
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:25,760
If I suddenly got an assistant,
you know,

1534
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,590
the fuck would get an assistant for a
podcast. All right, this is the deal.

1535
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:33,320
This is the Monday morning podcast.
If you're new to my page,

1536
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,520
I do one of these every single Monday.
People send me questions,

1537
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:41,300
they send me lists of stuff that
they feel is overrated or underrated.

1538
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:47,100
They correct me when they feel that I
say fucked up shit. And sometimes the,

1539
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:51,380
that causes an argument
between listeners and um, yeah,

1540
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,340
so it's going to be a very
subdued bill burr on this podcast.

1541
01:25:56,341 --> 01:26:00,170
And you notice my voice is a little bit
lower than it usually is that a lot of

1542
01:26:00,171 --> 01:26:02,900
screaming,
yelling this weekend at Caroline's comedy.

1543
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:06,230
And uh,

1544
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:12,220
I'm going to go see ACDC tonight at the
La Forum and then tomorrow morning I

1545
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:15,830
have to get up early because
I'm shooting something.

1546
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:20,990
So I got this weird thing where I'm
going to ACDC but I can't start screaming

1547
01:26:20,991 --> 01:26:25,700
and yelling, you know, so I
don't know what I'm going to do.

1548
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:28,870
What am I doing? They stopped playing
the Jack. Am I going to lip sync?

1549
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:33,680
I'll do it like Brittany Spears and I'll
put my fucking finger up to my ear and

1550
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:36,290
act like I'm trying to hit
that note. You know? Um,

1551
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:40,400
I have a fucking crazy week and,
um,

1552
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,960
I'm at the age now where I'm going to
start drinking tea with a little bit of

1553
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:49,961
honey in it before every one of my shows
because I don't what happens when I get

1554
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:50,901
tired.

1555
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:55,070
I start yelling from my throat rather
from down below where it's supposed to be

1556
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:59,450
coming from. And I fucking
shred my voice a little bit. So,

1557
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:00,710
um,

1558
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:03,710
I really hope you're not new to my podcast
because that was one of the fucking

1559
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:05,630
most boring minutes of my podcast,

1560
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:08,470
I think in the history of
my podcasts as credible.

1561
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,040
Why don't you fucking dropped the energy
through the God damn floor and let us

1562
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:16,710
hear about your medical problems. It
was really fucking awful. But, um,

1563
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:21,230
yeah, so I got a huge week. I'm going to
go see. Yeah, ACDC. And then later on,

1564
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:26,000
you know, I'm shooting some bullshit
this week. And then after that, uh,

1565
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:29,270
I'm going on a vacation,
I'm going on,

1566
01:27:29,271 --> 01:27:31,460
I'm going to go see some
hockey games up in Canada.

1567
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:36,590
Friday night I'm going to the Calgary
cannot gang a catholic connect deep

1568
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:39,800
fucking calvary flames came and I think
they're playing the Canucks, right?

1569
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:44,240
Or whereas Edmonton playing the
Canucks, oh, Calgary's playing Florida.

1570
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,740
Then I'm seeing,
uh,

1571
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,830
Edmonton versus Vancouver and
Edmonton Ed Northlands coliseum.

1572
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:55,490
And then I go over to fucking Vancouver.
And um,

1573
01:27:56,210 --> 01:28:00,470
if you're from up there and if
you're from Alberta or the, uh,

1574
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:04,700
British Columbia and you can recommend
some bars for me to hit before or after

1575
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:08,680
the games, let me know. Um, and uh,

1576
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,490
if you know some convenient hotels,

1577
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:14,360
that won't rape me because I've yet to
get a fucking hotel. Typical fucking guy.

1578
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:19,400
I got the tickets first and then I'm
dealing with all sorts of food and hotel

1579
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:24,080
shit later, which means basically I'll
get to the airport and I'll be like, oh,

1580
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:27,830
what the fuck am I staying? Oh,
there's a super rate. I'm sorry.

1581
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,950
There were all booked up.
What do you mean you were all booked up?

1582
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:36,370
He had the fucking Alberta rough riders
of whatever fucking CFL team that I've

1583
01:28:37,071 --> 01:28:40,640
never heard of is in town
playing for the Grey Cup.

1584
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,940
I really don't know shit about Canada.
My biggest,

1585
01:28:43,941 --> 01:28:46,430
the only thing I don't like about this
trip was I was hoping to drive from

1586
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:48,800
Edmonton over to Vancouver,
but I just,

1587
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:51,290
it would just take forever because
you've got to go through those mountains.

1588
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:54,770
But I wanted to go through them.
I want to see, you know, uh,

1589
01:28:55,970 --> 01:29:00,310
what toothless rednecks look like in a
what mountain men looked like in, in uh,

1590
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,690
Canada. And then, you know,
when you go to shit like that,

1591
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:06,330
she ended up seeing an animal you never
seen before and the fucking freaks you

1592
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:08,940
out.
You feel like Magellan or some shit.

1593
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,970
Like I'm on one time I was driving through
Wyoming and I don't know what these

1594
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:12,571
animals are,

1595
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:17,130
but they look like good sales antelopes
they look like some shit you'd see on

1596
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:17,964
the Serengeti.

1597
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:23,400
And I saw one and I started
freaking freaking out by myself,

1598
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:26,760
screaming, pointing at it as
I was driving by screaming,

1599
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:31,761
what the fuck is that like something or
something was going to like the universe

1600
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:35,730
was going to answer me. I just go,
what the fuck is that? What the fuck?

1601
01:29:35,731 --> 01:29:37,600
And I looked over at the guy,
you know,

1602
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:40,860
I was kind of passing and he wasn't
even looking at it. And I'm like, why?

1603
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:45,060
You know, he's not even excited
about do with that fucking thing.

1604
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:45,894
What does that thing?

1605
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,160
And then I went over the hill and then
there was a whole herd of them and I was

1606
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:53,610
like, oh, that's why that guy's not
excited. These are like dead pigeons.

1607
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,160
He doesn't give a fuck.
You probably annoyed by him.

1608
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:58,080
He's probably stepped in
this shit at some point.

1609
01:29:58,081 --> 01:30:00,150
His life maybe even fell
down at the bus stop.

1610
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:04,380
First Day of school sneakers and have
a clean again. He got a bad nickname.

1611
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:09,630
It comes old. Uh, you know,
Allie fucking antelope, shit,

1612
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,220
you know,

1613
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:14,430
some sort of alliteration that remont
red fucking went along with whatever kind

1614
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:15,510
of animal that once,
you know,

1615
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:19,050
and then that name just sticks and it
actually affects the level of policy that

1616
01:30:19,051 --> 01:30:21,510
you're going to get, you know?
And he always told himself,

1617
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:23,490
I'm getting the fuck out of this state,
man.

1618
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,020
I'm getting the fuck out of this state.

1619
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:29,070
How the hell am I going to get laid with
antelope? Shit is a fucking nickname.

1620
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:33,960
You know, it's not going to happen. I
need to go south. I need to go to Greeley,

1621
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:38,460
Colorado. And even if I'm
called fucking antelope shit,

1622
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:43,350
the smell from that slaughterhouse
down there, nobody's going to care.

1623
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,770
Nobody that greatly.
And it Kenny Colorado listeners,

1624
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,390
this is the Shit I learned on the, on.
I go on the road in Greeley, Colorado,

1625
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:54,630
they have this huge
slaughterhouse up there and uh,

1626
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:58,830
it lingers in the air and some days
when they killed too many fucking,

1627
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:03,240
they slaughter too many. Uh, whatever
the fuck they, I guess steer.

1628
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:07,680
Um,
people actually call up,

1629
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:10,980
they call bad smell days and then they
call up the the slaughterhouse and said,

1630
01:31:10,981 --> 01:31:15,000
Hey, can you, can you fucking lay off?
Can you lay off to slaughter a little bit?

1631
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,160
And I don't know what they do with
the count. Like one Mississippi,

1632
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:21,480
maybe they choke out of pheasant.
Speaking of stairs,

1633
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:24,620
I was in New York City last week and Oh,

1634
01:31:24,621 --> 01:31:26,860
and if you don't know where
to steer is a steer is a,

1635
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:31,860
I believe it's a bowl with no balls
and something else I learned when I was

1636
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,240
driving on the road. I'm like, all
right, that's a cow. That's a bowl.

1637
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:37,140
What the fuck is that? Someone's
like a steer. I'm like,

1638
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:39,600
what the fuck has this stare? And
they told me, he said that's a bold,

1639
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:44,100
doesn't know his balls. And
unlike what, why is that?

1640
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,230
And I think it had to do
something with hamburgers.

1641
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,020
I think that's what it is.
I think that's how they make beef.

1642
01:31:52,021 --> 01:31:54,360
They have both fuck cows.
I'm going to be wrong here.

1643
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,400
I think the bowls fuck the cows.

1644
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:01,120
And then they used the cows give
birth and it's either a cow or a bull,

1645
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:06,700
but you know, if they want to
make the bowl, the hamburger
meat or steak, you know,

1646
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:11,350
they cut his balls off and he
just stands around like, oh great,

1647
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:17,050
you know, like that fucking unfunny
caveman and those Geico commercials,

1648
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:21,790
those Geico commercials don't even
make sense anymore. He's like, oh,

1649
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:25,720
I get it. You know something, something.

1650
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,500
But I get it and he walks away. It's
like, you know what dude? I don't get it.

1651
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:32,230
I don't get it.
I don't get the whole fucking thing.

1652
01:32:32,231 --> 01:32:35,650
I don't get how there's some
hot chick giving you attention.

1653
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:39,250
And then she has a Geico key chain
and you, you can't handle that.

1654
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:40,720
I can save if you're a woman,

1655
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:44,260
that would be a deal breaker because you'd
have control over your fucking pussy.

1656
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,080
But if you're a guy you don't
have control over your Dick.

1657
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:51,310
So you know what I mean? She could
actually do wearing a fuck cavemen.

1658
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:55,450
I hate fucking cavemen tee shirt, but if
she wasn't wearing a bra, it'd be like,

1659
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:57,910
all right, well, you
know, simple equation.

1660
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:02,440
I'll just bend her over and
I'll hate fucker. So anyway,

1661
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:03,850
so I'm in a New York City,

1662
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:09,820
I'm in New York and all somebody asked me
that day after you say something funny,

1663
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:12,520
what is that clicking noise?
I Dunno if I'm just on a bad phone.

1664
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:16,670
It's probably me laughing. I don't think
it sounds like clicking noises. Um,

1665
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,530
anyways, Jesus Christ's they'll
get to the fucking point.

1666
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:25,360
So I'm in New York City and I'm
working Carolines and a buddy of mine,

1667
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:28,190
uh, always goes to the steak
steakhouse, Smith and Lewinsky. Uh,

1668
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:32,920
Willinsky some 49th and third is like,
yeah, there's a guy that works up there.

1669
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:37,690
He's a big fanny stuff. You should come
by and you know, I'm like, fuck yeah,

1670
01:33:37,691 --> 01:33:41,060
definitely. I'll go up there. You
know, I love going to steak houses.

1671
01:33:41,061 --> 01:33:43,990
That's one of the few places you
can actually feel like a man.

1672
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,010
It's like old school,
you know, you fucking,

1673
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,740
it's like classy. You're not like
a, it's not like that hacky shit.

1674
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:54,600
You know what I mean? Like, you know,

1675
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:57,610
these punks who sit there and they
watch a couple of rat pack videos,

1676
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,720
then they go out and they buy themselves
a suit and they start walking around

1677
01:34:01,721 --> 01:34:06,721
thinking that they're recreating the
rat pack when there's just something too

1678
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:09,640
glossy about the way they're doing it.
You know,

1679
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:12,880
I don't know if it's their manicured
eyebrows or wherever the fuck guys are

1680
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:15,220
doing nowadays, but they did.
They can't fucking pull it off.

1681
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:16,750
But when you're going into those,

1682
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,900
those steak houses that
had been there for awhile,

1683
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:21,190
they got a lot of waiters
who've been there forever.

1684
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:26,191
So they organically bring that vibe
and you raise up to their level,

1685
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:32,200
you know what I mean? To come to the
table. They have the females order first,

1686
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:36,930
that old school class. Classy Shit. You
know, I dunno. I like it. So anyway,

1687
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:40,360
so like fucking go in there and you guys,
if you've been listening to my podcast,

1688
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:44,450
you know, whenever I get sick,
I, uh, imitate that guy. Um,

1689
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:49,870
a ray Winston from, uh, when stone
or whatever from fucking sexy beast,

1690
01:34:49,871 --> 01:34:53,930
my favorite movie ever. You
know, the beginning of the
movie where he's like, Eh,

1691
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:56,463
I'm sweating

1692
01:34:57,940 --> 01:35:02,070
roasted bacon boiling.

1693
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:07,490
It's like a sauna. That
bullshit. I fucking loved that
movie as my favorite movie.

1694
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:11,660
So I'm in this fucking steak house and
I look over and I'm looking at this

1695
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:15,110
fucking guy and I can tell he's somebody,
but he's got these big,

1696
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:16,700
I'm a producer glasses on.

1697
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,600
I thought it was Mickey worked for half
a fucking second cause I'm real bad at

1698
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:25,280
that shit. And uh, and with like,

1699
01:35:25,281 --> 01:35:27,650
you know my girl and a couple other
people and they look over, they go,

1700
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:28,640
that's fucking,

1701
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:32,710
that's your boy there from the
movie that's fucking now wedding.

1702
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:34,820
And I don't know what happened.
A little hung over, sorry.

1703
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:40,120
He goes out to have a cigarette or a
fag is they call an ace fucking standing

1704
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:44,510
out there and he's out there
with fucking teddy bass.

1705
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:49,430
Mr. Black Magic. Fucking what's
his face? He and Mccallum.

1706
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:53,030
Is that his name? I'm so bad with, I'm
watching that movie fucking 900 times.

1707
01:35:53,031 --> 01:35:55,940
I stole another God damn names.
He's standing there and the director,

1708
01:35:55,941 --> 01:36:00,080
all his shit. And, uh, I was like,

1709
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:02,270
you gotta be fucking kidding
me. So my buddies, like,

1710
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:04,940
we gotta go out there and we got to get
them, we got to get a picture with them.

1711
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:08,120
And I'm like, Nah, man, I'm not
going to bug those guys. I saw him.

1712
01:36:08,121 --> 01:36:12,290
That's enough for me. I see him, I'm not
going to bug them. And he's like, dude,

1713
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:17,150
you fucking kidding me. You
fucking kidding me. That's
not like it's, it's fucking,

1714
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:22,010
uh, Ashton Kutcher. Those
are real fucking, you know,

1715
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:25,040
great actors. The guy was in the fucking
depart. It stopped being a Douche.

1716
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:26,340
Let's go.
So I said fuck.

1717
01:36:26,341 --> 01:36:30,420
And I went out there and they ended
up being in a hot shit and they were,

1718
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,470
I guess there's another sexy
beast coming out. I Dunno.

1719
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:37,180
They will fucking cool as
hell. And uh, I don't know.

1720
01:36:37,181 --> 01:36:41,060
I'm going to post the picture on
it at some point up on my website,

1721
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:44,990
but I got to meet like half the cast
from sexy beast and I ate a steak.

1722
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:48,740
You know what I mean?
Fucking doesn't get any better than that.

1723
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:51,920
It's like one of those old Milwaukee
brew commercials and now, right.

1724
01:36:51,921 --> 01:36:55,670
There's no other fucking those commercials
when it doesn't get any better than

1725
01:36:55,671 --> 01:37:00,500
this or was that Bush, you know, it
doesn't get any better than this.

1726
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,620
You know, we're a bunch of
guys. There's no broads around.

1727
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:06,800
We're sitting in the woods. How could
I not get any better than that? Well,

1728
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:10,820
because basically I think we've gotten
enough pussy in our lives and now we just

1729
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:12,110
find females irritating.

1730
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,750
That's the only way I could ever make
any sense out of that commercial.

1731
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,520
Cause other than that,
you're outside.

1732
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:20,870
You shouldn't in the woods
in this mosquitoes. And uh,
she there with five guys,

1733
01:37:20,871 --> 01:37:23,960
you know, one of them you didn't want to
come along, but someone else liked them.

1734
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:27,560
Yeah. Which is probably why
you're drinking. All right,

1735
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:30,860
let's get one with the questions
for this week. The subdued podcasts,

1736
01:37:30,861 --> 01:37:33,770
the easy listening podcast here and now

1737
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,690
behave. I'm paying for your meal.
All right, question number one, Bill.

1738
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:41,000
If you've died in some fucked up,

1739
01:37:41,001 --> 01:37:46,001
but still really funny way if you died
in some relief and some fucked up,

1740
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:47,090
but really funny way.

1741
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,480
How long do you think it would be before
your other comedian friends would start

1742
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:57,390
busting your balls either in own
standup act? So just in public,

1743
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,640
even though that would be kind of comfy.

1744
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:04,200
How long til that fucking too
soon period was over? Well,

1745
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:07,770
if I'm dead, I don't think that they
would be able to break my balls,

1746
01:38:07,771 --> 01:38:10,380
but I know what you mean.
Um,

1747
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:15,090
I would say pretty much
after a day and a half,

1748
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:20,510
someone would make the first joke and
a then it would just be open season

1749
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:25,440
because then the other comics would
try to top what the other comic said.

1750
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:29,100
And, uh, I dunno, outsiders
would view that as insensitive,

1751
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:32,880
but I've always been fascinated how
people don't realize that, you know,

1752
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:36,270
comedians always have a joke no matter
what the tragedy is and they think it's

1753
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:39,780
because comedians are
insensitive assholes. I mean,

1754
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:41,430
there is an element of truth to that,

1755
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:46,431
but I'm making a joke when something
bad happened is also a way,

1756
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:51,420
uh, it's like a defensive mechanism where
you like, oh my God, I'm feeling sad.

1757
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:54,840
I don't want to feel this feeling. And
then you just say something ridiculous.

1758
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:58,710
Everybody laughs. It gets rid of
the tension. You know, it's not,

1759
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:02,580
they don't give a fuck, but, uh, sometimes
they don't. And I got to have made,

1760
01:39:02,581 --> 01:39:04,800
if I did die in a really stupid way,
uh,

1761
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:08,790
I would be disappointed if people didn't,
uh,

1762
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,510
you know,
trashed me till the end of the time

1763
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:15,510
at Jesus Christ.
What?

1764
01:39:15,511 --> 01:39:18,620
I'm trying to think of a stupid waste
of die and I don't want to do that for

1765
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:22,860
fucking chinks of myself. All right.
Question number two, pay bill.

1766
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:25,860
I've been wanting to get into
standup since I was 20 years old.

1767
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,980
I've been a huge pussy
for the past three years,

1768
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,270
so I've just been writing jokes and not
performing them because I'm too scared

1769
01:39:33,271 --> 01:39:37,350
to go through with it.
Eventually I'm gonna man up and do it.

1770
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:42,540
But now I have the problem of having
a three year stockpile of jokes.

1771
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:48,050
How do I decide which ones to do for
my five minutes at the stress factory?

1772
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,980
Um, I don't know. I would tick, you know,

1773
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:57,420
some shit euro recently cause I figure
you've been writing for three years.

1774
01:39:57,421 --> 01:39:58,860
You probably just getting better at it.

1775
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:01,950
And plus if you're doing topical material,

1776
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:06,210
I don't think anybody gives a shit about,
uh,

1777
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,300
I dunno what was topical three years ago?

1778
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,860
2008 minus 2005. Oh, what's up with John?

1779
01:40:13,861 --> 01:40:17,200
Kerry is guy's face.
He's lugging it to fuck a peak.

1780
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,150
[inaudible]

1781
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,520
this guy knows what I'm talking about.

1782
01:40:23,521 --> 01:40:27,690
Asking you back me up now to just fucking
don't put that pressure on yourself.

1783
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:31,260
Just write five minutes to ship that you
think is funny the first time you go on

1784
01:40:31,261 --> 01:40:31,711
stage.

1785
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:35,430
I always tell this to people has nothing
to do with how good or bad you do.

1786
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:38,730
It's just all about having the balls to
go up there when they call your name,

1787
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:42,300
worry about what the fuck you're doing.
You know,

1788
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:46,650
after you've done it two, three times,
you know what I mean? Then start to,

1789
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,910
you know, cause you know you're
literally, you just jump in the deep end.

1790
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:53,680
He just tried to swim to the side.
You know,

1791
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:55,900
just make it to the end of his set it.
Don't worry about it.

1792
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:00,310
Don't worry about it seriously too and
just always know the worst you bomb,

1793
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:04,090
the better the story is. That's
it. When comedians sit around,

1794
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:06,010
we don't tell stories
about killing me talk.

1795
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:10,930
We sit around talking about the
night we ate our balls in front of a,

1796
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,470
I dunno,

1797
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:15,100
a bunch of navy seals that have corporate
party on a battleship or some dumb

1798
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:18,340
shit. I don't fuck it. You'll
be fine. You'll be fine.

1799
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:22,140
Just grabbed the mic and fucking talk
about what you think is funny and if you'd

1800
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:22,571
bombs,

1801
01:41:22,571 --> 01:41:25,990
just make fun of yourself and then tell
people to go fuck themselves and say

1802
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:30,310
thank you. Good night.
That's my first set advice.

1803
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,950
All right, number three. Hey Bill.

1804
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:37,980
Lately I haven't been flexing a ton of
girth and the flux autometer and my house

1805
01:41:38,681 --> 01:41:42,790
keeps going off. I think this is a
vaguely sort of a Dick joke here.

1806
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,690
Any tips for keeping my girth
more stealth when I flex it?

1807
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:51,010
Maybe a stealth flex or flex silencer.

1808
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,470
Any idea if these products exist?

1809
01:41:53,471 --> 01:41:57,250
So do you have any other tips
so that I can flex more quietly?

1810
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,320
I'm just trying to flex my girth more
stealth, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Well,

1811
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:05,740
you've got to stop wearing those fucking,
you know,

1812
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:10,150
Joey Ramone genes where people know
exactly how excited you are. You know,

1813
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:12,580
I would go more with some a 50 cent,

1814
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:16,430
what does he rough rider or whatever
the fuck his policies called. Yeah.

1815
01:42:16,431 --> 01:42:20,100
It just gets your, get
some different genes. Yes.

1816
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:21,700
Stop back like you were in the strokes,
you know,

1817
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:26,140
fucking loosen up your genes and you
can have a full on fucking woody and no

1818
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:26,980
one's ever going to know.

1819
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:32,010
Definitely do not wear sweat
pants and a or a short shorts.

1820
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:37,750
You know, sitting down also helps,
especially if you're at a desk.

1821
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:42,550
Other than that you and your
girth and run your own. All right.

1822
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:45,760
You see that she knew my podcast.
She liked the wide variety of questions.

1823
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,440
Anyways, question number four. Hey Bill,

1824
01:42:50,441 --> 01:42:54,640
do you think the media has ever treated
Donovan Donovan McNabb fairly. I mean,

1825
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:57,610
the guys put up great stats over
the years and led his team to,

1826
01:42:57,611 --> 01:43:00,500
for NFC championships and won Superbowl.

1827
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,620
It every year he gets
bashed for something.

1828
01:43:02,621 --> 01:43:06,010
Why does the media go after
the idiots of the league?

1829
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,540
Why doesn't immediate go after the idiots
of the league instead of players who

1830
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:15,340
stay out of trouble? Uh, I don't know.
You know what? I honestly don't know.

1831
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:18,250
I didn't know Donovan Mad
got more shit than usual.

1832
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:22,480
I know that fat Jack Ass from the
radio trashed him that one time.

1833
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:27,370
And I know tio gave him shit, but I
always looked at Donovan that he was a,

1834
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:32,530
he's a professional, handle this shit.
Well never throws a temper tantrum and uh,

1835
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:38,860
I dunno, it might have to do with, uh,
Philly fans. You know, they got that,

1836
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:44,680
they got that short fuse. I Dunno,
you know, something. I don't know.

1837
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:49,210
I never looked at Dunham McNabb
like he was treated unfairly and no,

1838
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:51,230
I guess,
uh,

1839
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:55,570
he just had a couple of really high
profile douchebags give him shit and a

1840
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:59,540
really bad way and uh, you
know, he handled it well.

1841
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:02,240
He never really lashed out back.
He just was like, Hey, you know,

1842
01:44:02,241 --> 01:44:05,630
that's what they're, so what they're
doing. I'm going to go get some soup.

1843
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,270
You know? I don't know. That was the
worst fucking answer have I have,

1844
01:44:10,271 --> 01:44:14,420
I have no idea. I don't fucking know. I
have no idea. But thank you for asking.

1845
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:15,351
Thank you for thinking.

1846
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:19,220
I actually could answer that question
intelligently and thank you for exposing

1847
01:44:19,221 --> 01:44:23,660
me on how fucking ignorant I am on
the whole Donovan McNabb crisis. Okay.

1848
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:25,430
Question number five.
Hey Bill,

1849
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:30,350
I've been listening to your podcast
for about half, half year now.

1850
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:34,280
Bout it should say a half,
about a half a year. Now.

1851
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,510
I don't think you've ever addressed
this. Okay. What does that jerk off? Oh,

1852
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:40,030
this is the question.
What is,

1853
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:44,600
what does that jerk off slash rapid
tapping noise you make just after you met?

1854
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:49,040
Make a salient point or a
particularly funny joke.

1855
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:51,260
For some reason that sound grates on me.

1856
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,340
Like somebody raking their
teeth on a blackboard. You know,

1857
01:44:55,341 --> 01:44:56,960
I never listened to my podcast.

1858
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:01,520
I think it's just me laughing and I have
a shitty cell phone so maybe it doesn't

1859
01:45:01,521 --> 01:45:05,510
pick it up right? I don't have no fucking
idea. What? I'm sorry. A grates on you.

1860
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:09,890
Like somebody's raking their teeth
on a blackboard. Jesus Christ.

1861
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:12,560
Fucking brutal image. All
right, now I'm self conscious.

1862
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:17,330
I won't ever laugh again
during my podcasts. Is that
what you do? Huh? You know,

1863
01:45:17,331 --> 01:45:20,690
you walk around miserable and you tried
to suck the joy out other people's lives.

1864
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:21,531
You know,

1865
01:45:21,531 --> 01:45:23,930
I think it's time you might want to
sit down in the mirror and you know,

1866
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:27,380
take a little stock in yourself.
All right, question number six.

1867
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:30,920
I don't know what it is. Dude. I have no
idea and I'm not going to look into it,

1868
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:35,570
so I don't know what to tell you.
Um, question number six. Hey belt.

1869
01:45:35,571 --> 01:45:37,400
First off,
great job in the podcast.

1870
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:42,180
I think it's cool that you're using this
technology to spread more predictable

1871
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:47,270
mediocrity.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1872
01:45:47,271 --> 01:45:50,200
I'm getting trashed. Let me read that
again so you guys can enjoy that pounding.

1873
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:53,000
That was funny. All right. First
off, great job in the podcast.

1874
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:58,040
I think it's cool that you use technology
to spread more predictable mediocrity

1875
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:01,130
than would have been ever
been possible 10 years ago.

1876
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:06,230
Guilty as charged fucking son of a bitch.
Second question second.

1877
01:46:06,231 --> 01:46:09,410
Here's the question.
When should I shave my head?

1878
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:13,970
I note that you have dealt with the old
receding hairline by trying your damn

1879
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:18,560
this to look like Billy Corgan.
Jesus Christ.

1880
01:46:18,561 --> 01:46:19,730
I'm getting roasted here.

1881
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:25,020
I suffer from the same affliction and
my plan is to sort of keep cutting it

1882
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:29,030
shorter and shorter until
eventually take it to the scalp.

1883
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:33,080
My hairline is about three and a half
inches from my eyebrows now and I'm using

1884
01:46:33,081 --> 01:46:35,570
the number four God on the clippers.
Any suggestion?

1885
01:46:35,571 --> 01:46:38,090
I think he got the right idea.
You know what,

1886
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:42,080
and I applaud you for man and
up not doing that. Rogaine crap.

1887
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:43,780
You know?

1888
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:48,080
Or having some hair yanked out of the
back of your scalp and stapled on top of

1889
01:46:48,081 --> 01:46:50,070
your fucking head,
you know,

1890
01:46:50,071 --> 01:46:54,270
man up like fucking telly
Savalas you know, I dunno.

1891
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,830
I Dunno. I Dunno what to tell you.
Yeah. As it gets shorter and shorter,

1892
01:46:58,831 --> 01:47:02,070
you just keep cutting it down. I don't
know why guys go through all that. I,

1893
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:03,930
you know, I've actually heard
when people get hair plugs,

1894
01:47:03,931 --> 01:47:08,880
it can actually still continue to fall
out and I eat now you can't shave your

1895
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:13,740
head because you've got this Frankenstein
scar in the back of your head.

1896
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,780
This guy I know who will remain nameless,
he recently got a hair transplant.

1897
01:47:18,781 --> 01:47:22,920
I never knew what the fucking
difference between hair plugs and a hair

1898
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:25,830
transplant,
but evidently a hair transplant,

1899
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:30,860
they literally cut a swag one inch long
on the back of your head and take all

1900
01:47:33,691 --> 01:47:36,390
that hair out. And that's what they
use to put on top of your head.

1901
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:39,750
And I guess the skin on your
scouts a little bit loose.

1902
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:43,720
So then what they do with, now
that you got that one inch, um,

1903
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:47,010
stretch your skin.
Now the back of your head,

1904
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:51,840
they basically then push the skin
together and then they sew it shut.

1905
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,300
And uh,
I don't know about you,

1906
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:57,600
but that sounds pretty fucking terrific
when you can basically shave your head

1907
01:47:57,601 --> 01:47:59,040
and about three,
I don't know,

1908
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,420
three minutes she'd done silver
and people look at you like,

1909
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:04,620
what the fuck for two minutes.

1910
01:48:04,621 --> 01:48:08,460
And then they can't remember you the
other way unless you have a half hour HBO

1911
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:11,730
special that reoccurs every
fucking six months. Um,

1912
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:16,230
okay. Anyways, this is
the rest of it. He says,

1913
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:22,510
I've been listening to you since you
first parents on our own Hay and I got to

1914
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:24,150
see you live in Houston.
Atlanta.

1915
01:48:24,151 --> 01:48:27,990
I liked your comedy and I'm pulling for
you to blow up even bigger next time in

1916
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:30,810
your Atlanta. If you still want
to know how to use a shotgun,

1917
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:34,320
I'll teach you what I know.
Apps, the fucking lovely.

1918
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,890
See that guy's odd shit. See that guy's
an old school guy and see what he did.

1919
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:39,000
He broke my balls.

1920
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:42,750
Gimme a couple of good jabs to the
face and he slaps me on the back. Hey,

1921
01:48:42,751 --> 01:48:44,220
just fucking with you.
I like your comedy.

1922
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,290
Let me teach you how to
shoot a gun right there.

1923
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:51,240
I bet that guy eats in a steak house.
All right, question number seven a bell.

1924
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:56,490
I've been listening to your podcasts ever
since you did a show at Embry riddle,

1925
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:02,160
that shitty little aviation school
in Arizona. I like that place.

1926
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:07,140
I liked it. I was fascinated by the level
of intelligence that you guys actually,

1927
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,880
literally, you literally
had rocket science to there.
Right? And you guys knew,

1928
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:15,870
understood about fucking arrows,
space science,

1929
01:49:15,871 --> 01:49:20,810
technology fucking thing. I don't know
what it was. I was blown away by. Um, God,

1930
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:21,930
I'm a moron. All right. Um,

1931
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:26,730
you've mentioned that you're a big sports
fan and that you have the NHL package

1932
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,350
as a fellow hockey fan.

1933
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:32,460
Do you feel the national coverage
that pro hockey gets is fair?

1934
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:36,270
I see highlights on sports center
that lasts about 30 seconds.

1935
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,860
They'd rather talk about dumb,

1936
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:42,550
pointless shit like tls comments after
a game and talk about it for 30 minutes.

1937
01:49:42,551 --> 01:49:46,380
So show pro bowling or women's college
volleyball and, and give you a pro hockey.

1938
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:52,050
I'm more than a minute of their time.
What, what's the deal with that? Um,

1939
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:55,990
all right, there's a lot of
questions in there. Um, let's see.

1940
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:56,980
Let's get back to these.

1941
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,940
Do I feel the national coverage
that pro hockey gets is fair?

1942
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,390
Um, yeah, I do.

1943
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:09,240
Because I think hockey is a rogue
sport and I like it like that. I,

1944
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:14,280
I liked that it's not at the same level
of disgusting exposure that hockey,

1945
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:17,980
baseball and basketball are at.
Um,

1946
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:22,510
because I think that those three sports
suffer from them just trying to cross

1947
01:50:22,511 --> 01:50:27,511
pollinate and cross promote and just
make people who aren't into sports watch

1948
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:33,931
sports and people who watch sports
and don't give a fuck about the Jonas

1949
01:50:34,631 --> 01:50:39,631
brothers watched the Jonas brothers play
at halftime or Brittany Spears or any

1950
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:44,620
of that other shit or those dumb TV shows
they try to promote during the games.

1951
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:49,540
Just trying to have that orgy of
horse shit that they always try to do.

1952
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:53,950
I can't stand that shit. So I liked it.
Nobody likes hockey. I really like it.

1953
01:50:53,951 --> 01:50:58,930
And I liked the, um, I like that people
don't get why people fight in hockey.

1954
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:02,500
Um,
I love all of that shit.

1955
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:07,060
I just think it's a great fucking game
and I think it deserves to be up in

1956
01:51:07,061 --> 01:51:11,260
Canada and in the north northern part
of this country and people who give the

1957
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:11,830
get it,

1958
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:16,660
watch it and those who don't can ask
their same little faggy questions of,

1959
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,390
you know,
I ain't just so you know,

1960
01:51:19,391 --> 01:51:21,370
the fighting and the
fighting is so fucking great.

1961
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,520
Every other sports there's
such an unbelievable level
of shit talking that you

1962
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:30,070
can get away with. Cause the second
people start throwing punches,

1963
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:33,640
you'll hold teammate jumps in. You know
what I mean? It was like back in the day,

1964
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:36,820
if you had to fight some kid after
school and you knew you were going to get

1965
01:51:36,821 --> 01:51:37,654
your ass kicked,

1966
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:41,170
the best move you could make was start
swinging in the hallways because the

1967
01:51:41,171 --> 01:51:45,310
teachers were going to run out and break
it up before anything ever happened.

1968
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:47,890
And by then you're down the office
and they say, if you guys fight again,

1969
01:51:47,891 --> 01:51:50,590
we're going to fucking expel you.
And now you've got your out.

1970
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:54,220
That's what those other three sports are.
You know what I mean? You have a seat.

1971
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:55,960
The basketball players try to fight.

1972
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:00,010
They throw punches like they're trying
to throw somebody out from the fucking

1973
01:52:00,011 --> 01:52:02,700
warning track of three rivers stadium.

1974
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:07,750
They throw like that dead Dave Parker
overhand right. I saw shat through that.

1975
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:11,350
He threw eat, fucking eat through
it. Like I'm in a long time ago,

1976
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:14,110
said Damon Wayans imitating
a big black girl fighting.

1977
01:52:14,111 --> 01:52:17,440
And that's the way Shaq threw a punch.
He fucking,

1978
01:52:17,441 --> 01:52:21,240
it was pathetic and he missed the guy.
Any fucking missed them.

1979
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:26,230
Um, you know, I love
hockey. If you're a cunt,

1980
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:30,010
you get the shit kicked out of you and
the guy only has to sit down for five

1981
01:52:30,011 --> 01:52:34,270
minutes for the simple fact
that he beat up a con. You know,

1982
01:52:34,271 --> 01:52:37,690
I don't understand why it's so difficult
to understand. You know, there's boxing.

1983
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:42,560
Boxing is a sport and
that is fighting and um,

1984
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:46,580
hockey, part of the sport is
fighting. That's a part of the sport.

1985
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:51,470
If you don't like it, watch diving
or something else. All right.

1986
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:55,370
I totally got off track there. Um,
why do I do? Um, and also, you know,

1987
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:56,190
something I liked the,

1988
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:59,570
I think ESPN doesn't show it because
they lost their contract with the NHL,

1989
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:03,170
so they're kind of pissed about
it. So they're like, fine,

1990
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:07,940
we're trying to have our little new world
order monopoly on all sports and you

1991
01:53:07,941 --> 01:53:10,910
don't want to play ball, so fuck
you. We won't show your highlights.

1992
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,420
So instead they show nine hours of poker.

1993
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,600
Is there anybody really
watching that anymore?

1994
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:20,240
That shit was literally fascinating
for like the first six months and then,

1995
01:53:20,241 --> 01:53:23,000
you know, now I don't
give a shit, you know,

1996
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:28,900
until this stupid nicknames and their
little fucking stupid glasses they call

1997
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:34,100
them snake has, he's out of Arizona and
he weren't fucking, I don't give a shit,

1998
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:40,790
you know, ed moneymaker, whatever the
fuck they call themselves. It's gay.

1999
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:44,330
It's really gates horrifically
out of shape people.

2000
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:49,540
And I don't give a fuck if the river
cards coming. Um, so there you go there.

2001
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:53,990
To answer your question, I
don't know. I don't know. Yeah.

2002
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:58,700
And Hl. We'll never get it's NHL gets the
level of exposure is fucking deserves.

2003
01:53:58,701 --> 01:54:00,740
They've tried everything
to get people into it.

2004
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:04,520
They remember that when they had that
little gay little fucking flame coming out

2005
01:54:04,521 --> 01:54:08,150
of the back of the puck for people
who couldn't see it, that didn't work.

2006
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:12,950
They tried everything and they should
just accept the fact that they are,

2007
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:14,893
you know,
just

2008
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:19,880
just be able to fuck you are stop trying
to be fucking something for everybody.

2009
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:25,580
You know those other sports. I mean the
NFL is annoying. I don't like on the NFL,

2010
01:54:25,581 --> 01:54:29,900
they're trying to fucking deliberately
make me get a dish because it keeps

2011
01:54:29,901 --> 01:54:33,200
showing cool games on Thursdays
and they won't show it to me.

2012
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,500
And let's say you have a
dish, you know, I don't,

2013
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:39,170
I don't respond to terrorism just like
this country. I do not respond to it.

2014
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:44,120
They'll fuck yourself. Sticking with
cable. Question Eight. Well what is this?

2015
01:54:44,121 --> 01:54:46,190
The last question too, by the way,
it's getting kind of long hitter.

2016
01:54:46,191 --> 01:54:49,820
What is your opinion on the
Christmas specials? On TV?

2017
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,680
My wife is like, let's watch
some Christmas specials. Well,

2018
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,090
I guess I'm supposed to do my
girl voice said my wife is like,

2019
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:00,860
let's let some Christmas special.
I can't fucking stand them all.

2020
01:55:01,130 --> 01:55:05,330
I want to shoot Santa Rudolph and
Tim Allen in the fucking head,

2021
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:09,890
but I don't, but I don't say that
cause I want to stay married also.

2022
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:12,890
What is your favorite hockey rink?
Hockey memory. I'm a big hockey fan.

2023
01:55:12,891 --> 01:55:16,070
Love the podcasts. Um, all right.

2024
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,440
What is my opinion of Christmas specials?
Um,

2025
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:20,740
I haven't watched them in 20 years
and I'm watching them Michelle,

2026
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,780
cause I'm trying to get into the
spirit and I'm actually enjoying him.

2027
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:26,000
Son of them are better than others.
Um,

2028
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:30,380
I liked the one where Burl Ives sinks
have a Holly jolly Christmas as the

2029
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:34,670
snowman. Um, I like that shit. I
actually decorated my apartment.

2030
01:55:34,671 --> 01:55:38,270
I went all out this year, so
I don't, I don't mind them,

2031
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:43,030
but if it depends on how
annoying your wife is every,

2032
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,810
if every five seconds she's like,

2033
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:51,900
then yeah, that would, that would
annoy the shit out of me. I know.

2034
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:55,530
I don't know, Dude. I don't know
what to tell you. Just fucking,

2035
01:55:55,531 --> 01:55:57,510
you know what he'd do? This
is what you do. He said, yeah,

2036
01:55:57,511 --> 01:55:58,940
let's get into the Christmas spirit.

2037
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,580
You get some eggnog and you put a bunch
of booze in it and then you'll start

2038
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:06,780
equating the Christmas specials with
boozing and not having to listen to your

2039
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:11,580
wife. And uh, maybe you'll start
looking forward to them. You know,

2040
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:16,350
they'll probably start, you know, watching
the great pumpkin in October. Okay.

2041
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:19,350
Oh wait, there was one other
fucking question I didn't get to.

2042
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,140
Somebody sent me a really good question
about the hype on Britney Spears.

2043
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:26,520
Where the fuck can I put that?

2044
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,760
What's going on here?
All right.

2045
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:35,910
Let me read some old rate on the under
and I got to find this last question real

2046
01:56:35,911 --> 01:56:38,690
quick. All right. Overweight
if number one. Um,

2047
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:42,300
I know if you knew one of
my podcast people send me
their list of shit that they

2048
01:56:42,301 --> 01:56:46,410
feel is overrated and their list of shit
that they think is underrated. Alright.

2049
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,360
Overrated.
The bcs standings.

2050
01:56:48,361 --> 01:56:53,070
Every year people complain and beg for a
playoff system. Not even our president.

2051
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:56,610
Now, even our plight president, Alexis,
we should have a playoff system.

2052
01:56:57,330 --> 01:57:01,770
Do you ever think these rich
pricks will allow it to happen? Um,

2053
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:04,990
no and I don't think they should
have a playoff system. Um,

2054
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:08,160
just for the simple fact that you can
blow out your knee and end your career and

2055
01:57:08,161 --> 01:57:12,780
they're basically playing for free other
than bullshit money that they get from a

2056
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:17,150
college boosters. Is that
what they call them? No,

2057
01:57:17,151 --> 01:57:18,480
I don't think they should play more games.

2058
01:57:18,481 --> 01:57:21,030
I liked that everybody gets all
pissed at the end of the fucking year.

2059
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:25,740
There's 9,000 fucking teams. What do
you want? They do the best they can.

2060
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,650
It works for me.
I don't care when I liked it.

2061
01:57:28,651 --> 01:57:31,560
Someone's always pissed in the end
as a nice level of controversy.

2062
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:34,140
I think they kind of have
a playoff system with bcs.

2063
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:36,720
They just need to expand it to 14.
That's all.

2064
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:40,530
And if anybody complains after that, they,
you know, they can go fuck themselves.

2065
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:44,880
They go, problem solved. Um, actually
I'm going to the Rose Bowl, this shift,

2066
01:57:44,881 --> 01:57:49,500
not bragging, but I'm going to write up
the fucking street now to NFL overtime,

2067
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:52,500
uh,
first and thinks this is overrated.

2068
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:57,150
How is it exciting scene teams when
it with the field goal in overtime?

2069
01:57:58,350 --> 01:58:02,760
How bad of a reader in my, I'm like,
how is it exciting seeing teens,

2070
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:05,340
what it with a field goal trying
to read this most smoother.

2071
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:10,710
How is it exciting seeing teams when it
with the field golden over time or even

2072
01:58:10,711 --> 01:58:13,910
tie like the eagles verse the Bangles.
Uh,

2073
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:17,190
they should take a lesson from college
football and make their overtime just

2074
01:58:17,191 --> 01:58:21,000
like there, it would be
a lot more exciting. Um,

2075
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:26,250
um, I don't know. I liked that they're
different. I really don't have a problem.

2076
01:58:26,251 --> 01:58:28,500
I don't have a problem with
college football or pro football.

2077
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:33,090
I just have a problem with the fucking
NFL trying to make me buy a dish. But,

2078
01:58:33,091 --> 01:58:33,540
um,

2079
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:36,360
I guess it would be more exciting if they
could have half a field and they just

2080
01:58:36,361 --> 01:58:41,350
keep going at it. Um, I dunno.

2081
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,240
I just think it gets
back to that thing again.

2082
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:46,810
Now you're dealing with
even older football players
and they could get the shit

2083
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:49,900
kicked out of them and blow out
there. Fucking the, I have no idea.

2084
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:53,350
You guys are really asking me a lot of
fucking, not too difficult questions,

2085
01:58:53,351 --> 01:58:58,120
but for some reason I can't fucking
answer them this week. I'll wait a second.

2086
01:58:58,121 --> 01:59:02,680
Wearing God's name was this question.
This guy sent me,

2087
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:10,480
God dammit. You know what? I
can basically paraphrase it.

2088
01:59:10,481 --> 01:59:13,420
This kid was asking me, Oh this
guy, this gentleman who was female,

2089
01:59:13,421 --> 01:59:15,940
I can't remember who wrote it,
was basically saying,

2090
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:19,360
what's with all this talk about
Brittany Spears coming back.

2091
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,820
People are actually really buying into it.

2092
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:25,240
I don't understand what the big deal is.
People were saying she's crazy.

2093
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:29,110
Just cause you shave your head,
it doesn't mean you fucking crazy.

2094
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:34,090
So I dunno. What do you think?
It's like a big media ploy.

2095
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,780
I have no idea.
All I know is that I,

2096
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:43,210
when I think somebody is music sucks, I
don't care about their comeback. You know,

2097
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,100
kind of like Madonna. Madonna has a
couple of the tunes. But other than that,

2098
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:53,290
you know, I, I don't understand
what the big deal is just, I mean,

2099
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,590
granted you gotta give her
credit every five years.

2100
01:59:56,591 --> 01:59:59,500
She comes up with a new way
to fucking dress like a horse.

2101
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:02,290
You got to give her that.
Um,

2102
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:05,470
but I really think it's time
for her to, uh, you know,

2103
02:00:05,471 --> 02:00:08,710
put some more clothes on than
I talk about that last week.

2104
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:12,520
What have I happened to? Elegance.
You know what I mean? Blake,

2105
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,330
women in their forties and 50s
can, can, can be beautiful,

2106
02:00:16,331 --> 02:00:18,880
but not if they dress like they're 18.

2107
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:23,110
Same thing with guys that just comes that
point where you've got to stop wearing

2108
02:00:23,111 --> 02:00:27,040
your how Colgan fucking wife beater.

2109
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,640
You know, at that point,
you know, you know,

2110
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:34,960
you got your fucking flabby grandmother
arms. It's just not going to work out.

2111
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:38,260
People in their forties and
50s need to wear more clothes.

2112
02:00:38,290 --> 02:00:42,280
They need to look classy. That's what
you in your class a year, you're older,

2113
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:46,420
you're wiser. You know what I mean?
You can't fucking sit there. Uh,

2114
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:50,440
it's weird cause Madonna
is in great shape,

2115
02:00:50,441 --> 02:00:55,420
but like this is still 50.
You're a shredded 50 year old,

2116
02:00:55,421 --> 02:01:00,370
put on some fucking pants. Jesus
Christ. Get a skirt down to your knees.

2117
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:04,610
At least, you know, I, I don't
understand it. And like, uh,

2118
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:07,600
now that I'm on the subject,
the plastic surgery,

2119
02:01:07,601 --> 02:01:10,300
I saw an interview the other day with
her, you know, it's just, I don't know.

2120
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:12,550
What did she do to her fucking face?
It was like

2121
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:18,430
you looked normal and I don't get that.
Like you,

2122
02:01:18,431 --> 02:01:19,900
you look your age. Okay. You look,

2123
02:01:19,901 --> 02:01:24,901
you looked 48 two years ago
and now two years later,

2124
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:30,040
now you look like a,
a 33 year old alien.

2125
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:33,700
I mean, I mean, is that,
what the fuck? I don't know.

2126
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:36,670
That's basically they don't
have it down yet. I don't know.

2127
02:01:36,671 --> 02:01:38,290
A few people have noticed,
you know,

2128
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:42,680
with the plastic you want to get a tummy
tuck or get your ankles and large to

2129
02:01:42,681 --> 02:01:45,860
whatever the fuck people are doing.
Any of that shit below the neck.

2130
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:48,230
I guess I can kind of understand it.

2131
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:51,710
But if the face they
don't have to face down,

2132
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:53,870
I didn't think they have
the other shit down.

2133
02:01:53,871 --> 02:01:58,100
It's just that when I talked to somebody,
I don't stare at their fucking stomach,

2134
02:01:59,290 --> 02:01:59,631
you know?

2135
02:01:59,631 --> 02:02:02,300
But if they're wearing a half shirt and
that's where that fucking mouth was,

2136
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:05,420
I would be looking at the stomach
going, Oh god, why did they do that?

2137
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,410
I don't fucking know. So basically what
I think about the Brittany Spears thing,

2138
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:13,850
I honestly, I don't give a
shit. I don't give a shit.

2139
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:18,350
I don't give a shit about, you know,
people who basically, you know,

2140
02:02:18,351 --> 02:02:21,980
you want to run with no underwear on.
Yeah. Now the Paparazzi falls you around.

2141
02:02:21,981 --> 02:02:23,300
But even then,
I don't even believe that.

2142
02:02:23,301 --> 02:02:27,140
I think you fucking called
them and let them, let them
know, hey, I don't make God,

2143
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:31,610
I'm going down to Starbucks and I
maybe forgot my panties. I like,

2144
02:02:31,611 --> 02:02:34,420
I like the fucking Paparazzi
gets this credit, like,

2145
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:39,620
like they have like this Pentagon ability,
you know what I mean?

2146
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:42,050
Like they're tracking her
on her cell phone. Did Not,

2147
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:45,050
there were a bunch of fucking,
I don't know what the fuck they are,

2148
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:47,690
but I'm not buying it. Oh, you
know what isn't as convenient.

2149
02:02:47,691 --> 02:02:50,600
Here's a telephone call. And let's just,
when I was going to end the podcast.

2150
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:54,110
All right, well, thanks for listening
and I will talk to you guys next week.

2151
02:02:54,111 --> 02:02:54,950
Have a great week.

2152
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:56,470
And,
uh,

2153
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:06,350
so

2154
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:44,840
[inaudible].
