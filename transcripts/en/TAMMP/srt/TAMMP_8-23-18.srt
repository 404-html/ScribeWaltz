1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:07,340
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,820
Ah,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,910
ah.
Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,150
I'm just checking in on you.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,180
Doodah Doodah how's your
fucking Cuba coal old odot.day.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,900
Um, what's going on? Happy Thursday.
Everybody here. Almost there.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,850
I'll tell you that this weekend.
Just cannot come soon enough. Oh,

9
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,190
fucking suck it up,
Mary.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,830
They're paying you to do you do a
fucking job. Go ahead and do it.

11
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,530
What are you gonna do this weekend?
It's going to make you less of a fucking

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,560
Goddamn wet diaper to be around next week.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,070
This weekend can't come soon enough.
Oh yeah.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,680
Who you're hanging out with that you got
to dump all your fucking problems on.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,270
Sorry, you wouldn't know
it, but I'm in a great mood.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm in a fucking great mood.
Um,

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,070
tomorrow morning I'm
taking it early flight.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,100
I'm flying out to a casino in Maryland
doing a one or two shows out there.

19
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:08,730
I'm not sure.
I don't know what,

20
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:12,840
just point me at the stage and I will
go out there and do my little fucking

21
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:17,280
dance. But a red sox finally won last
night. What did I do? Did I call it

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,420
or did I not call it?
All of these guys?

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,310
I don't know why you guys continue
to watch ESPN when the Monday morning

24
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:29,190
podcasts and the Thursday
afternoon just before Friday.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,280
Monday morning podcast exists.
Okay.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:33,620
Okay.

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,220
Why do you put on that? Okay, Jay.
Okay. They're professionals. Okay.

28
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,930
They went to broadcasting school.
Okay.

29
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:43,610
They pay attention to sports way
more than I do. Having said that,

30
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,030
yeah.

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,500
According to my ego,

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,890
nobody reads the sports
tea leaves better than me.

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,371
Of course it isn't true,

34
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:57,640
but the one thing I am right about
is all these people that flip out

35
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,950
during the regular season about God,
he records and all that shit.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,620
All the fucking wins. The Red
Sox half, we've seen this before.

37
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,390
We saw the Seattle mariners do it.

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,680
They want 120 something games
came home with no fucking,

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,060
they came home with their
pockets turned inside out

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,620
and I'll tell you right now,
there was all,

41
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:29,210
there were a lot of lumberjacks and
Seattle crying on Monday. All right.

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,230
No, I know that. I have a well earned
reputation as being a bit of a combustion.

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,270
Okay.

44
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,950
A bit of a fucking wet blanket.

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,070
A bit of a freckle. Alright,
guilty on all counts.

46
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,170
But I'll tell you one thing,

47
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:53,630
I'm right above other than my
misogynistic opinions about women,

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,250
I,
I am right about the regular season.

49
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,140
Okay?

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,520
And I'm here to tell all of you,
okay?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,410
To fucking stand down

52
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,600
with this screaming and
yelling every fucking sport,

53
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,070
Kate fucking relax.

54
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,280
What you want to do is you take all
the stats of all the fucking 90% of the

55
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,720
teams or whatever sport you're watching,

56
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,640
sometimes only 40% if
you're watching hockey,

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,370
the amount of fucking teams that
are not going to win the playoffs.

58
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,480
You take all of those fucking stats.
All right?

59
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:32,150
As the rock used to say,
you turned them up sideways,

60
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:34,150
the seventh straight up candy.
Yes.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,250
Cause they don't mean shit because
you're not going to see those people come

62
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,240
flop in October.

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,370
So what did I sing when I jumped on
the Red Sox bandwagon six hours ago?

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,230
I said we got the Indians twice.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,820
We got the Houston Astros and we got
the Yankees to more fucking times. Okay.

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,080
Now if we lay waste to those teams,
I can get excited.

67
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:58,100
But even then the playoffs
at diff Joe Bucks there,

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,750
there's more cameras. Everybody's watched.
All right? People get a little tight.

69
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,000
You never know what the fuck can happen.
So anyways,

70
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:08,690
I've been telling you guys and
yes I am pat myself on the back.

71
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,940
I told you everybody's sleeping
on the Indians and Terry Francona.

72
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,090
Now what happens?
What does Terry do?

73
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,730
He comes right out in the
first two fucking games.

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,710
He makes us look like a 500
ball club handled us with east.

75
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,340
That's two wins. Two more. And
you just took a series. All right.

76
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,070
I know we got Chris sale and
I know we got price. Okay,

77
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,100
that's only going to get us to there.
All right.

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,610
And I think Terry Francona is the best
manager in fucking baseball and then

79
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,220
never, evidently they got this Guy
Brad hand or some shit closer. I,

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,080
it was no fun. I know his last
name. His hand. All right,

81
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,700
very impressive. Lights out. I know
we won last night and everything,

82
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:54,640
but I'm just saying, you know, but that's
what they do over there. The ESPNs,

83
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,610
the Fox sports,

84
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,910
they are in the business of saying the
sky is falling or sending something to

85
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:05,330
the fucking moon. They sent it to
the bone and when the sky falls,

86
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,290
they have the balls to say what happens,
what happened? Rather than being like,

87
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,960
wow, we will, we will fucking wrong again.

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,750
All they do is hype shit up
over there. They did. I mean,

89
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,480
how many fucking times have they,

90
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,780
how do you compare the DD dd
2018 red sox to the 96 bowls?

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,033
MMM.

92
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay.

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,830
And it's always the 96 bolts.
By the way.

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,630
Everybody ignores the 1983 Philadelphia,
70 sixers.

95
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,120
Okay. One of the most underrated
teams of all fucking time. Um,

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,480
anyways, I was very relieved
that we got a win last night. Uh,

97
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,160
I'm going to try to
watch the game tonight.

98
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,713
MMM.

99
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,890
And it will be split with
them. But, uh, I, I mean,

100
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,730
I love our, and all our players
and all that shit, but I,

101
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:01,520
every time I see Terry Francona,
basically she's the best, you know?

102
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,190
I don't know what happens. You
just ever, you're just like,

103
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,590
familiarity breeds contempt. Is that
what is, how do you say that word?

104
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:13,830
Familiarity. Familiar. Familiarity.

105
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,710
Okay.

106
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,570
Hang on a second.
That's one of those ones.

107
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:20,510
You start the word and then
you get halfway through
and you're like, oh my God,

108
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm not going to make it.
And you have like,

109
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,410
you're talking to three people
to save time at the party.

110
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,420
You just see all of them
just ever so slightly.

111
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,740
You see their faces drop and they
realize how dumb the person they are that

112
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,060
they're talking to her. Sorry.
Famille year air or a T.

113
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,710
I didn't even spell it right. All right.
How do you say this? Okay, everybody,

114
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:44,150
here we go. You Ready? Whoops.
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

115
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Familiarity.
Familiarity.

116
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,400
No. Familiarity. Familiarity. Yeah.

117
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,253
Garrity.

118
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,180
Yeah.

119
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,590
Familiarity. Dude. You know what it is.

120
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:03,150
You just feel familiarity of the ballpark.

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,410
He ain't fucking scared
when he gets sick on a,

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,950
on a and he knows all
the nooks and crannies.

123
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,940
I said it right.

124
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,320
Yeah,

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,060
yeah. Already. Yeah. Familiarity.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,190
Okay.

127
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,070
You don't look, you don't believe
me. Listen to the fucking robot.

128
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:22,740
White Guy in my computer.
Familiarity C,

129
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,440
go fuck yourself. Give
me a bud light kit. Um,

130
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,340
watching my waistline for the end of
the summer, speaking of which, oh,

131
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,810
and then the Red Sox,
uh,

132
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,900
they had some fucking little a is the
English would say a little cheeky fucking

133
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,680
tweet there. I didn't like it. You know,

134
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:45,010
we apologize to our fans for, uh, our,

135
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,970
our lengthy losing streak.
Why would you do that?

136
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,713
You know,

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,840
this is what you got to ask yourself.
What would bill Bellacheck do? All right.

138
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,460
Just lob that over the
net. Hey, fucking cheat.

139
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,640
I know you guys would say that I cut
the sleeves off his sweater and fucking

140
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:11,640
blind a child to get an ice cream
cone quicker. You're all jealous. Um,

141
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,530
but funny. Um, anyways, uh, yeah.

142
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,330
Why would you give
bulletin board material?

143
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,170
Why would you motivate any other
fucking team? You know, that's just,

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,810
I think that's a stupid move.
Uh,

145
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,060
and that's what happens when you go on
Twitter and they probably read all these

146
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:33,800
red sox fans. Freaking
the fuck out. You know,

147
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,350
if they got 50,000 tweets,
I bet 30,000 were sent by Dan Shaughnessy.

148
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,860
Oh, I always get to make fun
of him. Um, there's this,

149
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,070
the 1978 season I'll over.

150
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,420
Are they going to chant 2013 at us?
Um,

151
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,630
anyways, tonight, tonight. Big, big,

152
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:57,740
big fucking match of who's on the for
the Indians. I have no idea. But uh,

153
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,450
the Indians are my team.
If the red sox don't make it this year,

154
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,280
I'd like to see them get one,

155
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,090
even though I'm going to have
to watch people in the stands,

156
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,570
have those stupid Cleveland
shirts that say defend the land.

157
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,070
Uh,
I just fuck getting,

158
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,520
I think that might be the
worst one. Okay. Yankees sing.

159
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:23,420
Why MCA during the seventh inning
stretch? If think that's bad, right?

160
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,580
Dirt that Eh,

161
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,900
all these fucking fat Harry
fucking Brooklyn cuts, right?

162
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,540
You'd take dad's bed and then you
go up to Boston and this, what is,

163
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,080
what is it swaying Caroline?
The thing is,

164
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:43,950
is you got to have like
a song for dumb people.

165
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,140
Yeah.

166
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,440
You know, like if you just
hum the melody of why MCA,

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,910
it's a Buddhist monk would probably tell
you that some sort of scent thing where

168
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,300
you just have a complete inability to
have any sort of thought in your head.

169
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,693
You know,

170
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,170
like,
think about your future while you go

171
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,330
a duck.

172
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,850
That's it.
It's over.

173
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,813
MMM.

174
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,110
And then the temple of it,
young men walking down the fucking street,

175
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:18,670
cause you can't dance. Right. Just
white guys walking around in a square,

176
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,420
you know,
is it's a girlfriend,

177
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,490
looks over his shoulder at the
black guy in the background.

178
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,563
MMM.

179
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,110
Anyways. And you just think it can't get
any bad worse than that, you know? I mean,

180
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:41,370
that's pretty bad because
it's, it's Douche behavior
combined with music. I mean,

181
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,070
that's usually takes the cake,

182
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:49,060
but defend the land,
the land.

183
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,600
What land? Cleveland. He'd be the
one you guys all fucking abandoned.

184
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,980
It's a fucking ghost town.

185
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,790
Drive in from your fucking
plush neighborhood.

186
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,400
All those fucking rich out there
in greater Cleveland, you know,

187
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,660
in their gated communities,

188
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,880
sitting out there reading their broths
in their fucking 14 carat big green eggs,

189
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,150
you know, then they come downtown
like the fucking Paul Revere.

190
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,020
I'm going to defend the land and go to
a game for three hours and then quickly

191
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:20,170
retreat back to my cul de sac,

192
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,060
the Lexis fucking riding mower.

193
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,240
The amount of money in greater
Cleveland is just insane, by the way.

194
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,320
I have no idea what greater
Cleveland is like. Uh,

195
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,790
but anyway, is it, is it
that much difficult to be
greater than Cleveland? Ah,

196
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,420
see what I did there. Sorry.
Anyways, having said that,

197
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,010
uh,

198
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,580
I love the idiots.
My Dad was a big Indians fan growing up.

199
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,113
MMM.

200
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,630
Indians at tigers where there's two
teams as he moved around a lot there. Uh,

201
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,610
so anyways,
I'll speaking to that late last night.

202
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,653
MMM.

203
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,700
I somehow, you know, and went
down this, this fucking, you
know, what do you call it?

204
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:03,260
The rabbit hole on Youtube.

205
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,520
And I ended up watching this youtube
video about every quarterback the Detroit

206
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:12,330
lions have ever had, you know, and uh,

207
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,440
they've had a lot of fucking quarterbacks.
Not a lot of offensive lineman,

208
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,330
but they have had a lot
of fucking quarterbacks.

209
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,263
MMM.

210
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,160
Fascinating. Fascinating franchise.
Allegedly, it's the curse of Bobby Lane.

211
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,480
It isn't. It isn't. It's
not. Okay. You know,

212
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,750
to say that you're cursed is just you
just passing the buck. It's like, no,

213
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,630
we don't know what the fuck
we're doing and we need help.

214
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,840
It's not the curse of Bobby Lane.
What?

215
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,310
Cause he left a little disgruntled.
Yeah, you get rid of me.

216
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,050
You're never going to win again.
And then some old lady I heard,

217
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:58,051
he shed fat 50 years and that's how it
starts that Dan Shaughnessy writes a book

218
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:01,620
about it. It makes a bunch of money off
the misery. That's what it should be.

219
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:05,390
His next book,
the curse of Bombay,

220
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,620
Bobby Lane would come into the
game fucking half in the bag.

221
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,550
He need hair of the dog after fucking
the second quarter going in halftime,

222
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:19,570
not listen to the coach, slap his fucking
wife around. Then he'd go out and he'd,

223
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:24,400
he'd have a fourth quarter
comeback, you know. Um,

224
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,480
and anyways, that's the way they told
the story. But I remember Greg Landry,

225
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,590
Eric Hippel,

226
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,640
I remember Joey Harrington his whole
fucking career just running for his life.

227
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,860
You know, that's what's amazing. You know,

228
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:39,861
when you see like some of these
people that are called bus like the,

229
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,270
this ship, this should be
like a consideration for the
fucking team you went to.

230
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,480
You know what I mean?
Like if Jimmy Johnson did not

231
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,520
come into the fucking Dallas cowboys
organization and make that Herschel Walker

232
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:02,440
trade, how long would have Troy
Aikman lasted in the league?

233
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,160
The amount of hits that that guy
took me the first couple of seasons,

234
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:09,970
he guy was on his back. You can only
take those hits for so long. Now.

235
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:13,630
I'm not saying Joey. Eric did his
Fuckin Troy Aikman I'm just saying,

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,730
remember way back in the day when
John Elway, the Baltimore Colts,

237
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:22,270
drafted him and he was,
you know, and he was like,

238
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,270
I'm not going to that fucking franchise.
And they go, what are you talking about?

239
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,570
He got ready to play baseball, I'll go
fucking play baseball for the Yankees.

240
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,513
You know,

241
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,170
because you guys don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

242
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,250
And I have one shot at this and
then they traded him to the Broncos.

243
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,630
Koby Bryant did the same thing
drafted by the Charlotte Hornets.

244
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,360
Say like I'm a fucking plane out there.

245
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,650
I actually think it is
like an for basketball.

246
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:52,160
It's bullshit for baseball
would be bullshit.

247
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,700
It wasn't like non contact sports for
the most part compared to like, you know,

248
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,880
football, football. I
get, it's like, dude,

249
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:02,690
I'm literally going to be drinking out
of fucking Straw by the time I'm 30 if I

250
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:07,610
play for you guys. Alright, you
don't have an offensive coordinator,

251
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:10,460
you have no offensive line. And I'm just
going to get like, I'm going to be like,

252
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,400
you know the guy, he waves his hand for
a fair catch and just get stuck. Now,

253
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,740
you know,
something with the new rules of tackling.

254
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,290
Now maybe I think that you
can go to these franchises.

255
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,070
You don't have to pull an Elway.
Um,

256
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,090
yeah. Cause I think it's that you
can't lead when you're fucking,

257
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,950
you can't lead with your head.
Where do you go to tackle?

258
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm trying to picture how, how do
you do that? That can, can you,

259
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,100
you can hit with your shoulder though,
right?

260
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,230
But there's no way to hit with your
shoulder with our leading with your head

261
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,000
unless you just sorta like a,

262
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,650
it just come jump and buy like a
pogo stick and just sort of like,

263
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,610
it's like slam dancing.
Maybe they should do that.

264
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,370
I think what they should do is they
should have a giant velcro belt around.

265
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:04,110
All of them right in the ball becomes
velcro and you just stick it on the person

266
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:06,030
and the person can't run that.

267
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,270
You bounced down the fucking field like
a pogo stick and then everybody else

268
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:11,760
hops after you and tries to bump into you,

269
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,790
but you're not allowed to slap the ball
the way the way a rod did when he ran

270
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,120
down to first base. I don't know.
I'm just trying to fix the game.

271
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,330
You know who the fuck knows?

272
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,370
I know it's all about concussion
protocol and all that.

273
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:27,970
I think they should just have NFL players
just sign a release being like, yeah,

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,710
basically. Um, you're going to
take about 30 years off life.

275
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,060
Okay. But in the three and a half
years you play in this league, okay,

276
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,180
you're going to have a,
you're going to get more pussy.

277
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,870
You going to drive more God damn cars and
have more fucking bling than you could

278
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:48,250
ever dream of. All right? So
joy, joy. Well, last, okay,

279
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,580
just sign here and you
can lead with your head.

280
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,260
Maybe that's what they have to do.
I Dunno.

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,150
Maybe the NFL implodes and then the
WNB takes over. I mean, who knows?

282
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,000
There's a good story for ESPN. Is
that what's going to happen? Um,

283
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,760
anyways, let me read a little
bit of advertising here. Um,

284
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,430
then I'm gonna talk about, uh, dog. Cleo.

285
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,980
Cleo is back in town.

286
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,990
I'm going to go take her for a walk after
I upload this fucker. A butcher box.

287
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:27,940
Everybody. Oh my goodness. Oh my
goodness. Are you a kind of war?

288
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,990
Dia Love,

289
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,380
impeccable cuts of fucking
butchered meat the way I do.

290
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,660
I literally read this.
This is disgusting.

291
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:43,100
I literally read this in my mouth waters.
That's how much I enjoy it. Plus also,

292
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,430
I'm on this fucking, this diet, you know,

293
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,000
and this week is like the
vegetarian diet. You know, I, I, I,

294
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,180
I had like a quarter of a chicken breast
at some point, you know what I mean?

295
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,250
An animal has to die so I
can live. I mean, it's just,
it's just how I am, you know?

296
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,170
Um, anyways, I just wish they
didn't treat the animals like shit,

297
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,540
which is why I like this one.
You know, these guys, they, they,

298
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,350
they treat them night. They pet them, they
rub their bellies before they kill him.

299
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,450
You know what I mean? I
mean, if you were going,

300
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,930
if you are on death row when she want
that, you know, nice head rub, foot rub,

301
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:20,370
you know, work out the kinks in
your back for they flip the switch.

302
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,241
All right.

303
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:26,241
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

304
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,700
organic chickens and
the greatest thing ever.

305
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,600
Heritage bread,
pork,

306
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,200
the Cuban cigar of pork.
Okay.

307
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,450
Uh,

308
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,450
the incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

309
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:50,601
raising animals humanely and free of
antibiotics and hormones before we kill

310
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:55,110
them. Each box comes with at
least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

311
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,800
which is enough for 24
individuals sized meals.

312
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,790
You can choose from five different
box types. I disliked it.

313
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,600
You can order a couple boxes of those
and you're ready for the apocalypse.

314
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,830
Just freeze those bad boys and everybody
else is going to be all starving out

315
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:15,420
there eating dandelions
in fucking flossing their
teeth with the flag in their

316
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,051
mailbox.

317
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:20,220
And you're going to be coming out
there with just full of fucking protein

318
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,180
throwing elbows and knees, Huh? Um,

319
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,600
you can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

320
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
beef it and it makes box for
are you progressive people?

321
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,990
Custom box lets you choose
your own cuts. Oh, this is for,

322
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:44,400
this is for the fucking chef right here.
Antibiotic and hormone free.

323
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:45,001
We already said this.

324
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,500
Butcher box believes in a healthier
food system where everyone has access to

325
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,280
meets the way nature intended.
Free of antibiotics and hormones.

326
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:56,460
Humanely raised on an open
pasture before we killed them.

327
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,760
Shots fired at the company,

328
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,290
the artist formerly known as Monsanto,

329
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,660

recipes are available on the butcher box,
websites and videos.

336
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,291
I literally thought like,

337
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:33,120
is this meat like tax deductible and
videos are available to follow along on

338
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:38,010
butcher box youtube channel? Yeah. They
wanted me to say my personal experience,

339
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,420
I told you I had the,

340
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,190
the heritage bread pork was the
best pork chop I've ever won.

341
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:47,580
One of the top three I've ever had and
I've had five unbelievable once by five

342
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,550
star chefs. It was just an entirely
different level. It's like,

343
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,280
did you ever just like,

344
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,560
you have to have a tomato at a grocery
store and then someone has a garden and

345
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,670
they bring that over and you're like,

346
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,210
this is what the fuck it's supposed
to taste like. It's unreal.

347
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,730
It's like our food has a mute
button that's been pushed,

348
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,730
so every once in a while
when you get the real shit,

349
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,463
you know,

350
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,140
she's so fucking weird that if you know,

351
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:17,280
if you went back to the 18 hundreds
how much better food would it tasted,

352
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,800
but then all the other shit
you could have died of,

353
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,263
you know?

354
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,290
Then you could fast forward all that shit.
They died of an hour.

355
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,400
Foods all fucked up, which is
causing more shit that you die from.

356
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,530
I'll tell you people, it's a
quagmire. All right. Legal Zoom fact.

357
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,100
Most Americans don't have
a, well, not this guy.

358
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,030
My affairs are in order.
20 years ago,

359
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,770
that wasn't a shocking statement.

360
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,880
You had to find a trustworthy attorney
and pay them by the hour to draft your

361
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,980
will,
but these days there's no excuse.

362
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,410
Legal Zoom has made it
easy to create your own.

363

it's your turn to take control of your

366

It starts with the will or living trust.

367
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:12,400
I can tell you this,

368
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,130
a lot of guys don't do it because you
don't want to contemplate your own

369
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,820
mortality. I gotta tell you, I was
one of those guys. I got a will.

370
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,180
I got everything all done and uh,

371
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,710
it was like a load off of my fucking
chest. You'll feel great afterwards.

372
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,670
You know,
unless you're married the wrong person.

373
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,920
And then they immediately start
to poison your food. I mean,

374
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:36,790
there's always something. There's
always a fly in the ointment anyways.

00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,500
Don't know which one's right for you.

funeral because you sell urine.

390
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,370
An unsettled spirit.
Okay.

And then you just going to be screaming.

to do brds.

396
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,860
Brds now nobody can fucking chill.
They got no money.

397
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:59,270
Now they're sucking dick out
on the street doing it quick.

398
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,350
They do what they do because
they need to eat some checks.

399
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,840
Thanks for fucking us over dad. You're
really screwed. US. All right me undies.

400
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,410
You've heard me obsess over my me undies.

401
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,430
You've heard me talk about how they
are three times softer than cotton.

402
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:23,360
While you've heard me read about it and
come with fun new prints each month,

403
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,040
but I got evidently I got a big scoop
that evidently I'm so excited to share

with y'all.

405
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,900
Me undies just gave their
membership a massive upgrade.

406
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,920
I just pictured them like there's some
sort of shelf they have in the front of

407
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:40,170
the underwear now that
just lifts your junk.

408
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,820
There's your massive upgrade
of foot rest for your balls.

409
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,280
All those dirty old whole written
disgusting underwear you've hung onto.

410
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,310

give your top drawer the refresher it

411
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:53,850
deserves.

412
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,850
Each month's BMDS we'll release a new
exclusive print that only members can get.

413
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,040

414
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:06,330
brands or other unique designs you
are going to definitely want to have.

You're so unique.

430
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,490
The sounds you make when you sleep,
the high pitched way that you fart.

431
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,620
So why would you buy a generic
mattress built for everyone else?

432
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,440
Next, please mention all the talking
points below. Okay. Hallux Helix.

developed nine different mattresses

435
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,280

let's wrap it up. Boop,
boop. Wrap it up. All right,

459
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,810
Billy botox is getting in shape.
It's right.

460
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,830
I'm going to get some injections in my
face. I'm going to have my teeth bleached,

461
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,960
my tongue scraped it.
Uh,

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,940
you know the wind have that
candle stuck in my ear.

463
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,310
We fucking melt out all the wax or some
shit. Now I'm not doing any of that.

464
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:20,820
I'm just trying to get, I'm trying to
get my abs. I got a four pack right now.

465
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,030
My stomach reminds me of the
old fucking wine. I mean,

466
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,790
that old bottle and James
Belly right here. Um,

467
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,340
it's abs sick. It's Ab five and six.
Those are the tough ones. You know,

468
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,920
even seven and eight aren't that bad.

469
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,840
Like the fat just goes right to five
and six. It just fucking sits there.

470
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,190
You know what I mean? Like,
you know, whenever you, you're,

471
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,390
you pour some liquid into a measuring cup,

472
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,890
no matter how much you
try and dump it out,

473
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:52,620
there's always that little bit that
fucking gathers in the bottom and then you

474
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,450
try and fucking snapping it down.

475
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:57,930
He did is always going to be a little bit
left him. That's what ab five and six.

476
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:02,430
So like in my fucking world,
um, I'm doing all right though.

477
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:06,390
I look really good with the
shirt on right now, you know,

478
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,490
but if I take my shirt off
it's still put it back on. Um,

479
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,640
so I think I need to do a little more
cardio or something like that. Uh,

480
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,410
you know what I want to
buy, I don't know, Rogan is,

481
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:20,670
has been talking up this fucking
cardio machine. I got to check it out.

482
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,260
I got to go next time I do his
podcast or write in the area.

483
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,540
I ran into him the other night and I was,
I was,

484
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,050
he was going on and on about how fucking
unbelievable this thing and how it was

485
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,950
tiring him out. So I figure if it tires
Joe out, it's borderline going to kill me.

486
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,990
Um, but I remember way
back in the day, um,

487
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,020
there was a gym and
they had this thing called Jacob's ladder,

488
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,270
which was just per picture.

489
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:51,130
You are a fireman and there was a ladder
that reached up to the top of a fucking

490
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:53,920
skyscraper. Right? And that's
what it was like. It was like,

491
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,540
you're on all fours and,

492
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,310
or like a 45 degree angle and just
climbing this fucking never ending.

493
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,580
It just keeps going and going and going.
You know,

494
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,280
it's like a treadmill on a 45 degree
angle. They, they didn't, they did.

495
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,030
It's like you're fucking crawl 10 miles
away from the gym and then you're like,

496
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:14,120
fuck, now how do I get back to my
car? You know, it just, you know,

497
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,090
it goes in a circle using your
own weight or some shit like that.

498
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:22,630
And I remember I got on that fucking
thing. And with if then three minutes,

499
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:27,280
it felt like my heart was in my
throat and I had done an eight ball.

500
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,913
MMM.

501
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,810
So I'm considering getting one of those.

502
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,910
I might buy one of those or

503
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,630
I'm going to check out the Joe Rogan
was could Josie, Josie always like,

504
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,060
he's always sees one of those guys.
He's always looking around the corner.

505
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:45,790
So he's always,
he knows what the next shit is.

506
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:50,791
And I feel like he's had that thing long
enough that if that he's already past

507
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:54,130
the, Oh, wait a minute, this thing
sucks. He was still raving about it.

508
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:58,690
So whatever the fuck he got, I'm going
to, I'm going to try to get, you know,

509
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,220
and then maybe I'll have a spinning heel
kick at the death level that he does.

510
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,320
Um, anyways, my dogs back in town.

511
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,713
MMM.

512
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,730
I'm going to go take her for a walk.
I fucking miss that dog so much, man.

513
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,623
I'm having an ally.

514
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,353
Uh,

515
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,391
it's just the best,

516
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:21,330
but I still get to see her like once
every six weeks and she's out here for six

517
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:23,610
days. So every day I'd been
taking around like a fucking hike.

518
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,970
She goes nuts when she sees me.
I got crazy when I see her.

519
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,560
It's always a little sad when I
give it back, you know? But, uh,

520
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,390
I think she's kind of used to
it at this point. You know,

521
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,370
I think human beings take
it harder than, than, uh,

522
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,230
the fucking dogs too.
But anyways.

523
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,303
MMM.

524
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,780
Okay. Let's, let's look a little bit
of world news. Let's see what's going,

525
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,540
let's check in on the
world. Everybody, uh,

526
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:52,570
Trump under fire for claim of large
scale killing of white farmers in South

527
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,450
Africa.
Um,

528
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,050
is there any doubt that this guy is just
a straight up fucking racist at this

529
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:01,110
point?
It's amazing how long he kind of hid that.

530
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,570
Like you had no idea when he
was just sort of this funny,

531
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:07,700
famous for being famous guy.
Um,

532
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,570
but the things that he chooses to focus
on, not saying that this isn't happening.

533
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,050
Okay.

534
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,780
White farmers getting killed
in South Africa, but, you know,

535
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:19,350
white people are killing a lot of other
people from different races for quite a

536
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:22,470
while. Uh, actually right now.

537
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,010
Oh I'm sorry.
We thought you were a terrorist.

538
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,170
Will you just a family go into the market?
Sorry about that.

539
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:36,270
We've been doing that for 15 fucking
years. I mean it's, you know,

540
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm not saying what's going on in half.
I've even about it is right.

541
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:41,510
But it's just like that like,

542
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,650
I dunno when you can see like you know
when this like neo Nazis and you can kind

543
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:49,790
of see their argument to why,
you know,

544
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,310
it's kind of six of one
half dozen of the other

545
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,060
and the fact that fucking politicians
on both sides are such pieces of fucking

546
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,630
shit that they will,
they will sit there and they will just,

547
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:06,450
they will tow the fucking company line.

548
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,790
Okay.

549
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:13,170
Because they're grossly under fucking
paid and it's all about getting reelected.

550
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:17,790
So someday you can write three books while
you're still in office and then buy a

551
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:20,220
$10 million house.
That's basically what it is.

552
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,930
A UK outlines plan to
avert chaos of a no deal.

553
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:28,590
Brexit, when the fuck is this thing going
to go down? I thought they were leaving.

554
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,010
This is like the longest break up ever.

555
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,490
What is a no deal?
Brexit.

556
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,320
So they leave the European Union and
then they don't know what the fuck they

557
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,650
going to do.
All right,

558
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,110
so there's showing a picture
of a bunch of tractor trailers.

559
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,220
Okay.

560
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,830
All right. Make a difference in today's
world. Support independent journalism.

561
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,460
Subscribe for a dollar a week.
Oh,

562
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:55,220
can I read what you wrote first?
How do I know you're independent?

563
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,630
This is New York times.com.
You're not fucking independent.

564
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,600
If mainstream, uh, London,

565
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,560
the British government issued its
first contingency plans on Thursday for

566
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:11,561
leaving the European Union without an
agreement seeking to prepare the public

567
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:16,280
for possible disruption without spreading
alarm that could undermine support for

568
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:20,360
the entire undertaking.
The government an agreement for what

569
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,710
citizens of other countries that are
living in London with some sort of work

570
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:31,770
visa. How you're going to
trade with the rest of it. Oh,

571
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,270
this is looking like a shit show.

572
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,083
Yeah.

573
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:39,730
The government emphasized that it hoped
and expected to hammer out a deal with

574
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:43,300
the European Union.
But in a series of technical documents,

575
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:45,400
it warned that without an agreement,

576
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,110
importers and exporters could face
significant new bureaucratic hurdles that

577
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:53,800
credit or debit card payments in
continental Europe could cost more.

578
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:58,180
And the British citizens living in the
block could lose access to banking and

579
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:01,090
pension service. I'm going
to call this right now. Uh,

580
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,180
England or Great Britain leaving

581
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,150
the European Union is either going to be
the greatest or the worst fucking move

582
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,600
ever. I mean, it's a great
move on some level, I guess.

583
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:16,190
Do you get out of the world banks
and you get to go back? They'd wait.

584
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,650
Are they are,

585
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,270
I can't even know if they're on the
euro and they still in the pound.

586
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,840
Were they on the road? Did they go back
to the pound? I can't fucking remember.

587
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,390
But that's going to be that this is
either gonna fucking make other countries

588
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:31,270
want to do it or they're going to be like,
thank God I didn't do that.

589
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:33,760
This is not going to be where.
You know what I mean? You know,

590
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:38,100
there's pros and cons. It's going to be
great or a shit show. One of the, uh,

591
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,460
I just went ESPN on that, uh, US,

592
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,350
China impose fresh round of tariffs as
escalating trade wars shows no sign of

593
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:49,390
ending. Why can't, why, what are we doing?

594
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,160
Why can't we just fucking get along
with people, you know? Hello China.

595
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:56,180
How are you? Is this how you want to
run your country? Well, God bless you.

596
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,400
This is how we run our country. You
know, you want some apples? I mean,

597
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:02,850
how fucking hard is that?
I know,

598
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:07,500
I just oversimplified it
anyways. Um, oh, lastly,

599
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,800
but not leastly. Uh, I did, uh,

600
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,840
an episode of Conan O'brien last night
to hype my show at Madison Square Garden.

601
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:19,090
November 7th.
I'll be there with Joe Bart,

602
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:22,260
Nick and the pride of Trenton,
New Jersey,

603
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,930
Paul Versey on November 7th.

604
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,100
I'm very excited about
that. And a, as always,

605
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,070
I had the best time on,
uh,

606
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,660
on Kone ease him and Andy,
they're the best current sets you up.

607
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,910
And then if you get in trouble,
Andy Saves,

608
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:41,610
you actually joked with Andy
when I left. I said, you know,

609
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:45,360
I think you only need to save me one time,
maybe twice.

610
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,740
I think he jumped in twice.

611
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,800
So my idea of a perfect game on
Conan is Andy never has to save me.

612
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:59,310
He's always two to five
times every segment. But um,

613
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,520
I had a great time. I actually got
there a little bit early and, um,

614
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,570
I got to go check out the drum kit,
which was,

615
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:10,800
was fucking bad SDW kit.

616
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,270
So I sat down and actually played
them for a couple of minutes and uh,

617
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:17,931
I don't know what that is.

618
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:22,520
That always like makes me more
relaxed before I go out. And,

619
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:26,100
uh, that do was show, I don't know why.

620
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,040
Maybe cause I'm a fucking lunatic.
I have no idea.

621
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,990
So I actually got to sit down at James
Worworth's kit. Um, sounded amazing.

622
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:36,810
I was like, you sure he's not going
to get pissed if I sit days. Hey Dad,

623
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:38,810
that's fine.
Um,

624
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,340
okay.

625
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,180
But, uh, anyways, I had a great time on
it. If you'd like to see some clips, uh,

626
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,300
maybe we'll, I'll post some links
or something like that to it.

627
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:48,860
I had a great time.
As always.

628
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,240
I'm so thank you to everybody
over at Kona for helped me, uh,

629
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,300

Garden November 7th. Uh,

630
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,950

there in a big empty arena. All right,

um, music interlude here,

633
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:11,700
musical interlude before we,

634
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,430

podcast from earlier in the year of

635
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:19,300
fucking 10 years ago. I have no idea
how it works. All right, I'll see you.

636
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,510
[inaudible]

637
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,490
wait, let's get back to Vegas out here.
I, uh, had a great time last night.

638
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,240
I did a surprise,
not so surprised.

639
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,520
Guest spot at,
uh,

640
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,880
on the fucking,

641
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,370
what the fuck? The, uh, the all
the all end tour. Sorry guys.

642
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,960
You can you tell I've been drinking
again. Drinking again. Oh, baby.

643
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,830
I'm drinking again. I went 73 fucking
days with that, without the booze

644
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,250
and uh,
Versie Bart,

645
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:22,210
nick in law had all came in
Saturday night after, um,

646
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,850
my second show over here at the Mirage.
And,

647
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:32,080
uh, I came back to my room
and I was waiting for them.

648
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,500
They were on their way up. Kevin
Shay opened for me. All right.

649
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,440
So all,
all the fucking maniacs.

650
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:43,441
We're out here and I'm sitting there
with the lovely Nia and she's going,

651
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:47,710
I'm tired. I'm like, I'm
tired too. I swear to God, if
these guys weren't in town,

652
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:53,380
I would just go to bed.
And they showed up.

653
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,180
We had a couple of drinks and had
some cigars sitting on the table.

654
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,500
And I go to my wife, hey, you
know, like, let's just, we're
just going to go outside,

655
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,070
smoked a cigar. I'll be back in a couple
hours or whatever. And that was like,

656
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,050
I don't know what that was. That was
probably just a little bit after midnight.

657
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,490
And I don't, you know, I started
drinking and I just became that guy,

658
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,780
that guy who just wants to keep
going and does not want to go home.

659
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,200
And a bargaining was joking,

660
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,930
said what we did was basically they could
have shot a commercial for Las Vegas

661
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:29,530
is what we did. Um, I
hate to say it. We did.

662
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:34,390
And we just did old school Vegas shit
that was not old school when I first

663
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,380
started coming to Vegas.

664
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:39,820
But I've been out here for 15 years and
like the new school's going to that Dj

665
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,680
Shit. So I didn't know what
the fuck we did. We somehow,

666
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,580
I think we ended up over the Venetian
and uh,

667
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,540
we were already smoking cigars. I don't
really even remember. I was just pounding.

668
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,820
Okay,

669
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,170
well where are we? I played
roulette somewhere and I made money.

670
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,370
Then I cashed out.
Then we went over to the v Venetian.

671
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,370
I remember playing craps.

672
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,750
Yeah,

673
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,920
throwing the dice.

674
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,140
I just kept going,
hey,

675
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,220
I started yelling and everybody's saying
I'm throwing numbers over here. Right.

676
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,370
And I just started throwing it.
I did what I always did.

677
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:27,300
I bet the 68 in the past bar, I should
have bet the point I hit the point twice.

678
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,020
I'd through like fucking, I
dunno, 1215 numbers in a row,

679
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,400
you know,
I was bullshit

680
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,360
man. I had like five bucks on each fucking
thing or whatever I made and I made a

681
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,000
couple hundred bucks cause I was
too drunk to realize like, Bill,

682
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,000
you know what you're feeling it.
Why not throw down a little bit more?

683
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,210
But I didn't this many people
on the other end of the table.

684
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,580
Okay,

685
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,120
well going. Hey, you're built bar
your throat die. I go, that's right.

686
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:54,340
They're buttoned down.
Throw throwing numbers.

687
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,720
Let's talk at Shit.

688
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,180
Oh is that what a hell of a time tip and
people doing what you're supposed to do?

689
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,970
Laughing my ass off. I made
money. I went back over,

690
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:14,740
cashed out. I had like fucking
three, $100 bills in my pocket.

691
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,670
I have to starting off with my old
Hartford. So I guess it was up 200 bucks.

692
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,240
Now all of a sudden this shady dude
comes up to us who had this weird little

693
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:27,160
sodas, zipper scar in his nose and
he's handing us a fucking flyer.

694
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,560
Oh wait,
somewhere in there,

695
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:32,530
I met these two agent chicks and I
talked them back into their dreams.

696
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,020
I can't answer that. Um, just
one girl, she was an accountant.

697
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:42,460
She wanted to be in fashion. And I
was like, so go do that. She's like,

698
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:44,320
do you really think I carrot Mike?
Yeah.

699
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,030
You totally can just keep your day job
and just start working on the fashion

700
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:52,210
thing and then eventually fashion
thing will surpass your other thing.

701
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:56,590
She was like, you're so awesome.
And all I'm thinking in my head is,

702
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
this is why that fucking guy,

703
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,270
okay

704
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,690
was able to buy where the Houston Rockets
used to play and go in there and talk

705
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:09,190
about Jesus. What the fuck is that
guy's name? You know that guy, you know?

706
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,930
Oh, what is his fucking name?
He's got this squinty eyes.

707
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,050
He closes his eyes and he sits there.
You know,

708
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,140
Jesus wants you to have a popsicle.
He wants you it,

709
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,720
all they gotta do is just tell people
what they, what they want to hear.

710
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,090
And I was totally sincere.

711
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,090
Okay.

712
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,160
When I told this woman
to go follow her dreams,

713
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:31,680
but I didn't really give her
any sort of concrete plan.

714
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,810
All I did was just tell
her that she could do it.

715
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,130
Yeah.

716
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,210
And it made him feel good. So I did do
a good thing, but you know something I,

717
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:42,780
if the bottom falls out,
uh, of standup comedy,

718
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,450
that's what I'm gonna I'm going to
turn into a motivational speaker.

719
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,430
I would absolutely crush it because I
already know how to make people laugh.

720
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,630
And then rather than being a negative
content, I would totally turn it.

721
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,010
I would finally take off like,
you know,

722
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,460
you don't want Spiderman wears that
black suit and he can't control it.

723
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,770
And he starts acting like a con,
you know,

724
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,210
starts talking shit to women and
spraying web web juice in their face.

725
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,420
Then he goes back to the classic
red and blue and then he's like, oh,

726
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,300
I'm sorry about that sweetie.
Let me get that. Uh Oh shit.

727
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,740
I didn't finish that fucking story.

728
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,480
So this guy with a Goddamn zipper
stark scar on his fucking nose,

729
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,880
he convinces us to go to a titty bar,
which really wasn't difficult.

730
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,070
And next thing you know,
we're in this fucking

731
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,690
titty bar. And are these women
were really God damn aggressive.

732
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,090
Like the second you sat down, one of
them sat in your lap and I was like,

733
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:44,730
it was really, I'd be honest with
you, it's fucking suffocating.

734
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,330
Okay.

735
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,260
I actually, it's kind of like, Hey,

736
00:44:47,261 --> 00:44:50,290
can you fucking let me
just get my bearings here

737
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,830
before you put, quit trying to shake your
tits. They're fake. They're not moving.

738
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,520
All right. What do you do
next? Shake your elbow.

739
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:01,723
MMM.

740
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,350
So anyways,
we're in this fucking place

741
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,320
and uh, I dunno. I mean,

742
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,430
we're all guys, we don't give
a fuck. Next thing you know,

743
00:45:15,431 --> 00:45:19,600
it's like six o'clock in the
goddamn morning, six something.

744
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,610
We came walking out,

745
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:26,020
it was broad daylight and
I'm sitting there like,

746
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,440
the only thing I can relate it to
was when I was playing up in Alaska,

747
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,960
when,
uh,

748
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,070
when it was that one of those times
a year where it had like 22 hours of

749
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:41,970
sunlight and you were inside
the club and you drink it.

750
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:44,250
And it's about two in the morning.
Like, all right guys, I'm tired.

751
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,200
I'm going to bed.
And then you would walk outside.

752
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:51,030
You'd open the door into broad daylight
and immediately give body's clock,

753
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:54,390
you would wake up, he said at two
in the afternoon, two, two at night.

754
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:57,750
It seemed like two in the afternoon
is the only way I could describe it.

755
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:01,140
And I walked out and uh,

756
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,930
all I heard was Kevin Chaise.

757
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,850
Maniacal fucking laugh at
like how light it was out. Um,

758
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,430
so that was my,
basically,

759
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:13,770
that was my first night out here
and I gotta be honest with you,

760
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,580
I'm still recovering from it.
And that was two goddamn days ago.

761
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,980
Last night after a show, I was just like,
I sat down and I got something to eat.

762
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,640
I had one Budweiser and then I went to
bed and I was fucking psyched to come

763
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:32,340
back and go to bed. So that goes
back to what I was talking about.

764
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,060
So I have to dress maturely.
All right now,

765
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:38,160
like I was ever a guy walking
around in a tank top. I didn't,

766
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:42,480
I didn't have any fucking a pigment,
you know, but I gotta tell you,

767
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,410
you go down on the pool. Some people, I
don't know if they just have, they just,

768
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,240
they can't see it or if they just don't
give a fuck some of the shit that people

769
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,920
wear it down,
but by had got damn pool.

770
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,183
I mean

771
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,680
it's just like, can you put that all
of that shit away? Can you put it away?

772
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:02,960
Half the people at the pool,

773
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:06,110
it should be wearing like one of those
bathing suits from the roaring twenties

774
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,870
you know where it was basically it
was kind of a mechanic suit like that.

775
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,000
Fonzie used to wear that one z zip up,

776
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,810
except you would cut the sleeves
off and you would cut the legs off.

777
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,770
That's what guys would wear.

778
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:24,440
And women wear the same thing and they'd
have a little frilly thing going around

779
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,340
the outside. Now it's unreal, man.

780
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:34,060
Oh Jesus. And my generation, oof,
it's, it's ugly. The tramp stamps,

781
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,060
the Barb wire tattoo around your arm.

782
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,400
It's just a,
it's not a good fuck.

783
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,650
Good luck.
It's just not a good

784
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:52,970
[inaudible]

785
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,590
going on. It's Belper and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

786
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,670
August 23rd, 2010. How they hell are you,

787
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,420
what's going on? I just got
back from Portland, Oregon.

788
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,200
I'm actually taping this a Sunday night
cause I got a bunch of bullshit I have

789
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:15,034
to do tomorrow.

790
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,213
MMM.

791
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,970
I Dunno what the fuck I just got back
from Portland and I hate doing these

792
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:25,380
things Sunday night because I'm
still like jet lagged. I'm out of it.

793
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,850
So, uh, this is gonna be a rough
one and I'm plowing through this.

794
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:31,320
Even if it fucking sucks,

795
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,620
I'm not stopping it and rerecording it
like I did last week because that ended

796
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:38,040
up getting me in trouble.

797
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,420
That's how I started talking about
that doctor Laura Shit last week.

798
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:44,280
And I got to say for the first time,
maybe the second time ever,

799
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:47,520
I'm nominating myself as Douche bag of
the week because last week I actually

800
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:52,320
supported Dr Laura because I had no
fucking idea who she was. And uh,

801
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,700
you know, I was having a rough time
doing the podcast. I needed some fodder.

802
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,190
Somebody send me an email.
What do you think about this?

803
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:02,820
And I watched like a ten second clip of
evidently a five minute clip and I just

804
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:06,750
thought she was imitating
something, something she saw
on def jam. So I was like,

805
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:09,390
well, she's quoting it, she's
not calling anybody that word,

806
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:13,830
but the ban and all that bullshit.
And then Jay's Zola, Jesus,

807
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,690
the fucking emails came in

808
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:20,480
from a, I evidently, uh, for
my 14 podcasts listeners,

809
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:25,100
every will be like six of
them are African American. Um,

810
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:26,871
and uh,
yeah,

811
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:31,340
they read me the riot act in different
stages and dark got admit they were

812
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:33,350
fucking right. Cause I didn't,
I, you know, something,

813
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:37,280
my uninformed logic is usually funny that
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

814
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:40,850
about and I go off on shit and I realized
that our race probably isn't one that

815
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,600
you should probably do that on. I
didn't know that. She was like, uh,

816
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,620
like rush Limbaugh with a cunt.
I had no idea. I just, you know,

817
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,120
I don't know the fuck she was that she
was some soccer mom with a podcast,

818
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:58,670
you know, and she was like all the crazy
kids out there. Fucking blob applied.

819
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:03,530
No idea. Sorry. Fucking eggs
on my face. Um, but you know,

820
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:07,910
it's funny, one guy got so
into fucking trashing me. Wait,

821
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:09,230
before I close this email,

822
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:15,070
here's something I got from a former
marine talking about that clapping for uh,

823
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,860
the troops going through the
airport. He goes, as a former marine,

824
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:23,030
nothing was a bigger joke than seeing
those support, the support, the troops,

825
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:28,031
stickers talk about an empty
gesture and is even lamer.

826
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,040
I've always fucking thought those bumper
stickers was stupid. Support the troops.

827
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:33,630
She just slowly,

828
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:38,240
you go buy that for a buck slapping on
the back of your truck or car and then he

829
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:42,350
just drive away. Well, I did my
part. Do you support the troops?

830
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:47,360
Have you looked at my bumper
sticker will. All right then. Um,

831
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,800
yeah, that's fucking lame. And he said,
and clapping is even lamer. He said,

832
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:55,970
you're on the right track. Sending
over drinks to veterans who got back.

833
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:59,750
But think bigger. How about a
program called head for heroes?

834
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,220
That's right.
Every,

835
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,710
every service member returning from
whatever fucked up Third World Shit hole

836
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:11,950
we're engaged in at the time gets met at
the airport by some gorgeous whore and

837
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:15,140
blown in a specially designated area.

838
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,010
That would be a great way of
showing the country's gratitude.

839
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,340
You know what, I think if he can bail
the bankers out, give him $1 trillion,

840
00:51:23,341 --> 00:51:26,550
I think it's, you can get a couple
of fucking who is, you know,

841
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:31,380
forget about the girls who have a
fucking uniform fetish. Um, but anyways,

842
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:35,130
uh, yeah, so I got, I
got fucking trashed. Um,

843
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,110
I took a little heat off of Mel Gibson.

844
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:40,890
I bet that he caught a couple of
less a fucking hate mails last week.

845
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:44,460
So I apologize. I don't know who she is.
I'm not gonna Apologize For my stupidity,

846
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:47,190
but in the future when it's
something, you know, race related,

847
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,200
I will try to be a little more
informed. All right, well,

848
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,680
I got to find this fucking email. This
guy fucking trashed me, you know, he said,

849
00:51:55,870 --> 00:52:00,390
uh, let's see. He goes,
it starts off good.

850
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,090
Just trashing me, which I totally
get. He goes, just like in your bit,

851
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,400
you did about the Jimmy,
the Greek thing.

852
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,270
It's best for white people to just
leave it alone. Dr. Laura May be old,

853
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:13,200
but she's aware enough to
know what happens to white
people when they say the n

854
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:17,100
word or bring up racial supremacy
theories. See that's the part of the tape

855
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,243
watch

856
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,480
showed up late to that rally.
You know,

857
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,410
by the time I showed up they had
already put the cross out. You know,

858
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:30,050
everybody's hoods. They took
them off. It was a hot day.

859
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,780
I didn't know what I was walking into. It
thought it was like a fucking, you know,

860
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:36,740
Aa meeting or something. You know, we're
all over by the table. I haven't, don't,

861
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:40,430
it's my fault. I came
in late. Um, so anyways,

862
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,020
he said the porting comes out.

863
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:45,260
So I'm surprised you defended
Dr Laura in this case.

864
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:47,600
They asked where I got a lot of them.
Surprise you. Defend it or can we,

865
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:50,720
cause I watched eight seconds
of the tape cause I'm Maura. Um,

866
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:53,720
I don't understand why there's any
debate about racial inequality,

867
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,250
why any debate about racial inequality
always comes down to comedians and def

868
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:02,720
comedy jam. I don't think it does,
but evidently a in your world,

869
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,950
maybe it does. Um, I've heard
this argument before, well,

870
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:11,951
black comedians say this and that
about white people and say the n word,

871
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:17,930
why can I, is it fair for minority
Comedians, but put up into and all basic,

872
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:21,440
all that's all that shit. Uh, I'm
trying to get to this part here.

873
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,580
So then he was talking about this
documentary where some comic was saying,

874
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,310
you know, making a joke. This is actually
a good joke where white people like,

875
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:31,880
why can't I say the n word?
Uh,

876
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:32,810
okay.

877
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,640
And then the dude was like,
Oh, it was Chris Rock. Well,

878
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:38,840
why do you even want to say it? Right.
Great. Fucking joke. Totally makes sense.

879
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,670
Uh, then the punchline is, I've sailed
the world. I've fucked Raquel Welch.

880
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,330
If I could just say the n word,
my life would be complete. Uh,

881
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,270
then this dude writes after that,
he goes,

882
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:54,980
I think that it bothers white people
because you're not used to being told that

883
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,150
you can't do something.

884
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,900
Why people used to be able to
do and say anything they wanted.

885
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,940
Now there's all these rules.
Isn't that fucking that,

886
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,940
that part of the email, that's where it
just went off the fucking rails for me.

887
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:12,410
You know what I mean? It's like I
totally get it. She's a fucking idiot.

888
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,910
I didn't realize it cause I watched
that short little clip, you know,

889
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,960
I shouldn't have support that shit.
And, and you're offended by that,

890
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:24,680
which I totally get. And then
in the end, you make some dumb,

891
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:29,030
general generalization about white
people. See, we're all the same.

892
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:33,940
We're fucking morons.
Jesus Christ.

893
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,360
I've sailed the world. Fuck walk Calwell
see that parts of the joke, but this,

894
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:40,810
here's what he writes bothers white
people that you're not being used to told,

895
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,160
being told that you can't
do something. Oh yeah, yeah.

896
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:50,020
We just run around doing whatever the
fuck we want to do. It's great. Ah,

897
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,600
Jesus Christ.
That's,

898
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:55,720
that's one of the great stereotypes
is that we're all Kennedy's living on

899
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:57,850
fucking Martha's vineyard
rather than fucking

900
00:54:59,090 --> 00:54:59,640
okay.

901
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,180
You know,

902
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,510
the majority of white people aren't
the majority of white people sitting in

903
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:07,560
cubicles, not living their dream,
drowning in a sea of fucking debt,

904
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:10,530
trying to get health insurance. Isn't
that the majority of fucking white people?

905
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,570
Evidently not. Evidently according
to this guy, why people have yachts

906
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,910
sailing the world, all 300
million of us, you know,

907
00:55:22,911 --> 00:55:27,410
do you just see it during that, the Gulf
War, uh, the Gulf spill there, you know,

908
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,460
that was one of the biggest problem.
All those white people,

909
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:34,200
all the 300 million white people with our
fucking yachts, just sailing around. Oh,

910
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:36,450
it's so awesome to be white.
You can just walk. You do it,

911
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:40,680
say whatever you want to do.
It's fucking incredible. Um,

912
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,330
that's an argument I've, I've
gotten it to, uh, with the, um,

913
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,060
I think every fucking,
yeah.

914
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,350
Female comics, black comics,
every fight, they just go, yeah,

915
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:59,060
it's easy for you all. You
gotta do show up, man. Oh yeah.

916
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:01,940
That's all it is.
I don't even audition.

917
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,600
I just lay here and they
call me up and I'm like, why?

918
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:09,290
Why did you give me that part then?
Cause you're white. Here you go.

919
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:14,150
You don't have to work
for shit. Uh, you know,

920
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,720
that's that class. You know, that's that
fucking double standard right there. Okay,

921
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,580
now we're opening a whole
nother can of worms.

922
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,620
Let's talk race for the next
couple of weeks. People,

923
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:26,050
this oughta bring out a lot of ugliness.
That's that classic fucking like,

924
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,050
that's one of those statements like you,
if you flip that thing,

925
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,460
what you just said there,

926
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:34,390
that generalization that you made of
white people that basically what we just

927
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,350
sit around and they do.

928
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:39,070
People just give a shit and we can
do whatever the fuck we want to do.

929
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,410
You're basically going to
define us by the Illuminati.

930
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,320
Um,
if you flip that around,

931
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,800
it's somebody white says that about
another race of people than there were in

932
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:55,630
like a Mel Gibson situation. All right,
now I'm opening this up for discussion.

933
00:56:55,631 --> 00:57:00,040
I'm not opening this up for
fucking rednecks to come
on here and be like, yeah,

934
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,440
that's why the fuck I'm talking about.
I'm not saying it like that,

935
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:03,600
but what I'm saying,
you know what,

936
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:07,390
this is what I've learned traveling
the fucking Globe and by the globe,

937
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,990
I mean I went to two other continents
and went to Australia and Europe.

938
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,070
I did all my research with just white
people. All right? And uh, yeah,

939
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:23,050
I think pretty much people
are people. We're all the
same. You know, there's a few,

940
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:28,140
like very small percentage of people on
this planet are genuinely good people

941
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:31,900
and everybody else is pretty much full
of shit and everybody looks at everybody

942
00:57:31,901 --> 00:57:35,260
else and they think they got it
easier. And all you gotta do is, yeah,

943
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,310
you got to do is this,

944
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,940
I got to work twice as hard at this guy
and this guy does this. And you know,

945
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:40,990
no one wants to know

946
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,770
what I've learned. Well, you probably
don't to know because I'm a fucking moron.

947
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,930
But for what it's worth,

948
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:52,770
this is what I've learned in
life is that life isn't fair.

949
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,920
It's really fucking difficult.
But if you bust your ass,

950
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:00,540
you're going to make it on whatever
level you're going to fucking make it.

951
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:04,650
You surround yourself with positive
people and you don't fucking quit.

952
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,130
Somebody kicks you in the fucking chest,
you get back up again,

953
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:09,270
you don't walk right into his foot.

954
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:11,280
You go around finding
different fucking avenue,

955
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,610
or maybe you build your own avenue, you
do whatever you're going to fucking do.

956
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,180
And everybody's got different
starting positions and all that shit.

957
00:58:18,181 --> 00:58:21,900
And it isn't fucking fair and there's
nothing you can fucking do about it. But,

958
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:23,250
uh,
you know,

959
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:27,570
and there's some people who don't get
stuff because of who they are because

960
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,180
they're there. So the data,
they're fat and that they're,

961
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,460
they're fucking in an
Asian guy with one leg.

962
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,960
Okay. And he can't work at a God damn
fucking place where you get a fake Tan,

963
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,500
you know? Yeah. That shit definitely
fucking exist. But you know,

964
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:44,650
what are you going to do?
You know? But you know what?

965
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:48,610
I think most people don't make it because
they're fucking pussies and they just

966
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:51,820
tap out. You know? And I'm
talking about fucking wipe.

967
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:54,580
I'm actually talking mostly white people,
cause that's what I know, you know?

968
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:55,990
And I got, I got people, people I know,

969
00:58:55,991 --> 00:59:00,310
they just fucking quit and they've got
all these fucking excuses why they can't

970
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:02,710
fucking do it. And it's
like, no, you, you quit,

971
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:08,140
you got punched once in the face and then
you just fucking laid down and I going

972
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:12,130
to fucking blame everybody else. Right.
Does that make any fucking sense?

973
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,600
I'm trying to say something positive here.

974
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,120
Trying to be balanced where
it's like, I know, you know,

975
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:21,750
like female comics, they're always
fucking complaining. You know,

976
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:23,670
I can't tell you the amount
of fucking times I would,

977
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:27,180
I would be auditioning for festivals and
the industry becoming up to me going,

978
00:59:27,181 --> 00:59:29,790
we need funny women.
Where are the funny women?

979
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,870
And then they would pick a fucking
woman just cause they needed one.

980
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:37,590
Not because they were one of
the funnier fucking people.

981
00:59:37,591 --> 00:59:41,540
I'm not saying that female comics
aren't funny, but I'm just saying there,

982
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:45,660
there are examples. You know what?
You guys can all go fuck yourself.

983
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:48,690
I'm a balding redhead trying to get
into movies. All right? You know,

984
00:59:48,691 --> 00:59:51,390
cry me a fucking river. I
don't give a shit. All right?

985
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:54,480
But I was wrong about the
doctor Laura think okay.

986
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:59,790
When I start a fucking group crying
about how there's no fucking redheaded

987
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:03,900
action heroes out there. You know,
Jesus Christ. What's that fucking movie?

988
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,340
That's the number one
movie in the country.

989
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:09,540
They got 58 fucking action stars in there.
One of them can't be a redhead.

990
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,030
Couldn't have called up David Caruso to
show his pasty white ass walking up to

991
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,200
Arnold Schwartzenegger. Ah,
who gives a fuck? All right,
so there you go. That was,

992
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:26,940
that was my, that was my roundabout
apology. Uh, now, seriously,

993
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:27,950
I really felt bad about that.

994
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,580
Felt like an ignorant ass at rather than
just immediately come on and apologize.

995
01:00:32,581 --> 01:00:33,630
I left it up there for the week,

996
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:38,370
so I'd get my nice pounding from everybody
and uh, yeah. You know what I mean?

997
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:40,590
I fuck around and said a lot of
fucked up shit, but I, you know,

998
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:43,560
I'm trying to start your week off right.
I'm not trying to Piss you off,

999
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,980
although there's probably a lot of women
out there who would fucking disagree,

1000
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:50,580
but you know, it's a comedy. You
know, people, people get hurt.

1001
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:54,210
That's how it fucking works.
This is the worst apology ever,

1002
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,430
but it's coming from the heart.
All rights. Go Fuck Yourself.

1003
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,820
That's how we got to end it.
All right. I grew up in no hugs,

1004
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,590
so if I'm trying to be fucking nice,
it has to end with go fuck yourself.

1005
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,510
Um, speaking of go fuck yourself.
Um, I just got back from

1006
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,810
Portland, Oregon and I had a great
time up at the a helium comedy club,

1007
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:17,740
the grand opening helium
comedy club and Portland,

1008
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:21,190
Oregon is a city that I
have not worked in, um,

1009
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,380
in 10 years because there was no comedy
club for a guy in my situation to come

1010
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:31,180
in there and work. Uh, I, I did work,

1011
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:35,770
there was a local club there, but it
wasn't really a comedy club. It was,

1012
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:38,320
but it wasn't like the club on it.
This is basically what he would do.

1013
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:42,040
He would paper the room,
which is a, the showbiz term.

1014
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:45,670
He would just just call people up and I
talk about this last week I came fucking

1015
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:49,390
remember he would just call
people up and just say, you know,

1016
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:53,440
or have this whole team of telemarketers
call up people and tell them that they

1017
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:54,610
want a comedy show.

1018
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,630
And he would just call enough people
where he would fill up his room every

1019
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,450
fucking night of the week from
Tuesday through Sunday. And uh,

1020
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,670
everybody caddied got in for free and
then all he did was fucking just throw

1021
01:02:06,671 --> 01:02:10,390
food and drinks down their
fucking throats. And that's
how he makes his million.

1022
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:11,621
But meanwhile,

1023
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:16,110
the comedian stands on stage in front
of a bunch of fucking drunk overeaten

1024
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:20,020
jackasses who could give a fuck about
the show and had to go up there on a

1025
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:24,490
Tuesday night with a goddamn
whipping a chair, two shows, Friday,

1026
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:28,350
three shows Saturday the guy
when he wouldn't even let
you talk to the waitstaff,

1027
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:30,880
you think if you put a
comedian through that bullshit,

1028
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,460
they can at least try to get fucking leg,
you know,

1029
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,860
try to get a little bit of action.

1030
01:02:35,861 --> 01:02:38,440
He fucking cock block young
like nine different levels.

1031
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,200
It's a fucking horrific gig
is what I'm telling you.

1032
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:44,650
And then the second you got a
TV credit and you said, hey,

1033
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,120
can I have an extra quarter?
The next time I fly across the country.

1034
01:02:49,121 --> 01:02:53,350
And then the guide, he just wouldn't
return your phone call. So he basically,

1035
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,700
other than up and coming guys would
just be booking horrific talent.

1036
01:02:57,701 --> 01:03:02,701
So Portland has been really starved
for any sort of national headliners.

1037
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,860
So now there's a new club out there and
I was really excited to be the first guy

1038
01:03:05,861 --> 01:03:09,640
to come to town and uh,
and have, uh, you know,

1039
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,350
work the comedy club.

1040
01:03:11,351 --> 01:03:15,010
And I had no idea how bad that other
club was until I talked to some of the

1041
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:18,990
younger comics. This guy told him,
he walked in there to do with spotty,

1042
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,780
moved up from, uh, from host to feature.

1043
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,960
And that club owner guy calls
him and he's like, look,

1044
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:29,200
I make $1 million a
year just selling food.

1045
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:35,560
That's what he said.
When you get on stage,

1046
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,360
no f bombs that just reads them the
fucking riot act. It's, it was horrible.

1047
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,910
It's great business model.
He's made his money,

1048
01:03:42,911 --> 01:03:45,850
but it's fucking horrible for
the development of Comedians.

1049
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:47,980
He's just sitting on their fucking chest

1050
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,940
and their dicks. He's not even let them
get fucking lay. What did I, you know,

1051
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:56,970
just asshole fucking asshole.
Um,

1052
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,310
so it's great that there's a new comedy
club out there and that the, you know,

1053
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,210
there's another place for these comics
to work and that they can actually see

1054
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:06,110
national headlines.

1055
01:04:06,111 --> 01:04:09,650
Cause that was a fucking big thrill for
me when I was back in Boston. So, uh,

1056
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,640
so if you live in the Portland area,
you know, if you're a lumberjack,

1057
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:17,990
climbed down out of the fucking tree
and come on down and do a helium comedy

1058
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:21,470
club. It's a great club. And uh,
he's got C's. Who's he got next week?

1059
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,640
He's got a Jimmy Pardot.

1060
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,390
Yeah.

1061
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:30,820
Is who he's got Jimmy Pardot a
right. Is that what it is? What?

1062
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:35,080
I think there was one
other person, um, oh,

1063
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:35,980
Reggie watts.

1064
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:41,010
Reggie rots on Wednesday and then Jimmy
Pardot from the never not funny podcast.

1065
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:44,170
Jesus Christ. I'm losing my goddamn
memory. I knew there was somebody else.

1066
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,020
So go check out those
shows next week and uh,

1067
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,450
support a comedy club. That actual books.
Somebody who's funny and on television.

1068
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,760
All right, low plowing ahead here. Um,

1069
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,950
what's the next thing on the docket? I
really have, I don't have shit this week.

1070
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,430
Do I? One of my 17 minutes
in. That's not bad.

1071
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,360
You gonna fucking tap out
at 40 minutes yet. You know,

1072
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,780
you guys don't go home early every once
in awhile and just fake a fucking injury

1073
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:15,040
at work. Try to pretend like a
forklift drove over you some shit.

1074
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,520
You know what I really wanted to do was
I wanted to look that five hour energy

1075
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,170
here on the Internet,
five hour energy.

1076
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,630
Now this is how I do my research now.

1077
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:30,631
Five hour energy I think is a liquid
cocaine and I think it really fucks with

1078
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:36,100
you. I think it's bad. So, um,

1079
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,120
rather than just look up five
hour energy consumer reports,

1080
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:45,130
I'm going to search five
hour energy unhealthy. See,

1081
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:46,840
and this is how most people do research.

1082
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:50,140
They already have their mind made up
and then they just read shit that agrees

1083
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:50,974
with them.

1084
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:51,800
Yeah.

1085
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:56,450
You know, according to a fuck
face.com um, I'm exactly right.

1086
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:01,820
Side effects to five hour energy drink
shots. Are they unhealthily unhealthy?

1087
01:06:01,821 --> 01:06:06,740
Let's read this one. This is the first
one that came up. Side effects of 500 to,

1088
01:06:06,741 --> 01:06:07,191
okay.

1089
01:06:07,191 --> 01:06:12,191
I was at lunch today and my friend was
trying to get someone to drink five hour

1090
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:14,240
energy caffeine shot.
So I,

1091
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:19,330
I opened it and smelled it and
said I'd give it a shot anyways,

1092
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,190
I think he's supposed
to mix them in a drink,

1093
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:25,760
but I straight chage that chugged
it and almost gagged from the taste.

1094
01:06:25,761 --> 01:06:29,900
After I swallowed it, it took me like
50 minutes to get that horrible taste.

1095
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:34,250
Uh, out of my mouth. I tried
eating food, chewing gum, drinking,

1096
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,370
but the tastes stayed in my
mouth for like 40 minutes.

1097
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:38,830
Okay.

1098
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:41,230
I felt sick every time I
thought about the taste.

1099
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,320
I think the taste bothered me so
much. Uh, Jesus, why you do research?

1100
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:45,360
Are you going to get to the part?

1101
01:06:45,361 --> 01:06:47,230
We had the heart attack so
I can feel like I'm right.

1102
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:49,370
Yeah,

1103
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:53,900
take the taste bothered me so
much caffeine. But anyways,

1104
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:56,510
I'm shy. So after the tastes
and the sickness wore off,

1105
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:02,050
I was feeling great all day and I felt
probably the happiest I have all school

1106
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,240
year because all my subtle tendencies
wore off and I acted more outgoing and

1107
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:10,760
funny like I do around friends.

1108
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,120
They just turn this dude
into a fucking coke head.

1109
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:19,950
That's classic reason why people
do drugs. Helps me loosen up, man.

1110
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:23,050
I could talk to the chicks.
Um,

1111
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,990
there's nothing on here.
Are you shitting me?

1112
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:31,200
Oh,
gives a fuck.

1113
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:32,400
Okay.

1114
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,700
I just, you know, why don't
you get eight hours sleep?

1115
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,470
Why don't you do want to just start
that? You know, I had somebody else,

1116
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:43,680
another mother call in a or call in or
write in going back to that fucking that

1117
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:48,360
shit I said about stay at home moms and
once again they were doing, she was,

1118
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:51,840
she was saying, I totally agree with you.
I understand. You're absolutely right.

1119
01:07:51,841 --> 01:07:54,780
They have no right to be come saying
it's the most difficult job ever.

1120
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:59,460
And then she wrote three paragraphs about
how difficult it is to be a mother and

1121
01:07:59,461 --> 01:08:04,080
to be worrying up in having
the responsibility of
another life. And it's like,

1122
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:07,500
I like, I don't, I get it. I know I don't
totally get it cause I don't have a kid.

1123
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:10,530
But you know
enough already.

1124
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:11,830
Yeah.

1125
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,990
All right. Like that other listeners
said, you chose to be a mother.

1126
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,110
You know you're acting like a,

1127
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,600
all of a sudden you've got
like a fucking terminal disease

1128
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,930
and all you're doing is bringing up
the bad shit. What about when you have,

1129
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,120
you have a bad day and you
come home and that kid with,

1130
01:08:27,121 --> 01:08:31,050
you know all that innocent just looks at
you and just thinks you're bigger than

1131
01:08:31,051 --> 01:08:34,870
life. What about that? Doesn't
that, that, that you know?

1132
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:35,830
Yeah.

1133
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:39,850
Wash away some of the spittle
on your shoulder blade.

1134
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,620
I don't fucking know.
You know, it's funny,

1135
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,980
actually ironic was I just watching 60
minutes and they have one of those guys

1136
01:08:46,981 --> 01:08:50,640
on the fucking BP oil rig and I
said when they jumped off of it,

1137
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:54,740
it was the equivalent of jumping off
a three story fucking brownstone.

1138
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,440
Evidently it's the equivalent of
jumping off a 10 story fucking building.

1139
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,060
That's what they did.

1140
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,940
That was their choice standing there
in the middle of the Goddamn Ocean.

1141
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,620
Either I burn up. All right, jump into
the fucking oily water without, oh,

1142
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,813
it was brutal.

1143
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:14,030
Okay, so while you mom stand the
fuck down, stop giving me shit.

1144
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:15,410
I was just fucking joking around.

1145
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,030
I'm just gonna have to end up
apologizing to everybody here. You know,

1146
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,190
I had somebody writing to
me today from a New Zealand.

1147
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,270
It's podcast is really going to be random.
Somebody wrote it from a New Zealand.

1148
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:32,230
I was thinking about this topic that from
people and all these random countries

1149
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,070
who listened to this podcast.

1150
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,970
I'm going to start nominating who I think
the coolest person from your country

1151
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:42,800
is. And with new New Zealand,
I think it's a no brainer.

1152
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:46,100
It's Phil Rudd.
You don't get any cooler than that guy.

1153
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:52,310
He's played the exact same drum beat for
fucking 35 years and he's such a tough

1154
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,370
bastard that no one has the balls
to tell him to switch it up.

1155
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:01,520
You don't feel like, how about boom chuck,
boom, check, check. Yet. How about that

1156
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:08,120
fucking guy? The whole fucking,
the whole goddamn album.

1157
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,690
I think he just goes in there.
Right?

1158
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:14,870
And he just starts fucking playing
that beat and then they just,

1159
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,650
they just play the whole song.
The whole fucking album worth of socks.

1160
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,200
Yeah.

1161
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,260
And then when they're done, they
just, they just start yelling, fell,

1162
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,630
fail. It's over. We're done.
Yeah. We made another album

1163
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,420
and he's just like, oh, all right. Yeah.
It's just starts breaking down his kit.

1164
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,170
Oh Geez. I got nothing. I
really riffing about Phil Rudd.

1165
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:39,240
There was some of the worst

1166
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,900
beat box and you're ever going to fucking
here. Um Oh, here we go. You know what?

1167
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,940
I got to read this right here.
Now I got something.

1168
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:49,630
This will take up a good three fucking
minutes. You know what? I liked it.

1169
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:52,960
This podcast is this difficult. Now
you guys can relate to me. You know,

1170
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:55,480
you sitting there and your Goddamn
cubicles on a fucking Monday,

1171
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,510
unless you're white, of course
you're out on your yacht. You know,

1172
01:10:58,511 --> 01:11:00,000
chat it up with a Kennedy.

1173
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,050
Hey, when's the stock market going
to crash again? Give me the heads up.

1174
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,710
Don't tell the Puerto Ricans.
That's what it's like.

1175
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,690
That's exactly what it's like.

1176
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:12,930
Okay.

1177
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,010
There's not white people

1178
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,830
work in farms,
slaves to corporations.

1179
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:24,220
No, not at all. Not at all. All you
do you, you don't have to get up.

1180
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,061
You don't have to get up.

1181
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:28,630
I spent nine years in bed just because
I was white and they just fucking

1182
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:31,330
hilarious.
I made more money then than when I worked.

1183
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,130
That's how great it is to be white.

1184
01:11:33,131 --> 01:11:38,131
It's so fucking easy and thank
God for people who aren't white,

1185
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,610
who've never been white to tell
me what it's like to be white.

1186
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,430
It's fucking awesome.

1187
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,810
Let me tell you something about being
white white guy is how good it is.

1188
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:54,973
Oh yeah.

1189
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:59,330
What do you reincarnated was
your name frank and another life.

1190
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:03,930
Um, is that a white guy name? I don't
fucking know. All right. So anyway,

1191
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:07,400
so I've pissed off a bunch of
people and uh, I just want to,

1192
01:12:07,401 --> 01:12:11,460
I just want to try to redeem myself
and show you that it's not all bad. I,

1193
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:15,550
that's not all bad. You know, I do inspire
some people. Uh, here's one for you.

1194
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:19,550
Milk white thighs is the name of this.
This email,

1195
01:12:19,551 --> 01:12:21,900
somebody sent me a, it
said bill. A few things. A,

1196
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:26,360
the last five years I've been
six feet tall, 240 pounds.

1197
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:30,200
I print trying to work out with
no results and no willpower.

1198
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,090
I usually lose five pounds,
give up and sit in each shit.

1199
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:40,250
However, you talked on the podcast a few
weeks ago about Bill Clinton and Al Gore

1200
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,320
sloshing around the White House.

1201
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,180
I believe I said sashaying around the
White House with their milky white hips.

1202
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,880
Um, I was in a quiet room with
about 15 people and blurted,

1203
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:57,170
blurt, laughed out loud, laughed
loudly, blurt laughed loudly.

1204
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:01,130
That's really worded strangely. You
burst out laughing. There we go.

1205
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:05,240
Ever since then. How will
be sitting, watching TV,

1206
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,750
looking at my treadmill
and I will say to myself,

1207
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:13,900
slosh your ass up there and work off those
milky white hips or something to that

1208
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:18,200
effect. It makes me laugh every time
and realize how pathetic I've been.

1209
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,880
It's been about three weeks.

1210
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:23,510
If this every day and 45
minutes on the treadmill,

1211
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:27,590
I'm down to 208 pounds.
Well,

1212
01:13:27,591 --> 01:13:32,060
on my way to my goal of
a hub of a buck 80. Also,

1213
01:13:32,061 --> 01:13:33,980
I'm a dude and my name is Lindsey.

1214
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:36,650
I know you don't have a
lot of female listeners,

1215
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:40,280
so if you ever feel like you need a
quote or just a woman's approval on

1216
01:13:40,281 --> 01:13:44,960
something, you do, feel free
to use my name and just say,
yeah, this chick Lindsay,

1217
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:48,170
I know this chick Lindsay who digs it.
Uh,

1218
01:13:48,171 --> 01:13:52,070
I'm more than willing to compromise my
sexuality for the furthering of your

1219
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:54,110
career.
Um,

1220
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,000
I would buy five of anything, Bill burrs
endorsing. All right, there you go.

1221
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:03,350
There's a good email. Congratulations.
You're down to 208. Keep going.

1222
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,900
And, uh, I'm glad. You know,

1223
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,190
I'm glad I just didn't bring all
negativity to the podcast this past week.

1224
01:14:10,191 --> 01:14:13,780
I felt fucking horrible about that even
though I've been kind of a cunt again

1225
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:18,400
this week. That's what I do. You
know, you came back, didn't you?

1226
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,120
You know, I don't know any better.
I'm just a white guy laying in bed.

1227
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,080
I can't remember the last time
I've had disappointment in my life.

1228
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,880
It just doesn't happen. Just
doesn't happen, you know? You know,

1229
01:14:35,881 --> 01:14:40,170
sometimes the sale on my schooner
will break and I'm just like,

1230
01:14:40,171 --> 01:14:44,010
oh Jesus Christ. And then I call the
government and I say, can you, uh,

1231
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,640
can you send me another one? They're like,
white and what color are you? I said,

1232
01:14:46,641 --> 01:14:51,500
why they guy? There you
go. Right on the way.

1233
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:56,150
You know, I agree with the first half of
the email. This guy I'm making fun of,

1234
01:14:56,151 --> 01:14:59,570
but I would love to send this guy
my fucking taxes. I really would.

1235
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,210
These mother fuckers,

1236
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,020
what a lot of people don't realize is
that rich people feel there's enough rich

1237
01:15:06,021 --> 01:15:10,790
people and they got all kinds of fucking,
they take a fucking pipe,

1238
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:13,010
Tia.
God damn knees every fucking quarter.

1239
01:15:13,011 --> 01:15:16,040
They make sure they can only be,

1240
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:20,330
they can only be a certain number or
a fucking rich people unless you just

1241
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:23,630
invent some shit like,
uh, I dunno. I Dunno what

1242
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,770
if you come up with the technology
for the fucking iPod then even then,

1243
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,460
I mean they'll just, they'll just,
hi. Yon Is like a scientist, right?

1244
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:35,490
I'm really getting to know over my
fucking head here. You know what I mean?

1245
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,180
Do you come up with Facebook? If you
reinvent that? I think that's the way,

1246
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:41,730
now that you can actually become fucking
rich, but I'll tell you right now,

1247
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,510
it's not fucking telling jokes.
Fucking assholes.

1248
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:51,880
Fucking assholes.
Goddamn fucking quarter.

1249
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:56,480
I gotta I gotta. Oh Gee. I
am my man to get into it.

1250
01:15:56,481 --> 01:16:01,040
I'm not going to fucking get it. Just
give me some me so fucking mad your time.

1251
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:02,660
I think I'm getting
ahead. Look at me. Yeah,

1252
01:16:02,661 --> 01:16:06,110
I'm getting the hey a fucking sit down.
That's what they do every quarter.

1253
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,800
You sit the fuck down. You stay
right where you're at. Hey,

1254
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:15,010
sit right where you're at.
It's what it is. Anybody else?

1255
01:16:15,011 --> 01:16:18,910
This isn't even a color thing. Anybody
else in the fucking middle class you go,

1256
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,770
it's fucking rich pricks

1257
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,200
fucking less goddamn eight years and then
making a ton of fucking money and then

1258
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:30,840
all of a sudden the shit hits the
fan and they run out of the God damn

1259
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:34,170
restaurant. Leave everybody
else with the fucking check.

1260
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:40,840
Fucking unbelievable.
My ever going to get that fucking car.

1261
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,071
I'll tell you.

1262
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:45,460
And I got off the plane today and somebody
had the dodge challenger in the all

1263
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:49,660
white, like the vanishing point guys ever
see that movie with that Dude Kowalski.

1264
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,630
He's got an all white charger.
So they did this tribute to,

1265
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:57,260
it's all fucking white and the guy
had these fucking rims on it and uh,

1266
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:58,730
okay.

1267
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,510
I just sat there drooling at it. My
girl's looking at me like, she's like,

1268
01:17:02,511 --> 01:17:06,950
Jesus Christ, you were obsessed
with that car. It's like, yeah,

1269
01:17:06,951 --> 01:17:10,920
you know I am. Okay. Well,
you know, I'm standing here.

1270
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:14,790
You just got off the plane. You
could say hello to me, you know?

1271
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:20,220
Oh, you know what that reminds me of. I
fucking went to go to this pizza place.

1272
01:17:20,221 --> 01:17:24,240
I really try to do fun things. When I
was in Portland, tried to be healthy.

1273
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:28,620
I went for a fucking hike. I was
sticking with my smoothies, you know,

1274
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,880
dropping pounds here and uh,

1275
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:34,390
okay.

1276
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:37,510
Anyway, somebody tells me that in, in
Portland, they have this fucking room.

1277
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,530
They got this pizza parlor where they
had the best God damn pizza and all the

1278
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:42,460
fucking northwest.

1279
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:47,350
So this guy has like this homemade God
damn doe and he only makes so much of it

1280
01:17:47,351 --> 01:17:50,860
every day. And when he's done making
the dough, he's done making pizza.

1281
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:55,750
Go Fuck Yourself. All right. So
I'm like, you know, well shit,

1282
01:17:55,751 --> 01:18:00,550
I got to try this pizza. So I go on the
Internet, I look up, I see where it is.

1283
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,900
It's right on Hawthorne Street.

1284
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:03,390
Okay.

1285
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:08,040
Like 45th and Hawthorne, 46 and Hawthorne,
something like that. Right. So I'm like,

1286
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:10,440
alright, I gotta go check this
fucking thing out. So I allow,

1287
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:15,470
I get myself an hour and a half before
the show to get there to get a God damn

1288
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:17,760
pizza. Right? It's a fucking pizza. Okay.

1289
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:22,290
So I call up just something told
me to cut just to call this place.

1290
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:27,030
And uh, I call up the, it rings like 11,

1291
01:18:27,031 --> 01:18:31,750
12 fucking times and nobody
picks up. So I'm like, Eh,

1292
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:34,240
you know what, the probably busy, no big
deal. I got an a, I'm, I'll get there.

1293
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:36,900
We're an hour and a half before,
right? I get a goddamn cab.

1294
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,470
I'm driving over there. Cab driver
goes, oh, just to let you know,

1295
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:42,900
this guy's kind of like the
pizza Nazis, like, like the,

1296
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:46,860
like the fucking a soup Nazi on Seinfeld.

1297
01:18:46,861 --> 01:18:50,250
So I show up and I walk in. Lo
and behold, the place is packed,

1298
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:55,110
but I see this little two top gets up,
waitresses cleaning off the table.

1299
01:18:55,111 --> 01:18:57,360
She walks away.
So I go over and I sit down

1300
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,140
getting ready to order the pizza.

1301
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:03,350
I'm checking out what people are ordering
of getting excited is what I'm trying

1302
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:06,830
to tell you. And then the waitress
comes over, she's like, um,

1303
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,020
were you over in the waiting room next
door or did you just like walk in here

1304
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:16,910
and sit down? And I was like, um, I
just came in and sat down. She goes,

1305
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:20,840
yeah, I'm, you have to like sign in, um,

1306
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:23,500
next door and all those people,
everything's,

1307
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:27,380
everything's a question you'd
have to like sign in next door.

1308
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:32,570
And I'm like, oh, all right. I go, well,
how long is the wait? She's like, wow,

1309
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:36,710
I can't really like say it's, you
know, it's kind of busy at that point.

1310
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:39,740
It's like a quarter of it go, well, I
got to show at eight to quarter to seven.

1311
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:44,510
Am I going to have time to order a
pizza and eat it? She's like, yeah,

1312
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,470
now,
now and um,

1313
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:54,420
and then that's when my blood starts
fucking boiling because I realized what I

1314
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:56,460
just walked into.
You know what I walked into?

1315
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:01,610
I walked into the pizza version of
pink's hot dogs out here in fucking La,

1316
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,520
the pizza version of
magnolia bakery in new city,

1317
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,640
all that fucking place.
We get the hot dogs in Chicago,

1318
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,233
you know,

1319
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,130
hour and 15 minutes to make a
fucking pizza. You can't do that.

1320
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,770
Sky's sitting here acting like,
you know,

1321
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,160
like he's making some sort of gourmet
food out. I'll tell you right now,

1322
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:30,990
that's my overrated for the fucking week.
Standing in line at any restaurant.

1323
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:34,110
These, you know, the, the, the
breakfast place in your neighborhood.

1324
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,030
You girlfriend's like,
oh my God,

1325
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:41,210
the stuffed French toast is to die for
and you stand there and fucking line,

1326
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,560
never worth it. It's never
worth the hype. Okay?

1327
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:50,400
If you learn anything from this podcast
other than I'm an ignorant asshole,

1328
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:55,140
don't ever stand in line for
fucking food. Okay? And less some,

1329
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:57,090
there's a natural disaster.

1330
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,750
The places flooded and this dis
scooping out fucking pea soup.

1331
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,300
You know when you're putting
it into your baseball hat,

1332
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:06,780
then you'll stand in line. Soup
kitchen. You stand in life,

1333
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,050
but don't stand outside these fucking
places. It's stupid. It's never worth it.

1334
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,720
You know, fancy restaurants. You
don't stand outside. You call up,

1335
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:13,920
you make a fucking reservation.

1336
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,590
But I'm not standing out there
like I'm waiting to fucking,

1337
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,410
did they even make God damn sense.
You know what I mean?

1338
01:21:20,411 --> 01:21:24,250
It's fucking people in New
York. They stand outside for
90 minutes for a cupcake,

1339
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:26,740
for fucking cupcake.
It's gone in three seconds.

1340
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,700
You know it's going to Piss me off.
Is some people in Portland. Okay.

1341
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:34,180
They're actually going to figure out
what pizza parlor I'm talking about and

1342
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:36,670
then they're going to tile. Tell me,
dude, it's totally fucking worth it.

1343
01:21:36,671 --> 01:21:38,690
These low self esteem Douche bags

1344
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:45,330
who just allow themselves to get totally
treated like absolute fucking shit for

1345
01:21:45,911 --> 01:21:48,790
pizza. Yeah. Sorry,

1346
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:51,550
I can't make you a pizza
within an hour and 15 minutes.

1347
01:21:51,551 --> 01:21:54,490
We know what fuck you
and your fucking pizza.

1348
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:56,950
What are you think about that and
your number one goddamn rating.

1349
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:00,700
I got a pizza hut.
Eat their fucking slop.

1350
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,610
You have to kill him. He is that. I
know. I'm going to have to go back.

1351
01:22:05,611 --> 01:22:08,130
I have to try it.
People hyped it so much.

1352
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,040
That's what I'm really
mad about is as I know.

1353
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,290
As much as I just fucking
talked about that shit.

1354
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:16,170
I'm going to have to go back
there and go get it and for all.

1355
01:22:16,171 --> 01:22:19,410
You guys wander and yelled at
Magnolia. It's, it's a great cupcake,

1356
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:20,580
but it's not that great.

1357
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,530
It's not that great to have to stand there
and listen to that awful conversation.

1358
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:29,310
Now if people driving by looking
at you trying to figure it out,

1359
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:30,600
what are they standing in line for?

1360
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:33,003
You know,

1361
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,840
is the president,
they're doing a book signing.

1362
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,070
Is there a porn star there? I was going
to blow you at the front of the line.

1363
01:22:42,071 --> 01:22:45,460
Can I raise the stakes for something
funny within the last seven minutes?

1364
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,640
All right. Fuck this. Fuck
this podcast. Here we go.

1365
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,030
Why don't I nominate some youtube
videos for the week? Everyone. Um,

1366
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,850
I have a ton of them and I'm going to
make the bold rex Ryan statement that I

1367
01:22:57,851 --> 01:23:00,130
think pretty goddamn soon if not already.

1368
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:04,750
The MLM podcast.com is going to have the
best fucking youtube video collection

1369
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,490
of youtube videos.

1370
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,060
Okay.

1371
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,680
All right. I mean cause you
guys are on the cutting edge.

1372
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:14,160
A lot of these videos that you guys
send me, they only got like, you know,

1373
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,330
10,000 to 40,000 fucking hit.

1374
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:19,530
Some of them have like a hundred
thousand or so like that.

1375
01:23:19,531 --> 01:23:22,050
And even a few with a million. But if
they're really funny, I don't give a shit,

1376
01:23:22,051 --> 01:23:23,910
but I think that we're on the
cutting edge of some shit.

1377
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,570
Like here's two that I found that
have, you know, only, you know,

1378
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:33,090
in the tens of thousands of hits. So
I'm assuming you haven't seen them. Uh,

1379
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,430
look up a prank of the century.

1380
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:41,400
This woman puts on a mask and scares the
shit out of this other woman and it's,

1381
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,690
you gotta watch it. It's fucking
great. And then piss off.

1382
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,590
Pissed off. Cat freaks
out. Look up that one.

1383
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:55,460
Um, and we got a lot of people,
you guys like violence shit.

1384
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,430
I'm trying to categorize
them now. Um, and by the way,

1385
01:23:58,431 --> 01:24:01,640
the man podcast is the official fan
page or the Monday morning podcast.

1386
01:24:01,641 --> 01:24:02,474
If you don't wanna have to,
you know,

1387
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:05,630
it's a pain in the ass to go on youtube
and try to find six different videos,

1388
01:24:05,631 --> 01:24:09,170
right? Typing it in and all
that shit. You're going to
get caught. You're at work,

1389
01:24:09,171 --> 01:24:11,860
you're not supposed to be doing it.
But if he just subtly type in the MLM,

1390
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,710
podcast.com and nobody's fucking looking,

1391
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,750
all of them are going to be right there.
And you can watch one after another,

1392
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:20,870
you know, or we can make it
last the whole fucking day.

1393
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,590
You can even drink that five hour fucking
energy and just start screaming at

1394
01:24:24,591 --> 01:24:29,390
your screen if you want. It's
all up to you. Um, so anyways,

1395
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:33,350
uh, he has a couple of, for you fight
fans out here. I will start slow,

1396
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:37,700
look up a choke slam.
Um,

1397
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:39,170
I hope that's the name
of the fucking video.

1398
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:43,940
Just this referee roughing a
fight and this it's choke slam.

1399
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,780
Look it up. All right. Uh,

1400
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:52,880
his kind of a cute one says little
girl boxer. It's actually a boy.

1401
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:56,450
His name's pretty boy. Bam, Bam. And
you got to look at this fucking kid.

1402
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,580
This kid would kick the shit.

1403
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:02,780
Just imagine this kid fighting
another fifth grader. Um,

1404
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,970
and this is the most insane one.

1405
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:11,200
Boston Street fight guy with bat does
damage Boston Street fight guy with bat as

1406
01:25:14,241 --> 01:25:19,160
in baseball. Bat does damage. Um,

1407
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:23,180
what else do we got?
Some ridiculous is something ridiculous.

1408
01:25:23,181 --> 01:25:24,830
Swollen in south Philly.

1409
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:29,810
It's a guy walking around like he's got
a fucking hard on having conversations

1410
01:25:29,811 --> 01:25:32,600
with people. Sort of an old
bit. I've seen it done before,

1411
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:37,010
but this guy does a great um,
wrestling fans.

1412
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:41,660
We've got two for you.
A mature man on Coke and uh,

1413
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:45,050
ultimate warriors. Confession
is absolutely fucking brilliant.

1414
01:25:45,051 --> 01:25:48,980
You got to look at that one. And uh, Oh,

1415
01:25:48,981 --> 01:25:52,940
more violence office worker goes insane.
Second Angle.

1416
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,590
Evidently there's some new
footage. Uh, what else?

1417
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,940
Oh, this is a great one. Look up the
turtle man. This one might be my favorite.

1418
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,630
This guy's missing all his front teeth.

1419
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,330
And when you find out how
he's missing his teeth,

1420
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:12,950
it's just one of the great stories
that he'd, he'd just alludes to it.

1421
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:13,731
It's fucking awesome.

1422
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:18,330
It's just this redneck who just
fucking catches turtles and a,

1423
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,210
I swear to God,

1424
01:26:21,211 --> 01:26:24,330
I would pay admission to sit on the
side of the pond and just watch this guy

1425
01:26:24,331 --> 01:26:28,350
catching turtles. It's fucking hilarious.
And I actually getting the covers,

1426
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:30,540
we were talking about the
worst covers of all time.

1427
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,970
Here's a great one of the
best covers I've ever seen,

1428
01:26:32,971 --> 01:26:37,080
just as far as being creative.
Look up a stairway to heaven,

1429
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:41,340
the beatniks and that's all
one word, B, e, a. T. N. I x.

1430
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:44,220
It's fucking cool as hell.
It's really fucking cool.

1431
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:49,050
They do stairway to heaven the way the
Beatles would do it. It's really fucking,

1432
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,680
I dunno, it's really creative. Um,

1433
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,560
and speaking of movies,
here's one for you is, uh,

1434
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:01,140
I got in this conversation
with somebody on the Internet.

1435
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:05,190
They sent me an email and they were
talking about how, uh, you know,

1436
01:27:05,191 --> 01:27:06,030
they're not married yet,

1437
01:27:06,031 --> 01:27:08,430
so they're kind of hanging out with
people who are younger than them,

1438
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,700
so they get a little bummed out when
they make references to movies that

1439
01:27:11,701 --> 01:27:16,020
nobody's seen before. So, uh, he started
showing him some of the classics,

1440
01:27:16,021 --> 01:27:18,600
like the dirty dozen and that type
of shit. And he asked me, you know,

1441
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:23,430
what are some of the great fucking
movies, uh, I should recommend.

1442
01:27:23,431 --> 01:27:27,810
What then led it to like music
and that type of shit. And, uh,

1443
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,530
here's a new topic for you. Is
it? Do you guys have like songs?

1444
01:27:31,531 --> 01:27:34,390
You must have these, these fucking
songs that the second you hear them,

1445
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:38,460
you can't hear the song without thinking
of the movie. You know what I mean?

1446
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,640
Of course you do. Here I'll, I'll give
you a classic fucking example and uh,

1447
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:47,190
I think even the broads will know
this one. Did I get rid of it?

1448
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:50,700
I had it all fucking cute up.
I really am the worst.

1449
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:52,890
Can I ever do this?

1450
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:57,090
This is why I started off in fucking
radio and then my career quickly ended

1451
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,550
because I would do the whole beginning.

1452
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:05,150
You're listening to 6:40 AM
WACB a broadcast service.

1453
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:09,840
The fucking whatever the fuck I
used to say. Hang on a second.

1454
01:28:09,841 --> 01:28:11,730
Let me get to youtube. God dammit, Bill.

1455
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:13,700
Yeah.

1456
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:17,930
And now there's a lull. See what happens.
You know what a play the other one. Well,

1457
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,650
no, I can't do that at the end and
ability to do that shit. All right,

1458
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:23,860
let me set the mic down. Hang
on a second. All right. Do you,

1459
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:26,480
why don't you act like you're
working for once. All right,

1460
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,730
now I'm yelling at you cause I fucked up.

1461
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:34,470
What the hell's the name of that
fucking Saba. Oh, something.

1462
01:28:34,471 --> 01:28:38,870
Something. Something.
Something air. It is. I got it.

1463
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:43,010
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

1464
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:45,703
Yeah.

1465
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:48,410
Ah, you fucking can't come on. Come up.

1466
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,350
Should I edit this out?

1467
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:55,920
You know what this is
like is when you fucking,

1468
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:59,280
someone just told you what their name
is and then somebody you know comes

1469
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:03,060
walking in and you go to introduce and
you have no fucking idea who they are.

1470
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:04,550
Okay.

1471
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:06,290
That's how I'm speaking
right now. All right. What,

1472
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:08,060
what movie does this remind you of?
Instantly.

1473
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:21,690
Come on. You know what?
You know the movie, right?

1474
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:25,230
I know most of you know even the
broads. We'll get it. Come on,

1475
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,480
I'll wait for the breakdown.
I'll wait for the breakdown of it.

1476
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:31,314
Where the hell is it?

1477
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:37,330
What did it hell was it?
I had this whole fucking thing queued up.

1478
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,570
This part right here.
You don't remember this.

1479
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:50,170
I even did the sound effects.
Remember that reservoir dogs,

1480
01:29:50,171 --> 01:29:52,000
when he cuts the fucking dude's ear off.

1481
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,550
Okay.

1482
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:56,910
I used to love that God damn song and
I couldn't listen to it for 10 years

1483
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,710
because every time I fucking heard it,

1484
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,730
I just thought about Marvin Nash
getting his Goddamn ear cut off.

1485
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:06,600
Ah, stop. Stop yelling at him.

1486
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,720
Fucking what?
What a great piece of acting

1487
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,120
by both of those guys.
Whoever played Marvin Nash and uh,

1488
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,030
Mr Blonde. I can never remember
people's fucking names.

1489
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:21,560
Okay.

1490
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,000
Uh, we'll call him Vince Gilligan.
I don't know his fucking name now.

1491
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,330
How did I fuck that?
I forget his name.

1492
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:26,700
Okay.

1493
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:29,970
You know most guys to play a psycho
would act like a fucking psycho.

1494
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:34,680
How they think a psycho supposed to act.
You know it just how fucking Cami was.

1495
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:38,990
You know, that's what's really fucking
scary. Somebody cutting your ear off,

1496
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,160
going with neck like a fucking maniac.

1497
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,650
You almost start laughing
halfway through it. Like,

1498
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:48,030
is this guy mocking being crazy? But
it's the calmness with which he does it.

1499
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:51,210
Here's another one for you.
These are really easy for like guy movie,

1500
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:55,230
so I need some more, more suggestions.
I'm actually going to disguise this one.

1501
01:30:55,410 --> 01:31:00,410
I downloaded this song because of the
movie and I didn't realize that this

1502
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:05,310
fucking Irish dude babbles telling some
fucking story for 20 minutes before they

1503
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:08,250
get to the part that I
actually recognized. Uh,

1504
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,440
let's see if you can guess this
one. Here we go. What movie

1505
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,343
goes to

1506
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:19,570
the test with Joyce,

1507
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,780
right? You're like, what the fuck is this?

1508
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:33,700
I didn't want to get blood on the floor.

1509
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,113
Yup.

1510
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,990
Hello.
Audio tion.

1511
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:50,510
That's a Donovan singing a Atlantis.
That was from a,

1512
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:54,350
the Billy bad scene.
When they start kicking the shit.

1513
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,120
Fuck it Billy bet.

1514
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:01,000
Is there anything better than that fucking
camera when they're doing that point

1515
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:04,990
in up at Robert De Niro's character?
Jimmy just fucking kicking him.

1516
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:08,950
Rick flair. Couldn't do fake kicks
better than Robert Dinero. You know,

1517
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,420
he just sitting there kicking him.

1518
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,580
See,
this was bad.

1519
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:20,470
Billy batts was a made guy with
some real grease ball shit.

1520
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,920
We did what we wanted.
We were wise guys. Right?

1521
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:28,420
What's the last one I got here? So I want,
I, I, I, you know, as usual, you know,

1522
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:32,320
whenever people ask these questions,
I can't end up, I can't remember him.

1523
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,173
MMM.

1524
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,830
Let's see.
Here's one for you.

1525
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:39,740
This is actually an interesting
one that's really fucking obscure.

1526
01:32:39,741 --> 01:32:42,920
This is one from a movie that
the dude ended up selling.

1527
01:32:42,921 --> 01:32:46,280
This is from cool hand Luke.
All right.

1528
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:49,730
For those of you have seen cool hand Luke,
if you haven't seen cool hand Luke,

1529
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,440
you got to fucking watch that movie.
All right.

1530
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:56,090
And basically the guy who did
the score, uh, wrote this song.

1531
01:32:56,091 --> 01:33:00,050
There's a scene where they
have to tar this road and uh,

1532
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:02,540
Paul Newman's character,
you know,

1533
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:06,870
rather than just sitting there being like,
this is a miserable fucking job.

1534
01:33:06,871 --> 01:33:11,430
He gets them all amped up that it's
supposed to take all fucking day,

1535
01:33:11,431 --> 01:33:15,090
but he gets these guys so fucking
amped up. They just, they just fucking,

1536
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:15,660
they just,

1537
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:20,100
it's like they took five hour energy
and before they just flying down the

1538
01:33:20,101 --> 01:33:22,890
fucking road and they're all laughing,
having a great fucking time.

1539
01:33:22,891 --> 01:33:26,910
And they finished the road and they
actually have an afternoon off. Right.

1540
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:32,010
So it was like Paul Newman's way
of saying fuck you to the, to the,

1541
01:33:32,011 --> 01:33:35,370
to the, to the screws. Is that what they
call them back then to the, to the guards.

1542
01:33:35,371 --> 01:33:38,180
Right. So they had to
have this music. So they,

1543
01:33:38,181 --> 01:33:42,080
this guy wrote this score for this scene.
Uh,

1544
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:44,820
but the problem was it
was perfect for the movie,

1545
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:50,180
but the problem was years later he sold
it or I don't know how far along he sold

1546
01:33:50,611 --> 01:33:55,611
it and it got played so much in this
other shit that it actually kind of fucks

1547
01:33:55,771 --> 01:33:57,600
up the movie. This is, this is the score.

1548
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,770
This is going to be for some older
people to actually understand this is the

1549
01:34:01,771 --> 01:34:04,260
music that they had for the tea.
It's called tar sequence. When they,

1550
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:06,960
when they tar the road
and they ended up selling,

1551
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:10,440
the guy ended up selling the song
for something else. Here it is.

1552
01:34:10,441 --> 01:34:14,780
Just listen to this shit.
Ah,

1553
01:34:14,781 --> 01:34:18,760
you suck. God dammit. Fuck the, see,

1554
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:22,970
this is why I got out of range.
I used to do shit like that on the air.

1555
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,980
There will be the worst break ever.
I am the fucking worst.

1556
01:34:27,981 --> 01:34:30,680
I what a great intro. I gave
that song. All right. Here we go

1557
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:35,440
for and the road totally makes sense.

1558
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:43,043
Wow.

1559
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:44,760
All right.

1560
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:49,760
[inaudible]

1561
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,360
good evening and welcome to the six news.
It was a four car accident.

1562
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,870
The motherfuckers sold it to
every six o'clock news station.

1563
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:08,350
This was the classic,
if you fucking old like me,

1564
01:35:08,351 --> 01:35:11,980
anytime the fucking news came on,
this is the fucking song that they played.

1565
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:13,750
This is back when the,

1566
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:18,280
when they actually had fucking journalists
telling you what the corporations

1567
01:35:18,281 --> 01:35:19,120
wanted you to know.

1568
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:32,390
Good evening. I'm Jake Johansen.
When I say, Gee, I'm a Jew.

1569
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,890
I was, that's how fucked up my brain is.
I was trying to think, uh, Chet Curtis.

1570
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:42,510
I was like, well, I can't say I can't
say Chet. That's an actual fucking name.

1571
01:35:42,511 --> 01:35:44,790
I don't name names. So then
I'll go, I'll go with Jake.

1572
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:47,940
And then for some reason I don't,
it just got crossed up and they said,

1573
01:35:47,941 --> 01:35:49,110
Jake Johann's I gave Jake,

1574
01:35:49,111 --> 01:35:54,111
Joe answered a fucking shout out the best
God Damn Comedians the last fucking 20

1575
01:35:54,271 --> 01:35:58,590
years for my money. So anyways, yeah,

1576
01:35:58,591 --> 01:36:00,180
it's called out of the tar sequence.

1577
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:03,180
So that one actually doesn't remind
me of the, the, the, the fuck.

1578
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,140
That's a reverse one.

1579
01:36:04,141 --> 01:36:07,650
I actually watched the movie and I'm
getting into that scene and then I think

1580
01:36:07,651 --> 01:36:09,720
there's like all of a sudden I'm
going to start listening to the news.

1581
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,990
So Jesus Christ,
that was,

1582
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:17,840
that was probably the worst debut
of any segment. But you knew,

1583
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:20,760
you got to admit you were
definitely into it, right?

1584
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:25,110
I know you guys have suggestions.
Can you help me out? All right.

1585
01:36:25,111 --> 01:36:27,450
I'm fucking burned out
with this fucking podcast.

1586
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:32,220
I'm trying to get ready to do other
shit and I'm just, you know, look at me.

1587
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:36,000
I'm fucking supporting Nazis now cause
that what I'm doing is that I'll fucking

1588
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:40,050
tired. I am doctor Laura. If you're
not a bad birthday book and Moron.

1589
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:45,180
All right, here's one for you. You know
what? I'm going to actually do one.

1590
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,040
I'm going to do one here for it to try
to make peace after my doctor Laura a

1591
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:57,170
Dr Laura comments, here we go. Uh,

1592
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:00,020
wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got
to get a secretary for this shit.

1593
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:09,570
All right. Where the fuck are we?
Yeah, I fucking hate you tube.

1594
01:37:09,571 --> 01:37:13,260
I don't want you douchebags doing the
fucking thing. I want the actual guy.

1595
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,380
Everybody doing a fucking remix.
Wait, hang on. Hang in there.

1596
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:29,680
There it is. [inaudible] we go. Alright.

1597
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:34,840
Now this one's mainly going to be
for, uh, the people that I offended

1598
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:40,960
last week. Last week,
uh, with the fuck is it?

1599
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:46,510
Come on now. All right, here we go.
Here we go. This isn't going to remind,

1600
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:49,420
this isn't going to remind you of a movie.

1601
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:53,740
This is going to remind you of a TV
show. What? What show was this? Hang on.

1602
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,550
This is the last one.
Come on. Wait a minute.

1603
01:37:57,551 --> 01:37:59,120
You fucking cunt.

1604
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:00,620
Okay.

1605
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:03,530
I did. I didn't hit pause. Did I? Hang on.

1606
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,793
Okay.

1607
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,090
All right. This is going to remind
you of a TV show. What TV show.

1608
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:22,203
Okay.

1609
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:30,020
I somehow missed that when that came
out. That is a, that's the Carlton Dance.

1610
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:34,280
I think I was too old for that one. I
kind of tapped out with sitcoms after, uh,

1611
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:36,710
after why happy days.
And I wanted the cheers.

1612
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:41,900
I started Busan and actually
believed cheers, you know,

1613
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:42,960
I believe that,
you know,

1614
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:47,980
there was a bar like that and you come
in and just being an alcoholic was like

1615
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:52,640
funny and fulfilling.
I guess there was the sadness.

1616
01:38:52,641 --> 01:38:57,270
He completely avoided his wife,
Vera, and they never showed her. Um,

1617
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:59,750
anyways, you know what? I think that's
going to be the podcast for the week.

1618
01:38:59,751 --> 01:39:02,460
I have to, I got a tap out
here, man. This, this, uh,

1619
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,620
this trying to do one on the road the
day after I come off the road is really

1620
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:07,790
difficult. But, uh,

1621
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:12,170
fortunately thanks to been
going well that I'm really busy.

1622
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:14,780
So I guess that is a good fucking thing.
But you know,

1623
01:39:14,781 --> 01:39:16,880
you get used to this comedian lifestyle.
Well,

1624
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:20,600
you just get to fucking hang out
on a Monday. Now I actually, uh,

1625
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:24,380
I have shit to do,
which is annoying.

1626
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:28,160
It's not why I started being a comedian.
I started to be a comedian,

1627
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:32,150
so I would not have shit to do,
you know,

1628
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:36,710
wouldn't have a boss tell fucking jokes,

1629
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:41,570
talk about my Dick in all 50 states
and whatnot. Believe it or not.

1630
01:39:41,571 --> 01:39:45,860
People, my neck stand up date
isn't until September 9th, uh,

1631
01:39:45,861 --> 01:39:50,150
at the comedy works in Denver, Colorado.
Let's blow through some date shall we,

1632
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,630

1638
01:40:18,021 --> 01:40:20,840
I mean also going to be at
xannies comedy club in Nashville,

1639
01:40:20,841 --> 01:40:24,830
Tennessee on our September 23rd,
24th and 25th.

1640
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:30,200
One of, uh, one of my favorite clubs to
play as is the comedy works in Denver.

1641
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:34,700
September 10th. Well, we've

1642
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:40,190

1643
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:44,000
That's what I'm working there. Um,
and then starts to theater shit.

1644
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,490
I'm going to be at the egg in Albany,
New York.

1645
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,150
All you people in upstate New York.
We're always say come to upstate New York,

1646
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:52,550
man. What the fuck? I'm going to be there.

1647
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,290
I'm going to be at the egg in Albany,
New York.

1648
01:40:56,291 --> 01:41:00,280
And then the following day I'm going
to be at the center for the arts,

1649
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:05,620
Buffalo, New York. Um, so I'm
finally coming to buffalo.

1650
01:41:05,621 --> 01:41:09,760
I'm actually hitting up a bunch of
towns that I haven't been to in fucking

1651
01:41:09,761 --> 01:41:12,820
forever. Uh, another city, a city.

1652
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:16,000
I've never done standup in a full set.
I've done a guest set,

1653
01:41:16,330 --> 01:41:17,860
but I've never gotten a gig out there.

1654
01:41:17,861 --> 01:41:22,861
I'm going to be at the
pantageous Pantages Pan,

1655
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:26,740
an ageless, whatever the fuck
it is, theater in Minneapolis,

1656
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:30,310
Minnesota on October 22nd.

1657
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:35,940
And then the following day I'm going
to be at the Vic Theater in Chicago,

1658
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:40,300
Illinois on, um, October 23rd.

1659
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,460
And uh, any other ones? I
got another theater date.

1660
01:41:45,461 --> 01:41:50,170
On November 19th I met the
listener auditorium, Washington,

1661
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:52,990
D C and a,

1662
01:41:52,991 --> 01:41:57,310
the last theater I have is
the more theater in Seattle,

1663
01:41:57,311 --> 01:42:00,580
Washington on November 27th.
Uh,

1664
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:05,320
you can go on to bill bird.com and just
click on the links in the lower left hand

1665
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:10,150
corner and you can check out
all that bullshit. And, uh,

1666
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:14,200
hopefully you'll come out to the
shows. We'll see how it goes. Um,

1667
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:17,590
for those of you wondering if I'm just
going to try to do theaters exclusively,

1668
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:20,920
um, no, I am not. I'm always going to
be doing the clubs. The clubs are like,

1669
01:42:20,921 --> 01:42:24,910
the gym keeps you in shape, you
come in, you do five, six shows,

1670
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:28,330
and then every once in a while like,
uh, like Buffalo, I don't know,

1671
01:42:28,331 --> 01:42:30,940
they don't really have like a
big time comedy club out there.

1672
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:34,720
No disrespect to anybody out there.
So while you just come in,

1673
01:42:34,721 --> 01:42:38,380
you try to do with theater. Same
thing with Albany, you know,

1674
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:43,410
you start going to those really smaller
fucking towns or smaller comedy markets.

1675
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:48,020
And then that's just when, you know,
the local comedy club is just nay nay,

1676
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:51,400
you know, like knee slappers, you know.

1677
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,210
Um, God damn it, you're funny.

1678
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:01,330
Who's ready to laugh? You know, they
just got awful fucking names and uh,

1679
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:05,140
yeah. And they try to make
you stay in a comedy condo.

1680
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:06,970
So that's why I always
avoided those things.

1681
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:08,840
And I tried to stay in the
bigger markets where that could,

1682
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,720
they actually put me in a hotel. I'm
like, you, I like my comforts. So,

1683
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:16,960
uh, that's, that's the big,
uh, my big tour coming up.

1684
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:21,790
And there's also a date there I missed in
Columbus, Ohio. That's a club date. Uh,

1685
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:25,660
November 12th, 13th, and 14th. And
the fucking, you know what kills me,

1686
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:30,070
it's how quick that's all gonna go by and
another year is going to go by as well

1687
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:33,730
as, you know, by the end of that tour, um,

1688
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:36,580
football season will be three quarters
over. How fucking sad is that?

1689
01:43:36,581 --> 01:43:40,780
At least the regular season.
Uh, who do you like by the way?

1690
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:44,140
Anybody?
Anybody for some predictions.

1691
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:48,400
How about we try to do some predictions
and whoever comes to fucking closest

1692
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:52,020
gets a, an audit, grab an autograft DVD of

1693
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,790
my brand new DVD.
Let it go.

1694
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:56,280
Because by then it'll be the end of
the season and I'll fucking sent, Nah,

1695
01:43:56,281 --> 01:43:59,550
I'm not going to do that then
you won't fucking buy it. Right.

1696
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,810
I need to get you to buy it. Goddammit.
I suck at marketing. Anyways.

1697
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,710
That's a podcast for this week
was very disjointed. I, you know,

1698
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,300
they can't all be gold. You
know, even Peyton manning,

1699
01:44:11,301 --> 01:44:14,700
he throws an interception every once in
a while and the file drive of a fucking

1700
01:44:14,701 --> 01:44:19,350
Superbowl doesn't he? Well, doesn't,
he actually saw what's his face. Uh,

1701
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:23,280
drew Brees finally getting some props.
He came in there with John Gruden,

1702
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:27,320
you know, John Green's got that
unbelievable intensity that,

1703
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:29,010
that vein down the middle of his forehead.

1704
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:32,400
That's one of my favorite
announcers out there are color men,

1705
01:44:32,401 --> 01:44:34,260
whatever the hell that guy's
doing that guys to shit.

1706
01:44:34,261 --> 01:44:37,440
This is not the better than an
ex football player. And this is,

1707
01:44:37,441 --> 01:44:41,010
this is provided that they
have broadcasting skills.

1708
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:44,790
Somebody that played the game,
coached the game and that type of shit.

1709
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:48,390
And then you get the classic
like broadcaster, like, uh,

1710
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:52,860
like an Al Michaels or something like
that to call the game. And then, uh,

1711
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:55,620
then you got your crew.
Thank you bill.

1712
01:44:55,621 --> 01:44:58,440
Thank you for breaking that down
is if we didn't fucking notice,

1713
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:00,540
why don't you just admit bill,

1714
01:45:00,541 --> 01:45:04,530
that you just babbling at this point to
somehow try and make it to 'em up to 57

1715
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:07,230
minutes. That qualifies. I
can tap out at this point.

1716
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,800
I don't you guys leave sometimes
three minutes before five.

1717
01:45:11,850 --> 01:45:13,170
So what did we learn this week?

1718
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:18,180
We learned that even on major topics
like race bill really doesn't do his

1719
01:45:18,181 --> 01:45:22,010
research. Uh, we learned
that I yet at y. Uh,

1720
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:27,030
then I got some fat guy with the milky
white ties to laugh at himself and he's

1721
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:31,590
lost 40 pounds. So I'm not
totally a bad guy. And uh,

1722
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:34,230
I guess from the troops come back,
send them a drink or get, get him,

1723
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:38,810
get him a blow job or shut your
face. And evidently they, they,

1724
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:41,760
they feel the same way of that support.
The troop bumper stickers is,

1725
01:45:41,761 --> 01:45:44,220
I do you like I'm taking one marine,

1726
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:47,520
his point of view and just saying that
that's everybody's well that's what the

1727
01:45:47,521 --> 01:45:51,900
fuck I do. That's what I
do, support the troops.

1728
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,870
I always thought it was ridiculous.
So out of those bumper stickers that said,

1729
01:45:54,871 --> 01:45:58,350
I support the troops, it's like,
well, why wouldn't you? What do you,

1730
01:45:58,351 --> 01:46:00,600
what are you rooting
for? The, the other team.

1731
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:08,970
So fucking obvious. I support the
troops. Ice Cream tastes good.

1732
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,100
Okay.

1733
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,510
I like babies.
You know what?

1734
01:46:12,511 --> 01:46:15,150
He's gonna have all kinds
of obvious bumper stickers
on the back of your fucking

1735
01:46:15,151 --> 01:46:18,840
car. I saw a guy had a
big heart on, on his,

1736
01:46:18,841 --> 01:46:21,690
on his side of his house.
It said love our troops.

1737
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:24,900
It just really gave me the creeps.
And every time I see it,

1738
01:46:24,901 --> 01:46:28,920
I want to fucking rip it down.
You know, I, this other guy,

1739
01:46:28,921 --> 01:46:32,970
ray wrote me an angry fucking email all
about the politics about setting the

1740
01:46:32,971 --> 01:46:34,920
troops over there, you
know? And it's just like,

1741
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:39,120
like he was fucking dropping
all this knowledge man,

1742
01:46:39,121 --> 01:46:43,530
about what's really going on
with the war man. You know,

1743
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:49,020
like I don't realize,
like I don't realize that shit.

1744
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:52,750
I also realized that those guys don't
determined where the fuck they go.

1745
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:56,710
All right? So I'm just trying not to be a
Dick, you know, pick up in a dick enough,

1746
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,770
haven't I?
I've gotta be honest with you.

1747
01:46:59,771 --> 01:47:02,110
I have no idea what I said
for the last 11 minutes,

1748
01:47:02,111 --> 01:47:05,200
but all I know is I recorded it
and you're listening to it. Okay.

1749
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:09,220
So who's worse make you guys just
shaking your heads right now.

1750
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:14,640
He's really losing his mind. Well,
maybe I am. Um, that's it. So I got to,

1751
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:17,590
I got like two,
three weeks off on be hanging out.

1752
01:47:17,591 --> 01:47:19,780
Could be gone doing a lot of
spots down the comedy store.

1753
01:47:19,781 --> 01:47:22,690
If you're in Los Angeles,
going to be working out my shit.

1754
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,450
If you want to come down there,
watch me bomb. Lean on the mic.

1755
01:47:25,451 --> 01:47:29,050
Stand and stare at that. All weather
carpet is, I work out my bits,

1756
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,700
uh, pop in down the comedy store and
that's it. Thanks. Everybody wrote in,

1757
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:38,080

to you guys next week.

1758
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:09,510
Yeah.
