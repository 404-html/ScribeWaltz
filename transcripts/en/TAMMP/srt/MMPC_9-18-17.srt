00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,040
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,380

5
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:18,070
Put your pants on one leg and a
thigh. Joe. Six pack. Going to work.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,920
Um, I got to keep it down. This isn't new.
This, this is the new, uh, more subdued,

7
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,980
quieter podcasts.
Now that I have a baby daughter,

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,250
um,
I'm recording this Sunday night and uh,

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,980
that's all you need to fucking know my
fucking are you hearing that or you're in

10
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,330
some sort of weird noise there.
I don't know what I did.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,550
My fucking mixer is acting weird. What
happens if I pushed his button? Anything?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,050
Anything. Oh, there you go.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,830
Just goes into one speaker and then
the other one had fallen in the other.

14
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:54,520
How are you, did you enjoy your football
Sunday? Did you Julia sports weekend?

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,240
Did you follow politics?
Did you watch college football?

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,980
You just stare at the wall. Drinking
booze, ignoring your loved ones will,

17
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,870
if you did,
I'm jealous.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,280
Billy. No booze. Billy. What Ha. Oh,

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,000

go? Bill Lee. Boy. Billy boy,

20
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,300

Charming Billy.

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,770
It's sitting over there and every
night a fuck can steer a bird.

22
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,930
I can't have a fucking drop
cause I got active work.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,530
Yes I can have a fucking
job cause I got acting work.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,120
See I'm slowly losing my mind.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Yeah.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,650
What if I just said one
bill, Lee boy, POB boy.

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,680
What if you just had one charming Billy?

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Well then I drink the whole bottle and
I've taught computer on the couch and I'd

29
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,000
be a fat fuck on camera.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,240
Hd.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,790
I'm down to one 76 and change,

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,470
I mean been working out because I was
playing catch and fucked up my fucking

33
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:01,160
calf. That's how old I am. So I've
just been eating like an angel.

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,270
Okay.

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,103
You know,

36
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,400
after every bite I count and I chew
fucking 27 times on each side of my mouth.

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,370
And then I take the Napkin and
I wipe off like a fucking angel.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,890
If there is a god,
La,

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,520
whatever the fucking peanut butter
sandwiches you're read to. And with that,

40
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,560
our law peanut butter sandwiches.

41
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,690
I wonder if fucking the couch getting
any death threats from extreme Muslims.

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,190
Well, maybe he was Muslim. I don't know.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,820
They never really said God knows
sesame street was liberal enough.

44
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:39,760
They probably would have thrown
that in back then. Right.

45
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,090
And then Bob would be fucking
singing that song. Uh, what is it?

46
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,130
Who are the people in your neighborhood?

47
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,660
Neighborhood. A neighborhood. Oh, who
are the people in your neighborhood?

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,110
The people that you meet each day.
Oh,

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,000
fucking puppet vampire.
That happens.

50
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,420
Be Muslim is in your neighborhood
was too long. That's what it was.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,250
It was too fucking long.
Um,

52
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,620
you haven't had Devon had a drop
of booze in fucking 32 days.

53
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,310
32 fucking God damn days. I'll die right
now. I'm not even gonna lie to you.

54
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:16,180
This was the longest month and a
day of the year without a doubt.

55
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,680
Um, it's fun in the morning.
It's not in the evening.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,050
Like right now. I just want to
get fucking blasted, you know,

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,620
I dunno. Can't do it. They'll
can't do it. Gradually coming down.

58
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:33,010
I got to get down to a buck
72 my fighting weight is Bob.

59
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,880
Pogo says onF is for family
season two while you're watching,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,380
are you liking how you're
giving it a thumbs up,

61
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,200
whatever the fucking scoring system
is over there at Netflix. You know,

62
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,480
I don't know what they use it now and I
think they said they're going to go with

63
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,150
thumbs up, thumbs down. And I think
they stuck with the star system.

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,600
I have no idea. I don't
pretend to know. Um,

65
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,140
my whole fucking weekend it's just been
about keeping my fucking leg raised.

66
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,530
I went to this fucking party on Thursday
night with my lovely wife and the

67
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:08,440
fucking host of it was given a big speech
and I was stone sober and I had to go

68
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:11,380
over and sit in the corner was outside
in this guy's lawn with like a tent.

69
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,970
Right.
And I'm sitting,

70
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:17,470
I go off in the corner to sit
down stone sober with a fucking,

71
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,290
I had like club soda and lime.

72
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,560
The hardest thing for me to order, cause
I can never remember what you're saying.

73
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,410
I can just for some reason I can never
remember club soda cause I never ordered

74
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,530
and half the time I go up to the
bartender at the Va, what can I get you?

75
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,131
I'm like,
yeah,

76
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:37,150
what's that thing people drink when they
don't drink and then they go club soda.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,250
I go yes with alive.

78
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,780
And then if you're trying to be
funny like a third of the time,

79
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:46,390
that's how I have to order it because I
can't remember what it is cause I never

80
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,224
ordered.

81
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,860
So I'm on my second club soda and lime
in this guy who's hosting the party.

82
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,410
Fabulous hose.
He's fucking tank and all these people.

83
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,010
I had to go outside the tent because I
see a stone wall where I could sit down

84
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,830
because my fucking ankle
is filling up with fluid.

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,070
Um, and it's becoming twice the size, my
other ankle. But you know, I went to the,

86
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:12,090
you know, I just went into some walk
in clinic and the guy looked at it. Oh,

87
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,650
I'll tell you what. I'll tell you. I
can tell you what you did right now.

88
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:18,070
I can tell you for a cross the fucking
room without even doing an x ray,

89
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,680
you know, walk in clinic
type Shit, you know.

90
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,300
So I go to sit down the guys in
the middle of this great speech,

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,370
everybody's fucking listening
and I don't know how,

92
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:30,040
but I set my glass down and I
reached back to get something.

93
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,490
I knocked it off and it made that
and it was like a fucking wine glass.

94
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,690
So it sounded like a booze glass in the
middle of his speech and like half the

95
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:42,550
10 fucking looks over me. I spilled it on
my link. I did all of this stone sober.

96
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,530
So my [inaudible] comes walking out. She's
laughing at me going, what did you do?

97
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:51,620
And I was all embarrassed going,
I was going near stomach and a scene.

98
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,900
I felt bad enough as it was. And then she
got mad at me cause I got like, I got,

99
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,040
you know,
I

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,680
got emotional with her so she didn't,

101
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,000
didn't talk to me for like two
fucking days because of that.

102
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,150
But two fucking day she started
talking to me. You know what I mean?

103
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,720
Like if she ever spilled a drink on
herself and half a tent to people looked

104
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:13,590
over at her and I walked over and said
like, what did you do? Like, you know,

105
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,470
mad she'd be at me. But that's how
it works in the male female dynamic.

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,353
All right?

107
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,340
You're either wrong or you were
too mean when you were right.

108
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,740
That's basically how it was.
That's what it was.

109
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,700
I think I was guilty of being
too mean. So anyways, I, um,

110
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,180
I watched a little bit of the Patriots
today. I saw the first quarter,

111
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,640
I taped the game. I'm going
to watch the rest of it, uh,

112
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,120
patriots with a little bit better today.
Obviously it's early in the season,

113
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,280
you know,
this is what they always do.

114
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:47,060
They hype up shit because people are went
beating teams are losing to teams and

115
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,730
all this shit that you're not going to
see in January. Who gives a fuck, right?

116
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,150
That's just getting going.
And um,

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
I actually went to a,

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,550
I went to the stub hub center today
and I saw the new Los Angeles chargers,

119
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:04,990
their first game against
the Miami Dolphins. Um,

120
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,980
I went down there, I got to tell
you, that might be the best stadium.

121
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:11,770
I've seen a football game
and at the NFL level,

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
simply because there was
only 25,000 people there.

123
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,850
I can't believe the patriots are
playing the charges on the road.

124
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,700
If I could see Tom Brady and
a 25,000 seat stadium of,

125
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,070
it'd be fucking incredible.
That's like the old, that's what,

126
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,780
what the old NFL used to look
like back before. You know,

127
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:34,781
we out fucked all of those other stadiums
back before lady Gaga and fuck it,

128
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:38,360
Whitney Houston, everybody brought
all these other people into the game.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,420
All these people who are just like,
oh my God,

130
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,370
what else happens after the concert?
You know,

131
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,610
when they started watching football,
so they had to build 50, 60, 70, 80,

132
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,470
a hundred thousand fucking seat stadiums,

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,860
25,000 seat seats.

134
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:56,360
I got to see two wily veterans
to gunslingers, Philip Rivers,

135
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,220
Philip Rivers against a,
what's his face? Said?

136
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,690
Jay Cutler's at Jay or Jake? Jay
Cutler. That's right. Jay Cutler, right?

137
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,690
Am I going to say his name
right? Jay Cutler. I like it.

138
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:12,380
One guy's a fucking religious frequent
90 kids. The other guys like set them up,

139
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,600
set them up. Let's have another drink,
right? Jay Cutler. There you go.

140
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,550
That's right. Jay Cutler. So I'm fucking,
San Diego had the Goddamn game one.

141
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,910
Wait, this is showing me a
body builder. Is it Jake?

142
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,740
Okay.

143
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,500
This is the age I'm at now. I don't
know anybody's fucking name anymore.

144
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,060
Jay Cutler.
There we go.

145
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,340
No, it is Jay Cutler. All right. Whatever
the fuck this fucking guy, right?

146
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:43,040
He key key leads his
team down the field day.

147
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,820
Go ahead by three points and then San
Diego comes down the field. Philip Rivers,

148
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:51,220
he doesn't give a shit
either. He's worried about a
fucking two minute offense.

149
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,220
This guy's got nine miles to feed.
You bet you have a nine kids.

150
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,220
Just it's, you just come
home to a standing ovation.
Everybody's freaking as here.

151
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,770
You have a crowd, you have a
fucking crowd of kids. Oh, amazing.

152
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,570
Is that till they all become teenagers
and then there's a 10 to 15 year period

153
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:13,940
where they hated you. You know,
you never made sure that I know.

154
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:17,690
So God staked down. You always sat
down the other end of the table.

155
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:21,500
I wanted to sit closer to you and then
he's going to deal with all of that shit.

156
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:26,180
Right. Um, was a great game.
Fantastic fucking stadium.

157
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,813
MMM,

158
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,670
dead great.
There's not a bad seat in the house.

159
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:34,810
I'm telling you before they moved to some
giant monstrosity of a fucking stadium

160
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:38,890
that this Sharon with the rams, I believe.
And it's going to fucking, you know,

161
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,000
bankrupt his city.

162
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,500
Um hmm.

163
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,890
Before they fucking do that.
Eat. If you get a chance,

164
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:47,950
definitely go to the stub hub center.
It's fucking phenomenal. You know,

165
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:48,820
it's funny, I was, I was sitting,

166
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,720
I was watching the game and I see this
guy flying over in this helicopter,

167
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,630
the Robinson 44 during a fucking game.
He's,

168
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:58,930
he looks like he's not even 500 feet off
the fucking gruff flies right over the

169
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,230
fucking stadium. And I, with my
limited knowledge of aviation,

170
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,390
realize that when there's
a big event like that,

171
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:07,720
it's an automatic temporary no fly zone.

172
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,570
An hour before and an hour and after
the game, I believe that what is,

173
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:12,970
if not two hours before and after,
right?

174
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,030
This fucking jerk off flies
right over the fucking stadium.

175
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,330
And I'm sitting there with my buddy going,
ah, that didn't look like a cop. Right?

176
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,480
You can't, I don't think you can
fucking do that. I'm just a novice,

177
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,630
but I do not think you could do that.
This fucking jerk off comes by again.

178
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,420
He's on his side showing all
the passengers down in it,

179
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,260
and then like two seconds late, like
a police helicopter comes flying over.

180
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,410
I don't know if he got in trouble
or what, but, uh, I dunno.

181
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:40,360
I know some pilots listen to
this shit. I, like I said,

182
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:44,140
I don't ever pretend to know anything
about that stuff as far as, uh,

183
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,540
my limited knowledge.
You are not allowed to do that.

184
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,580
God forbid something happens and then you
fucking land on 25,000 people watching

185
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:54,640
fucking Jay Cutler,
right?

186
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:57,460
With keg booze coming out of
his pores going up against, uh,

187
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,200
the other guy from Ash
Wednesday, right? Um, uh,

188
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:05,960
these Kansas city chiefs
for real. Uh, so I,

189
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,290
I fucking got a taxi on the way down.

190
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,503
MMM.

191
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,260
And then on the way back,

192
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:15,830
I called the car service and I'm
fucking tell him this guy, I'm like,

193
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:19,100
meet me at one 84 and Avalon.
All right,

194
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,740
there's a Kentucky Fried Chicken
right next to a doughnut place.

195
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:25,330
Can you fucking meet me there? Right.
So the guy is like, yeah, I was good.

196
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,590
All right, great. Great. All right, so
we get down there, right? The game ends.

197
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:34,250
I walk out there for 15.
He's supposed to pick me up at four 30.

198
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:37,850
I called the guy up, he's like a fucking
city block away. Everything's going good.

199
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,410
Then all of a sudden the cops are
everything and they're like, dad,

200
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,900
like Uber and Lyft. One 92, I walked down,

201
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,540
walked down to one 92. Right? And
I'm sitting there going, well,

202
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm not Uber or Lyft car
service. I'm like, these guys
are going to fuck with me.

203
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:54,820
So I try and call this guy. I called the
guy up and I keep telling him, the guy,

204
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,030
he's gone to grab a block away. I'm a
block away and I'm going, yes. Yeah,

205
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,260
I forget the Kentucky, the KFC
and go, no, no, no, no, no.

206
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,300
Don't KFC now. No, KFC. There's
a doughnut shop right next door.

207
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,710
I'm going to walk over, see
if you can turn it in there
and he goes up, go up. See,

208
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,630
I'm going, no, no. Listen. I'm
walking over, walking over. All right,

209
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,460
forget it.
You can't walk into the doughnut place.

210
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:22,690
I'm going to go down to one 92 in Avalon.
He goes, okay, give me a parking lot,

211
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,920
KFC.

212
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,180
He just kept saying that like a prank
show and I'm literally getting angry.

213
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,290
Okay.

214
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,580
Yelling,
no.

215
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,410
One 92 an Avalon into my phone and like
people with kids and turn around looking

216
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,950
at me. So I'm trying to put more of a
happier tone in my voice and it's just not

217
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:43,530
working and he just kept going,
okay, KFC parking lot. I come, no,

218
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:47,340
one 92 when the Avalon, and then I
finally got to just repeat it, repeat it,

219
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:51,960
and he goes, yes, yes, I will
repeat what I said. He goes,
one 92 Avalon. I go, fine,

220
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,340
fine. And then like he's calls me back,
hook up, pulling into the donut shop.

221
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:03,390
I finally had to fucking take a picture
of one 92 in Avalon and send it to the

222
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:06,090
fucking gun. Ain't showed up. Right.
And he was the greatest guy ever.

223
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,790
Greatest guy ever. And I was
like, all right. You know what?

224
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,610
Maybe I got a little emotional.
Okay,

225
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:14,700
there's 25,000 people walking up
and down the Goddamn street here.

226
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,200
I don't know what to do here.
Maybe, you know, I don't know what,

227
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,220
but I will tell you that
when I was at the game,

228
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,650
okay.

229
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,080
Um, go. See when I was
at the game, the, uh,

230
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,920
these people in front of me, I've never
seen this before. We're drinking. Uh,

231
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,140
what's that Mexican
beer that begins with a,

232
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,330
with an m begins with an M bay.
It's in a,

233
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,110
it's fucking gold,
right?

234
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:40,560
It looks like there's almost
like a trophy looks delicious,

235
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,390
especially after 32 days in that booze.

236
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:45,030
And so these people in front of me are
drinking this shit in it, out of a can.

237
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,870
And they had this shit, this shit on
top. I'm like, what the fuck is that?

238
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,210
Is it crushed red pepper flakes?
What is,

239
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,880
and this guy next to me goes chili powder.

240
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:58,090
They put chili powder around the
topic cause I don't like it. I'm like,

241
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:02,200
is that like white people putting a lime
and a fucking corona? He goes, yeah,

242
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,480
it's something like that. He
goes, you know, I don't really
like it. And I was like,

243
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,710
well, I got to try that.
I mean, not right now,

244
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,280
but eventually I'm going to try that.
Um,

245
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,630
it looked like the shit that you put
on the warning track. So these new, uh,

246
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,300
baseball stadiums,
it's sort of sanded sort of rubber.

247
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:22,450
That's what it looked like
for fucking far away. Um,

248
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,410
so that guy proceeds to get absolutely
plastered and after three fucking,

249
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,830
um,
quarters,

250
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,220
he comes back up and yells to the crowd
that they stopped serving beer at the

251
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:40,560
start of the fourth quarter and he's
yelling about how dumb it is. And, uh,

252
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,450
that's one of those moments where it was
good that I also wasn't drunk cause I

253
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,350
would have been like, yeah, buddy,

254
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,950
you're the reason you're the fucking
reason they do that because you can't hold

255
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:49,870
your alcohol. Look at you,
you're a fucking mess.

256
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,750
So I actually went to this game
and this is like a record for me.

257
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,300
I didn't have any booze and I
didn't eat any of the shit food.

258
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,330
I had like two handfuls of fucking
peanuts and drank like three waters.

259
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,030
That's it. Because I can't be a fat
fuck on this thing, you know. So, um,

260
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,780
okay,

261
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,790
I fucking go downstairs and take a piss.
Right.

262
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,933
Okay.

263
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,350
And he's this fucking guy just yelling
at the police and there's like two cops

264
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,230
there and then there's three and then
there's five. And I'm walking by.

265
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,260
I go down and take a piss and I come
back and there is like half the police

266
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:27,280
force is standing there and is this
white dude screaming at all of these cops

267
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,460
screaming, you got to do some, go
up there and, and do something.

268
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,730
Another white guys yelling, dude,
it was like total white guy moment.

269
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,370
You're like yelling at fucking 20 cops.

270
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,130
He's not getting the shit kicked out of
him. And they actually listened to it,

271
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:39,641
went up,

272
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:43,700
they'd kick two guys out and the other
guys were like really fucking like, oh,

273
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,090
all right. They just sort of
left. I don't know what they did.

274
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,720
I Dunno what the fuck they did.

275
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,420
It was the weirdest thing
was the two guys screaming,

276
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:56,570
looking like the ones that we're
going to get fucking arrested. Um,

277
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,250
but we're demanding that these cops go
up and do something and then they finally

278
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,060
fucking did when they throw these guys
up. It's a really bizarre day, but I'm,

279
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:05,894
but once again,

280
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,220
a phenomenal fucking a sports
experience if you go there. So, um,

281
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,900
I apologize. A lot of this shit
is going to be all sports stuff.

282
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,220
That's kind of what I did this weekend.

283
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:19,940
I can't hang out with my daughter and I
just watched a bunch of sports and uh,

284
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,970
did anybody put on the NFL network
and watch Dan Marino a football life.

285
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,910
Okay.

286
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,980
It was fucking amazing.

287
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:33,981
But like you can't do the Dan
Marino story in fucking 30 minutes.

288
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,750
That should have been an hour
and a half long it least.

289
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,580
And as much as he five feel
like the finally got his
fucking do is you watch and

290
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:45,240
Troy Aikman, Peyton Manning, Brett Farve,
all of them saying this was the guy,

291
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,740
this was the fucking guy.

292
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,120
Then finally putting to bed this
whole thing that you know that,

293
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,470
because he didn't want a Superbowl,
like that's some sort of like,

294
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,500
okay,

295
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,290
black mark up against the
guy's fucking name, the guy,

296
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,390
he was so ahead of his time, he was such
an unbelievable fucking quarterback.

297
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,480
It took 25 years,
a quarter of a century,

298
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,460
and a massive change in
the rules of passing in.

299
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,820
How you could defend against the past for
people to start fucking with what this

300
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:19,530
guy did from 1983 on.
Um,

301
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,700
he was unbelievable.

302
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,360
You know what kills me is his
dad taught him how to throw ball,

303
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,730
come the arm comes up,
ball comes out.

304
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,880
And I can't even tell you how
many times as a patriots fan,

305
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,880
we played them twice a fucking year.
I thought Andre tip had had him,

306
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,930
he's armed with the football would still
be at his waist and Andrea was bringing

307
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,510
his fucking arm down to get them
in somehow as armored come up.

308
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:43,060
And it'd be out 40 yard fucking laser.

309
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,110
Yeah.

310
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,340
Oh my God.
He used to kill us.

311
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,100
He used to kill for all you young dolphin
fans out there. That fucking Tom Brady.

312
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,050
You know,

313
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,020
cause he's been beating your ass two
games a year for like almost his whole

314
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:59,970
career. Just about, um,
that's payback for Dan Marino.

315
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,441
I'm telling you,

316
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:09,441
Dan Marino today in his prime would
easily throw for over 6,000 yards easily.

317
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,150
And if you could actually win
without having a running game,

318
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,850
which you can nowadays,
the way that fucking game has changed,

319
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,170
he would have at least one Superbowl
ring. Okay. I'm telling you, um,

320
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,060
if one of my favorites of fucking all
time and I'm glad they finally did, uh,

321
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,810
the football life and I think it was
at least an hour too short. All right,

322
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,990
day you go. I've said my piece that's
coming from a patriots fan too.

323
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,120
And when he played, I fucking
hated him because he, he killed us.

324
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,570
I didn't really hate them, but you know
what I mean? I wasn't pleased with him.

325
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,450
All right, let me do the
little bit of the, uh,

326
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,170
some has to break up this sports stock
guys. I gotta I gotta do the fucking,

327

There were a ton of online mattress
retailers popping up these days.

330
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,290
All with a one size fits all solution
to a better sleep. You know what?

331
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,220
I had no idea.

332
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:05,250
I do not have my ear to the ground
and the fucking mattress retail.

333
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,730
I didn't realize there was a whole bunch
of these people popping up. Oh my God.

334
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,420
If there's another online
merge was retailer, guess what?

335

All Italian Americans offended
by that with the without papers.

364
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,610
Do you know what I learned?
A Irish wop I'd never heard of,

365
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,350
which was Nina.

366
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,740
So Italians that was
without papers and India.

367
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,950
India in fucking Irish.
Nina was no Irish need apply.

368
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,190
I didn't know that.
I had no fucking idea.

369
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,050
This is back in like
the gangs in New York,

370
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,530
and if you're actually offended by that,
you better be 100% Italian. All right?

371
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,630
Okay. Don't come at me with the
15% being 100% offended. Okay.

soft fabric that's three times softer

376

than cotton.

377
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,250
What they do is they punch a horse in
the head and they cut off its muscle and

378
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,080
then they put it right down here
where your junk is, you know,

379
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,070
and then the horse wakes up permanently
smiling for the rest of its life.

380
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,210
That's where the, you know,
that's where it comes from.

381
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,760
A lot of people don't know that.
That's what modelle is.

382
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,330
What else could be softer than
cotton other than a horses muscle?

383
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,310

I want to give this guy a shout out.

424
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,020
Okay. Unknown unheralded.
Unheralded actor.

425
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,070
Okay.

426
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,360
Um, as far as I know, rich
Turner in reservoir dogs.

427
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,430
Yeah.

428
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,250
It's one of my favorite fucking
just one scene actors. I've,

429
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,860
I've, I don't know, I don't watch a ton
of movies, but I fucking love this guy.

430
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,390
He plays the cop in the bathroom when a,
what's his face?

431
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,920
Tim Roth is sitting there with all the
drugs and he comes out and this is a dog,

432
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,670
a dog sniff and a the drug sniffing
dogs sniffing drug sniffing dog.

433
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,290
Um,

434
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,100
okay.

435
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,720
See was in pulp fiction too?
Meaning also.

436
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,600
Yeah. He wasn't in a lot of movies,
but he plays Mike. The way he,

437
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,560
he's being the cop and he's
telling that story. Just the way he

438
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,840
like the line. I said, buddy,

439
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:22,600
I'm going to shoot you in the face if
you don't put your fucking hands on that

440
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,560
dashboard. That's just the
way it's written in the way
he did it. He goes, I said,

441
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,394
buddy,

442
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,980
I am going to shoot you in the face if
you don't put your fucking hands in that

443
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,780
dashboard.
Just the way he said it.

444
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,380
I don't know why that sounds
exactly like a fucking cop to me.

445
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,650
So that was like something
just me and my friends,

446
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:45,730
we would be fucking hammered striking
out with chicks and you'd just be walking

447
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:48,760
out to your car and one of your
invariably would just go, buddy,

448
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,080
I am going to shoot you in the face.
And everyone just started laughing.

449
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:56,770
You don't put your fucking hands in
that dashboard. Who are your favorites?

450
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,100
Okay.

451
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,410
Who were your favorites?
They just had that one thing.

452
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,930
Your fucking friends you still quoted man.

453
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:06,530
Ice knew a bunch of those
is obviously a zillion guys.

454
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,900
Is it a zillion lines and
fucking Paul, uh, am sorry.

455
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:15,550
And I'm good fellas by the
way. Uh, rest in peace.

456
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:16,384
Frank Vincent,

457
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,500
the first big guy to go from
Goodfellas, man. I mean, what,

458
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,070
what an absolute legend.
What an absolute legend.

459
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,010
He was as amazing as an actor, as his hair
was. What a head of hair that guy had.

460
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,850
Good Lord Jesus Christ.
What a head of hair.

461
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:38,720
That guy had his whole frigging life.
That's what you say when you're bald.

462
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:40,910
You fucking see that on people.
Look at that guy.

463
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,050
I know if I ever had

464
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,883
that hair.

465
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,610
Some people, you know, some
people they just fucking,

466
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,800
I don't know what genes that guy is,
that guy,

467
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:58,240
he must add a Roman emperor or
something in his fucking family tree.

468
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,160
Um,
credible actor.

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,770
And so God damn funny, comedic
timing was incredible. Um,

470
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,510
I even love the commercially did
one I think is only line was oh,

471
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,360
when that guy was like stocking up the
freezer and he was disrespected him,

472
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:18,320
he and his buddy just
kept going. Oh, oh, um,

473
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,200
definitely going to miss him. And that
was definitely somebody on my bucket list.

474
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,870
You know, I get in a movie, I'm
like fucking two, three lines,

475
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:29,770
but that was definitely a bucket list
to ever be able to do a scene with him.

476
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,490
And what was so cool? Uh,
Michael Rappaport. Um,

477
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,690
quite possibly the funniest guy in
social media right now with this fucking

478
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:40,630
videos are so god damn funny.
Um,

479
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,540
he actually posted a picture on his
Twitter account. You should check it out.

480
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,370
I think it's,
I am at,

481
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:52,170
I am Rapaport and it's him working with
Frank Vincent in the early nineties.

482
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,420
Yeah,

483
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,990
it was like really early on.

484
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,610
And he got a picture of him shine and
Frank Vincent shoes and he said, uh,

485
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,970
at one time, Frank Vinson, uh,

486
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,890
maybe go home and get my shine box.

487
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,880
And what I love was a lot of people
now can look back on it, a classic,

488
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:11,910
and everybody's quoted it a zillion times,
but Rappaport already knew.

489
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,210
Go home and get your fucking shine box.
He was on that shit early.

490
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,280
Fucking early nineties. Uh,
they barely done editing it.

491
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,800
He already knew that that was
an instant fucking classic. Uh,

492
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,160
I got to get him back on the podcast
again. He has so many amazing stories. Um,

493
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,830
anyways, uh, let's skip that.
Let me finish this phone.
I had to break up the, the,

494
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:34,920
uh, podcast reading, I mean,
the advertising reading. Why?

495
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,400
Why don't we say the wrong thing first
before I correct it. I don't know bill,

496
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,790
cause you're dumb because you have a
zillion things on your mind. I know.

497
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:45,920
Fair enough. All right. Dollar
Shave club everybody. Um,

498
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:49,500
what you might not know,
there's a lot of things you do know,

499
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:52,290
but what you might not know,
I said Buddy,

500
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,720
is that dollar shave club also also has
products for pretty much everything else

501
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:02,040
you need in the bathroom.
Bodywash, Shampoo, hair, Gel,

502
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:06,180
don't need any of that. Lip Balm,
everything. What am I going to Moose,

503
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,440
my pubes uh,

504
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,680
at the store there are too many options
and you can't tell the difference

505
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:11,520
between any of them.

506
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,750

usually doesn't know the difference or

507
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:19,680
it's still running the fucking
cash register. They can't
help you anyways. Right?

508
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,311

574
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,830
All right. All right, well let's
get back to what the fuck. Okay.

575
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,470
Formula One. Did you think I was
going to talk about Formula One?

576
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,480
What'd you think I was gonna
talk about how Mississippi,

577
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,270
Mississippi State fucking
trounce my Lsu Tigers.

578
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,060
You know another one of my favorite teams,

579
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:12,110
Smu giving away 56 pounds per player
on the fucking offensive and defense

580
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,540
defensive line against Tcu.
C'Mon frogs.

581
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,820
How SMU was whipping that fucking Horn
toad ass for fucking the first half

582
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:24,090
before they wore him down.
He just leaned on him. Um,

583
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,260
do you think I was going to
congratulate the Cleveland Indians in an

584
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:28,670
unprecedented 22 in a row?

585
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,370
Does that what you thought I was going
to do you think I was going to do all of

586
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:32,461
that?

587
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:35,670
And I wasn't to talk about that Formula
One race down and fucking Singapore,

588
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,300
that race made me sick to one of
my favorite races of the year.

589
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,220
It's at night, it's in Singapore.
It's one of the most beautiful,

590
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,670
amazing slash kind of freaked me out
cities I've ever been to in my life slash

591
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:51,970
countries. Um, it really is
one of the most beautiful,

592
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,530
amazing fucking city where you
just feel like you're overbearing.

593
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:59,550
Parents are home all the time.
Um,

594
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,450
it was fucking rain. It was
night. It was raining out. Okay.

595
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,780
The Ferrari's were running great.
Daniel Ricardo was running great.

596
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,380
Mercedes wasn't doing that well,
you know,

597
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,380
I don't know if Hamilton at fucking,
I thought it was all tied up.

598
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,420
Maybe he was up by three points.
I can't remember.

599
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,300
But Ferrari needed to show up
on this fucking day. All right.

600
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,110
And if you watched when they were doing
the time trials on Saturday and you sell

601
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,620
what was like trying to drive
behind somebody doing 150, 60, 70,

602
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:35,030
80 fucking miles an hour with that
fucking rooster tail of water coming up.

603
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,570
I mean, it was going to be
an unbelievable fucking race.

604
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,620
God knows whoever's in fucking first
place and then first turn is going to win

605
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,560
the God damn race.
All right,

606
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,600
so Sebastian Vettel the Ferrari's,
they get first and third.

607
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,530
All right, well Daniel recard on the
red bull isn't second fucking place.

608
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,660
I believe that's the way it was.
Right?

609
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,360
Fucking Mercedes or back
and fourth and fifth.

610
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,530
So the Goddamn race starts
offer Ferrari has to do.

611
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,790
All he's gotta do is just make it to
the first turn in first fucking place

612
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,620
unscathed. He's going to win this
fucking race. Okay. Worst case scenario,

613
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:20,310
Hamilton gets fucking second place.
That's only 18 points.

614
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,630
Federal is going to get 25 he'll
pick up fucking, you know, whatever.

615
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,080
What does that seven points?
The fucking race starts.

616
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,380
Yeah,

617
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,570
Kimmy Reagan and he acted like
fucking Greg Brady. When, when?

618
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,050
When the pressure was on to beaten gotta
beat Marsha could to get close to the

619
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,390
quarter of an inch. He fucking
stomps on gas. Tries to go around.

620
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,610
Okay.

621
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,260
Oh, I'm sorry. It was Max Verstappen,

622
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,210
not Daniel car tries to go around the
guy that fucking tires get all fucking

623
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,743
yeah,

624
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,520
in a locked there when they
fucking go up and over.

625
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,120
Yeah,

626
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,660
he fucking fucks up his car.

627
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,490
Slams the fucking red bull
car into his fucking teammate.

628
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,710
Okay.

629
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,320
The other Ferrari Vettel

630
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,580
makes it to the first turn unscathed.
Meanwhile, fucking not on skate,

631
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,300
but he makes it there, but it takes,
car's fucked up. It got hit in the back.

632
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,920
Meanwhile, fucking lose fuck. And
Hamilton, he drives right around the shit.

633
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,810
Raise sneak sneaking by. Fuckhead
comes back in with this fucked up car.

634
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,680
Greg Brady,

635
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,180
right smashes in to the
fucking red bold guy again.

636
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,070
And who does he hit? He hits the fucking
Alfonso in the fucking orange car.

637
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:37,200
Try and do the exact same
thing as Lewis Hamilton,

638
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:40,800
but Lewis Hamilton's that Derek Jeter,
fucking star child,

639
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,490
just blessed 3000 hit the aid of
fucking grand. Slam one of these guys

640
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,570
in fucking Vettel drives like,
you know,

641
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:50,660
two more turns in the whole front of
his car. It comes off both Ferrari's,

642
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,290
out of the fucking race. They were in
first and third place, a first and fourth.

643
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,370
I can't,
I don't remember.

644
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,473
They had them.

645
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,210
They had them and they let off the hook.

646
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,000
They were both out of the race
before it even fucking started.

647
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,910
And all I could think is what
my dad used to always say.

648
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:13,480
When somebody would do something like
that, you'd be on crisis guy or that guy.

649
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,520
I said, okay, you could
fuck up a free lunch.

650
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,820
That's the first expression that popped
in my head. I think I tweeted it.

651
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:22,510
I was so fucking pissed. Ferrari
could fuck up a free lunch. I mean,

652
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:26,200
that was a free lunch. No one
could drive fast. That date.

653
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:29,390
Mercedes weren't running well the whole
fucking weekend. So what do you do?

654
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,160
You take out yourself and you fucking
teammate you clear out the whole fucking

655
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:37,090
front row.

656
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,080
So fucking Lewis Hamilton, who just
drives along unscathed. That guy,

657
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,550
Lewis Hamilton is a blessed man.
That's one of those deals.

658
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,010
He's one of those guys. Makes you
believe in a higher power like this.

659
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:52,990
Just somebody that just
fucking loves. I mean, I,

660
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,310
I'm taking away all the
preparation the man does, but

661
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,813
you know,

662
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,710
he cuts around the outside,
no problem.

663
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,460
Alfonso goes through the same thing
his fucking days over. Unbelievable.

664
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:08,420
And then the rest of the race and riding
around the fucking rain in Hamilton

665
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:12,640
fucking wins. No problem.
Unfucking believable.

666
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,170
Okay.

667
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,790
I wanted to see a race. I knew that
Hamilton was going to try to fucking,

668
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,150
he wasn't gonna be happy sitting in,
you know, all the way back there. Right.

669
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,380
Who would be right.

670
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,680
I wanted to see what the fuck he
was going to do with this car.

671
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:29,580
Not doing that well and all of that
rain. What? He actually crashed. I mean,

672
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:31,530
you know, he's going to push
it to the fucking limit.

673
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,810
All of that was out of the second.
It started like,

674
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:40,770
remember that year the jets was supposed
to be good and like fucking 99 and like

675
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:41,730
the first game,

676
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:45,990
Vinnie tested verde goes back and blows
out as Achilles and then Keyshawn was

677
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:50,310
crying after the game. That was the
original. That's my quarterback.

678
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,400
That was the original.
Um,

679
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,880
that's what it was like. I still watch
the fucking rice. It was still fucking,

680
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,790
it was still exciting by
Jesus Christ. Um, anyways.

681
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:06,960
Okay.

682
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,640
And then I also,
I watched the boxing.

683
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,980
That's all I did this weekend is I just
fucking watched a brain in an episode of

684
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:12,691
F is for family.

685
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:14,910
So I just stayed in the whole fucking
weekend when I wasn't writing.

686
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:17,700
I was just watching sports and,
uh,

687
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,590
I'm not a big boxing guy just because
I've gotten fucked over so many times in

688
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:26,760
the paper views. Uh, so
forgive me if I fuck up.

689
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:29,640
The pronunciation is a Golovkin first.

690
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:34,330
Conello and uh,
that took me back.

691
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,280
That's what pay per view.
Boxing. He used to be.

692
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,230
I'm not saying he didn't get fucked
every once in a while back then,

693
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:41,850
but it was just too, they was fucking
forehead to forehead. Just, it was a war,

694
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,210
feeling each other out, respecting each
other and all that shit. And then, uh,

695
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:47,740
the usual bullshit happened.

696
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,830
You know how that fucking lady saw at one
18 to one 10? I mean, I, I the Jesus, I,

697
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,080
I don't know shit about boxing.
And I was like, what the fuck? Um,

698
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,330
and I loved how Roy Jones in the
fucking end goes like, I, he goes,

699
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:04,180
I love that it was a draw,
you know,

700
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,840
cause that means we get to see this again
and next time there's definitely going

701
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:12,610
to be a decision. And I felt
that, I felt like he was like,

702
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,600
they were like, Roy, don't bring this up.
This is the Illuminati script of boxing.

703
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,590
Please don't bring this shit up. That
it's, this whole fucking thing is a,

704
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,820
that it was going to be a drive.

705
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:25,330
We had any way to make this thing be a
fucking draw so we could do it again.

706
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,520
Um, but it was great. It was a
great fucking fight. It's so,

707
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,100
I thought a glove can
clearly won the fight.

708
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,020
I just thought he was backing up the
whole fucking time. And uh, I know can,

709
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,180
I had some big shots towards the end,
but he glove could just fucking walk.

710
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:47,380
He ate them all up. He ate him up. He
just can, he would back off for a second.

711
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,420
You just come back and then he would
fucking give him, uh, you know,

712
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:54,280
if he took two, we'd come
back and give him too. I just
thought, you know, I dunno,

713
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,160
I agreed with you that,
that fucking guy who screams all the time.

714
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,820
No,
I got to fight the mood.

715
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,800
That guy, he's always screaming. Uh,

716
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,910
do they have them in the crowd
so we can't hear himself?

717
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:09,350
Does he not have headsets on? I loved
that he yells every fucking time. Um,

718
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,150
I dunno. I thoroughly enjoyed
it. The decision obviously stunk,

719
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:16,400
but I did not feel that
I got fucked on my money.

720
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:20,540
I feel like the fighter's got fucked and
I retweeted this rant that Teddy Atlas

721
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:25,280
went on and um, it was, you know,

722
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,730
somebody has to say, I just don't
understand how it's still that corrupt.

723
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,520
It's just, they've never
like, it was weird.

724
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:35,210
Like Vegas was totally
corrupt and totally mobbed up.

725
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,110
And then they cleaned it up by putting
those corporations in there who then

726
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,420
fucked you on everything,
including the steak.

727
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,483
Yeah.

728
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,620
Why can't they clean up boxing?

729
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,970
Can they get the mob out of this so that
the corporations can come over on the

730
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:54,600
legal side of stealing and fuck people
more than they ever have. Maybe they have,

731
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,600
I have no idea.
I don't understand it.

732
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,190
But a Teddy Atlas said,
I'm gonna,

733
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,630
I'm gonna Butcher it.
How he said it.

734
00:42:04,631 --> 00:42:08,230
He said those guys went in the ring
and came out less of who they were.

735
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:12,820
Meaning that they fit you do
permanent damage to yourself.

736
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,240
I mean,
will they will break it down the uh,

737
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:17,930
okay.

738
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,760
They will break it down, the power
shots and all of that type of shit.

739
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:23,990
And it's like I was watching
Rogan's recap of it.

740
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,460
Okay.

741
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,930
With Jim Norton and,
uh,

742
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,630
Rogan read some stats where this guy,
he took, okay. You know, here's the,

743
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:37,070
blew his head.
He took 118 punches to the fucking head.

744
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,970
I haven't taken 118 punches to
the head of my life. Am I bowled?

745
00:42:42,971 --> 00:42:44,740
A brother used to beat the
shit out of me all the time,

746
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:46,330
but we knew you kept it to the body.

747
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,280
That's what your father wouldn't
see it when he came home. Um, so,

748
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:54,190
but other than that, I
mean it was, it was great.

749
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:59,191
It was everything that I knew that may
weather and m McGregor wasn't going to

750
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:03,190
be. And that's why I didn't rent it.
And that's why I spent my money on that.

751
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,270
I still got fucked.

752
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,150
MMM.

753
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,860
But, uh, it's Tommy
Morrison still alive. Okay.

754
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:13,530
I have to hit pause on this
cause I gotta watch this shit.

755
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,790
He's a relative of fucking
John Wayne in case she didn't know.

756
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,930
I'm sorry. He's a boxer back
in the day. Uh, all right.

757
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,770
I got to read some of the, uh,
the shit here for this week.

758
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,140
I can't see anything here doing
this in my fucking living room.

759
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,360
We bought these things
and where we, uh, yeah,

760
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,850
and another thing I had
to fix on this house,

761
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:38,030
say these fucking awful lights on
the wall. So we bought these sconces,

762
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,210
these really fancy fucking things.
And the thing,

763
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,240
the fancy thing in front of the
light is so goddamn thick that it,

764
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,800
it always seems like it's on a dimmer.

765
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:53,000
It probably should have just bought
a higher wattage bulb. I Dunno.

766
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,560
This has gotta be one of those
moments where you're like,

767
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:55,940
why the fuck am I listening to this guy?

768
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:58,250
He's talking about the fucking light
bulbs in his living room. I'm sorry.

769
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,980
All right. DNA testing
at Raven's game. No boy,

770
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,690
dear bill, I love the podcast.
Love you. Stand up. I Love
F is for family. Thank you.

771
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:10,840
I have to start promoting
that at my standup shows too
because I feel like a lot

772
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:15,040
of people still don't know the show's
on. Um, so if you get a chance,

773
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,020
if he give the show,

774
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,110
tell your friends about it and everything
just so we can continue doing the show

775
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:22,180
would be awesome.
He said,

776
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:26,380
I wanted to hear your opinion on
this very weird giveaway at Sundays.

777
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:27,250
Ravens game.

778
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,070
I'm a season ticket holder for the
ravens and it's not unusual to get little

779
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:36,180
freebies when you went to stadium
commemorative coins, beer, koozies flags,

780
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:37,014
et Cetera.

781
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,200
A Sunday is the home opener and some
company is giving away free DNA test.

782
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:46,650
So I guess this happened yesterday.
Free Dna test,

783
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,330
but he trying to do it. Figure out
if you're a fucking human being. Um,

784
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,530
and it's not even some ancestry.com
type shit that could give you some semi

785
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:56,370
useful information.

786
00:44:56,371 --> 00:44:59,790
You're not getting any useful information
from ancestry.com they're doing what

787
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,710
this company is doing.
I don't know what they're doing,

788
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,120
but they're not trying to help you out.

789
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,170
Do you really need to know how much
Scottish blood you have in you that you

790
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,550
really need? What? So what you can do,

791
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:12,210
what go on and go feel justified by an
a fucking kilt. You're not Scottish.

792
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:16,860
You're a Mutt. Um, the
article I linked says,

793
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,460
uh,
they're testing for four genes.

794
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,440
The test offers insight into your mind,
body and health is what they claim.

795
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,700
It seems like this company just wants a
bunch of data and they figured that an

796
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:33,870
NFL game is a great way to get 70,000
mouth breathe and fucking morons.

797
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,480
Um, that, that part was me. 70,000
people, d 70,000 people's DNA all at once.

798
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,620
Uh, the company has also partnered
with the 40 niners. So testing my,

799
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,840
come to San Francisco soon.
What are your thoughts?

800
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:47,900
Keep up the good work
and go fuck yourself. Ah,

801
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,830
I think I know exactly what this is.

802
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,233
MMM.

803
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,740
In the future,
people's DNA is going to be a,

804
00:45:57,741 --> 00:46:00,560
it's just starting to
become a revenue source.

805
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,250
The way your phone number and all of
this other shit that they get from you at

806
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:07,130
cvs and all these fucking places.

807
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:11,180
It was another revenue stream where
you were buying shaving cream tampons

808
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:14,390
whenever the fuck you doing and then
they would get personal information from

809
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:18,440
you that then they could then sell
to other fucking companies. Um,

810
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:20,960
I think it is now that
they've exhausted all of that,

811
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:22,790
they've now moving on to fingerprints,

812
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,940
face recognition in DNA and they're
going to share this with everybody.

813
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,400
And uh, I know the robots are
coming. I don't know how to,

814
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,380
I don't know where this all lands.

815
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:37,940
I know that there's talks in the future
that human beings could be meshed with

816
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:38,774
robots.

817
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,010
MMM.

818
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:42,600
If I had to guess,

819
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:46,200
they're probably going to get to the
point where with your DNA they can grow

820
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,110
another you and say,
well that's not really you.

821
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:51,090
The real you is going to the ravens game.

822
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:54,020
So we're going to do all
kinds of Nazi doctors,

823
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,150
Nazi doctor esque type experiments on
this with the fucking robot before we

824
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:03,510
release this to the public.
That's where I think it's going.

825
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,400
All right.
And you know,

826
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:12,430
I don't want my twin adult brother coming
into this world had 51 years of age

827
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,880
cause I figured another two years
we'll probably start doing it

828
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,530
and getting a fucking,
you know,

829
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,620
bionic arm put on as he's
screaming and fucking pink has,

830
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:27,700
God knows they're not going to use
fucking anesthetic cause that that fucking

831
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,100
DNA version,

832
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,450
you will be the property of a corporation
and we'll have no rights to fucking

833
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,533
mmm

834
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:42,060
anesthetic.
Why don't I write Scifi?

835
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:42,391
You know,

836
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:46,390
I did the whole fucking thing about how
you had to take a test and if you flunk

837
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:48,330
the test on the population control,
eh,

838
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:51,600
you just walk into the ocean and now
there's a movie coming out about that.

839
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,270
I Dunno,
maybe I'm just not original.

840
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,670
Maybe I should start writing these
fucking things and that sounds like a cool

841
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,330
fucking movie, right? Uh,
you have to go save yourself.

842
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,131
You know,

843
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:09,200
Hollywood do some fucking creepy happy
ending where you're just staring there

844
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:12,630
yourself touching each other's face
and everybody's fucking crying.

845
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,660
MMM.

846
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,410
I Dunno. You throw will Smith in there
somehow. It's a winner. All right.

847
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,970
Whiny fan complaining.
All right. Howdy bill.

848
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,040
I'm a four year podcast listener and I
saw you love and San Antonio early this

849
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,870
year.
I think your layers guy,

850
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:33,380
and obviously it should podcast
and I should go fuck myself,

851
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:38,330
but I think your Trump positions
are kind of unfair. Um, oh God.

852
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:42,170
Not another political fucking person.
He did call himself off of being,

853
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,800
I think your Trump positions
are kind of unfair.

854
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,890
Well then you think my Hillary ones
are fair. All right. God bless you.

855
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,710
I know you're just a comedian.

856
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,400
I know you have a lot of fans
in the quote real America. Ah,

857
00:48:56,401 --> 00:49:00,050
there's the left talking
down to the right. Okay.

858
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,930
And so you have to tow align.

859
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,900
Isn't this? This is the classic, I really
hope the person wrote this is listening,

860
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:09,810
sir.
You're in,

861
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,860
you are inventing all of this in your
head because you're upset about something

862
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:20,210
politically. Okay? Are you mad at
what I'm talking about about Trump?

863
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:24,140
Is that what this is that you feel?
I have to tow some sort of fucking what?

864
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:28,440
Liberal Line because I'm
out here in Hollywood. Uh,

865
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,870
but Trump is, to my mind,
obviously a dangerous guy.

866
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,960
I won't go through my whole
list of grievance grievances,

867
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:39,650
but he thinks climate
change is a Chinese hoax,

868
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:45,790
a supports the white supremacists and
just this week through the lies of 800,000

869
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,820
I think that to make sure
he didn't use any comments,

870
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:54,740
you 8 million people who were brought
here as children into disarray.

871
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,760
I know every president has skeletons,
but even a liberal like me, Oh,

872
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:05,770
is a Hillary person can see this
guy is nothing like w w or George H.

873
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,920
Uh, dude, when did I say I liked this guy?

874
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,970
I never did.
I never said that I liked the guy.

875
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,770
I just said people freaking out about
them and losing their fucking shit.

876
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:23,340
I should've been more specific
like fucking white people
acting like the needle

877
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:27,860
in your life was going to change that
fucking far. All right. By the way,

878
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,180
um, you know, if you really
want to see a bunch of skeleton,

879
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:36,710
both of these people, I mean this
election was essentially 2:00 AM at a bar.

880
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:41,000
I mean, you had to go home with somebody,
right? Probably shouldn't have. Um,

881
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,410
listen, this fucking guy thinks climate
change is a hoax. Fine. All right.

882
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,460
Hillary was all for bailing out
these fucking banks in 2008,

883
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:53,200
which is exactly what the fuck happened.

884
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,250
And all these people who stayed in
Florida riding out the fucking storm and

885
00:50:57,251 --> 00:51:00,400
everybody's making fun of them and saying
how dumb they are for staying there.

886
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,980
They're probably upside
down in their house.

887
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,840
And unlike the bankers don't have
another house that they can go to. Yeah.

888
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:09,820
Evacuate the area and do what?

889
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,840
Go with half of the Florida and sit
in a fucking waffle house in Georgia.

890
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:16,180
And then what?
I don't have enough gas money to get back.

891
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,010
I love the complete lack of sympathy
for people that can completely fucked in

892
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:21,940
2008

893
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,050
which Hillary was totally all about.

894
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,050
She was also all about fucking

895
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,310
okay.

896
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:30,760
You know,

897
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,810
ignoring the wishes of the people on the
left who voted more for fucking Bernie

898
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:39,790
Sanders according to this
trial and colluded with the
Democratic Party to ignore

899
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:41,500
those votes in box.

900
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:45,460
Bernie Sanders out in and she just took
the nomination and now all of a sudden

901
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:49,000
she's got the fucking balls to sit here
and talk about the electorial college.

902
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,620
Okay. She's not a good person
either. And I'm not saying w was,

903
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:56,890
I told you I was done. I want
to say WME. Sorry. Donald Trump.

904
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,690
I said I was done with Donald Trump.

905
00:51:59,400 --> 00:51:59,740
Okay.

906
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,300
When he said that both sides can
take contributed to the violence,

907
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,480
that he couldn't even get himself to say
that those Nazis might be a little out

908
00:52:07,481 --> 00:52:11,620
of their fucking minds. The neonazis I
told you I was done with the guy. Okay,

909
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:16,060
but you hate the guy so much. You're
hearing what she want to hear. All right.

910
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,790
Maybe I don't Trump trashed
Trump enough on this podcast,

911
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:22,120
but I don't feel that I need to,
everybody,

912
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:26,110
at least in my profession has a bit
on how fucking stupid the guy is.

913
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,960
Million dry mouth talking about this shit.
So I don't, and for you to sit there,

914
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:36,110
you fucking cunt. After four
years of listening to my podcast,

915
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,360
acting like I tow some sort of line.
Did you,

916
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,000
do you ever listen to my fucking
advertise and I lose advertisers all the

917
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:44,150
fucking time. Okay. If I was
towing some sort of line,

918
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:46,370
I would read those things like
I was on fucking Lawrence Welk.

919
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,460
Hypen Geritol I don't.
Okay.

920
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,770
I tow a line as far as I say,
what the fuck? I think it's funny.

921
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,020
That's the line that I am
towing here, sir. I'm sorry,

922
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:02,070
the guy that you wanted to fucking win
didn't fucking win. I know. I know.

923
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:04,420
Trump's out of his fucking mind
and I don't need you wagon.

924
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:07,250
You fucking finger at me. Give me
a God damn fucking lecture. Yeah.

925
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,800
Okay.

926
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,310
Is if I don't understand that
this guy's fucked up. Okay,

927
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,550
so why don't you look at your,
I'll up your own fucking skirt.

928
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,093
Okay.

929
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,640
It'd be a little more even handed
all you fucking guys. I mean,

930
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,980
I guess you got to whine
about Trump because he's
actually the fucking president

931
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,900
of Jesus Christ.
The fucking,

932
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,700
I don't know what the fuck it is that
Hillary gets is, is unbelievable.

933
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:36,050
P S Hillary sucks. That's all
I get on this side. You know,

934
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:36,681
he said,
look man,

935
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,270
I just think that despite what
you're saying about being community,

936
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,500
you do have a platform.
Fuck you buddy. Fuck you.

937
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,110
You're not putting that on me. All right.
I can tell you this right now, dude.

938
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,200
If you get your political information
from a fucking standup comedian who can't

939
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:54,740
even read out loud,

940
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:00,500
you use this thing to decide who the
leader of the free world is going to be.

941
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:04,610
I can't help you. What am I supposed to
do? You know what I would say to you?

942
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,890
Send you fucking DNA into the ravens.

943
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,200
Um, anyways, you do
have a platform and why?

944
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:13,940
I'd never dare to tell you what to say.

945
00:54:13,941 --> 00:54:17,750
I hope you will consider what happens
when you play down the danger of his

946
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:21,170
behaviors. Um, let me ask you this sir.

947
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:25,490
What exactly would be happening now if
the other fucking bought and paid for

948
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,980
fucking Twat went in there?
What do you think would happen?

949
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,970
What do you think would
happened? Huh? Do you honestly,

950
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,870
while she admits that global warming is
real, what do you think? What happened?

951
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,400
Do you think she's going to do anything
most the most she could be and therefore

952
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,290
is eight. Fuck, they just wait him out.

953
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,180
Al Gore in 1992 said that there has to
be a car that gets at least a hundred

954
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,340
miles a gallon by the fucking
year, 2000, something like that.

955
00:54:56,341 --> 00:54:59,700
And it just kept delaying the project
and delaying it and delaying and delaying

956
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:00,630
it and delaying it.

957
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:06,000
And then they were out of office and they
just fucking went away. There you go.

958
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,660
So I don't know what to tell you.
I have to tell you buddy. Um,

959
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,240
I always vote outside of the
democratic and the Republican Party.

960
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,970
Okay.
Unless I find somebody within them,

961
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:20,220
like a Bernie Sanders
who I feel will actually,

962
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,630
hopefully make more people within those
bought and paid for fucking groups.

963
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,140
Uh, I don't know. Take a stand for
fucking regular people. I mean,

964
00:55:29,141 --> 00:55:33,100
that's what I do. Okay. I
don't like Trump. The guy
makes me sick to my stomach.

965
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:37,810
I think he's a, I absolutely think
the guy's fucking racist. Uh,

966
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:41,710
but I also think Hillary is the
fucking devil in a lot of ways.

967
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,490
We sidestepped a bunch of other shit.
Okay.

968
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,260
We walked into a bunch
of the shit with Trump.

969
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:51,100
But you definitely sidestepped
the come on man. Everybody,

970
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,110
anybody with any remote sense of
intelligence knows that, you know,

971
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:59,230
that was the fucking Blue Bonnet bowl.
All right. That wasn't the fucking,

972
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:04,730
that wasn't Alabama versus fucking
Clemson or shit. That was uh, you know,

973
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,360
that was the holiday bowl election.
Alright. Actual money based, but I, I'm,

974
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,000
you know, I dunno. I Dunno why
you needed to send me that dude.

975
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,610
Do you honestly think that I want to
see fucking kids get sent out of this

976
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:18,460
country? I don't. I don't. Okay,

977
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,800
so stop turning me into the fucking,

978
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,460
you know what it is you want
of this country's fucked out.

979
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:28,330
There's a guy who can't read out loud
that does a podcast twice a week.

980
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,920
And I'm telling you that is,

981
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:35,460
if we could just get him to
politically say what we feel,

982
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,700
I think we could turn this country around.

983
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:39,650
Okay.

984
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:44,180
We're taking callers. I said, buddy,
um, actual money based on gold.

985
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,760
Hey,
Billy gold bullocks.

986
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,630
That'd be great. Have some gold bullets
in that fucking diamond encrusted pouch.

987
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:59,000
I was listening to Rogan's
podcast recently and he had
a guy called Peter Shift

988
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:03,650
on and he was talking
about gold money.com.

989
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:07,220
This is basically a private gold
reserve where you can buy gold,

990
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,170
which is held in a
secure vault. Oh, is it?

991
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:18,170
Listen, you give us our money and
we'll have, we'll hold your gold.

992
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,990
Great.
So they keep my cash and the goal,

993
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:25,430
do I got to send them a donkey toe
and using a prepaid mastercard,

994
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:30,431
you can pay for goods and services with
your money backed by gold or platinum if

995
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:32,640
you'd rather buy that.
Uh,

996
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:36,050
I would do that immediately or when the
dollar crash is effectively what the

997
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:41,051
banks used to do a before they sold the
foundations of our currency here is here

998
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:47,330
in the UK. Gordon Brown sold all
the diamonds that back sterling,

999
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,800
uh, when the bank shit the bed. Um,

1000
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,680
I don't know what any of that
means. Here in UK. Gordon Brown,

1001
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:56,480
who's Gordon Brown or is that a bank

1002
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,480
like fucking JP Morgan,
uh,

1003
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,030
sold all the diamonds that back sterling
when the bank shit the bed. Oh, okay.

1004
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,360
So you got your money back.
Cause I was saying I just,

1005
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:12,770
this minute signed up does sounds like
a commercial and I'll be putting some

1006
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:13,431
money into it,

1007
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:16,980
although not all my money as it's always
best to diversify when you stash of

1008
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:17,301
saving.

1009
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:21,230
I think it is much better than bitcoin
as it's actually based on something of

1010
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,910
value. I love you to
go fuck yourself, sir.

1011
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:26,150
Why don't you just take your
money and go buy a gold coin?

1012
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,450
Why don't you just do that?

1013
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,780
Why don't you take your paper and go
buy some gold and leave with the gold

1014
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,480
rather than giving your money to this
fucking person you're not gonna meet any

1015
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,080
tells you that he has got,
he know there's gold there.

1016
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,080
He's basically doing what they're doing
with Fort Knox where they say there's

1017
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:52,260
all this golden there and then there's
rumors that it's fucking empty. Um,

1018
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:55,490
I liked the direction you're
going in, but uh, I think you, uh,

1019
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:59,040
went out of the frying pan into
the fire with that one grant.

1020
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:01,500
I don't want to shit on the whatever
that guy's doing because I got your

1021
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:02,970
abridged version of it.
But um,

1022
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:08,030
that reminded me of that movie blow where
Johnny Depp's character gives him $2

1023
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,370
million in cash and they give him
a book that says $2 million on it.

1024
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:14,790
Then he goes to jail. He never
gets his fucking money. All right.

1025
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,640
My girlfriend's daughter
is causing us to break up.

1026
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,670
Is that a bad thing? Um,
Jesus Christ. I mean,

1027
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,380
you're already dating somebody
that already has a kid,

1028
00:59:25,381 --> 00:59:28,140
so that's going to be already a hundred
times harder to make that fucking work.

1029
00:59:28,141 --> 00:59:29,460
And then the kid doesn't even like you.

1030
00:59:29,461 --> 00:59:31,230
So I mean maybe she's
doing you a solid here.

1031
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,433
MMM.

1032
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,130
Hey Bill. Okay, here we go. So
my girl and I have seven years,

1033
00:59:38,131 --> 00:59:41,910
both work for the same company and I
was offered a better position in Florida

1034
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,820
and she was also offered
a position as well.

1035
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,910
Now here's where the daughter comes
in and fucks up the flow. Yeah.

1036
00:59:47,911 --> 00:59:50,220
Cause she fucking probably
wants to stay at her school.

1037
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,510
Her daughter's 14 is just
starting high school,

1038
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:57,360
just a foods refusing to move and her
mother is going along with not forcing her

1039
00:59:57,361 --> 01:00:01,800
to move and it's going to pass her
is going to pass on our position.

1040
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:06,670
We agreed I will not move down and
get things in order until she wait.

1041
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:11,460
We agreed I will move down and get things
in order until she gets there in four

1042
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:12,660
years.
Now,

1043
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:17,130
for the past few weeks we've been getting
into more fights in our reasoning for

1044
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:19,830
the fight is sit down for this one bill.

1045
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,930
She says it's easier for
me to leave when she's mad.

1046
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:31,740
She's fighting you because it's easier
for you to leave when she's mad.

1047
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,540
I think that's the dumbest fucking reason
I've ever heard. Also, she keeps saying,

1048
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:41,340
I'm going to go down and find myself some
black ass and ended up cheating on her

1049
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:42,450
while I'm there.

1050
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,740
Okay.

1051
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,400
We'd love to get your take on this
situation and get your insight on what I

1052
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:52,290
should do. Thanks. And pick up a
fucking drink. You Pussy. Fuck.

1053
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,430
Ah,
I would say A.

1054
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:58,500
Okay.

1055
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,410
I'd say there's a staggering
lack of trust. Um,

1056
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,003
okay.

1057
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:07,280
I think the key here is to not get into
an argument with her is to just sit down

1058
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,420
and try and discuss it with
her and just say, listen, yeah,

1059
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,583
mmm.

1060
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:16,020
We agreed that this is what
I was going to do and now

1061
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,110
what it is is I know,
I think this is what happened.

1062
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:25,690
What she did was she did what was best
for her daughter and she put herself with

1063
01:01:25,691 --> 01:01:26,770
you in second,

1064
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,660
but she still sounds like cares about
you and the fact that you're down there

1065
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:33,970
and she's worried that you're
going to leave and she misses you.

1066
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,480
I think that that's what's happening.
So I would just ask her,

1067
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:41,530
it's just some like misdirected anger.
I,

1068
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,200
we were actually just saying
that you miss me and you love me.

1069
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,510
Is that what you're saying?
It,

1070
01:01:46,511 --> 01:01:49,180
we can work through this and then if
you're really not going to fuck around,

1071
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:50,920
we're on her and you're really
going to see it through.

1072
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:54,160
Then you want to be able to just say,
listen, I'll do whatever it takes.

1073
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:56,290
I'm going to be there in four years.
If you're not lying,

1074
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,860
I think you ought to be able
to work your way through it.

1075
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,420
And I think this has less to do with
the daughter then it has to do with the

1076
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,510
fact that she just misses you and
she's afraid that you're going to find

1077
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:12,030
somebody else down there.
Evidently wherever you moved where,

1078
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:14,430
uh,
there's a bunch of black ass down there.

1079
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,340
That's what I was,
that's what I would guess.

1080
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:22,800
So are you guys need to get on the
same page and you didn't have an honest

1081
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:26,370
moment with yourself before you
fucking slowly tear the bandaid off.

1082
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,720
Either get the fuck out of it are
totally commit to her. Um, I mean,

1083
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:33,490
seven years at this point. Why didn't
you drop in a fucking ring on her?

1084
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:34,770
Okay.

1085
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:38,480
Done on a, shut her up for a
good couple of weekends. Um,

1086
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:41,900
it won't shut her up permanently.
I can tell you that right now. Oh,

1087
01:02:41,901 --> 01:02:42,860
I can tell you some stories.

1088
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,490
Oh,

1089
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,840
can I tell you so, oh shit.
Right back in a or a tea latte.

1090
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:52,710
11 mayor Reed Guy who jumps through all
the fucking hoops and still gets the

1091
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:54,810
evil lot. All right. My wife,

1092
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:02,340
uh, my wife is, uh, who were there,

1093
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:06,540
Bill Billy Butler tits. Fuck you.
I'm losing weight. Uh, my wife,

1094
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:11,100
my wife decided to have an
affair for months ago. Oh boy.

1095
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,750
Before I knew what was going on,

1096
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:17,220
she told me she didn't know if she wanted
to be married to me anymore and that

1097
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:19,620
it was because I was too controlling.

1098
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,690
And by controlling she means I
told her as a stay at home mom,

1099
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,320
I had expectations.

1100
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:33,090
I expected it to keep the house clean and
take care of our children as we agreed

1101
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:35,860
when she quit her job.
Yeah.

1102
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:39,870
Which is a totally fair ask,

1103
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:45,120
you know. But nowadays in this
world of hyper fucking feminism,

1104
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,350
not all feminists are bad,
but the fucking, the uh,

1105
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,870
the god is great fucking
crazy ones there. Um, yeah,

1106
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:56,970
they would say that that was
sexist. That, you know, well,

1107
01:03:56,971 --> 01:04:01,830
why don't you work all fucking day and
then come home and also have the house

1108
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:03,750
clean. You know what I mean? Let me
look up. You got a bunch of kids,

1109
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:07,170
it can only be so fucking clean, but
at least she could do is order a pizza.

1110
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:08,940
Right? Um, anyways,

1111
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,690
I would come home to her friends being
at the house and her drinking all

1112
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:16,640
afternoon while Jesus Christ. She's
not even making an effort. Oh,

1113
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,100
this is what happens when you draft
in the first round buddy. You know,

1114
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,490
you get those second rounders, they,
they got some to fucking proof. You know,

1115
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,940
that's just what happens when you marry
a 10. I'm assuming she's good looking.

1116
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:28,350
If you putting up with this shit.
Uh,

1117
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:33,060
I would get home from work after being
gone 15 hours and a half to say something

1118
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:37,170
about how I felt that the house was a
wreck and there was no dinner and sight.

1119
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,930
It never seemed to matter.
Back in January,

1120
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:44,040
we moved to Denver from Atlanta
thinking everything would be better.

1121
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:49,560
And she met this 25 year old guy who
she proceeded to sneak around behind my

1122
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:53,520
back with and bring our children around.
No Way.

1123
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,140
I'm 38, she's 35. We have two children and
we've been married for almost 12 years.

1124
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:02,530
Yeah, Dude. Yeah. This is a wrap. Yeah,

1125
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:07,300
and now she wants a divorce to plans
to move this kid into our home with our

1126
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:10,000
children. Oh my God, Dude.

1127
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,350
Okay.

1128
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,730
This is the worst person ever.

1129
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,920
I am beside myself with the thought of
the divorce and this punk living with my

1130
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:21,070
children. Oh my God. I know it won't last,

1131
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:24,640
but the fact is I don't want my children
to be around this piece of shit,

1132
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,520
let alone living in my house.
She thinks this is,

1133
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:31,090
she thinks this is perfectly okay
to put the kids and I through this.

1134
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:34,510
I do love her and would do
anything to save our marriage,

1135
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:38,830
but the truth is she's delusional
at this point and I guess I am too.

1136
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,690
What do I do this?
Stop this.

1137
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:44,500
I know this is not my fault because I
busted my ass to build the life she always

1138
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:47,440
dreamed of. Only for her to
think she can kick me out of it.

1139
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:52,441
Any advice and or the lovely nick you
could give would be greatly appreciated.

1140
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,930
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah,
man. I mean, this is the things,

1141
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,560
this is what can happen to a guy.

1142
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,083
MMM.

1143
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:06,860
But you're not allowed to talk about
this on television are you? Never,

1144
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:11,030
never, never. You can talk about guys
being overbearing, domestic violence,

1145
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:13,070
all those things that
should be brought to light,

1146
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:18,050
but they will not talk about this.
You Watch doctor Phil talk about this.

1147
01:06:18,051 --> 01:06:22,270
You want to blame the guy.
So she saying,

1148
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:27,280
Lou reason that she saw his
cock was because you weren't
paying enough attention

1149
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:33,440
to her. You need to try to
pay attention more to her.

1150
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,830
Well,
she sucking his dick.

1151
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:43,200
What do I do to stop this?
I don't know.

1152
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,083
MMM.

1153
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,790
At this point I would be
thinking about my kids

1154
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,200
and how I could

1155
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:58,870
make this as
look through.

1156
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:01,770
This is what the fuck she wants to do.
This is what the fuck she wants to do.

1157
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,000
Are you make this as easy a fucker?
Transition your fucking divorce. Uh,

1158
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,800
I can tell you this.
I know you called her a whore here.

1159
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:13,920
Don't ever say that to your kids
because at the end of the day,

1160
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:18,000
it's still their mother and
you got to fucking, you know,

1161
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,680
you got to look the other way.
Um, I dunno dude, this is,

1162
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:24,990
this is outside my fucking realm.
Um,

1163
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,880
I can tell you this dude,
you fucking 38 years old.

1164
01:07:29,881 --> 01:07:33,030
You sound like a great fucking guy.
Um,

1165
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,900
I would just, whatever you got to
do for your kids, I would do that.

1166
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:42,630
Her is a fucking lost cause.
All right.

1167
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,700
And I would, um, yeah,

1168
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,060
I would do that and I
would start P90x and,

1169
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,150
and go out and get yourself a fucking
beautiful, goodhearted fucking woman.

1170
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:54,890
I mean,
I would maybe even if you have time,

1171
01:07:54,891 --> 01:07:57,800
I would go to therapy and figure
out how the fuck you ended up.

1172
01:07:58,670 --> 01:07:59,230
Okay,

1173
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,090
well she's just a total psycho.
Like,

1174
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:06,460
so you don't go out and fucking marry
that again. Um, figure that out.

1175
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:09,130
But the fuck I'm trying to marry
you off already. Jesus Christ.

1176
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,840
You just getting out of something.
I don't know.

1177
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:13,870
Do this by head spinning over this one
because I'm putting myself in your shoes.

1178
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:17,060
I don't know what the fuck I would do.
Um,

1179
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,860
oh man, that's a rough one.
Some other fucking guy going in

1180
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:28,420
telling your kids to pipe down.
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. Uh,

1181
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,340
yeah, I would, I would, uh,

1182
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,730
I would talk to somebody about this way
beyond my fucking educational level.

1183
01:08:35,731 --> 01:08:38,550
That's what I would do. I hope you
get through this thing and, uh,

1184
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,750
what a fucking mistake she's making.
I can tell you that,

1185
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:47,660
but she does the way you described it.
Granted, I gonna get your side of it.

1186
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:50,780
She does not sound like the final person
that even when she does fuck it up,

1187
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:54,680
she'll admit it.
She probably still put it on you and uh,

1188
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,660
but you know what?

1189
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,970
It'll all come out in the wash and you
kids are going to know that you're a

1190
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:03,440
fucking good guy, so. Well, Jeez.
Can we, can we, can we end on that?

1191
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,303
I don't know.

1192
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,353
Okay.

1193
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:08,770
I don't think so. Hang on a second, Nia.

1194
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,710
Okay. My fault. I thought
she could come on. Uh,

1195
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:18,450
she can't just get to do mommy duty.
I got to have it back on more, man.

1196
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,980
Miss Savin around here. Um,
anyways, that's the, uh,

1197
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:27,150
that's the podcast for this week.
Uh, how about those dolphins?

1198
01:09:27,151 --> 01:09:30,570
One and over top of the AFC east,
you know,

1199
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:35,010
patriots won and one in second
place. Um, it's still early.

1200
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:39,000
Kansas City looking fucking
tough. Uh, what else?

1201
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:41,370
Cowboys' defense is in shambles.

1202
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,390
Bread Ahrens to call me or text me
all fucking concerned about that.

1203
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:49,260
But it's still early. It's still fucking
early. We'll see what's going on.

1204
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:52,860
My beautiful daughter is
crying downstairs, so I'm
going to go handle that shit.

1205
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,520
And literally and figuratively,
God knows

1206
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:01,590
that's it.
About checkin on you on Thursday.

1207
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:05,730
A joy the Monday night football
game tonight. And uh, once again,

1208
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:08,070
congratulations to the Cleveland Indians,
22 in a row.

1209
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,330
I've obviously never saw that ever. That's
in fucking incredible. That's almost,

1210
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,990
I told someone is wanting a
month's worth of games. Yeah.

1211
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,240
Built this 30 days in a month
and they almost play everyday.
Yeah. Thank you, Bill.

1212
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,190
All right, go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you on Thursday.
