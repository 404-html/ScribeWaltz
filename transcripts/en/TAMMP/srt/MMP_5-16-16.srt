1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,850
Hey,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,420
Is Bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,680
May 16th, 2016 how's
it going? How are you?

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,440
How's your life? Are you liking your
life? Are you enjoying your life?

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,340
Do you hate your life? Would
you like to make a change? Well,

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:25,341
fortunately there's a solution with
my new seven part eight track tapes.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,160
I'll help you turn around your life by
making me a rich motherfucker first thing

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:36,720
you do. Um, anyways, I am
in a great fucking mode.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,650
It's actually a Sunday when I'm
recording this. When I'm recording this.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,670
It's Sunday. And, uh, I got the fucking

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,623
shoes.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,823
Yeah.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,640
Juices are flowing.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,430
Blood is flying through my system right
now. Heart grade, fucking wonderful.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,133
You know why?

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,670
Cause I worked out the last two fucking
days in a row and my brand new gerage

17
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,530
Raj,
fuck it,

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,553
Jay.

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,250
Hello. My New fucking
gym. It's finally done.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,390
I went back and I picked
up my, uh, my truck.

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,420
You know my old fucking Ford truck that
I had a in storage while they finished

22
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:21,390
it. They did a phenomenal
fucking job. I, I'll fit it.

23
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,540
The whole thing with a bunch
of rogue fitness shit. And um,

24
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,290
I never fucking show you my house.
I might have to make a video.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,190
I might have to show is a little
fucking chips, a little cute. Cim.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,270
I'll give you a before and after,
you know,

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,150
I might even wear my leg warmers for you.
I'll give you a quick two second tour.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,750
The God damn thing. I got my atomic
holds up top and a, I got to tell you,

29
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,170
all freckles,
old freckles lost a lot.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,870
A lot of what little he had. Holy
Shit. I went onto the pegboard.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,440
I felt like,
you know,

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,110
the 40 only first time you ever
tried to do a pull up in your life.

33
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:55,830
It's like this.

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,860
It was like you were born without those
muscles because you never use them.

35
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,520
You know what I mean? It's not like you
go, oh, what's on top of the fridge?

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,630
You know, what do you do? You
jump up and down, usually cash.

37
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:07,140
You don't grab the top of it
and fucking pull yourself up.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,490
You little stupid feet squeaking on the
front of the fucking weed as you try to

39
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,110
go up,
which is cheating by the way.

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,170
And if you ever made a video of
it and you put it on Youtube,

41
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:20,430
I'm sure there would be
hundreds of thousands of
comments saying that it was an

42
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:25,260
epic fail refrigerator. Uh, pull up.
It's cause people like when you fail,

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,720
you know why? Because they
don't like themselves. Um,

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,460
so it's done. And uh,
I'm so fucking psyched.

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,860
Of course there's a few little
doodads we've got to do.

46
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,620
Nia once an elliptical in there,
you know,

47
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,630
which is fucking hilarious to me because
she could give a rats fucking ass about

48
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,500
this gym. And still until it started
coming together and now she loves it,

49
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,660
you know? But what's great is it's the
garage and everybody knows that the woman,

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,930
the wife, the fucking, the
fucking lady over there,

51
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:59,710
everybody knows that they get the house,

52
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,030
but the guy gets the garage and see the
women think that they win because they

53
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,760
got the fucking house. Right.
You don't want the house.

54
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,540
The house is where all
the responsibility is.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,260
The house is where the bills come to the
houses where the fucking people knock

56
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,460
on the door and the cops come. They
go to the fucking house. Nobody,

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,620
nobody goes to the garage.
The garage is fucking,

58
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,000
it's, it's genius. You know, you
act like it's a shit hole, blah.

59
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:29,440
And we'd go up to the garage. They're
like, yeah, yeah. Get out of the house.

60
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,390
They don't give a fuck. You go
into the garage at that said, yeah,

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,010
she's getting no fucking
idea. You wait till I, I,

62
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:38,980
I get one of those little fucking
Kegger raters out there and be doing keg

63
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:40,510
stands as I do curls.
Right.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,770
Taking in calories as I burn them off at
the same time while getting shit faced.

65
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,420
It's this new exercise video that I'm
going to be putting out, you know,

66
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,040
I dunno what I would call it to get
what you need. Alliteration, right.

67
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,660
Drunk dips or some shit like that.
Right. Just to get people to buy it.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,950
Alcoholic aerobics as too wordy too
now to worry too. Two syllables.

69
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,060
I Dunno what I'll brainstorm on it.
You know,

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,200
all you gotta do is just have a fucking
headband on and people will buy the

71
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,480
video. If you promise them you're
going to help him out, right?

72
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,250
You have a fucking headband on,

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,950
they spray a little fake sweat
on you and then you know,

74
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,910
all you got to get as a couple of
hotties behind you just smiling and shit,

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,170
right? The very least
somebody can jerk off to it,

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,570
right? The next thing you know, they
start flying off the fucking shelves.

77
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,070
And then what do you do yet? You add
onto the garage, add on the garage.

78
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:39,700
I've told you guys forever
my dream fucking house,

79
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,480
my dream house. I don't even
know what the house looks like.

80
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:47,260
I just know what the garage looks like.
The garage,

81
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,010
don't you say as my dad loved to say
the garage Doe Isi would be a three car

82
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,240
garage, right? One for me,

83
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,020
one for her and the other for whatever.
My old fucking truck. All right.

84
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,350
And then upstairs they all,
there'd be an upstairs.

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,350
The upstairs would have a gym.

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,960
It have a drum room and a fucking
cigar bar slash fucking sports bar.

87
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,880
That's what it would
be. Okay. One door in,

88
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,900
one door out,

89
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,730
maybe a fucking little ladder to
go up onto the roof to buy you.

90
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,160
Right. And that's, I think
if every fucking guy had
that, there's no fucking way.

91
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,760
You couldn't be a happily married man
because he just could be in the house.

92
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,620
You got your kids running around.

93
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,230
Everybody's freaking the fuck
out and he and I need a break.

94
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,630
I want to be fucking single,
you know, without the whois.

95
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,660
I just want to fucking just sit a
drink without you fucking people in my,

96
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,800
what's left of my hair.
That's where the upstairs comes in.

97
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,450
And then you just go up there.

98
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,560
You have a great time while you
slowly kill yourself, you know?

99
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,850
And then with every cigar you smoke and
every drink you have and you know that

100
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,490
you're one close,
one step closer to death,

101
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,300
which is a great thing because
it's a release, you know?

102
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,150
I don't know. It started off happy. It
got a little dark there towards you.

103
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,930
You wouldn't know that. I'm a happily
married man, uh, by saying all that stuff,

104
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:22,880
but I also am by nature,
I am a fucking loner. And,

105
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,990
uh, you know, I, I just, you know,

106
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,630
I just need to get away from people
every once in a while and, um,

107
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,990
I'll do that would be the fucking shit.
You know,

108
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,030
I have a couple of cool fucking dogs.

109
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,120
Those dogs at fucking lay around
and like the howl, you know,

110
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,380
like a fucking bloodhound, right.
Just sit there watching the game,

111
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,530
getting hammered, you know, soundproof
walls. You can't hit your family.

112
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,680
He just sitting in there every
once in awhile. You look over your,

113
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,860
your fucking bloodhound.

114
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:55,700
A rottie roughly what the dog would
bark and join with you. Yeah, I'm, yeah.

115
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,850
You fucking get it. You
fucking get it. Right.

116
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,700
I hope you enjoyed that because
that fantasy though, man,
I, that's it right there.

117
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,450
You know, I don't know what it is.
Some people want the White House,

118
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,930
some people won a fucking Oscar.
And then some people just want,

119
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,620
we'd like to be able to get a Tan and have
a two story fucking garage. That's it.

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,060
You know? Um, I'm part of that third
group, part of the third group, everybody.

121
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,460
So anyways, um, I fucking
went down there, um,

122
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,550
used all that rogue fitness shit that
I bought and like I said, you know,

123
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,680
these guys are not paying
me or anything like that.

124
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,600
They actually sent me
those colorful weights.

125
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:39,650
Now I don't know what the fuck to do
with them cause I have more weight than I

126
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:44,180
need. So I got some standup
shows coming up in the La area.

127
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,540
If you're building a fucking gym,
you know,

128
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,520
and um, oh, how do I get,

129
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:55,850
how do I make this a fair contest?
I don't fucking know.

130
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,080
You build in a gym and you listen to
the podcast and you want some colorful

131
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,660
plates, some weights. Uh,

132
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,960
I got them cause I was going to
take it over to play it again.

133
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,960
Sam's have played against sports,
whatever the fuck they are,

134
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,270
but they just so God damn and Celtic,
you know what I mean?

135
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,780
If you think that baldheaded cont on the,
uh,

136
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:19,230
the pawn shop show how we just fucking,
you go in there and a man,

137
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,220
he got a bar of gold and the guy's like,
yeah,

138
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:25,190
you know how much you want
for this? You're like, well,

139
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:30,050
the market value is fucking whatever.
Fucking $1,200 an ounce.

140
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,070
Why don't you give me a, give me a
thousand and outs? And he's like,

141
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,830
so what you really want for it?
But I were on a fucking smash it over.

142
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:39,890
You've got fuck yourself.

143
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,890
Like what a fucking business people
coming in selling their old fucking hair

144
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,580
dryers. You know their ass out, right?

145
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,480
And you've got to fucking take as much
out of their crack as you can. I get it.

146
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,920
You know what? It's a business. I'm going
to hotter than that guy. God bless him.

147
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,690
God bless them. All right, so play it
again. Sports is the same fucking way.

148
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,340
You'll come in with something with the
price tag still on it and they'll go,

149
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,660
yeah, I'll give you like a dollar 50. You
know what I mean? It's just like, I mean,

150
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:04,340
they make Richard Rollins
look like a saint.

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,360
I mean,
these fucking guys bust you down so bad.

152
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,980
It's like whatever you're selling them.
It's like,

153
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,050
how about I give to you for free,

154
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,990
but I get to hit you over the head
with it first. How about that?

155
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,490
Don't give me any fucking money.
I'm about to just mush it. Right.

156
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:22,390
And you're fucking,
I'm not doing that.

157
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,910
So I would rather give it to
a podcast listener for free,

158
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:29,300
but I'm not shipping these fucking things.
Gets like, uh, I don't know what it is.

159
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:33,980
I think it's two 45
pound plates to 30 fives.

160
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
I don't know what it is. That fucking big
and they're heavy. That's all I know. Um,

161
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,460
whenever they're free free
weights. So anyways, um,

162
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,030
I went down there yesterday, I did fucking
chest and Tris. Today I did the, uh,

163
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,150
upper body stuff, all the, uh, bodyweight
shit. Neither wanted the speed bag,

164
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,550
which I thought was a little fucking
stupid. You know what I mean?

165
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,940
I always hated the speed bag unless
you really training for a fight,

166
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,990
you know what I mean? Do to do the,
then you go to your fucking cubicle.

167
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,600
It always seems so,

168
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,780
it just seemed fucking disrespectful
to people actually fight for a fucking

169
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:12,500
living.
Like the,

170
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,280
the level of respect that I have for
people that do that for a fucking living.

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,810
Just the, the, the fucking
courage it takes to do that. Um,

172
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,210
but of course now it's up there and
I'm down there. What did that get?

173
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,560
That pulled the dip abated, but what
it did, data dump, look at that,

174
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,770
that fuck data, that data that then
I'm doing, it popped back up, up, up.

175
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,310
So now of course, now I'm going to
get fucking obsessed with that shit.

176
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,540
I don't know where it's
going to do for me.

177
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm hoping it's going to bring my
freckles out, you know? Um, anyway,

178
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:45,050
speaking of fights, did anybody
watched UFC? You're upstream by day,

179
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,590
not of the red corner. Did anybody see
the UFC one 68, eight, eight, eight?

180
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,750
MMM.
Was basically,

181
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,540
I think the USA or the
world versus Brazil.

182
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,160
And I think Brazil once again
proved that they are raw. You know,

183
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,440
if you want to fucking get into a fight
slash B in the missionary position with

184
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:09,790
another person, if you think you're
coming out on top of it ain't happening.

185
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,270
They pretty much, they pretty much
dominated the fucking night. But a,

186
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,140
except for this one guy,

187
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,960
and I'm not going to know the
names and actually tweeted the guy,

188
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm still not gonna remember his name.
He has a very fucking,

189
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,690
a unique name and it was fucking,

190
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,230
he's fighting this guy and this guy is
making all these silly faces when he's

191
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,420
going and they're going
like the Brazilian dude,

192
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,170
I guess he was a champion or he is a
champion. That's right. He's a champion.

193
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,730
And then he fucking, uh, that
Jesus Christ that was having a few,

194
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:40,090
when I was watching this,
he fucking, he was fucking,

195
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,640
he was a champion and he was
supposed to fight. He got hurt.

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,490
So he wanted to make sure
he's 100% so he's coming down,

197
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,290
he's making all these
silly faces and shit.

198
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,720
And I just remember the announcers
go and like look, and I was like,

199
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:53,230
no biggest fighter. He's had it
for years and he's making faces.

200
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,050
The camera is not even nervous,
right. All of this shit.

201
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,600
And then he comes to fucking
white dude. He fucking, you
know, old Dudley do, right?

202
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,210
He's got a police officer's haircut.

203
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,270
You like this guy could have been a state
trooper and he's fucking comment down.

204
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:07,991
And I'm like,
all right,

205
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:11,740
well let's see what's going to go on
here at the white dude seems to be in a

206
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,820
little better shape.
The Brazilian guy,

207
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:16,750
surprisingly for a champion as
a little bit of a dad bought,

208
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,730
you know what I mean? And a whatever.
They start going at it and uh,

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,630
you know, white boys taking it a little
bit, he's given it bag, he's taking it,

210
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:26,464
whatever.

211
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,850
Then all of a sudden the Brazilian guy
starts just running at him and he fucking

212
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,670
each one and he get in any regroups.

213
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,730
He starts running man again and
this fucking guy, the white to what?

214
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,570
The fucking state trooper haircut and
he's backing up and as he's backing up,

215
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:43,540
it gives them just a little
fucking little right there,

216
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,090
Fred with the fucking a
right hook. Right? Well,

217
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:50,410
backing up and this fucking guy just,
he just shut off this guy's hard drive.

218
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:55,300
He just fucking pip. And the guy was just
write down like a controlled implosion,

219
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:55,521
you know,

220
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:59,260
when they take down a fucking building
and everybody for some reason can take

221
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:02,740
off work to go down and watch
it, you know, that's what
they wasted a sick day on.

222
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,390
Like, Hey, he's anyway, I can
breathe in that fucking, uh,

223
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,210
what do you call that shit, not asphalt.
Oh Christ, what the fuck do you call?

224
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,170
That shit is best dose, right?
They can breathe it in anyways.

225
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,910
He fucking just hit the guy. I keep just
caught him the right way. I mean, granted,

226
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,710
if he hit me with that,
I mean I would have been dead.

227
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,570
There'd be no podcast ever again, you
know? Um, but he just caught the guy,

228
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,940
I guess. Right. And the guy just
went right, like a ton of bricks.

229
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:32,710
He fucking went down and the fucking
white dude just lost it. You know,

230
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,770
he just fucking,
who runs over to his corner climbs,

231
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,160
I thought was going to get on the fence.
He went right up and over,

232
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,550
hugged his halting and just kept
screaming, I'm a fucking world champion.

233
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,550
It was awesome. Oh, sorry. Just blow
out years here. It was fucking awesome.

234
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,280
Do I get this too?
I think it's blue on my fucking ears.

235
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,750
It was just fun to see somebody
like dad excited. And uh,

236
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,030
then of course they said
that he was from Cleveland.

237
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:02,740
So I tweeted out Cleveland finally
want to champion championship and a,

238
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,680
that's why I think that's what I tweeted
out or something like that. But, um,

239
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,320
congratulations to that guy who I can put,

240
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,650
I don't not going to butcher
his fucking name. Um,

241
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,080
it was awesome to see
him win a championship.

242
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,470
It's great for the city of Cleveland.
Right.

243
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,910
And even though it wasn't a team sport,
you know, if you're in Cleveland,

244
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,700
you gotta be, you won't be thinking
this. Cause you guys, you know,

245
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,803
you've been beaten,

246
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,730
you've been beaten down by this sports
gods for so long that you guys really, uh,

247
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,230
you're afraid of having hope.

248
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,710
But I remember reading about Christopher
Columbus when he came over to the,

249
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:41,350
the the Americas, which he
thought was, I dunno, India.

250
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,850
I don't know what the fuck you
thought. Um, before he got to land,

251
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,390
there was a couple of branches before
he got the land and he started either,

252
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:50,224
you know,

253
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,870
being nice to people are chopping off
people's hands because they wouldn't give

254
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:58,700
them their gold fillings. Uh, depending
on what movie you believe, you know,

255
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,220
I always loved that new
studies find, it's like, what,

256
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:04,940
where the fuck was this information
was it was an on a cocktail napkin and

257
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:09,260
somebody finally looked at it. Huh?
Did you find one of those scrolls?

258
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,150
Was it written by somebody? Hey, by
the way, this is what really happened.

259
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,570
And somebody just kept it for years and
they just let the light go and go and go

260
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,920
and then fall. Maybe, maybe the
people that that survived what he did,

261
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,720
they had this shit written down. I Dunno,
I think I'm fucking way off track here.

262
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,820
Where the hell am I? Oh yes. So anyways,

263
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:32,060
he's either way before he
fucking got to land and he,

264
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:36,740
that was a halfway decent guy or an
absolute fucking war criminal depending on

265
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:41,030
what you believe. Either way. Don't
you get the day off? You know,

266
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,310
sometimes people got to die to
get a fucking day off. You know,

267
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,460
when you really think
about it. Um, anyways,

268
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,110
the fuck was I talking about? Yeah.
You see some fucking branches and shit.

269
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:54,470
So there you go.
But guy from Cleveland is a champion.

270
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,480
All right. It starts with once and now
you gotta be looking at the Cavaliers.

271
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,530
I don't think they've lost
yet. You know, it's funny.

272
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:04,970
Everybody in Cleveland right now is
going shot. All right, I'll shut up.

273
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,880
Just say it. Um, that's
another weird city.

274
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:14,390
Part of me wants Cleveland to win,

275
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,370
but there's just such a hilarious
misery to the Cleveland Sports Fan.

276
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,900
I almost want to see it keep going.

277
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,630
So I guess I'm going to be happy either
way. I was really surprised at, okay.

278
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:30,140
See, beat a beat. The Spurs. Um,

279
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,610
considering I never watched,
I just watched the Celtics,
but I was hoping that, um,

280
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,650
I was hoping that, uh, Tim Duncan was
going to get his sixth ring, you know,

281
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,980
just so I'd have yet another thing to
say to fucking Laker fans when they bring

282
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:47,000
up Koby Bryant. Well, another guy
during kobies time, he was six.

283
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,100
He was a team player.
That one,

284
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,200
he really got everybody involved.
Uh,

285
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,460
did need fucking 90 million free agents
to come in and help him out every

286
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:05,920
fucking year. All right. Sorry.
Anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Um,

287
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,340
what am I talking about here? So,
yeah, so congratulations. And um,

288
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,570
I was disappointed with the Cyborg fight,
you know what I mean?

289
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,530
I would sit in there going like, yeah,
I know. I want to see this shit fight.

290
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:21,890
I want to see the, you know,
and you know, I got to tell you,

291
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,170
the women's fights are
usually better than the men's.

292
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:27,120
I don't know why they go out, like
they go in and like fucking alley cats.

293
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,840
It's crazy. Um, I just don't
understand how they can just hire,

294
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:35,990
you can just kick somebody in with the
barefoot and it doesn't hurt you too.

295
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,640
You know,

296
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,960
they should fucking have just regular
people like me just go in and do MMA shit

297
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,990
to each other and just watch this both
crumble after the first strike punched

298
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:50,810
once with your hand. Ha Fuck. You know,
you put in under your, um, anyways,

299
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,340
but she fought some chick. She was
like eight, six, and one. So I'm like,

300
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,440
what the fuck?
She's going to destroy it.

301
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:02,000
This is going to be over in the first
round. And then Lo and behold, Jesus,

302
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,140
she fucking hits hard.

303
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,410
She fucking was just rain and punches.
And the other woman was, was, you know,

304
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,710
still pool's getting hurt was still way
better than I would have one jab and I

305
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,350
would've been on my back, but she was
fucking eating them for well for a minute.

306
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,310
And then she went down. And then there
was a moment when she was always moving,

307
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:23,180
but it looked like she was out and
the guy stopped the fight. Right.

308
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,410
Which he shut it. I think it was right
to stop the fight. So in the end,

309
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,930
when they have the official decision,

310
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,640
they cut to her right now and
everybody cheers, gs Brazilian.

311
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:38,510
It's a hometown crowd.
And when they cut to the other,

312
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:43,370
the woman who lost sheets like holding
back tears and she's just looking up,

313
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,360
this is why I love this fight. Or forever.
She was just looking up at the fucking,

314
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,260
the diamond vision thing, whatever
the big screen. And she waited, she,

315
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,970
she was on the scoreboard and the
second she was on the scoreboard,

316
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,800
she just goes,

317
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,170
I've never fucking tat tat

318
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,690
and the whole place Buddha.

319
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,490
Okay.

320
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,520
She was so fucking mad.
Um,

321
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,220
which is understandable.
I mean,

322
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:13,250
I can't imagine train in that
fucking long and that God damn hard.

323
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,900
And then it's just over in like three
minutes. Um, it must have been brutal,

324
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:21,470
but um, I dunno. She was
great. She was all hard.

325
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,150
So hopefully she'll come
back or what have I done?

326
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,710
I was really into that last one and I,
that Cleveland Guy was hilarious. He was,

327
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,710
he was talking to every, he was like,
you know, and I know everybody here,

328
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,120
you don't like me because we're in Brazil,
but you guys make the sport great.

329
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,310
He called them out on it.
You know,

330
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,250
you're not voting for
me cause I'm a fucking

331
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,170
cause I'm from Cleveland. He should
have been, but I'm from Cleveland.

332
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,010
I'm used to this. Um, anyways,

333
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,640
let's see here. I don't know if
I have any advertising here. Um,

334
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,850
hang on one second. In the meantime,
I'll tell you a quick story.

335
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,480
You guys are all well aware that
the, uh, the genius prince died.

336
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,110
Did you guys see that? Do you get
that and your papers just anyways,

337
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,090
out here in Beverly Hills, they're
having an auction on one of his guitars.

338
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,920
So yellow one that he did.

339
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,930
How many fucking times I got to type
in my fucking password. Come on.

340
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,570
Uh, maybe cause I can't fucking remember
it like that. Fucked it up again.

341
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,750
Third Time's a charm, huh? Hmm.

342
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,440
I have to hum what it is or I fuck it up.

343
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,640
You imagine being this dumb and
actually fucking having your own gym.

344
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,060
It's kind of dangerous,
isn't it? All right. So e

345
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,010
they're actioning off one of his guitars.
It was the one that he used with the,

346
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,840
the new power generation,
the cream album, I believe.

347
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,570
And somebody bought it a few years ago.
I can't believe it was even for sale,

348
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:52,590
but some guitar collector admittedly
doesn't play him. He just collect some,

349
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,480
he paid 30 grand for this fucking thing.
So he says,

350
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,680
I should read this word for fucking word.
This is so fucking priceless.

351
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,160
And he says like,
the reason why he's selling it is because,

352
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,210
you know, it's become, you know,
with the passing of prince,

353
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,900
it's become so valuable.
Um,

354
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,030
daddy's actually nervous to have it.
He's nervous to own the fucking thing,

355
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,170
right? Which fucking,
it's, it's like, dude,

356
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,060
why don't you just say, you know
what? The Guy fucking just died.

357
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,950
Everybody's paying attention. This is a
great time to sell this fucking guitar.

358
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm trying to make money
off of this guy's death. Um,

359
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,970
but can't you just say that? You
know, I hear it. Is Prince's guitar?

360
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,230
All right, I got to read what
this guy said. It's just so, well,

361
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,000
there's nothing wrong with it. You
want to make a buck just, you know,

362
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,130
the guy died and I'm trying to make
fucking money off of it. All right. Um,

363
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,090
but blah, yellow face goes.

364
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,970
I've been a prince fan since
I was a little kid and that
guitar always stuck out

365
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:08,720
to me because it was super cool and
stylish. Said the current owner,

366
00:22:08,721 --> 00:22:12,500
we paid about 30 grand for it. He said,
unfortunately, as morbid as it is,

367
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:15,050
when people pass,
their items become more valuable.

368
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,830
I think something is valuable as this
could be too risky to continue to have in

369
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:22,340
my possession.
He's worried about his safety.

370
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,470
Get the fuck out of him and you try to
make some money trying to make, give me,

371
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,200
you're trying to make some money.

372
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,520
Okay.

373
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,270
That's so fucking creepy.
It's a really cool looking guitar,

374
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,990
but I don't think I could own a guitar of,

375
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,630
of a dead person who was way better
at playing than I'll ever be.

376
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,940
Um, I feel like that should be in like
the rock and roll hall of fame so people

377
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:49,150
could just go in and look at it.
Stay in your house.

378
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:52,960
How fucking weird would that be?
Just having people over and people going.

379
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,240
Is that, is it? Yeah,
that's Prince's guitar.

380
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,500
I would immediately be whispering to
my wife going, this guy fucking killed.

381
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,770
Let's get outta here. Fuck.
Does he have his guitar?

382
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,400
It would immediately create me
up, but that's me. You know,

383
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,080
I'm paranoid son of a bitch. He wants
a fucking two story garage. So me,

384
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:14,370
do I not have any fucking reads this week?
I think I might of advertisers that,

385
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,340
I don't know if you guys have noticed,

386
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:19,300
but I have slowly but surely
pissed all of them off. Um,

387
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,800
no. Well, well maybe. Maybe I do have
some advertising. He just hasn't sent it.

388
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,290
Nope. I'm hitting the refresh button. I
don't fucking see it now. You know what,

389
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,530
why are they so sense it don't,
they understand that if I shit on it,

390
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:35,350
you guys actually listen to it and then
maybe you'll buy it as opposed to just

391
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:39,340
fast forwarding through all of it. That's
what I try to do. I mean, I'm just,

392
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:43,390
you know, I'm trying to help
them make money right now.

393
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,320
What the fuck are you going to
do? Well, speaking of, you know,

394
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,970
I played for about five,

395
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:51,330
six years and then I stopped over the
last couple of years when the downstairs

396
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:54,930
was being redone and then I recently
got back into it. But, you know,

397
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,810
this is the deal. I play drums,
I fuck around and guitar and um,

398
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,720
I've always wanted one of those
lemon burst fucking, uh, Les Pauls.

399
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,770
I'm trying to find one, a lefthanded
one. I just think it's fucking,

400
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,400
I dunno, but you know what kills
me whenever I get to get a guitar,

401
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,570
it was associate Les Paul.

402
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:16,160
I just start thinking of all
the fucking great music I've,

403
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,060
yeah,

404
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,030
I've heard coming out of that thing and
then when I pick it up, it's just like,

405
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,230
oh Jesus.

406
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,760
Am I the asshole that just bought a
fucking guitar he doesn't deserve.

407
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:30,960
I think I am.
All right,

408
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm going to pause here just
if so I could just fucking,

409
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,530
if I get advertising later, I
could just put it in here. Um, oh,

410
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:42,210
maybe not. So maybe if dealt, see,
let's see what happens. All right.

411
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:45,660
Pausing here for some advertising
that might be read later.

412
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,630
All right, I'm back. Did
I read anything? I Dunno.

413
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,520
I guess I'll find out
later. Anyway, so, um,

414
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,970
it's only for 27 here,
Pacific coast time and in 33 minutes,

415
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,630
the blues, San Jose Shacks, fucking, um,

416
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,070
game starts.
And um,

417
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,790
I can't tell you how fucking excited
I am about this and I already know how

418
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,820
they're probably going to sell this game.
That's a tale of two cities,

419
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,190
two cities that I've never
gotten over the hump there.

420
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,710
Fans of add more heartbreak then a fucking
blade blown up fucking spirit through

421
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:28,600
the chest.
But one thing's for sure for one city,

422
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:33,470
they'll be moving on to the
Stanley Cup final, not final.

423
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:38,170
So as I always say, the Stanley Cup
final. And for you, the other team,

424
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,990
more misery. Well, neither
one should be ashamed.

425
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,450
Lave both knocked off between the toile
humble to perennial giants in the west

426
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
with the La cakes and they'll
fucking Chicago Black Hawks, right?

427
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,010
They're going to do some shit like that.

428
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,150
Somebody is going to make it to
the Stanley Cup final. I hate that.

429
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:57,680
It's the final, I like the finals
and I hate when people go, Ooh,

430
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,020
there's only walleyball is all we want,

431
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,440
but there's seven games. So finals. Right.

432
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,230
I'd have no problem with that plural.
That's a great thing.

433
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:09,540
You know when people go like,
yeah,

434
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,860
all those countries over there
in Europe or around the world go,

435
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,740
why do you call it foot?
Yeah.

436
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,133
You know,

437
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,900
ours makes sense. It's football
and somebody goes, right?

438
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:21,120
If you want to be technical,
you should call it feet ball.

439
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,390
You use in both your feet. What do
you call it? Football. There you'd go.

440
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,560
You'd trouble right back and forth
between your feet so much called football,

441
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,500
Fidi Ball, footsie, which
called footsie. In other words,

442
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,920
why don't you go fuck
yourself. Um, anyways, uh,

443
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,250
I am really excited about this
and, um, what I would like to do,

444
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,150
don't you see is I would like to have,
uh,

445
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,840
what am I giant ice cubes with some
fucking booze in it cause I booze hard on

446
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,841
the weekends cause I fucking stare at a
God damn script all week before I come

447
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:54,180
home and booze heart, who's getting
to my drinking is out of control. Um,

448
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,760
I think this is why people have children
at some point in their life because if

449
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,500
you don't,
you just drink yourself to death.

450
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,360
I'll tell you it's fun. It's a lot funnier
than shit diapers. Um, anyways, I am,

451
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:10,650
uh, I'm nervous about
this one. I'm nervous.

452
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:13,180
I had a belief that the blues were
going to get by the Black Hawks.

453
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm not kidding. I'm
much surprise. And uh,

454
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,300
I had a belief that they could get by the,
uh,

455
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,380
the Dallas Stars and certainly
what the goaltending issues,

456
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:27,090
which I didn't even know they fucking
ad. Um, there's still went seven.

457
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,270
So I figured this when it makes sense
that you get to the next, each tie,

458
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,470
you get a little blood tested.

459
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:36,471
So I want to say whoever wins this is
going to fucking win the Stanley Cup in

460
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:41,250
the Stanley Cup, Stanley Cup final. Um,

461
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,700
but I was hanging out with Bart Nick
last night and he knows more about hockey

462
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:47,320
than I know about myself.
And he was saying that, uh,

463
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,640
he thinks Tampa Bay lightning know
even though their goaltender went down.

464
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,150
So we shall see. Um, I'm sticking
with the blues. Me. Well,

465
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,610
we low me, meet me at the fair,
I'm sticking with the blues,

466
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,410
that's my team. And um, cause my
real team, the Bruins didn't make it,

467
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:04,981
but I still love him.

468
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,830
I'm going to be there again in
October and if they play the blues,

469
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:11,610
I'm not going to give a fuck if they
beat him fucking whatever, 12 to nothing.

470
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:15,150
I won't give a shit. Um,
speaking of which, somebody
sent me something about, um,

471
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:15,901
you know,

472
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,950
people always love to make points on
all the dumb shit that I say on Twitter.

473
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,650
Like, I mean, how many times do I have
to admit that I'm a fucking moron?

474
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,030
You really don't need to correct me.
I realize that I'm an idiot,

475
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,000
but somebody goes dictate.

476
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,280
It's not a lot of scoring and soccer
and sends me like one day's worth of

477
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:36,870
fucking scores. It's just like, okay, well
if you average it out, I think I'm right.

478
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,020
You know, you know what's funny about
that fucking Leicester City Championship?

479
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,310
Do you now they found out that they
won a championship cause to other teams

480
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:51,600
played to like a one one tie.
There wasn't even a play off play off.

481
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:55,830
There wasn't even a fucking play
off. Like here we go, this is it.

482
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,130
We're down to the final two fucking teams.

483
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,200
We're going to play for 19
hours and hopefully at some
point somebody's going to

484
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:08,250
put the fucking ball and then in
the net and the goal, whatever,

485
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,630
and then it's going to be over.

486
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,710
Except it's going to be injury time that
nobody knows what it is except for the

487
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,820
fucking, uh, they'll refs and
everybody starts whistling.

488
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,790
I didn't even have that.

489
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,470
They watched these two other teams play
to with Tai and then everybody went

490
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:29,250
crazy.
That seems really anticlimactic to me.

491
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:31,470
I had to think he wants somebody
to fucking kick the ball.

492
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,160
It goes into the fucking somebody scores.
Right.

493
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,040
And then collectively as sports fans, you
all fucking bust your nut. No, Haha. I,

494
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,070
it goes in a bunch of people
walking around and scarves,

495
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:49,530
watching somebody with win, get a fucking
tie and then you're excited about that.

496
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:53,510
And I, I don't, I, I
don't get that. You know,

497
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:57,020
you would think that a country that
survived the fucking blitzkrieg like that

498
00:29:57,021 --> 00:30:00,020
level of excitement in your fucking life,
you think

499
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,950
you'd think use sports would,
would reflect it. Maybe he hadn't.

500
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,630
Maybe you have fucking grandparents
had enough fucking excitement for one

501
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:12,050
lifetime, annual lifetime too. So they
just started watching that. I don't know.

502
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:12,501
Well,

503
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:15,440
maybe I don't understand enough about
the game and I'm just a fucking moron.

504
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,850
Maybe that's what it is. And I don't
know. I have no idea what ever. Go,

505
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:23,200
go get some fucking fish and chips and
go fuck yourself. All right, let's,

506
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,990
let's read some, um, let's read
some, uh, some of this bullshit here,

507
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,020
but I got from this week, oh, by the way,

508
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:34,290
I had a great weekend down and before
I get to this, I got an hour to fill,

509
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:38,860
so don't worry about it. Um,
I had a great weekend and I,

510
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,930
I've just been in a real slump as
far as writing new bits just because,

511
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,040
uh, my life has ground to a
halt here. It's like, you know,

512
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm not going out.
I'm not doing anything.

513
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,010
It's like my wife went to the
Beyonce concert last night at, uh,

514
00:30:55,011 --> 00:31:00,011
at the rose bowl and I was
actually thinking I should
have gone because there's

515
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:03,380
no fucking way. I wouldn't have got a
bit out of that. I would have felt old.

516
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:05,390
It would've felt stupid.
I wouldn't know what the songs,

517
00:31:05,391 --> 00:31:07,880
when she come out fucking
whipping or weave around and shit.

518
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:12,230
That'd be something I could
talk about. Right. Um,

519
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,460
but instead I went down to
the comedy store and it did
a couple of shows and, um,

520
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,720
I actually went out,
let's have a comedians that are out there.

521
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:26,721
And I was just so fucking sick of doing
the same shit and trying to make it

522
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:30,750
work. I just, every once in a
while, if you just go out there,

523
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,370
yeah.

524
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,120
And, uh, you're just not thinking anything
and he just started fucking talking.

525
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,560
It works way better and it breathes
new life into all your jokes.

526
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:43,920
I just kind of went out there and,
um,

527
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,120
which is a very terrifying
thing to do when you,

528
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:50,640
if you've never done that in standup
because you really feel like you're, uh,

529
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,550
you know, do you remember in like
the Matrix when Keanu Reeves,

530
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:59,610
the trying to convince him to fucking
step off that building and he's not going

531
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:03,660
to fall to his death, all he has to do
is bully isn't it? Was At that movie,

532
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:05,530
it was a fucking Battlestar Galactica.

533
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,010
Moonraker I don't know what the
phone in those space movies, right.

534
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,080
It wasn't even space but Scifi.

535
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,610
Okay.

536
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,240
Um, he had to like, believe
it and if you believe it,

537
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,200
then you find if you, if you don't believe
it, you actually fall to your death.

538
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,890
This is sort of one of those things,
but of course you're not going to die.

539
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:23,820
You just going to,
you know,

540
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:28,821
metaphorically die on stage
is his basic stepping.

541
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:29,061
Oh,

542
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:34,061
off the building is basically just leaving
your act behind and just fucking just

543
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:35,971
talking.

544
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:40,410
So I just went out there
and I just started riffing
on fact that I made a smart

545
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:44,520
move by not going to be
on say, because, you know,

546
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,560
when I went to Lady Gaga with my wife,

547
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,383
mmm.

548
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,410
You know,
I fucking,

549
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,320
I mean she was mad at me for like three
fucking days after that one in defense

550
00:32:56,321 --> 00:33:01,160
of me, which there really, really is
no defense. I watched the Patriots,

551
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:04,760
we lost I think to the ravens
and the playoffs during the day.

552
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,850
So I was already drinking. I already had
that good six pack in me. And then, uh,

553
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,880
we took a car service to fucking lady
Gaga and we went on the thing and it was,

554
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,870
uh, it's, you know, I'm
all about seeing the band.

555
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,150
I want to see the drummer
and all that type of shit.

556
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:24,830
And she on this tour for whatever reason,
it's hard towards her choice, whatever.

557
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,810
She had them in.
Like this house,

558
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,170
there was a fucking house and
I couldn't see the drummer.

559
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,080
There was like a window. I could
kind of see his hands a little bit,

560
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:35,660
a little bit of his head. And that was
it. And it was just like, what the fuck?

561
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:40,370
I want to see the band. And um, I can't,

562
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:41,690
it was so long ago. I mean, what the fuck?

563
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,270
But I just started telling that story
and how I fucking pissed her off.

564
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:48,050
And then if I went to the Beyonce thing,
you know how I would, I would just,

565
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,180
you know,
you know,

566
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:52,880
when they sang like that independent
woman song and everything,

567
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,780
just a dirty looks,

568
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,360
I'd be given most of the women there and
no one that they were full of shit and

569
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,840
that they shouldn't be putting
their hands up in the air. You know,

570
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,680
it was just a smart move that I didn't go.

571
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:11,681
And my wife still has never gotten over
my behavior at the lady Gaga concert to

572
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:16,811
the point that I actually asked her to
come on the podcast to talk about the

573
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:19,460
Beyonce concert. And she just goes, no.

574
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,630
And I tried not to laugh.
I tried to hold it together and I go,

575
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:27,140
what do you mean though? She goes, we
think I'm a fucking idiot now. She goes,

576
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:30,350
I'm not going on the podcast and give you,
giving you a,

577
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:34,000
an opportunity to start trashing beyond
sake. I'm not going to trash Beyonce.

578
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,193
Okay.

579
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,890
I have to admit,
she started showing me

580
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,620
video clips of the concert and she
had it like the way she was holding,

581
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,590
she was, we were on the couch
and she snuggled up next to me.

582
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,620
So she's holding the kind of low
to my, you know, near my stomach.

583
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,600
And like three times I started
laughing, looking at the, uh,

584
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,823
yeah,

585
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,850
looking at the clips. Um, and look, dude,

586
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,560
I know she's way more talented than
I could ever be out and I don't even

587
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,700
remotely put it on a Shiller care,

588
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:14,701
but it's just something funny to me
about when everybody dances in unison and

589
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:17,440
they have that, you know,
that angry look on their face.

590
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:21,160
It's just the funniest assist. Like
what is your, what is the problem

591
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,170
coming up? And they got
their arms out, you know,

592
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,590
and they're doing that little fucking
thing with their head and their feet are

593
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:32,350
running. Uh, it's just, I can't,

594
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,950
I can't even dance like the
fucking nerve of me to laugh at it.

595
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:40,210
But it always strikes is just, it's,

596
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,260
it's absolutely ridiculous.
Something, it's,

597
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,930
I understand why it's awesome
and people appreciate it,

598
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,940
but it's also really fucking funny to me.
I should say.

599
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,970
I don't know why. Maybe I get
one, I'm just a cut. Don't
listen to me, so whatever.

600
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:58,590
So I made a great fucking move
by not going to that concert.

601
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,760
Made a very smart,

602
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:05,130
married a couple of years getting a
wise in my old, I just was just like,

603
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:08,070
you know what? I can, that's,
that's the best. When you start,

604
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,940
you start to know somebody and yourself
well enough to be like, you know what?

605
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,570
I see the fight coming. You
know what I mean? It's actually,

606
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:17,730
it's like slipping punches,
which I, there's something else,

607
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,320
another reason why I
suck at fighting escape.

608
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,180
You could literally tell me on Thursday,

609
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:26,181
I'm throwing this punch at this time and
you would still not only catch me with

610
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,670
it, you like the feel whole
hand or foot or whatever.

611
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:36,120
I just can't do it. I, I, you
know, whatever, I stink at it. So,

612
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,840
um, I saw this fight
coming and I was just like,

613
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,040
I was like, all right, no.
And I gave my, you know,

614
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,120
my ticket away and she took
one of her girlfriends.

615
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,660
So I look good with the friends
and all of that fucking shit.

616
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,720
And I avoided a major fucking fight and
I just went on stage cause I was like,

617
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:57,720
I'm sick of my jokes. That was the point
of this shit. I'm sick of my jokes.

618
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,580
So whenever I get into this, these, um,

619
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,670
whatever you call it, writer's block,
even though I don't write whatever,

620
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:10,270
just riffing block,
I guess cause I just sort of wing my shit.

621
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,803
Um,

622
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,180
yeah.

623
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,270
I just say to myself, what am I
thinking right now? What am I feeling?

624
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:17,861
And I was feeling,

625
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,860
thank God I didn't go to Beyonce because
me and my wife would get into a big

626
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:25,060
fight. So, and you know, it's funny,
I didn't even make that decision.

627
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:28,140
I kind of as I was don my
rare brought me up. Yeah.

628
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,680
Yeah.

629
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,020
He gives the best fucking intros. He
said, this fucking enjoy goes, you know,

630
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:37,120
it's next guy coming to the stage.
Uh, you know, he never made me laugh.

631
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,240
You know, immediately people
would just die. They just fucking,

632
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:43,400
he just does that stuff. But, you
know, people seem to enjoy him. Um,

633
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,680
I dunno. I've written a lot of
his stuff and just, you know,

634
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:49,390
just making me look
like a complete asshole.

635
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:53,380
So I went out there and it wasn't
until after I shook his hand that I was

636
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:56,770
actually thinking of the first bit I was
going to do and I was just like, Oh God,

637
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:59,380
I can't, I can't, it's physically going
to feel like shit coming out of her mouth.

638
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:02,770
I can't even say it.
And then I just,

639
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,430
over the years of just knowing that trick,
I was just like,

640
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:08,290
what am I feeling right now?
It's just I'm feeling,

641
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:11,410
I'm glad I fucking did go
to Beyonce because I get new
a three day fight with my

642
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:16,411
wife and I just started
talking about that and it just,

643
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:17,434
it worked.

644
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,890
And then I had this other
chunk of material and I did
the last joke without even

645
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:26,610
setting it up from the other shit.
And it's still worth it.

646
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:31,450
We just worked in a different
way. And um, it was,

647
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,180
it was great. It may be fucking love
standup again cause I was really,

648
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,630
no guy would ever hate standup but just
this whole fucking writing every day.

649
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,453
All right.

650
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,230
All right.
Now see the magic of technology is now

651
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,590
10 oh one Pacific coast time.

652
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:53,940
And I'm watching the third
period of a Saint Louis,

653
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:58,080
San Jose. Um, I take the fucking game.

654
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:01,060
Could write a check to go to a,
what's the first two periods?

655
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,100
One St Louis so far. All right. Let's see.

656
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:08,640
Have you spoken as fucking get on with
the fucking or the sports here. All right.

657
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,410
Uh, you need to know how to cook
when she got a broad your license.

658
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:17,130
She's old school.
She know what I mean.

659
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,520
Not only do you feel like you
know your way around the kitchen,

660
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:21,480
but cooking at home,

661
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,370
eating healthier and saving money instead
of ordering expensive takeout all over

662
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:31,140
again. But where do you start?
Blue Apron as you covered?

663
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:35,220
Fuck for the last 10 or
less than $10 per meal.

664
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,210
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh
ingredients and you need to create a home

665
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:42,300
cooked meal. Just follow the
easy step by step instruction.

666
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,820
He's me of actually look really good.
Uh,

667
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,160
this was around when I
was a single seller. Uh,

668
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,920
each meal can be prepared
in 40 minutes or less.

669
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,910
No overwhelming trips to the
grocery store, no more sad takeout.

670
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,470
And that a how? Dietary preferences,
no matter your dietary preferences,

671
00:39:58,471 --> 00:39:59,320
Blue Apron,
Nix it,

672
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,350
a bleed and prepared dishes like salmon
with asparagus and new potato Hash and

673
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,050
me Aov right in your own kitchen.

674
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,160
I don't even know what happened.
That is, what's up. Fuck is they only

675
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,310
cook with the ingredients that you've
never used before. Like watermelon,

676
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:25,860
radishes, Pharaoh, Pharaoh,

677
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,310
modal and purple potatoes and recipes
are between 500 to 700 calories per

678
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:35,460
portion.
Delicious and good for you right now.

679
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,260
You could get your first
two meal for free. Yes,

680
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:41,160
we wait for dotcom slash
for that blue apron,

681
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,850
blue apron.com/ [inaudible] a
better way to cook. Oh, here we go.

682
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:52,851
Me On de Leon d no more sweaty balls
to do me on the and be drinking them.

683
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,990
Maker's mark towards down the fund off
my fucking underwear dries up real quick

684
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:03,000
and I don't care my ball good bronc in.

685
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,890
So am I by the fucking 10
your queen is all right here.

686
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,530
Whether you're wearing a suit or

687
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,080
whether you're wearing a suit or

688
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,470
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your
underwear unless you Matthew mcconaughey

689
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,540
and then you're wearing that.

690
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:25,710
She is running down the beach carrying
a couple of hard whenever the fuck it is

691
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:29,010
he does on TV.
That's a magazine anyway.

692
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,280
But instead of making a
statement like trouper, man,

693
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,370
everyday clothes,
your underwear is probably boring.

694
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,620
The undies is here to change that.

695
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,880
Well you don't see what it has on the
is pretty boring as it is. Just read.

696
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,510
You saw, you know this fucking name on
it. That's when it gets interesting. Um,

697
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,660
please include all the volume. Why
would not eroded? I'm going to read it.

698
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,670
Modal is pronounced modal.

699
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Every pair of me undies is made from
sustainable mode out fabric twice as soft

700
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:06,590
as cotton, allegedly nothing can describe
the fit and the feel of me undies.

701

He got to feel it up against you,

if you make a statement
with your underwear where
there anyone can see them or

707
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:31,250
not. Remember Superman. Um, uh,

here for this week.

741
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,540
Oh,
um,

742
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,870
speaking of which, how great his song,
his top Jimmy. I fucking love that song.

743
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,350
All right, so I Annika. Hey
Bill, love your podcast.

744
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,180
I want him to tell you about my
sister's cure for s a Sayada ACOG lie,

745
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:13,970
but don't worst. Okay. Cloud. Um,

746
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,260
the providence center chat
and I one night only shy

747
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,660
my ass fucking
um,

748
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,310
she suffered from Sciatica for years.
For years.

749
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,940
Her doctor recommended
she see a podiatrist.

750
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:36,350
That's a foot doctor for all you civilians
out there who filmed her from behind

751
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,630
fucking creep as she walked
on a treadmill. Yeah.

752
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,670
What are these yoga pants,
by the way?

753
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:48,020
I don't understand why guys are
fucking so obsessed with yoga pants.

754
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,040
I've never been yoga pants.
I like just, you know what?

755
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,720
I took too many yoga classes.

756
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:56,900
I just know what the room smells like and
I just feel like that's what you clamp

757
00:45:56,901 --> 00:46:00,900
smells like when you wear those. And
I know that's immature. I'm sorry. Um,

758
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,180
he immediately saw her right foot
was rolling out. Is she walked,

759
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,230
he said this was causing
her problems with Sciatica,

760
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,130
and he made custom orthotics shoes,

761
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:15,560
inserts that she wears most of the time.

762
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:20,561
She said this worked immediately to
completely eliminate her pain from Sadeka.

763
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,640
Ooh. She said, after you
start wearing the orthotics,

764
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:30,350
you should visit a chiropractor to get
everything back in alignment and you're

765
00:46:30,351 --> 00:46:35,300
good to go. Give it a try and go fuck
yourself. Thank you so much for that. Um,

766
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,560
I don't think I have that issue,

767
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:40,010
but I got the name of a good chiropractor
and you know what, God dammit,

768
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,570
when I'm uploading this podcast,

769
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,910
I'm actually going to go see
a doctor because somebody
sent me this thing on, um,

770
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,030
on Twitter. Go Bill, go see a doctor.

771
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,580
Jesus did we learn nothing from so and so.

772
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,140
And it was somebody who
was on Letterman who was,

773
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:57,890
she had a shortness of breath
and he kept blowing it off.

774
00:46:57,891 --> 00:47:00,140
He kept talking to people who
weren't doctors and they're like,

775
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:01,430
I'm sure you're fine.
I'm sure you find.

776
00:47:01,431 --> 00:47:02,990
Then he found out it
was fucking lung cancer.

777
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,180
Obviously that's not what I'm
looking at here. Um, all right.

778
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,470
Uh, so I will definitely go. Oh, thank
you for that. All right. Number two,

779
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,810
uh,
Duke

780
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:21,350
where we'll Katelyn take his shit
this week. Um, number two. Hi Bill.

781
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:26,351
I was a wall and floor Tyler for 27 years
and my go to for any lower back pain

782
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:31,780
was a gel ice pack in
lying on a hard floor.

783
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:37,140
The Gel pack molds to the area that is
sore and the hard floor keeps you spine

784
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:40,540
flat. Lie on your back. Wait,

785
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,930
lie on your back on the
floor with your knees bent.

786
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,900
Put the ice. No, what does that mean?

787
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:51,870
They bend and then lift them up or
just to have the feet on the floor. Um,

788
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:57,310
can you put your foot down on the
two? Get jump up on the one. Sorry.

789
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:02,540
Thinking about prince now. All right. Um,
then we'll the ice pack and then try it.

790
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:05,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I missed the
whole fucking thing. It lie on your back,

791
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,683
right?

792
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,040
You know what it is? He wrote a bunch
of words that are all like the same.

793
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:13,610
I have some sort of fucking dyslexia
because he has lie like a bunch of times

794
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:16,820
and feet lie on your back on
the floor with your knees bent.

795
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:20,360
Put the ice pack at the spot, giving
you trouble. Leave it there. Oh,

796
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:23,930
I know why he didn't have any punctuation.
Leave it there for 15 minutes.

797
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:28,760
You can watch TV doing this then moves
the ice pack and then try to feel like

798
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,970
you are pressing your
spine into the floor.

799
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,660
Continue with the treatment once or
twice a day until you feel better.

800
00:48:35,661 --> 00:48:36,770
I hope this works for you.

801
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:41,180
I loved F is for family and reminded me
of my childhood and I'm a 57 year old

802
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:44,870
Australian male. Love the specials and
the podcast. Hope you get better soon.

803
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:47,750
Well that's good to know.
So you're 10 years older than me.

804
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:51,110
Well that should work because we kind of
age bill a little bit older than I than

805
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:56,111
I was in 1973 or 74 he's about 11 years
old and which would mean he would have

806
00:48:56,361 --> 00:49:01,270
been, would have been born in 62
so that's right in your wheelhouse,

807
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,020
right? You probably be
born and like what, 58 59.

808
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,210
Yeah. Built. That's how the math
works out. All right, cool. Um, okay.

809
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:14,330
Australia mailable for thank you so
much for watching and please tell more

810
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:17,020
people down there in Australia
if you can to check it out. Um,

811
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,300
I actually heard a lot of times people
say to put heat on your back ice I guess

812
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:24,050
is better. Uh, cause it, if
you have any sort of, uh,

813
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,570
inflammation in the nerve or
something like that. I Dunno.

814
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:29,270
I've been using a leaf
and doing these stretches,

815
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:32,840
I feel much better and I haven't
been sitting down at all.

816
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:37,190
I've actually been squatting like
a Vietnamese gambler and, um,

817
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,930
I don't know. I, uh, that's been
working for me in these stretches.

818
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:45,980
I still haven't quite gotten it
better, but I'm going to walk,

819
00:49:45,981 --> 00:49:50,300
go to a chiropractor and get adjusted
out Jesus. And you know what? I that,

820
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:54,740
and I also need glasses finally
giving into that because my, um,

821
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,410
every two years when you're at my advanced
age, you got to go get a physical,

822
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:03,920
physical.
I want to get physical.

823
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,250
Um, I got my pilot's license.
So you got to every, you know,

824
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:14,030
if you're a younger fella, every floor
lady lady, every five years you, you,

825
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,840
you got to renew your medical, um,
you gotta get it updated. So with me,

826
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:22,610
it's every two fucking years and I
barely made it through and I'm literally

827
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:27,530
like, what the fuck am I doing here? I
don't want to wear glasses, just don't,

828
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:29,720
I just don't want to have another
fucking thing that I have to deal with.

829
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:34,580
And I also have this paranoia that all
glasses do is make you fucking eyes

830
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:39,500
worse. Kind of like a chap stick. It
just dries out your lips even more.

831
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,990
That's like the big urban myth.
And then you get addicted to it,

832
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:46,340
then he got to use it. You know,
whenever I have dry ass lips,

833
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:50,120
I just use a little Vaseline works like
a fucking charm and then I just started

834
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:51,650
pounding waters and then you're fine.

835
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,150
You fucking fine that fucking
chapstick and all that shit.

836
00:50:56,151 --> 00:51:00,080
I don't like it and don't like it
makes me have weird dreams, you know,

837
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,200
get that chemical in there and seeps right
in the fucking face and it goes right

838
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:04,490
to your brain.
And next thing you know,

839
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,290
you're just running around
with an ax and your drinks.

840
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,980
You have to have a dream like that.
So raise a year screaming, answer me.

841
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:19,160
Uh,
I'm just making this shit up.

842
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:21,470
People out. I don't know what the
fuck you want from me. Usually the,

843
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,320
the advertising takes up a
little bit of time and I,

844
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:29,330
and I don't have any full 48 another
12 minutes and then the game stats.

845
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,270
Oh, and I got another 15 minutes here.
Fuck. Well thank you. Thank God for Tivo.

846
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:40,040
Right? All right. Grass
killin name. Alright,

847
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,810
a fantasy revenge advice.
Hello billion.

848
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,490
I'm a 23 year old male.

849
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,840
I live with my parents in the
country that even Australia makes.

850
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,760
Oh Wow. They, even Australia makes fun
of two from a Australians here. Oh,

851
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:57,410
New Zealand.
Oh Jesus.

852
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,040
I live with my parents in a country that
even Australia make fun of New Zealand.

853
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,950
I thought he meant a part of a country.
I can't read people.

854
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,160
I love emphasis for family and can't
wait for season two. Thank you so much.

855
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:09,890
Please tell more people in New Zealand
about it if you haven't already.

856
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:10,760
If he got the time.

857
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,830
I'm not trying to put you out if
you don't want to be that Douche,

858
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,330
don't be the Douche, but if
you do, I'd, I'd appreciate
it. All right, so here we go.

859
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,200
Fantasy, revenge advice. Sometime ago,

860
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,300
my father was using a lawn trimmer
on the right side of the front yard,

861
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:30,500
which is only a few feet
from our neighbor's driveway
while trimming the edges

862
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:34,820
of small rock in the grass shutout and
hit our neighbors parked car in the

863
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,654
driveway.

864
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,260
Our neighbor was already at the front
of his house and either saw or heard the

865
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:43,870
bang and started yelling at my
dad who was apologetic. The Rock,

866
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,980
the rock put a small dent in the car,

867
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,750
which was hard to see even close up
when I, when I was told what happened,

868
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:54,230
my dad by my dad,
I was a little pissed that he yelled,

869
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:57,800
but I knew he had a right to be upset.
And although it was an accident,

870
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:03,010
my dad would happily pay for the
damages because he knew he was at fault.

871
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,730
Um, our neighbor didn't talk to
us again about a bill or anything,

872
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:11,360
so we've quickly forgot about it
and moved on. A few weeks later,

873
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,350
I was at the front of our house and I
saw that the right side of our lawn was

874
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:18,320
completely dead of foot inwards.

875
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,820
I realized this fucking cunt had
poisoned the area of the grass that would

876
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:27,560
usually be cut using the trimmer.
Wow.

877
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,320
This guy's got major communication issues.

878
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,220
So this incident would never
happen again to state my,

879
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:38,150
despite my dad telling him that he would
only mold alon when the driveway was

880
00:53:38,151 --> 00:53:40,190
empty in the future.
Um,

881
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:44,900
I asked my dad if he knew anything and
he told me he had known for a few days

882
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:46,580
but didn't want to make
a big deal about it.

883
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,420
My Dad is a very easy going guy who
doesn't get bothered much myself on the

884
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:53,040
other hand, spent the night, uh,

885
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,270
the next few nights
fantasizing about revenge. Oh,

886
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,790
it looks like you take after your
Ma. All right. Get Dad's easy going.

887
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:06,050
He married a fucking hot blooded woman
and she's, you know, she calmed her down,

888
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,710
right? And then you, you, you, you got
her fucking DNA. All right. I like,

889
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:12,980
I like where this is going so far,
even though I'm not a big revenge guy.

890
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,630
You Dad's easygoing. It's
his house already. My Gut
saying your dad's easy going.

891
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:20,700
It's his fucking house, you know? Um,

892
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,140
yeah,

893
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,480
don't do anything to disrupt it.
And you said it.

894
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:26,790
I thought about doing the
exact same thing to his lawn,

895
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,680
but spelling out the word coward.
Oh my God. That's fucking hilarious.

896
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,150
I thought about pulling out all of his
plants and dumping it on his car to send

897
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:36,984
a message.

898
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,230
It's been a few months and I still
get pissed off when I think about it,

899
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,100
but I decided not to stoop to his level
and pull off a bitch move like that.

900
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,170
The only option would be to confront him,

901
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:50,040
but there is no scenario in which
that would end. Well, why not?

902
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:56,170
Um, why not? Why can't you just next
time you see him just say like, dude,

903
00:54:56,171 --> 00:55:00,220
I got to tell you something. I haven't
been on this planet for a long time,

904
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:03,220
so maybe I need to see
more bitchy behavior,

905
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:06,340
but that's the biggest pussy bitch
fucking way. I don't do that.

906
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:09,580
It's going to cook. I don't
know. I would just say, hey,

907
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:13,630
you have any idea why this part of
the lawn died? Isn't that amazing?

908
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,030
And I would do that to
them every fucking time.

909
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,670
Just do something to drive
him nuts. Anyways, he goes,

910
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:20,650
I've decided to do nothing and moving on,

911
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,470
but it's been about a year and
I'm still thinking about it.

912
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,860
What would you have done?
Am I justified to be pissed?

913
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:31,240
This pissed and how the fuck do I stop
myself from letting it get me in such a

914
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:35,620
bad mood every time I walked past our
front lawn and see the dead strip of

915
00:55:35,621 --> 00:55:39,190
launch. Thanks for listening,
Bill. Come back to New Zealand. Um,

916
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,250
your lawn is still dead.
Look,

917
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:44,740
I'm not big on revenge,

918
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:48,490
but the great thing that you have
right now is you've waited a year.

919
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,440
Um Hm.

920
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,150
So if you were to do anything,

921
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:56,700
obviously don't bring any
physical harm to the person. Um,

922
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,520
he does seem to love that car.

923
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,140
It's just why would you do it?

924
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,193
MMM.

925
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,140
Why don't you guys read,
just replant the fucking grass.

926
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,700
That's what I would do. I would
replant the grass. This is what you do.

927
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,280
Replant the grass
and get all excited.

928
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:20,820
And then without him knowing what you
do is you set up a fucking video camera.

929
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,770
All right? And he just videotape and
you, you try to catch them doing it.

930
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,870
That's the best way to do it.
Right?

931
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,290
And then he has to fucking pay for it
and then pay for the previous thing.

932
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,230
The previous time he poisoned
it. Like, that's what I would do.

933
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,840
You know what I mean?
There's obvious things that you could do.

934
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:40,740
You could go to a fucking auto zone and
buy one of those little catch trays that

935
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:45,390
captures oil, you know? And then when
the night you could undo his fucking

936
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:51,030
let all the oil out of his car on screwed
the thing on the oil pan and you screw

937
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:54,270
it back up and then he seizes the edge
on his car. You can go that route,

938
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:59,660
you know, there's no oil
in the fucking car. Um,

939
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,120
the key is what you have to do is

940
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,403
okay,

941
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,690
he would still figure it out.
So you can,

942
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:11,990
you can't do this is all bitchy
fucking moves. You know what I mean?

943
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,670
You got to have a face to face thing.

944
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,860
Or what I would do is I
would just repaint three,

945
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,970
plant the grass and I would
set up a fucking video camera

946
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,160
and maybe just say that. Just
say, hey, just so you know,

947
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,230
if you plan on poison Eric Grass,

948
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,190
cause I know you're not a man and you
would never say anything to my dad's on my

949
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:33,930
self's face. You know, just so
you know, I got this security,

950
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,930
you're going to be on video and we're
going to catch you doing it. Okay?

951
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,970
All right? It costs us a lot of money
and I, I, oh my God, what a, uh,

952
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,350
in a perfect world, could you just
go over and just fucking take,

953
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:51,210
just answers the door and you go hi.
And he is Buddha right in the nuts. Huh?

954
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,270
You would think they need just take a
strip of the dead grass and you just start

955
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:57,330
fucking beating his back with it.
That's what the fuck you wanted. Do I?

956
00:57:57,331 --> 00:57:59,490
You know what? I actually want to do
that right now. But you know what?

957
00:57:59,491 --> 00:58:03,510
You can't do it. You know what?
Fuck him. He did it to you.

958
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,100
He did it to you.

959
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,820
Oh Dude. You know
something? I think you're,

960
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,370
I think what you came
up with this the best.

961
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,410
Why don't you just write coward?
No.

962
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,930
Cause then he's going to do
something else to your dad's house.

963
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:31,430
Oh, this guy's a cunt. You know what?

964
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,160
He doesn't have the balls to confront
your dad. So when I think you'd do yet,

965
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:36,890
do the little cow thing and then set
up video cameras and catch them doing

966
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:39,020
something else, but then you've done
something to him. See, it's just,

967
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:41,840
it's just awful. It's just as
bitchy tit for fucking tat thing.

968
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,260
I don't know what you have to do,
but I feel like something has to be said.

969
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,123
At least

970
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,940
I know what you do.
This is what you do.

971
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:56,990
You go down to a fucking lady shoe store,
all right?

972
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,750
And you buy a cheap pair
of fucking women's shoes

973
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:06,060
and next time you see you wrap it up
like a present and you just give it tool

974
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,480
and there's a card in there and
everything. And then you just,

975
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,070
this is what you do.
You do that.

976
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,750
You just humiliate the guy and he just
open it up and just say, hey sweetheart,

977
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,420
just want to get you,
you,

978
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,460
you just write from your heart
about what a fucking bitchy is.

979
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:27,220
It just is what you do. Don't ever,
don't curse in it at all. Right?

980
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:32,110
It really nice and
lovely. Um, but in that,

981
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,130
without ever cursing,

982
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:36,910
just let them know what an absolute
fucking pussy he has for doing that bay.

983
00:59:36,911 --> 00:59:39,550
You Go, oh, that's, I, I think that,
you know what? I think that's a winner.

984
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,300
You know what? I might have to, I might
have to outsource this to my listeners.

985
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:46,390
If you guys have better ideas of
what to do there. Nobody gets hurt.

986
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:50,260
You made your point. It's fucking
hilarious. And that's a funny, you know,

987
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,560
you tell people that this guy did it and
they go, so what'd you do? He tell him,

988
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:57,640
I went out, I went to a lady's Tish, she
was doing, I bought him a pair of pumps.

989
00:59:59,150 --> 00:59:59,520
Okay.

990
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,260
And then you get to laugh and every time
you see him just wave and just start

991
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:06,270
calling them sweetheart Kim,
a pet name.

992
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,580
Maybe you give him a woman's name like
Diane or something. Just, hey, Diane,

993
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:14,280
how'd you like the shoes?
And just every fucking day,

994
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,710
you can just do that forever.

995
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:19,663
I Dunno.

996
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,930
It made me feel better about the
situation. Maybe you can do that.

997
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:25,810
Who the fuck knows? Anyways,
good luck with that. Uh,

998
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,340
but don't do any physical harm or
real property. That's the brilliance.

999
01:00:30,341 --> 01:00:34,280
I must said genius. Pat Myself on the
back there. Sorry about that. Um, that's,

1000
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,130
that's what I like about the last
plant is that you're not hurting him.

1001
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,360
You write it eloquently. You're not
cursing. There's nothing he can really do.

1002
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:48,610
You just bought him a gift that you'd
give. You'd give a woman, it's perfect.

1003
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,523
You know,

1004
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:55,470
I'd send them to the candy on Valentine's
Day. Just, Ah, just torture the guy.

1005
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,900
But you just keep giving them gifts,

1006
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,393
you know,

1007
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,770
I don't know what else, what's
some, get them some flats.

1008
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:06,730
Okay.

1009
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:10,780
I Dunno. Just a bunch of shit like
that. I don't know who the fuck knows.

1010
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,600
Maybe you just do it
once and then that's it.

1011
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:17,980
And then what you do and then right
after that you replant the grass and then

1012
01:01:17,981 --> 01:01:19,480
you just let them know that you know,

1013
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:22,600
that he did it and he's going to be too
much of a bitch to try to do it again.

1014
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,860
And then he can tell you dad years later
that that's don't tell your dad that

1015
01:01:26,861 --> 01:01:27,940
you did it.
And then years later,

1016
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:31,030
you're telling me you did it when you're
having a pint and you guys can fucking

1017
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:36,010
laugh your balls off. All right.
Work argument. Um, hey bill,

1018
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:39,070
I work with some real morons.
I'm in sales,

1019
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:43,630
so everyone is a hotheaded tool. Really.
I thought you guys were like funny.

1020
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:46,360
It always seemed like the salesmen were
always breaking balls and being funny.

1021
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:50,620
Um, they all think they're living
in a sales movie. Oh, okay.

1022
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:52,830
Too many Glengarry Glen
Ross. All right. Uh,

1023
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,430
we have set accounts and nothing about
our job requires us to generate new

1024
01:01:57,431 --> 01:02:01,150
business from cold leads,
but that doesn't stop these tools.

1025
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,110
So the other day they're bitching about
Saturday night live and how it's not

1026
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:07,690
funny anymore.
That's not really a big deal.

1027
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:11,500
People always bitch about SNL even
when it's good. That didn't bother me,

1028
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,480
but then they all started saying
how they'd be funnier on the shell.

1029
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:22,190
No, Jesus. Here we go. This is like maybe
watch. No, I guess it's not like that.

1030
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:25,600
All right, let's continue. I'll just say
it's like me watching UFC being like, oh,

1031
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,710
you know what I wanted done.
Um,

1032
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:31,250
so this is when I chimed in and told
them that it's harder than it looks and

1033
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:35,210
that they did not. They did
not. They did have a shot. What?

1034
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,210
And that they did have
a shot. Oh, the, oh,

1035
01:02:40,211 --> 01:02:44,230
that if she left out a word there said
it's harder than it looks. And if they,

1036
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,100
if they did have a shot at having no
stage presence or Rick or experience,

1037
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:49,510
they would end up freezing up,

1038
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:53,530
then they'd be the guy who froze
up whose face was everywhere.

1039
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:57,220
I made the point to them that if
they were offered a spot on SNL,

1040
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,110
they'd be better to turn it down.

1041
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:02,890
They'd have a happier life if
they said no to SNL. Jesus,

1042
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,850
do you agree with this? And if you are
offered SNL, would you take it? Um,

1043
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:09,800
okay.

1044
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,970
Two, I think that the people on SNL are
funnier than a salesman. Yes, absolutely.

1045
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:17,240
Absolutely. Do I think that they
would freeze up now? Not necessarily.

1046
01:03:17,241 --> 01:03:20,990
They would probably, you know,
maybe a few would freeze up.

1047
01:03:20,991 --> 01:03:25,520
Others would get dry mouth and still
plow through it. Others would ham it up,

1048
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,370
you know, who knows. Um,

1049
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:29,743
yeah,

1050
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,260
I dunno.
Um,

1051
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,560
yeah,

1052
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,730
their eye,
if they offered me SNL,

1053
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,490
I would know that they
were in a lot of trouble.

1054
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,920
I am a 48 year old man next month.

1055
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:44,260
I think that they like to try
to get young talent and um,

1056
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,320
I think that window has closed.

1057
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,550
Um, I haven't said that.
I got nothing but respect.

1058
01:03:52,551 --> 01:03:56,250
It seems like haven't just trying to
write a fucking cartoon where we got all

1059
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:59,460
the fucking time when the world to do
this shit where they have to come out with

1060
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:03,180
a brand new, you know, 90 minutes
minus fucking commercials.

1061
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:05,203
Um,

1062
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,810
what's that 90 minus 24 to get
technical eight minutes every half hour,

1063
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:13,890
that's 64 fucking 66 minutes a week.
Fuck you.

1064
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:18,030
There's no way I've or I've heard nothing.
But that's an absolute,

1065
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:23,570
it takes a special personality to be
able to do that well, to handle that.

1066
01:04:23,571 --> 01:04:24,740
And um,

1067
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,850
I would actually be worried about
what it would do to my standup career,

1068
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:32,120
having that level of a commitment.
Um,

1069
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:37,300
which is why I prefer to do a role in
a movie where it's just sort of like,

1070
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:42,300
okay, we got you from here to here.
So it's a finite thing with at SNL.

1071
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:45,750
Shit is just like, I don't know when
they started, when they stopped,

1072
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:49,520
but it just seems to be a, it's
a hell of a commitment. But, um,

1073
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,510
yeah, so they go, did I
answer your question? Um,

1074
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:55,250
yeah.

1075
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:59,560
I'll have to get offered SNL. Who
says fucking note of that? Um,

1076
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,420
I dunno. I Dunno if I get that on.
Why am I fucking stressing over this?

1077
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:08,990
It's not happening.
But anyways,

1078
01:05:08,991 --> 01:05:12,560
thank you for sticking up for everybody on
SNL. I appreciate that. All right. Okay.

1079
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:17,400
Here's the last one from a
lady from a fucking lady,

1080
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:23,010
a woman proposing Yo baby cakes.
Belieber uh, just curious.

1081
01:05:23,011 --> 01:05:26,190
What are your thoughts?
What are your, what? Oh,

1082
01:05:26,191 --> 01:05:28,950
just curious what your thoughts are.
Sorry everybody. I'm bad at this.

1083
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:33,720
Just curious what your thoughts
are on women proposing love you.

1084
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:37,530
Thanks for advocating for pitfalls.
Hope to see you soon.

1085
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,540
Please don't use my name while
they never show me your name. MMM,

1086
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,720
I think that's a bad
move on the woman's part.

1087
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,720
Uh,
I think you guys generally speaking,

1088
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:54,860
are more gung Ho to get
married than guys are.

1089
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:56,070
And um,

1090
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:01,360
if you propose to a guy and he's
too much of a pussy to say no.

1091
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:03,060
Okay.

1092
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,720
Um, and then you ended up
marrying the wrong person.

1093
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,480
I think as a woman you should
wait for the fucking guidance.

1094
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,700
I think there's a reason why the guy asks.

1095
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,150
Yeah.

1096
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,150
Um,
it's because we don't want to do it.

1097
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,150
So if we are actually asking, then
you know, you with the na, that one,

1098
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,910
most of them ended up in divorce.
You know what? I don't know. MMM.

1099
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,080
I don't know. That could be
maybe be kind of cool. Okay.

1100
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,830
There's something cute about it. I can
tell you that. Not talking down to you,

1101
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,830
but uh,
I used to always fake proposed to Nia.

1102
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,410
Now he's, so he's go Nia, I'm
proposing to you right now.

1103
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,120
And she would always be laughing,

1104
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:51,010
knowing I was fucking around and I would
always go, I propose that we break up.

1105
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:55,810
It was a silly joke and he used to
always make her fucking laugh. Um,

1106
01:06:58,930 --> 01:06:59,380
I dunno.

1107
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:04,380
She was real cute during that time
when she like wanted me to ask and uh,

1108
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:11,170
I dunno. My wife's fucking adorable.
So I mean, what am I going to do? MMM.

1109
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,300
Took a special kind of fuck a
woman to trick me into doing this.

1110
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:23,620
Uh, she didn't trick me. Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

1111
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:26,620
I don't know if I have any advertising
left anymore, but who gives a fuck?

1112
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:28,120
I never did it for that anyways.
Right.

1113
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,970
I'll go out and go dance
for my supper tonight.

1114
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:35,950
You're advertising the water money,
although I loved it. Oh, I love that.

1115
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,130
Advertising horror money. Maybe
I still have it. Who knows.

1116
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:45,780
That's the podcast. Once again, um,
I will try to take some video, uh,

1117
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,760
this week I actually
made a couple of ones,

1118
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:51,580
but I made one for visy and I
made one for fucking Dean del Rey,

1119
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,710
so it's got their name on it.
Um,

1120
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:55,540
when I say maybe I'll just
