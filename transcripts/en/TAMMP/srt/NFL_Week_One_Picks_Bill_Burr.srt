It's back baby. I'm a, I'm very excited,

16
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,530
but I'm also a little concerned
about did you punch the table?

17
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,500
This motion pumping in the air ride?
Are you questioning

going into the Vegas trip?
No, I'm not questionable.

I am at 100% I'm ready to go up.
They're cooling off,

season the balls back and we're
ready to do some foot ball.

21
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,920
We got shirts over at the SGP Berge page,

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,280
including it's a fucking wheel man and
right football is back and we got a free

23
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:06,020
low contest.

24
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,190
We got NFL picks and we got bill
bird come in on later on the podcast.

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,730
Yeah, we got just so much. God,

26
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:19,240
my head's about to fucking explode.
We're going to Las Vegas this weekend.

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,170
We chewing huge wads a
dip watching sweet action.

28
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,910
We got God just overwhelmed.

29
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,760
It is, it feels like fucking
Christmas Eve Ryan. No,

30
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,080
no female supervision for no 48 hours.

31
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,150
Completely let loose on her
own. And it's uh, it's just,

32
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,830
it just feels like a holiday.
But Ryan, we teased it in, uh,

33
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,780
in the little NFL song,
but freeload contest,

34

the free roll football
contest is back baby.

35
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,000

42
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,660
Now, unfortunately we do have to
do the pics page from CBS and uh,

43
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,600
so every week the lines will go up
about Wednesday, Wednesday evening,

44
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:33,280
west coast time. You make your pics and
then I know what you're thinking of.

45
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,440
What are the prizes?
Great Question Ryan.

46
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,720
The prizes this season prices,
we're not giving away sportsbook credit.

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,970
We're giving away cold hard cash.

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,630
Okay, pretty drinking. I
know what you're thinking.

49
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:53,200
What are the weekly prize as well? The
weekly prize, whoever wins the week,

50
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,460
you get one item for free
from the SGP merchant page.

51
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,660
But most importantly because
we want to reward consistency,

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,750
there could be some freak freak
moments where someone has a great one,

53
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:07,510
but we want to,
we want guys in there day in,

54
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,180
day out cashing tickets,

55
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,260
much like we did in the
super contests almost.

56
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,860
We didn't actually catch when we did
hit on 60% come on against the spread.

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,000
Ryan. These seasoned prize pool will
be determined by the listeners. Oh Wow.

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,950
Really? And I know what you're
thinking. How does that work?

59
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,880
The listeners just get to decide,
hold on and get the dental base.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,050
We're going to start calculating here.
Here's how it works.

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,140
We meaning a sports gambling,
podcasts, network ads,

62
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,310
shark putting up $2,500 plus.

63
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,380
Now this is where you,

64
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:49,580
the listeners come in $1 per entry
for the season long prize pool.

65
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,120
So if we get 7,500 people,
we're giving away 10 grand.

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,590
If we only get a hundred people,

67
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,380
we're only giving away
2,600 so you the listeners,

68
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,180
it's up to you guys to spread the word,

69
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,400
get everyone signed up and the free roll
football contest and then the season

70
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,440
long prizes first,
first place,

71
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,670
a juicy 60% cut of the
prize pool percentages.

72
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:17,780
Now I need a calculator again.
Get the database on it. Jeez. 60%

73
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,000
second place,
25% of the prize pool of third place,

74
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:27,080
15% of the prize pool and
then fourth through eighth,

75
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,880
one item from the SGP march page.

76
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:31,880
So things a little different
this year and it's not,

77
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,530
it's not roll over credit at a sports
book. Instead it's cold, hard cash,

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,640
which I know you guys want.
And uh, listen, ended the
season. That's a perfect time.

79
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,390
Your Post Christmas, your pockets are
empty. You're going to need some cash.

80
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,523
And uh,

81
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,030
what better time than right after the
NFL season and rolling into the playout.

82
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,970
Yeah. What better time? I mean
I would almost rather, uh,

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,040
when a week then the season would that
baby whale tee or you can baby whale

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,430
tee shirts available the year with the
regular t shirts available that the

85
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,870
hoodies available. Will there be
more shown there? Well, we are a,

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,150
we're just looking at some more designs
and we're just going to be loading up

87
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,800
that merge page.
So stay tuned.

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,090
The art department's working on
them working over time. And again,

89
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:18,710
we'll be out in Las Vegas this
weekend so people are hitting us up.

90
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,220
Hit us up. If, uh, you know, we may
have some shirts kicking around,

91
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:25,460
people are hitting us up like crazy. I
mean, this contest that they're going to,

92
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,300
I mean, we should check in
with Gus Johnson because I
think just the collection

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,730
be like the a,

94
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:37,270
the moment when I was on campus as a
freshman and Brittany Spears came out for

95
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,750
that halftime performance,
just penetration,

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,500
a collective nutting of the,
uh, the population. Yeah. No,

97

I mean people are Jones about the contest.
People are Jones and about Vegas.

98
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,330
People are Jones in about a year.
Everyone's DFS lineups.

99
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,770
There's just, there's just a frantic
energy that takes over your brain.

100
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:59,470
If you're like me,
I'm just stressed out.

101

You'll have to show me how to use

through the draft. Love it just, it's,

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,333
Favorite time of year.

145
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,310
Honestly, Sean, it's the feeling I get
when I, when I give myself a little, uh,

146
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,210
abstinence from the old medication and
then I, I get to indulge again and that,

147
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:04,950
that first like sinking into the couch.
That's football for me. I'm, I'm stoked.

148
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:08,040
It's back. Yup. Comfort
food, baby. It is so great.

149
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,580
I feel like they scared us a little bit
in the a week two and week three of the

150
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,580
pre season. They were just
flagging everything. Any, any uh,

151
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,790
guy lowers his helmet even though he's
got his head up trying to hit him right

152
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,624
in the chest.

153
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,840
They're throwing a flag and then all
of a sudden week for the preseason,

154
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,820
all those flags dried up. I have
a feeling when it comes, you know,

155
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,040
Thursday night we'll see very few of
those penalties actually called the,

156
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,900
because the refs are just as big a fan
of football as us and they know it'll

157
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,090
just kill the game if they do it
all the time. I think they set up,

158
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,420
don't, the reps aren't making that call.
It's the people up top talent to do it.

159
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:46,980
This is the deal. At some point,
if the game is going to continue,

160
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,030
you're just going to
have to sign a release.

161
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:51,630
So if you want to play this
at a professional level,

162
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
these are the risks and
they're going to make you like,

163
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,360
they're probably drawing
up that contract right now.

164
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:01,410
You can never come back and
sue us. I mean, look, if, if,

165
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,710
if the state or the federal government
can put you in jail for like 30 years and

166
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:11,490
then realized they screwed up and the
only way they let you out as you can't sue

167
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,030
them.

168
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,890
I'm sure the NFL can draft
something these for these people,

169
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:20,100
that belt, they'll come up with something.
So I think the game will be okay.

170
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,360
Yeah. The same people who drew up
the warnings for cigarettes now,

171
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:27,080
the Philip Morris guys, they'll meet up
with the NFL, they'll figure it out. Hey,

172
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:30,680
you just got to put this warning on the
helmet. You know, we'll still be good.

173
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,190
Yeah, come on. It was great.
It did feel like this, uh,

174
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:39,191
this college football weekend leading
into the NFL was almost a kind of a warmup

175
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,520
or play baby.
Yeah.

176
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,170
Did you watch football?
Because football has been like,

177
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,800
it's just been what it's been all
about man for the last few years.

178
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,540
Like it's just,
it's so exciting.

179
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,090
And then they finally figured
out not to have all those,

180
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,330
like just a cupcake games.
You know,

181
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:59,070
like I remember back in the day when
you would gamble in like in like, uh,

182
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,891
September,

183
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:04,891
like Nebraska would be favored by 58
over Kent State and then they'd cover,

184
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,860
it was like ridiculous. Um, but now
there was smart enough where they had,

185
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,450
they had the Michigan Notre Dame game,

186
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:14,200
they had Lsu Miami that the Florida state
game last night. I missed all of that.

187
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,580
I was doing some daddies labor day stuff
with the family. I missed that one. But,

188
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,730
um,
I I absolutely,

189
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,970
I love college football as much as I
love pro so much to my wife's Chagrin my

190
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,700
entire weekend and this
weekend I'm actually in
Sacramento and then I got to go

191
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,010
to the Toronto Film Festival.
Uh,

192
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,090
so I'm missing Saturday football and I'm
flying home during the one o'clock game.

193
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,050
So this is going to be a lot of
Dvr and going on in my house.

194
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,140
Oh, that's my favorite thing. Every season
is the really football's back already.

195
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,650
It's only August, wasn't it?
Just the draft. What happened.

196
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,930
Then you got the combine and
then you just go, hey honey,

197
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,990
one of the real housewives
in the off season. Exactly.

198
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,610
The Bachelor is a full time sport.
Like you know the NFL should be as well.

199
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,340
Yeah.
That that Andy Cohen show,

200
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:08,340
that's their sports center where they
get those women all stirred up again.

201
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,630
What about on this plate
when she said you're,

202
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,250
you're barren and you
couldn't have children, they
start yelling at each other.

203
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,470
It's like watching a red round the horn.

204
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,650
Yeah it does.
It does.

205
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,320
It does end the pacing of a studio
show cause they bring up game film.

206
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,500
They're breaking it down. What do you,
you know they have former players,

207
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,270
former bachelor's weighing in turning
point Madden's on the telestrator over

208
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,220
there.
That's good.

209
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,710
That's the only way I could,

210
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,660
I had to like get like look at my
wife's perspective and just be like,

211
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,190
this is just her sports center.

212
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,340
And then I was able to kind of relax
and then I really look at a lot of the,

213
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:48,390
you know, it's a lot of the sports chatter
out there. It's just so ridiculous.

214
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:51,510
It's like somebody like me who's not
even connected to it. Just I'll tell you,

215
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,590
I'm really concerned about a
middle relief. Know talking
baseball. It's like, oh,

216
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:59,070
are you somebody who never played
beyond not getting picked in gym class?

217
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,160
The weird thing is always funny.

218
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:05,000
Sean's a big fan of doing that with the
Eagle and I do enjoy the, uh, you know,

219
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:08,930
we're, we're going to win it all
this year. It is a way, it's a way,

220
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:13,530
because if you don't win, you get all
this crap you guys saw. Exactly. Show,

221
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,750
model, Blah. Then all of a sudden your
win and then the other guy, it's like, oh,

222
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:21,510
we're easy to apply. You didn't play,
but what do you mean? Yeah, when,

223
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,400
when I wake up Monday and the eagles got
their ass kicked, I'm fucking depressed.

224
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:29,320
All right. I have to live with that.
These guys, that's just a job for them.

225
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,670
This is my fucking life.
So, yeah, I may dress right

226
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,320
at, at people give you
shit saying you guys suck.

227
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,200
You guys show Philly's a bunch of losers
and then all of a sudden if you're win

228
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,770
every, that's when you know you want
to gain. When people say, oh, we,

229
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,960
it's not we, it's like, oh,
we must've won something that

230
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,950
you resent. Yes, exactly. All
right, well, perfect bill, we uh,

231
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:55,640
we picked up a couple of games here
to break down with you. Of course,

232
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:58,790
all the spreads come in from our
official partner, my bookie dot. Agee.

233
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,480
He's that Promo Code Bill Bats for
a hundred percent deposit bonus.

234
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,180
First game opening game of the season.

235
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:10,181
Atlanta falcons heading into Philadelphia
right now it's looking like eagles

236
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:13,520
minus two and a half. I think it
opened at like three and a half.

237
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,810
It was up to four when it sounded like
when this playing. Now when's is out?

238
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,080
Falls is named the starter.
Which way you lean in on this game.

239
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,493
Ah,

240
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,910
you got to take the eagles
at home. I know. I, you know,

241
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,050
they're going to be raising the flag.
Every one's going to be going nuts.

242
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:35,680
Half the crowd will be in that
little jail they have. Um, I,

243
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,480
ah, it is, it's still the eagle.

244
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,240
So those should win this game,
but there's still,

245
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:47,870
until they wouldn't that second one,
there's still the eagles on Nerd,

246
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,870
but I'm going to take the
eagles at home considering, uh,

247
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,250
nick falls at a pedestrian 300 yards in
the Superbowl compared to Tom Brady's

248
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,910
500 yards and losing which
will never be broken. And Tom,

249
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,540
Tom does it again.
Thank you so much for bringing this up.

250
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,540
I go at it with Patriots fans who say
that Brady had a better game that falls

251
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:10,691
out.

252
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:15,691
Brady had an amazing game and you can't
obviously knock Brady's play at all.

253
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,890
But in that particular game I would say
nick foals out played him because of the

254
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:25,240
couple of key plays fulls made and the
limiting of the turnovers and Brady

255
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:27,460
obviously. Yeah, Sean's defensive of Nick

256
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,540
full is a passion of mine.

257
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,850
Well No. And then the fumble, that
kind of turned the game at the end.

258
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,570
And on the other side you've got nick
foals driving down to get a touchdown.

259
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:41,620
Now I'm not trying to

260
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,710
not timeout dude. First of all,
Tom Brady's not a running back.

261
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,860
He's like 51 years old.
If you don't block it,

262
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:52,820
he gets tackled that one fumble
duty through for 500 yards.

263
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,780
If you're really going to put that
it was our defense. Right fix.

264
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,260
What's the problem on both sides of
the ball? Both sides of the ball.

265
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,980
Nick false came out like it was a
regular season game. He wasn't nervous.

266
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,560
Tom Brady's Tom Brady,

267
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,660
Balsa offenses played great
defenses on both teams. Sucked,

268
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,170
sucked. The only thing was the
eagle sucked. A little less.

269
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,770
Eating goes basically
the eagles made the only,

270
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,320
I think defensive play the game.

271
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,250
I'll up saying listen you started
this shit cause I'm sitting there

272
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:28,040
congratulating you.
If you're going to say like,

273
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,400
like that is like like some ESPN shit.

274
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,890
Just say like do you
have any hot takes gone.

275
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,580
Somebody throws to a 500
yards and they're the problem.

276
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,020
They they I think they
will kind of offs the

277
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,790
magic. No, I would at this point it's my,

278
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,170
it's probably my second favorite sport
or watching Sean talking about how Nicole

279
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:49,860
is, had a better game than
Tom Brady. And to be clear,

280
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,360
Tom Brady had an amazing game.

281
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,990
The reason the patriots lost was because
they couldn't stop anyone on defense.

282
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,230
That's, that's what I'm really, what
you're bringing it full circle for us.

283
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:01,050
Nicole's is gonna suck.
Like he has the rest of his career.

284
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,380
Eagles.
Eagles couldn't stop the patriots either.

285
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,630
They stopped him one fucking to do. There
was like two pumps the whole game. Yeah.

286
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,523
Yeah.
It was crazy.

287
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,630
There's no talking shit about what your
defense did in that game other than we

288
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:20,550
made one play if they would like, I mean
the offense was, it was the weirdest.

289
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,340
I can't watch it because
it's too still too close,

290
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,580
but I have to go back and watch it.
It's the weirdest fucking game.

291
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,480
I mean at this,
that's,

292
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,680
that's some shit that happens at like
division three high school where there's

293
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:36,620
like two pumps in a game. He looked
like a big game. It was really a,

294
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,000
it was, it was bizarre. I not start yet.

295
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,440
And it started off with what's his
face is like, like, like crying,

296
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:46,470
like he's had a funeral
that Malcolm Butler.

297
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,910
Oh Man, what did he do? What did
he do? I guess we'll never find,

298
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,360
I should've known. I should've known
when he was, when they'd better.

299
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,670
Anytime Bella check does that we lose.

300
00:18:56,671 --> 00:19:00,120
So I remember we were playing the jets
at home and Wes Welker had made all those

301
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:03,180
feet joke.
Rex Ryan,

302
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,280
we sat him and then Brady threw the
worst tasks of his career on that.

303
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,800
That screen pass or was just,
it was like he threw it three yard hail.

304
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:14,850
Mary went up in the air and there's
always a pick six. And uh, so anyway,

305
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:15,390
what happened,
man,

306
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,500
I wish that you guys beat somebody
else because I was very happy.

307
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:23,010
I would have what I could have enjoyed
watching the eagles. Finally, what am I,

308
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:28,011
because I don't wish long term misery on
any sports fan other than a select stu,

309
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,240
you,
Montreal,

310
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,390
Montreal Canadians fans and
Yankee fence to everybody else.

311
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,870
Everybody else.

312
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,730
All right. So Kramer
said, are you going with,

313
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,520
obviously I'm going to be on the eagles.

314
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,560
The key with foals is if
you give him time, if he,

315
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,160
if he doesn't face a pass for us,
she's going to be okay.

316
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,820
They got Jason Peters coming back and
left tackle. I think that'll be huge.

317
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,380
They get some of their weapons back.

318
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,270
I think they could scheme
up a decent game plan.

319
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:59,620
I think their defense will play good,
uh, against the Falcons here week one.

320
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,980
And uh, yeah, they're raising the banners.
I think there'll be jacked for it.

321
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,530
I'm going on the eagles.

322
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,550
You got shut down the
vikings, you know, everybody,

323
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,690
you guys just completely
shut them down in the,

324
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:14,460
in the NFC championship game, if I
remember correctly. So the census there,

325
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,080
I just don't,
that was like a twilight zone game.

326
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,480
It was bizarre because I,

327
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,690
every scenario in my head going over
the game for the eagles to when it was

328
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:26,610
going to be a defensive struggle,
you know, or, or a low scoring game.

329
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,580
I certainly didn't see 13 yeah,
something like that.

330
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,610
That's what I was thinking and I was
shocked to see them pull it out with the,

331
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,720
you know, 74 points or whatever
scored. Yeah, I mean, listen,

332
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:41,170
it's tough to go against the, the, I mean
the patriots got runner up last year,

333
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:44,980
but typically the team raising the
banner, it's a good bet. You know,

334
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,150
the contrarian in me also likes the line,
you know,

335
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
the line move is moving the wrong way.
Nick falls did just win the Superbowl MVP,

336
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,890
so got to give them better
the benefit of the doubt.

337
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,590
But what I would say the Falcons could
have that pastor I've shown you mentioned

338
00:20:56,591 --> 00:21:00,050
the past rush, that could be the
problem. And just out of principle off,

339
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm of course I'm going to fade the
eagles fan niggles. All right. Next up.

340
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:08,080
Big Game. Houston Texans at the
New England patriots right now.

341
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:12,700
Patriots six point favorite.
And uh, I'll kick things off.

342
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
I like the pats here, lane six against
his texts and his team. I mean,

343
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,300
one thing that's been pretty consistent
in the Brady Bellacheck era is they look

344
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:22,660
good coming off a loss.

345
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,690
And if you look at 2012 when they lost
the Superbowl in 2008 they and even back

346
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:31,330
to the parcels and 96
they came back and uh,

347
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,420
they won 34 13 they want 1710 they
want 41 to seven like this team.

348
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,580
I think we'll come out with a statement
game and really put it on the tech since

349
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,423
that's what I'm saying.

350
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,130
I'm not trying to be a jerk here,
but how does,

351
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,250
how does that have anything
to do with this team?

352
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:51,820
All those and all of the personnel
from all of that. It's like, you know,

353
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:55,840
they think they play really good
historically and when it's 70 degrees out,

354
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,190
Bella check I guess. Yeah,
I guess. I guess to me it's,

355
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,240
I don't Bella checks the guy that just
doesn't lose back to back games and I

356
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,830
think, listen, little brothers
coming off a Superbowl loss. Yeah.

357
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,890
Bill O'brien,
former guy in the coaching tree.

358
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,170
I think he's going to want
to put it on him. I just,

359
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,730
this patriots team seems like they're
ready to make a statement at home against

360
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:19,564
the Texans team.

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,050
Do you see it go, well, I
think Texas quarterback,

362
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:28,560
what's his name there to Sean Watson?
He's coming off the ACL.

363
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,360
He's going to be a nightmare.

364
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,030
He's going to be a nightmare
for us trying to contain him.

365
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,090
And the only thing I like is like,

366
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,740
I guess they have the worst
offensive line in the league.

367
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,540
I think that bodes well for
us. Um, what's the spread?

368
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,960
Six patriots laying six at home.

369
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,120
Oh, they always pick the perfect
number. Dot. Yeah, they're so good.

370
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,440
I'm actually,

371
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm actually going to take the
Texans with the points because a,

372
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,030
you have the last year we played the
Kansas City chiefs and they came in and

373
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,090
they killed us,
you know,

374
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:04,400
so I'm gonna play your game and talk
about something that happened before.

375
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,600
Probably it doesn't matter.

376
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,940
I think everybody's going to
jump on the patch being like, oh,

377
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:11,220
they're going to be pissed because
they've lost the super bowl.

378
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,100
Everything he just said.
And then the time Julio Jones,

379
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,070
that wasn't really,
you're at a sports bar like me without,

380
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,360
and makes a couple of great catches in.
Now also, this is their revenge game.

381
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,870
I'll forget, they haven't seen us since
we, uh, came back and this, you know,

382
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,050
came back historically two years ago
in the Superbowl against them. So, uh,

383
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,250
sorry, I think you were bringing the
falcons in there for a second right there.

384
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,640
Forgot. And we were
playing Texas. I'm sorry.

385
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,290
Oh, good. Kramer. Which way? Which
way you lean in here? I mean, yeah,

386
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,150
it's Bellicheck just whoops.
On his disciples period. Yeah.

387
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,080
Not much to handicap to Sean Watson would
scare me with that defense. Yeah. Uh,

388
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,700
I do, I am curious to see the
offensive line, but I've just seen,

389
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,630
I feel like we've seen this so many times
where a t and optimistic disciple of

390
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:07,100
bill Bellacheck comes in and just gets,
gets a shit pushed in. So yeah, I'm not,

391
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,340
I'm not a fan of the Patriots
week one. Yeah, I do.

392
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,410
I do think bill is hitting on
something. No, because I feel like,

393
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,380
and maybe this is again
just kind of a gut instinct,

394
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:18,440
but the pads kind of play
themselves in September.

395
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:22,040
They use it as an extended preseason.
Kind of try out some stuff,

396
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,240
figure out some things.

397
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,870
And I'm still shocked that Patricia got
a head coaching job because I don't know

398
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:33,140
that defense didn't want, you know,
instill a lot of confidence. So that's,

399
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,880
that's crazy that he got that Detroit Gig

400
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,840
y'all can't reminds me of,

401
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:40,890
when I first moved out to la the
first time it'll late nineties,

402
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,920
everybody out here either had a Seinfeld
or a friend's credit and that entitled

403
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,600
them to some sort of show
runner like, uh, or they,

404
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,720
we get some sort of deal and
they would pair them up like, oh,

405
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:54,270
this guy wrote on friends,
this guy wrote on sign shop.

406
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,590
I think bill Bellacheck is
to Seinfeld of writers' room.

407
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,530
If you did, if you did anything,
if you will, the waterboy. Yeah,

408
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,890
but he was the water boy. Bill Bella
check you. You don't make a lateral move.

409
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:11,000
You don't become the waterboy you,
you get elevated in physicians.

410
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,680
So maybe that's why a
Patricia's where we is.

411
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,420
I mean it's so true,
but it sounds like Patricia is just,

412
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
it sounds like people are already
penciling them in is a failure.

413
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,700
It sounds like things aren't going well.

414
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,390
There's some weird dynamics going on with
that team. All right. One of the, uh,

415
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,910
one of the Monday night games.
There's the dual Monday night game.

416
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:31,010
Do a kick off the season,
which fuck it.

417
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:35,060
Why not the La Rams head
up to Oakland right now.

418
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:39,200
The Raiders four point home
dog bill. I'll let you, uh,

419
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,710
get things started here. How do you,
how do you see this game shaken out?

420
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:45,800
Do you look, do you like the Raiders?
What's your thoughts on John Gruden?

421
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,550
MMM,

422
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,220
I'm hoping that he doesn't
regret going back to the 24,

423
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:55,791
seven,

424
00:25:55,791 --> 00:26:00,470
three 65 life of coaching when I
always feel like when coaches get into

425
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:05,471
broadcasting and there was good at good
at it as is groupness they gotta be

426
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:09,320
sitting there going like this,
just job as a joke compared to what?

427
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,820
Compared to what I used to have to do.
But I imagine he missed it.

428
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:16,370
Obviously they gave the right amount
of money. He came back and made Gruden.

429
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,370
I know he's been gone for a while,
man. I mean, well how many years?

430
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,900
Like almost a decade and a half.
He left like early two thousands I right.

431
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,270
Yeah, I think it's good. At least 10
years. I think we looked it up. It was,

432
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,600
it was before the wildcat. So
put that in perspective. Yeah.

433
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,790
Yeah. 2007. Yeah.

434
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,880
So that's a long time and each generation
of kids is a little bit different and

435
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:45,600
he's also rebuilding and I saw the thing
on the Ram's head coach where he could

436
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:48,540
recall like you usually see that
in real sports with Bryant Gumbel.

437
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,040
Like they'd be like, hey a minute, 42,
week eight, third quarter, what happened?

438
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,040
He's like, Oh yeah, we ran that sweep
play. The guard didn't get out, uh,

439
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,340
quite where we wanted him to,
but he got the job done.

440
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,160
He has like a photographic memory.
I think that guy is,

441
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,750
is like if anybody's going to
be the next generation of guys,

442
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,530
it's going to be him. And um, where he's,

443
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:15,000
where he's just taking the rams
so quickly. I just think, uh,

444
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,300
cause is just starting to put it back
together. I would take the ramps.

445
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,150
Okay. Kramer, first of all. Yeah.

446
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,300
It comes off like somewhere between a
serial killer and rain man and that piece,

447
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,180
he's definitely like, well advanced of
grew and, and, and just just imagine,

448
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,550
I mean I have to deal with
millennials on a daily basis shown.

449
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:36,060
I cannot imagine John Gruden
dealing with millennials. I mean,

450
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,880
we know why he came back.
We saw it in hard knocks last year.

451
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:41,850
He still was making a playbook.
He just didn't have anyone to give it to.

452
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,780
He loves rocking the visors.
He's, he's cut like half the team.

453
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:50,550
I think I saw that there's, there's 31
new players on his 53 man roster. Um,

454
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,870
I saw a great tweet.

455
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,120
The Raiders decided to pay a coach $100
million and not pay their best player 90.

456
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,590
Uh, so many reasons to, I
mean, this is the ultimate,
like, just take the ugly dog,

457
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,790
right? This is the ultimate take the ugly
dog on money and I, but I, I can't do it.

458
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,810
I can't do it in this spot. So yeah,
I'm going to fake. I come on and we,

459
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,960
we think Jay Gruden's a joke, at
least I do. He made a mistake,

460
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,750
he's going to realize it
quickly. My talks, I wouldn't,

461
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,380
I wouldn't normally like to take a kind
of road favorite here in a divisional

462
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:24,360
spot. I normally like to take a Monday
night home dog. Great Opportunity here.

463
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,141
But man,

464
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:30,060
this Raiders team isn't crazy disarray
and it just seems like the quarterbacks

465
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,820
pissed off. He's upset that
they traded their best player.

466
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:37,320
It's a weird move to pull this close to
the season and the Raiders did the 24th

467
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:41,670
ranked defense with cleal Mag.
You trade a all time defensive player.

468
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,070
Now maybe this line up working
out for them in the long run.

469
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:46,140
But I think this rams offense,

470
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,560
even though they didn't get a lot of reps
in the pre season for whatever reason

471
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,920
McVay maybe, you know, they use the
crazy analytics and some sports side,

472
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,050
no wig Gruden's using analytics.
He openly challenges analytics,

473
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:02,340
which I Kinda, I normally like the old
school guy approach there, but uh, yeah,

474
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,120
I'm lucky.
Yeah,

475
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,133
look at that.

476
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,170
You look at the ram season that last
year in St Louis didn't go well,

477
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,600
moved out to Fisher. It was just a
complete disaster. Just think of this.

478
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:23,710
If John like John Gruden became a
caricature, much like John Madden.

479
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:28,360
Imagine if John Madden came
back to coaching after like
15 years. No fucking way.

480
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,540
Yeah. I, I think burden. It'll
be interesting. I don't know.

481
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,190
I'm not saying, I'm just saying he
walked into a hell of a situation. Yeah.

482
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,670
He's playing these guys week one who
are just going to build on what the past

483
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:44,250
two seasons, how much they've
improved. I just think they,

484
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,060
I think they're going to keep going.
Yeah.

485
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,430
The rams have a lot of
momentum from last year.

486
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,860
Not even catching like an east coast
team playing that late kickoff.

487
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,010
You're catching another west coast team,
so it's not like they have no,

488
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,500
there might be more rare.

489
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,530
I mean there's gonna be a lot of rams
fans right now that the bandwagon has

490
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:03,550
gotten nice and roomy. Yeah. I think it's,

491
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,870
I think a lot of ranch hands going
up to, oh, you know, it's true.

492
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,020
That's also true.

493
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,870
That is such a weird tradition.
The guys,

494
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,080
let's get her costumes on and go to the
game. The foam spike shoulder pads like,

495
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,270
hey, I got to, hey, we're
going to go tailgate.

496
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:24,950
Let me stop off at Michael's first to
get all my face pain and Styrofoam cones.

497
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:27,560
The glue on the shoulder bags.
I'm a pirate.

498
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,090
So yeah, they used to look like a biker
gang. The crowd somewhere along the line.

499
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:36,740
Yes. Starting to look like like a musical,
you know what I mean? Like, like, like,

500
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,580
like for kids, you know? Or
even this even this scary thing.

501
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,590
It's a little friendly.
It's almost like you've kissed.

502
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,820
Just became a cheering section.

503
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,020
Yeah.
It's like rocky horror pictures,

504
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,620
whatever the hell that stupid movie is
meets like it needs like a Disney ride or

505
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:57,620
something. Like we can only make
it so scary because we don't,

506
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,440
there's something about like
when you have the dad bod

507
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,340
and foam spikes coming up, I love that.
They think that they're intimidating.

508
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:07,980
The other team,

509
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,200
the other team literally has 300 pound
guys trying to rip their heads off.

510
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:15,360
But you're up there dressed like a
pirate and you're the one who's be

511
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,860
throw him off. Oh, you're eyepatch
man, you're freaking me out.

512
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,580
There's a lot of that.
The dog pound a lot of that silly stuff.

513
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:28,050
Like you know, your dad goes there on a
rubber mask, eat dog biscuits. It's like,

514
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:29,370
come on dad, I gotta go. I gotta go.

515
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,260
Oh, on Monday. I have to respect
your father. Come on. Yeah,

516
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,160
you just helped me with my math homework.
You're not crazy. All right bill,

517
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:42,870
before we, uh, before we let you go here,
what is a, maybe it's these three games,

518
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:46,470
maybe it's a, a, another game you
feel really strongly about week one.

519
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,150
Can we get you to throw out a lock?
You know, we are a gambling podcasts,

520
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:53,250
so what is, what is bill burrs
lead pipe lock for week one,

521
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,320
my lead pipe lock.
All right,

522
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:01,140
this is my lock and it's not
going to be gambling related.

523
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,710
My lock is going to be
whatever happens this week.

524
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,480
Most people in sports are going to
talk radio, are going to act like,

525
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,920
you know,
like say Oakland gets their asses kicked.

526
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,160
All they're going to be talking
about that John Jacob was,

527
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:28,020
he sitting on $100 million and he's,
and he's all in one worst case scenario,

528
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,150
one game out of first they're going to
act like every goddamn thing that happens

529
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,620
this son Thursday, Sunday and Monday is
what's going to happen the whole year.

530
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,710
They do it every fucking when Kansas
City came out and kick the Patriots,

531
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,370
as all of a sudden Kansas City was
the fucking team of the future.

532
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,590
And what happened to them?
You know,

533
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,660
the Patriots went back and won the
AFC championship, you know, so I mean,

534
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,850
just don't listen for gamblers.

535
00:32:55,851 --> 00:33:00,440
Do not listen to all of the freaking
out that they're going to be doing when

536
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,050
they feel it. That's,
it's just, I don't know,

537
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,290
they always act like the fucking sky is
falling or Jesus just came back after

538
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,070
every single game.
You know what I mean?

539
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,460
You look at some of the teams that started
to get destroyed, missed the playoffs.

540
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,350
And that's a great,
you know,

541
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:20,270
advice especially for gamblers because
a lot of times you see one week and then

542
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,230
complete crazy overreactions and
we always talk about that week too.

543
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,230
When you're picking your games,
don't overreact to that week one.

544
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:30,140
If you had a strong feeling or yeah,
whatever you,

545
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,320
you were really high on the team.
It could just be one bad game.

546
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:36,920
Don't totally throw out your
shit by low Sean. Bye. Hello.

547
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,070
Exactly. Look for the look for
that overreaction spread sheet.

548
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,210
They can jump on that.

549
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,990
Tons of line value there and of course

572
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,210
L. Dot. C. O Kramer. Let's do it.

573
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,370
Oh, Sean, have you stretched?
You Ready? I might pull a hand.

574
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,310
Listen, we've had all summer. Um,

575
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,580
although it's funny all summer to look
at these lines and yet so much has

576
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:32,120
changed in the last couple of weeks even
since the last time we talked about it.

577
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,960
So I mean, Sean, let's, should we just,

578
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:38,040
should we just dive in
or are we just making

579
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,510
sex now? Yes. Alright. Well,
Thursday night, the tradition,

580
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:46,110
like none other,
the Superbowl winner in this case,

581
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:51,111
the Philadelphia Eagles hosting the
Atlanta Falcons for a revenge spot

582
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:56,670
potentially for the falcons.
Suddenly with Carson Wentz out,

583
00:35:56,671 --> 00:36:00,170
the falcons are laying a
point in Philadelphia. Uh,

584
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,030
even I questioned this minus
one 20 on the money line

585
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,930
plus 100 for the eagles.
45 is the total.

586
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,250
We did mention a different spread.
Yes. When we just talked to bill,

587
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,890
it was the night before
and it was two and a half.

588
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,480
Now the Philadelphia Eagles are
home dogs have had the, I mean,

589
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:20,540
do you remember the dog mass? You
remember lane chats, you remember,

590
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,250
you remember Chris Lung, you remember
that this team was disrespected.

591
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:29,060
And you remember how they responded and
you're going to make them a home dog

592
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:29,894
once again.

593
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,510
What is Atlanta done in the off season
that makes you think they're just going

594
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,570
to come in and blow the doors off?
Yes.

595
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:38,600
Carson Wentz is not at the helm
and that hurts their office.

596
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:42,890
But you still have super bowl MVP.
Nick falls at the hell.

597
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,640
I mean, yeah they are
missing now. Shawn Jeffery.

598
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:48,800
But you know what they have
that they didn't have last time.

599
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,300
Jason Peters and Jordan Hicks leading
players on both sides of the ball.

600
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:59,070
You got j a j healthy
where you are you preparing cause when,

601
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,870
when Atlanta was the dog, I,
I enjoyed that side of it.

602
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,270
I think it's going to be a close game.
Uh,

603
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:08,600
at two and a half I would
be fine taking the falcons.

604
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,720
But I think at a point there
gets to a point where it's like,

605
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:15,830
well and maybe I just had time to
think about, maybe I reminded myself.

606
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,960
Oh that's right. It's Matt Ryan. Oh,
Matty ice on the road. I know he, he's a,

607
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:25,220
he's a cool bro who likes to drink and
natural ice and he's from Philadelphia or

608
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:26,840
some shit like that.
But

609
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,190
I, then I remember, oh, it's the
falcons and they're going outside to a,

610
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,010
granted it's not going to be cold
or anything, anything like that,

611
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:37,950
but may actually be human. It's
going, they're going outside.

612
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,910
They're going to be playing a,
just a super savage crowd,

613
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,320
savage.

614
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,490
And we wasn't one fucking Superbowl and
this is the game where they're raising

615
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,740
the banners and you were to come in.
You're not,

616
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,340
you're not making the Superbowl
champs a favorite at home.

617
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,580
That is the definition of disrespect.
Do you kidding me?

618
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,320
Yeah. So, oh, all of that being said like,

619
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,740
I really want to take the
falcons here, but there's a, I,

620
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,780
uh, nick falls is, it's
so hard to do. Hard to

621
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,210
do this with nick folds doesn't look good.
No.

622
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,020
Nicole's doesn't look good
in the preseason. Right.

623
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,530
This guy shows up in big games and
this game at home is a big game.

624
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,190
Now what's the key to the nic fall?

625
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:23,990
It's the key to Nicole's is giving him
time to throw the book football with

626
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:28,490
Jason Peters in there who didn't play
all preseason looks 100% they're going to

627
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:30,800
have time to throw the football.
They're going to scheme up.

628
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,360
I mean if you want to play,

629
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,510
if you want to talk about fantasy j a
Gi I think could have a big game because

630
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:38,860
they're going to be running screens.

631
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,020
They're going to be getting
him going in the first half.

632
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,460
That's going to loosen up the Atlanta
defense and really I think this game is

633
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:49,870
just going to come down to
Philly's defense playing
really well and I like what

634
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:53,710
they've done. Yeah, Timmy Tim journey guns
out, but they blood, they brought it in.

635
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,000
Hello? D Nata Michael Bennet, that
defensive line. Derek Barnett,

636
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:01,780
second year, he's looking better
brain and Graham is fired up.

637
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:06,220
Fletcher Cox said he's going to try and
be the defensive player of the year.

638
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,054
He'll looks,

639
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,320
you want to talk about pre season
that guys was just fucking destroying

640
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,330
offensive lines long.
Cox and Chris long still looks good.

641
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,261
This past her.

642
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:21,100
She's going to get the Atlanta Falcons
and Jordan Hicks being there really helps

643
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:25,120
them app. I do think not having natural
Brad, their hurts, their run defense,

644
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,190
but this team shows up. They
defend the, the trophy at home.

645
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,790
It's going to be a nightmare for the
Atlanta Falcons who didn't look great in

646
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,550
the pre season. They can say
the eagles look rusty, but the,

647
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:37,840
the falcons didn't look right.

648
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,070
I just think this is a tough
spot for this falcons team who,

649
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh and two against the gym shorts,

650
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:48,730
defense and I think a Thursday night
they make it. Oh, and three. I got it.

651
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:53,590
It'll be a competitive game. I
got it. Like 2117 eagles. Yeah,

652
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,360
I mean week one is not,

653
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,420
is not the week to get into a bunch of
trends or data because it's the start of

654
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:04,360
something new and you don't have
a sample size. Sean, this is the,

655
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,420
no,
it's,

656
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,270
it's a, it's appropriate. It's, this is
the ultimate time where you, you don't,

657
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:15,770
you don't, don't, don't try to overthink
it. Um, I think there's a lot of reasons,

658
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,210
but look at, just look at the slate.
How many home dogs do we have? Right?

659
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,530
Cleveland, you want to compare
that Superbowl champs to Cleveland?

660
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,860
What's funny is the
Raiders are a home dog.

661
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,570
You want to compare them to the Raiders.

662
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,290
What's funny is I'm about to pick the
eagles and you're getting very defensive.

663
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:37,160
Not, no, I'm mad at the lines makers.
I mean, I guess I'm not mad at him.

664
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:41,030
If my bookie daddy wants to give away
their money, then that's their choice.

665
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:45,620
This isn't the line. They opened it where
it opened and now it's being bet. Yes.

666
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,460
That's what's happening here. Uh, I
will go against this, this action.

667
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,323
I will middly.

668
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,470
I did Bennett when it was at Philly
minus four because I was sure that Carson

669
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,010
Wentz is going to play and I thought I
was getting a great number. So again,

670
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,610
probably probably worth waiting
on these lines, but, well,

671
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,000
not if you get on the right side,
like say giants plus four,

672
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:07,150
but we'll get to that
later. Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna,

673
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,090
I'm gonna fade this line movement.
I'm going to fade the, uh,

674
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,660
the public opinion and uh,
yeah.

675
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,730
Gimme gimme Philly as as gross as it is.
Shawn,

676
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,810
I gotta take Philly Thursday night
raising the banners and everyone,

677
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,160
everyone thinks about that
patriots chief's game last
year as all the defending

678
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:29,210
champs got whooped at home.

679
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,040
But that is a first off a that that was an

680
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,070
anomaly.
You got Andy Reid opening opening day,

681
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:41,030
which is you want to talk about trends
that actually matter when Andy Reid has a

682
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,770
long time to prepare, he is a, he is
a good coach. He coaches them up. So,

683
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,690
and that I think was more the anomaly.

684
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,720
If you look at the previous
years showing shown 80%,

685
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,950
80% of the cash, please say
falcons. Please say falcons.

686
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,230
70% of the tickets on the falcons.

687
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,340
[inaudible] I felt,

688
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,200
I felt, I felt a little nervous, but
now I feel much better. All right,

689
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,600
let's should we move on to Sunday shown?
I can talk about this game all day.

690
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,140
I know you can Sunday 10:00 AM kick it.

691
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,450
I feel you will be in the
beautiful Oh, West Gate. Um,

692
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,420
confirmed it is free again. Like
march madness. Yeah, there was a,

693
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,040
there was a little hiccup
there with their formula,

694
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:33,041
but we will be in the Westgate ballroom
where they have a just movie screens,

695
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:38,630
size fires going in and out. Sorry, I'm
a little tipsy. A little fired up. Right?

696
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,550
Yeah, I mean, so uh, I apparently,
I don't know how true this is.

697
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,790
Unconfirmed sources have told me that uh,

698
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,180
apparently it didn't go over well when
they charge for seats during March

699
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:52,800
madness. So they're, they're
going back to making it free. Uh,

700
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,150
it is definitely a great place to check
out. Games were not being paid at all,

701
00:42:56,151 --> 00:43:00,260
but no, they should pay us 10:00 AM one
of the games that give me a drink ticket.

702
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:03,260
Come on man. One of the teams that
will definitely be off to the side.

703
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:06,890
One of the games that will be off to the
side is this one seems to happen every

704
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,720
year. Pittsburgh Steelers with I guess
without Levy on bell at this point.

705
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,220
It does appear that way. He's, they're
heading to Cleveland where this line open.

706
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,440
Sean, I think. I think
what six and a half.

707
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,680
It's come all the way down to four plus
one 75 for the browns minus two 10 for

708
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:28,790
the Steelers. 46 is the total. So,
so Cleveland money is pouring in.

709
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:34,250
Yeah. You know the sharps love
them some by the way, Jackson,

710
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,150
one in 31. What more do you
need to see, by the way,

711
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:42,800
why is it that the GM or the head coach
weren't doing the cuts for the Cleveland

712
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:46,460
Browns? And did you watch the latest,
sorry, why did they have this assistant?

713
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,760
He was like the assistant GM looked
like Bill Simmons and he was so nervous.

714
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,700
So yeah, it's uh, it's time to
have that conversation. You know,

715
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:01,100
it's a tough business.
You're going to be great.

716
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,330
Be a man and look them in the AG. Oh, hey
you, you played, you played hard. I mean,

717
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,040
I appreciate it. Or just say, hey man, I
appreciate you showing up. Pest and luck.

718
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,790
Shake his hand. They realize it's the
NFL. You don't need a caudal. Again,

719
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,250
Rhone Nfl, it's, it's super awkward.

720
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,330
It's hard to watch and shows a
huge accident is not a good coach,

721
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,040
has no control of the team,

722
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,490
and they haven't even decided
who's starting at left tackle.

723
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:26,960
He wouldn't answer that question.

724
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:32,340
The teams in disarray now tie Rod Taylor
Ryan, who you have a hard on for. Yeah,

725
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,580
he can limit the turkeys are great.
I think he's a great quarterback action,

726
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,650
right, and you're, you're, you're
hokey. Love is making you crazy.

727
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,170
He's a bottom 10 quarterback. Whoa.
Oh, I'll take that bet right now.

728
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,230
I don't know how we quantify this movie.
I'll take that,

729
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:52,870
but he's not a thought of qualifying
him wins. That's how we quantify it.

730
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,500
He made the fucking playoffs last year.
Shawn,

731
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,540
the every argument you use for nick folds
just, I mean, tie Rod, we'll come on.

732
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:05,541
Dragos is so much the buffalo is not a
playoff team with nick folds last year.

733
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,400
Dude, you're crazy. No, it's just
crazy. When when teams are bad,

734
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:13,800
they need a quarterback. They can
give them a little, a little bit,

735
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,720
a little breathing room. Listen,
this isn't a, this isn't a statement.

736
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,340
Cleveland right here. You don't
like Cleveland as a home dog shot

737
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,030
one in 31 I'll, I'll
say that all day. Yeah.

738
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:28,730
Jackson one to get the fuck out
of you. I'm so glad. Love yet.

739
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:33,360
But I was not playing this levy on
bell's not worth two and a half points.

740
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:38,280
No. And if you want to talk
daily fantasy or any fantasy, uh,

741
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:42,330
Connor, the backup, I think this,
I mean if you listen to the,

742
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,500
how pissed off their o linemen are,
I think they're going to be motivated to,

743
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,900
to show that they don't need levy on pal.

744
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,660
I think this could be a statement
game and it goes deeper than that.

745
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,520
Connor local kid cancer survivor.
Oh come on.

746
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,480
Came back in college.
I mean it and,

747
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,180
and honestly like when he was in app hit,

748
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:07,200
like he looked through your first round
NFL running back. So I have no dad.

749
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,630
He could step in.
I it a couple of day again.

750
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:13,740
I'm not getting too deep into this
game. Let's Fade Hugh Jackson. Yes.

751
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,820
And let's not apply two and a half
points of line value to loving on bell.

752
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,770
It's a simple formula. Does this line
so on Pittsburgh, does he get the three?

753
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,310
Yeah,

754
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,570
Tommy. God Damn, if that gets the three

755
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,640
trouble. All right, well we're a,

756
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:42,170
I feel like we're chalky cause we took
the eagles but they're not actually chalk.

757
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:43,131
Anyway,

758
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:48,131
moving on up to the space ship where the
Minnesota Vikings are hosting the Jimmy

759
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:52,070
g, the very handsome Jimmy g
led San Francisco 40 niners.

760
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:57,370
The vikings are laying six and a half
points minus two 75 on the money line plus

761
00:46:57,621 --> 00:47:02,621
two 25 for the 49 there's 46 is your
total Zimmer said Dalvin Cook is full.

762
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:04,664
Go.

763
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,990
Okay.

764
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,720
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Don't
you love this Minnesota team?

765
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,490
Like isn't this a classic like I can't
wait. I mean I know you weren't as high.

766
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm going to say actually you
weren't quite high in Minnesota.

767
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,350
You had them winning.
I liked this Minnesota team.

768
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,710
We've always talked about Zimmer
gets the most out of his guys,

769
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,700
especially on the defensive side of the
ball. Do they have a shutdown corner?

770
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,310
They have a pass rush and they, they
went out and got a quarterback that sure

771
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,060
it will make them higher variants
this year. But what did I say?

772
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:36,040
Well we broke down the NFC north.

773
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,720
They are going to destroy people at home
that whatever they did in that building,

774
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:45,310
they built themselves and amazing home
field advantage. And on the flip side,

775
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,990
San Francisco as a team,

776
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:51,340
I've been itching to fade and this
should be seven points period.

777
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,790
It's on the wrong side of seven.
While you're, no you're not.

778
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,210
It probably should be Ryan.
But I'm going to go, listen,

779
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,420
I brought two pens out here so I can
throw one at you. What are you doing?

780
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,680
Here's what I'm doing. You, you're, you're
searching for a dog aren't, you know,

781
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,300
I would never do such a thing.

782
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,110
It Minnesota feels a little too easy.

783
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,870
And if you remember
Kirk cousins last year,

784
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,930
opening day at home against the
Philadelphia Eagles as a favorite,

785
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,500
didn't pull it out and even turn the
ball over a couple of times. One,

786
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,360
including a defensive touchdown,

787
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,140
which helped me a when
$200,000 in money or maker,

788
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,930
so which I witnessed at the
uh, west. Congratulations Sean.

789
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,370
I don't know if I've ever mentioned
on the podcast, I think this game,

790
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,600
here's what I think of this game.

791
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,440
If you've watched that San Francisco team
last year and even during Jimmy, Geez,

792
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:44,350
we're on where they went,
five and o or whatever,

793
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,490
which I I overall for the season I'm
looking to fade San Francisco and get on

794
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,020
Minnesota.
However,

795
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:55,270
situationally I think
this could end up for me.

796
00:48:55,271 --> 00:49:00,271
This game feels like Minnesota gets out
to a big lead and Jimmy g racks up some

797
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:03,160
garbage yards and some garbage points.

798
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,810
This to me feels like one of the few
games on the slate where the spread will

799
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:08,620
matter.

800
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,310
Our Buddy Christian Pina from inside
Vegas points out how often the spread

801
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:13,120
doesn't matter.

802
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,050
I'm going to make a bold prediction and
say this is a game where the spread will

803
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:20,830
matter. This actually to me feels
like a three or four point game. Now.

804
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:24,370
I went into the season thinking, Hey, I
want to go against the 40 niners a lot.

805
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,200
I think they're a little over hyped.
Smart. I'm going to take him here,

806
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,200
but this is where you sell the
stock because it's at its highest.

807
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:35,350
It's never going to be highest
or higher than when when they,

808
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,620
before they play games,
because this team is not going to be good.

809
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:42,580
I don't think they're ever going to be
that good. The stock is at a tie point,

810
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:46,390
sell, sell. So I'm buying
baby for this particular game.

811
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,260
Jimmy Giana dome. He'll be able to move
the ball enough to keep them competitive.

812
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,130
Obviously I'm worried about Jerick
Mckinnon not being there because it seemed

813
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:58,070
like Shanahan had a hard on for him.
Yeah.

814
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,660
I think Shanahan schemes enough
to get them to cover again.

815
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,090
This is not going to be in my lock or my
dog. Ma, you're backing off it already.

816
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,510
No,
I'm not backing off at it.

817
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,150
Slowly walk over and just know
a game where I don't feel, uh,

818
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,730
listen, I, I know they
opened the season, uh,

819
00:50:15,731 --> 00:50:17,770
against the saints last
year and beat them by 10.

820
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,580
Like to me this is a no brainer there.
They were so good at home. It's just that,

821
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:23,680
that's all I see.
I see what you're doing.

822
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:27,180
I know you're trying to fill some dogs
out on that card over there. Yeah.

823
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,420
I just moving on,
Sean,

824
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:32,270
your boy Andrew Luck and
the Indianapolis Colts,

825
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,770
they host the Cincinnati Bangles
culture minus two and a half.

826
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,330
Definitely see some threes out there.

827
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,260
I liked the two and a half
minus one 50 on the money line.

828
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,490
Cincinnati plus one 30,
48 and a half is the total.

829
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:51,500
Been hearing a lot of chatter about how
Cincinnati is becoming a darling pick

830
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:56,390
week one, uh, w w w what
am I missing here, Sean?

831
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,180
Well listen,
Cincinnati is the,

832
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,780
I'll give them the super bowl
for square sharp of the year.

833
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,960
A team because everyone who
fancies themselves a handicapper,

834
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,580
as I'm seeing stuff that you guys
aren't seeing in the Cincinnati Bangles,

835
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:15,581
what I'm seeing is a guy like Marvin
Lewis who consistently disappoints,

836
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,270
right?
Five and 11 is past 16 road games.

837
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,570
He's a guy who's not
going to win on the road.

838
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,430
And listen,

839
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,970
sometimes you can overthink these things
when it comes to penny on the NFL.

840
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:33,971
And sometimes you just have to ride a
trend like Andrew luck being the second

841
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,100
best quarterback against the spread.
You know why?

842
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:39,710
Because the guy just figures
out how to win fucking games.

843
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,910
It doesn't need to get more
complex than that. Now what was it?

844
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:44,511
What were the cults?

845
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,690
Greatest weakness in the Andrew
Lakira and that was coaching.

846
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,190
Horrible coaching except
for when our buddy, um,

847
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,310
uh, areas was there. They had a good run,

848
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,180
there were well coached then Pagano
not a good coach and they had horrible

849
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:02,480
offensive line play. That's why Andrew
luck had to take a season that half off,

850
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,570
cause he got the shit kicked out of them.
Now they got Quinten Nelson,

851
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,410
he's pulling out of the guard spot.
He's dominating the offensive line.

852
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:12,770
He's moving the line now is,

853
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:18,260
is Andrew luck a little scared to
go deep to Tui Helton? Maybe so.

854
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,070
Maybe not. I think they roll
coverage to t by Hilton and again,

855
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,700
I've said it a million times
in the daily fantasy podcast.

856
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:28,970
I think Jack Doyle has a big game
against the spangles defense.

857
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,980
Now the contrarian is like, oh, indie's
defense their dog shit, they're at home.

858
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,640
But I think in his defense
is enough to keep them in it.

859
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,570
This is a game you want Andrew Luck.
This is the game.

860
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,430
Now maybe you fade him week two,

861
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:47,300
week three where the adrenaline
where he's not playing at home,

862
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,940
whatever the situations are.
I haven't even looked at their schedule,

863
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:53,960
but this seems like a spot
where Andrew luck shows up.

864
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:58,480
He comes out and says, Hey, I'm back. Uh,

865
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,343
I mean I,

866
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,390
maybe I'm not buying Cincinnati like
some other people and may maybe.

867
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:10,130
I remember like the crowd is going to
be so juiced up to see Andrew luck and

868
00:53:10,131 --> 00:53:14,840
they had a year of Jacoby percent.
Come on. Maybe my theme here is like,

869
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,730
just like much like Matt Ryan just got
paid and has to go outside and hard a

870
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,290
difficult environment.

871
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,400
Andy Dalton is going into a difficult
environment and we know what Andy Dalton

872
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,590
is, don't we? Yes, it's,

873
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,330
it's a mediocre and less than
quarterback. And like our buddy, a doctor,

874
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:38,331
Chao at pro football doc mentioned of
the quarterbacks coming back from injury.

875
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:40,950
Andrew Luck.
He said he was the safest play.

876
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,730
He was the guy that he thought was the
most healed and that's all I need to hear.

877
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,390
You're giving me a healthy Andrew
luck less than three points.

878
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,400
This is a game he shows up in wins.
Yeah. And and Oh, by the way, oh,

879
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,930
I know.
Teams aren't,

880
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,370
no team would be looking ahead
after week one, but they got,

881
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,230
Cincinnati is going to hit the Baltimore
after this. So division division game.

882
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:08,610
Are we really? Are we on the same fucking
picks? No, I had the 40 niners right now.

883
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,110
Thank God. Yeah. Gimme the colts. I'm, I'm
back. I'm all in on Andrew luck this year.

884
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,070
30 to one MVP.
Maybe I shit.

885
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,000
Next up. Oh, what a shit fest.

886
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:25,190
This is going to be buffalo led by Mr
Peterman. They head down to Baltimore.

887
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,800
Baltimore is laying eight points
minus three 40 on the money line.

888
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:32,610
Buffalo plus two 70 40
and a half is the total.

889
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,200
You know what this is Sean Circle it.
This is the ugly,

890
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,330
the ugly dog or the week
of the ugliest dog. Uh,

891
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,890
God, I mean, can can you back? He can't
throw five picks and a half again. Kenny.

892
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,810
Kenny. I mean you would think you would
regress from five picks and a half,

893
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:55,260
but either way, I'm not
taking buffalo. I like,

894
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,330
I like buffalo situationally.

895
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,400
Normally I don't think they're
going to be quite as bad.

896
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:00,900
But I think part of that,

897
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,840
them not being as bad as them
getting Josh Allen in the lineup.

898
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:07,530
So it may take a couple of
games for them to do that.

899
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,330
There's no line value here.

900
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:12,240
And taking Baltimore because they opened
up and like minus three and a half.

901
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,870
Everyone saw how good the
ravens kind of our as a team,

902
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,250
Joe FLACCO has a fire lit under his ass.
Harbaugh's still solid coach.

903
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:24,510
I like Baltimore to win the division. I'm
going to take them at minus eight. Oh,

904
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:30,450
really? You're laying these
points? I don't like it, but
I'm going to have to, uh,

905
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,700
to me this is just the, again,
I'm not going to overthink it.

906
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:40,170
There has been a lot of line movement
here and while it does seem like buffalo

907
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,630
could be horrible,
horrible dog shit,

908
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,100
I see 92% of the money on the Raymond.

909
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,590
I see 92% of the money on a ravens team
led by Joe Flacco laying more than a

910
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,970
touchdown. Give me the dog,
Shawn. This was my attempt to Doug

911
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,160
and listen, I, I see where you're
coming from here, but it's so obvious.

912
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,270
Peterman socks, other no way. Come on.
Do you want make it is a good coach.

913
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:09,120
You don't see this as like this.
This is going to be a classic,

914
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:13,500
like they kick a field goal
to win by five. I mean,

915
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,840
I don't completely disagree.

916
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:19,080
Baltimore's probably not one of
my strongest plays at minus eight,

917
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:24,130
but I'm going to fade Peterman on the
road. Next up, Shawn, it's taking a road,

918
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:28,940
Peterman play. I'm taking a, well
maybe Alan gets a good, how many,

919
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,200
how many picks before Peter
was bold and we see Josh Allen,

920
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:35,790
I may let me head over to my bookie
and get some end game wager cause I,

921
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:39,370
I like that kid. I just, I I wonder,

922
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:44,020
I wonder about this number with Joe
Flacco. I think again the theme here,

923
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,110
I think some like,

924
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:48,880
like a bunch of non non football playing
months have happened and all of a

925
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:52,060
sudden we have a different
perception of Joe Flacco like that.

926
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:56,170
He's worthy of laying this many points.
Get the fuck out of here. Next up Sean,

927
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:56,970
we have,

928
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:01,970
I don't know much anticipated Tom Claflin
revenge prevents Jacksonville heading

929
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:06,970
into New York, laying
the field goal. My minus

930
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:13,770
minus three minus one 20 minus one 65
on the money line for Jacksonville plus

931
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:18,190
one 40 for the giants.
43 and a half is the total.

932
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:24,460
I mean I we, this was a line that I gave
out in the summer of giants plus four.

933
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,540
Yeah, it's moved to a point
that's probably smart movement.

934
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:33,820
I think this line is right where
it probably needs to be. Ah, Ryan.

935
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:37,900
Am I going to take Blake Bortles as a
road favorite? You Bet. Oh my goodness.

936
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:41,860
You Bet. A, because tag
God hates jags. Sean.

937
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,290
God hates Jags,
but God also,

938
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,520
God also hates poor offensive line play.
You are,

939
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,100
you're punching your
ticket to Saks and ville.

940
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,420
This defensive line does not fuck around
and your offensive line is a mess.

941
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,280
I think it's going to be a
bit of a problem. Sean, who
do they play next week? Who?

942
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:05,080
Who? Who? Who is the worst team the
Jacksonville could have on deck check.

943
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,460
Seville has no rivals,

944
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:11,440
but who's the worst team that they
could have on deck for the Patriots?

945
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:16,720
They play the Patriots week too. At home.
At home. Alright, possible. Look, ed spot.

946
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,950
Conference roads. But you can't
look ahead. Wordles on the road.

947
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:26,850
Listen, it's a bad formula. And at
four I'm thinking about it much more,

948
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:30,300
but at minus three, give
me the Jags, the giants,

949
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:35,040
Ryan who explained to me the cornerback
structure, the New York. Jesus Christ.

950
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,830
Okay, so you have to Norris Jenkins.
Yeah, that guy's a player. Right?

951
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:42,800
Or I'll give him that Isla apple
disaster of a second. Too salesy.

952
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,280
He's been wanting to battle players.
Land in Collins has his back.

953
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,160
He's really committed to the team.
Who is Dante?

954
00:58:50,161 --> 00:58:55,161
Deon is the guy that you and all these
other fucking talking heads that want to

955
00:58:55,351 --> 00:58:59,580
talk shit about the Joe Dante. Deon. It's
going to come in and play the slot a,

956
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:00,630
he's a baller.

957
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,880
Okay.

958
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,120
I don't really care Shawn.
Okay. I know you don't care,

959
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:08,690
but people have money on the Kootenays
out with a high ankle sprain.

960
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:12,320
That's the more concerning thing.
Evan Ingram concussion. He's back.

961
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,350
He's practicing. I just want
to see the offense. Shawn,

962
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,800
I want to see Beckham healthy. Hey, it'll
be, it'll be fun. There'll be a co giants.

963
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:22,530
I'll have a couple of big plays,
but I think eventually the Jags,

964
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:25,640
the defense will be too much.
You want the hot tag? Sure.

965
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,210
Barclay goes for over 102 touchdowns.
All right.

966
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,520
I mean the jags defense is really good.

967
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,940
I run events is not okay to
take stands and a hundred yards.

968
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,310
I'm saying that's the hot
take shall. Okay. All right,

969
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,180
well that's the take he just gave.
Keeping the jags minus 30.

970
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,160
I'll take the giants and this is where
I point out even though they were the

971
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:57,161
number one defense in the league last
year according to Dv away shown 27th

972
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,350
against the run. So it's definitely
the way to exploit them in the,

973
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,990
this new revamped mauling offensive
line of the New York giants.

974
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:10,610
It's going to come out and smash
some heads. Next up, Shawn Tampa,

975
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,260
the Jamis Winston lists Tampa Bay
Buccaneers led by Ryan Fitz Fitzpatrick.

976
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:22,970
They head down to the Dome in New Orleans
where New Orleans is laying 10 minus

977
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:26,930
five 20 on the money line,
three 95 for the bucks,

978
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:32,210
49 and a half is your total.
That total seems low.

979
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:37,090
I know it's high but it's 49 and a half
second highest total on the board, uh,

980
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,870
tied with the Rams Oakland
game and then still seems low.

981
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,930
Yeah, it does it and I
think peanut mentioned it.

982
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:48,380
I know I got a lot of guys
in DFS calm for the saints.

983
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,100
This Tampa Bay team is just dog shit.
All right.

984
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,190
Is there not a narrative where it's
like there's a narrative for sure that a

985
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,500
Tampa Bay, Gerald McCoy makes a couple
plays. They got defensive touchdown.

986
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,823
I,

987
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:06,940
I randomly have a soft spot for
Fitzsimmons but I don't think it's Patrick

988
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,120
Fitzpatrick. Sorry. I love
that guy. He went to Harvard.

989
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:15,070
Ryan as they bring up every other time.
It's this guy went to Hamad.

990
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,290
He is a is a smack.

991
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,310
Nice accent was horrible. I'm going
to take the saints minus 10 air. I,

992
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,750
part of me would like to take a
divisional game and take the big number,

993
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:32,150
but I'm just so against
this Tampa Bay team.

994
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:37,220
I just don't see it man.
Why? I just don't see it.

995
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,240
And I think uh, they're loaded. Tampa Bay,

996
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,800
Cameron Bray,
Oj Howard Godwin.

997
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,470
Evan's the Sean Jackson. Yeah, they have,

998
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,650
they have skilled position player
running backs. A bit of a question often.

999
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:54,470
Some wine, a little bit of a
question. The defense has players.

1000
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,990
This just strikes me as the kind of game,

1001
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:01,820
kind of like the buffalo one where maybe
I come after two of these spots and I

1002
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:05,840
hit one but I,
I one of these two teams is not covering.

1003
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:08,170
Now the thing I'll say about the saints,

1004
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,720
the saints have the offense
to manage this and that.

1005
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:13,820
That would be my hesitation and I this,

1006
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:18,380
this is by no means a game that I'm
looking to play. But again, 10 points,

1007
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,040
it's a of points.
I'm

1008
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,020
going to take the dog. Aww. Wow.
You are extra chocky today. Sean,

1009
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,320
what do you mean? Just hoping
that the uh, the league continues.

1010
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:32,400
Like last year I took the 40
niners catching six and a half.

1011
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,030
I took the eagles again.
Another contrary in play for some reason.

1012
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:38,581
Well you're,

1013
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:43,581
you're certainly on the public side and
this one 80% almost 80% on the saints.

1014
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,340
It is early in the week though. So some
of these numbers don't mean that much.

1015
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,960
Next up, Shaun Hughston
Mellow Brian, a little,

1016
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:55,650
a little big brother game here heading
up to New England where Belichick and the

1017
01:02:55,651 --> 01:03:00,651
Patriots are laying six and a half
minus two 70 plus two 10 to 20 for the

1018
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:03,570
Texans. 51 is the total
highest total on the board.

1019
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:07,820
As you were mentioning mentioning before,
uh,

1020
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:12,690
Texans are actually getting some love
right and everyone's kind of talking about

1021
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,430
how getting some love,

1022
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,020
I mean listen now that now that gambling
is legal and a lot of states and

1023
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,760
fantasy football and that I think fantasy
football is having to even a bigger

1024
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:28,320
impact in this line plot. I mean everyone
has a hard offer to Sean Watson. Again,

1025
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:33,030
great guy, great player, but
he was three and three, right?

1026
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:37,800
Like this is a tough spot to go into
New England and beat the Patriots coming

1027
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:42,480
off a loss we mentioned with bill,
but Bella check is coming off a loss.

1028
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:47,510
I think the Patriots perpetually
find motivation and the,

1029
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:50,850
I think that's as much as
it pains me to say this,

1030
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:55,260
I think that's kind of their greatest
asset is they've in this five super bowl

1031
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:55,561
run,

1032
01:03:55,561 --> 01:04:00,561
they found ways to stay motivated if they
don't get complacent and I don't think

1033
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:05,590
they're going to be complacent at home
opening day against the Texans and Bella

1034
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:10,110
check just doesn't get beat by his
assistance. Like it just doesn't happen.

1035
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,660
He doesn't, I know we're talking
about a spread here. We're not,

1036
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:15,960
we're not picking games straight up
like uh, Lee Corso and those guys,

1037
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:19,410
they are on the college game day.
Yeah. Someone, someone tweeted out,

1038
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,080
they go wow people and
wonder why they're waiting.

1039
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:25,380
Wondering why the ratings are
down. They're picking, yeah.

1040
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,970
Like 28 point spreads straight up and
the acting like they have some sort of

1041
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:32,580
insight. This is a, you know,

1042
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:36,040
this is going to be a 31 17 game.
I,

1043
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:40,590
I as much as you could make a case for
a Houston's defense and the fact that

1044
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:44,550
they're completely healthy and how they
could kind of wreck the shop of New

1045
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,580
England. I'll say this about New England.
Look what they did against the eagles.

1046
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:51,090
The Eagles hadn't really could defense
going into that super bowl and they gave

1047
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:52,470
Brady a bunch of time.

1048
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,970
I mean obviously Brady dropped a wide
open pass and Brady fumbled the ball away

1049
01:04:56,971 --> 01:04:57,804
when he,

1050
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:02,280
when they did get to him
and they basically made that
one play that they needed

1051
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:02,791
to beat them.

1052
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:07,550
But New England schemed up a good game
and I just can't imagine Bellacheck

1053
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,190
having the whole off season stewing about
that super bowl loss and he's going to

1054
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:13,830
lose to a guy he used to be his boss.

1055
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,010
That's a tough scenario for me to
swallow. And I mean, you know, we had

1056
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,461
a doctor,

1057
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:21,970
we had an actual doctor on talking about
the coming back from the knee injury.

1058
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,050
And I think regardless of how
well, how, if he can play or not,

1059
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:29,650
he's not going to be 100% and
with a guy like the Sean Watson,

1060
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:31,510
I think you have to worry that,
you know,

1061
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:36,511
part of what makes him great
is his ability to do great
things and he does a lot

1062
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:39,610
of those great things with his leg.
So will that be the same?

1063
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:40,960
Will the offensive line hold up?

1064
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:43,090
You can say a lot of the same
things about the patriots,

1065
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,980
the differences that Belichick and Brady,

1066
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:49,300
I'm a track record of doing more
with less. I may be wrong here,

1067
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:52,510
but I'm not going to come out of
the gate going against the Patriots,

1068
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:53,440
especially when I,

1069
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:58,420
when I can lay less than a touchdown
against the team that I think, you know,

1070
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:02,410
look, here's, think he'd be a really good
team and drop this game by 17 points.

1071
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:06,520
So I'm with you, Sean. We're, we're
both on New England, lock it up.

1072
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:11,200
Last of the early camps and maybe another
game that none of us will give a shit

1073
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,190
about.
Tennessee.

1074
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:18,070
The Tennessee Titans head down in Miami
where Miami is a two point home dog.

1075
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,420
45 is the total.
I didn't see him money on it.

1076
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,210
They do not have a money line
up on this over at my bookie,

1077
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,370
45 is the total. Sean, you got a,

1078
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,490
you got to look at, you got to
look at Miami early in the season,

1079
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:36,400
just like we're going to talk about in
a couple of games with another team.

1080
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,280
Early season home field advantage,

1081
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,860
I think you could apply
temperature and humidity,

1082
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,770
humidity and someone's gonna ease.
You know you're going to be like,

1083
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:47,290
well Tennessee, it's humid
there. It's not Miami.

1084
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,940
Marcus Mariota is not good.

1085
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,240
Why am I the only guy who
sees that and I fucking crazy

1086
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:56,130
and it's another Bella check disciple who,
I mean these guys don't,

1087
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,910
Bella check doesn't let them do like
he lets them do stuff but he doesn't

1088
01:06:59,911 --> 01:07:02,100
actually like share the intelligence.

1089
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,010
So none of these guys
have really succeeded.

1090
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,500
I had a Marcus Mariota had more
interceptions and touchdowns last year.

1091
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,760
Why are we still talking about this guy
like he's a franchise quarterback cause

1092
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:18,030
he's the ruins touchdown to himself.
That was awesome.

1093
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,770
And yet he was in a great situation.
Andy Reid in the playoffs,

1094
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:24,240
they found a way to fuck that up.

1095
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,990
If Travis Kelsey doesn't have
his brain pushed in. Seriously,

1096
01:07:27,991 --> 01:07:31,980
that was the turning point. That was
the turning point to the game. This,

1097
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,010
this Tennessee team, Marcus
ferry road is not a winner. I,

1098
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,290
I really don't like Miami,
but I like Miami and the spot Ryan,

1099
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:44,130
we talked about how September's the new
preseason football and to not overreact.

1100
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:47,250
Our Buddy, uh, bill burr
even said it. Oh, week one,

1101
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:50,280
everyone's getting his lock was that
week one. Everyone's going to be,

1102
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,530
all the talking heads are going to be
fired up and making broad crazy statements

1103
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:59,910
for the season. And I think the
fact that Miami will win this game,

1104
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:03,330
we'll win it by a decent margin and
then all of a sudden become the sleeper

1105
01:08:03,331 --> 01:08:06,000
darling,
I think will eventually fall off.

1106
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:10,740
I know it's kind of crazy to predict
that, but I, I like mammy and the spot,

1107
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:11,910
but I don't like the dolphins

1108
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:16,160
for the season. Yeah, I think I,
I think I agree with everything

1109
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,570
you said. I, I,

1110
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,490
I don't think the dolphins,

1111
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:22,400
it was surprising for me to
see that 65% of the money.

1112
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:25,910
I'm a dolphins again early in the week.
This is not a heavily back game,

1113
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:30,530
so the number doesn't mean a ton to me,
but surprise to see that and

1114
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,380
I mean this is,

1115
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:37,940
I don't, I don't know. I
got to see Tennessee do
something honestly like Miami.

1116
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,930
I know you're low on Miami,
I'm hiring Miami, but I think,

1117
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:44,180
I just think this is one of
the games that they get as a,

1118
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:47,620
when they shouldn't be a two point
dog to Tennessee that that's,

1119
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,610
that's really what this
comes down to Sean.

1120
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:53,430
Great.
Next up early.

1121
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,880
Oh afternoon kicks here on the West Coast,
Kansas City heads to Los Angeles,

1122
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:04,881
Sean and the soccer stadium where the
chargers are laying three and a half

1123
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:10,011
points minus one 85 on the money line
plus one 55 for the new look chiefs 48 the

1124
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:15,540
total you back in the homes
and as a first real start.

1125
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,160
Yeah,
I keep going back and forth on this one

1126
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:24,780
because this is another one. Uh,
Kansas City is, this is a very, uh,

1127
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,240
like kind of the stereotypical
pros versus joes game.

1128
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,290
The Publix on Sandy Arab. I said, there
it is. The public's on Los Angeles,

1129
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,590
Sean Sandy Bay

1130
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,410
and the pros are on Kansas City.

1131
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,560
This number's probably too big.
Yeah, it is a divisional game.

1132
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:49,790
I don't love. It's going to feel a little
bit like, Oh, I'm game. Here's, here's,

1133
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:53,600
here's where I'm looking at of this game.
I really like the over.

1134
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:57,920
That's what I really like in this game
because I think Kansas City's defense

1135
01:09:57,921 --> 01:10:02,921
can't stop anyone and I think the
chargers will put up a lot of points.

1136
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:08,840
What I'm scared about is Andy read
having a bunch of time to scheme up some

1137
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:12,840
stuff that uh, I think we'll
put the chargers, you know,

1138
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:14,270
we'll fuck the chargers up

1139
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,400
and also the charges are just
such a snake bitten franchise.

1140
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:22,970
But at the end of the day,
I'm going to go,

1141
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,420
I'm going to go chargers minus three
and a half. I've debated this a lot.

1142
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:30,620
I just moved my pick on the spreadsheet
charges minus three and a half.

1143
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:36,020
And that's because Joey Bosa,
Melvin Ingram against Patrick,

1144
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:38,390
my homes and Patrick my homes.

1145
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:40,790
I think we'll end up being a
good quarterback in this league.

1146
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,110
However you watch any, any of his early
stuff, he's turnover prone, right?

1147
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,290
He'll give you a couple of big plays
and that's again, why I like the over.

1148
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:52,220
I think if you look at uh,
a fantasy defense,

1149
01:10:52,221 --> 01:10:56,360
I think there's a defensive touchdown
possible for this Los Angeles chargers

1150
01:10:56,361 --> 01:10:57,194
team.

1151
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,740
And I think that'll end up
being the difference and
why they covered the spread.

1152
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,880
If it gets close, obviously there's
a chance Casey wins out, right?

1153
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:08,810
Because of how snake bitten this chargers
team is and Kansas City has plenty of

1154
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:13,500
weapons. So there's definitely a case
to be made for the chiefs. But I'll,

1155
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:14,250
I'll lean

1156
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,630
chargers here. Yeah, I mean again,

1157
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:22,980
this is there another team where they
then this defense got so much better last

1158
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,540
year they brought in the kid from Florida
state cane to play say they have the

1159
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:31,830
pass rush and uh, but they, they,
they struggled to stop the run.

1160
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:36,450
And if you were to highlight a weakness
of this defense last year it was

1161
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:39,240
stopping the run and you know, they, they,

1162
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:42,360
the teams that we're able to kind of
beat him up and run on them and you, you,

1163
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:45,360
you take Bosa out of the game.
Yeah.

1164
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,370
And I think as much as I
don't like the chiefs, this,

1165
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,890
how does, how much does Andy
Reid actually commit to the run?

1166
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,690
I think he know he is just,

1167
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:59,290
he's just sitting there with
the on waiting unleased homes.

1168
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,100
Well you haven't even mentioned
the coaching disadvantage
that answered your own

1169
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:07,990
has read is one 70% he's seven
and three straight up Sean.

1170
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,150
We've been rolling though.
College football, we're, we're,

1171
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,610
we forgot about the spreads in the NFL.

1172
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:16,000
Like you can't just throw a three and
a half and a divisional game where you

1173
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:18,640
don't have any home field advantage.
You'd be like, that's cool.

1174
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,820
I know my homes is going to
turn the turn the ball over,

1175
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:25,900
but it's the NFL like this. We're not
going to see all these crazy blowouts.

1176
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,450
This is going to sound really bad when
we just see a whole bunch of, but Ryan,

1177
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,090
Ryan, Ryan, the exception is your,

1178
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:35,300
I think if you take the chiefs I
respect that pick in that plight,

1179
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,510
but you're underestimating how dog shit.

1180
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,410
The Kansas City chiefs defense
in particular. The secondary is,

1181
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:47,580
I don't, I hate doing the double
negative, but I don't disagree Sean.

1182
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,640
I just don't,
we,

1183
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:55,670
we spent the whole preseason talking
about their lack of a home field and how

1184
01:12:55,951 --> 01:13:00,510
many chiefs fans are going to be showing
up to this game and I like the chargers

1185
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:04,590
that have a chance to win this game.
I just can't lay three and a half.

1186
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,250
They're going to miss a kick. They're
going to do something that fucks it up.

1187
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:14,020
Give me Kansas City plus the points
here. Okay. Just update Eric Berry.

1188
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:19,060
This is from coach Andy Reid. He's day
to day. It's not looking good. Oh No.

1189
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:22,660
The chiefs turned over their
entire secondary shedding.

1190
01:13:22,661 --> 01:13:27,580
Six cornerbacks from last year and plan
to start Ron Parker at one of the two

1191
01:13:27,581 --> 01:13:31,450
safety spots.
Eric Berry's not going to play from my,

1192
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,240
from my knowledge.

1193
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,980
And I think that'll be a big passing
day for Philip and company. So look,

1194
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:43,780
start Keenan Allen.
I mean if you play in Tonio gates,

1195
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:48,640
you I think crazy, crazier stuff. I think
you target this game for DFS period.

1196
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:53,500
And I didn't say DFS is the Er over
as the play in this game. See I,

1197
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,860
I'll go the other way.
I think it's so obviously an over.

1198
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:01,220
I'm gonna take the under. I think I, I'm
telling you man, like I just want to,

1199
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,180
I want to be contrarian for
these early this, this week.

1200
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:05,780
While you're not very contrarian around,

1201
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:11,460
I guess you do have the giants of the
bucks. I'll give you that. And Buffalo.

1202
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,720
Yeah, I, I have some unpopular
pics. I don't feel, I can't, I,

1203
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,470
the chargers are definitely the, the,
the, the public and more popular side.

1204
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:22,630
So I have it there too. Next up, Sean,

1205
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:26,770
one 25 kick here on the west coast.
Seattle.

1206
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:31,780
I guess they're all, Thomas is
playing. We don't know either way.

1207
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,070
Either way.
Russell,

1208
01:14:33,071 --> 01:14:38,071
the love muscle will lead the Seahawks
down into Denver or case Kanombe in the

1209
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:42,070
Broncos are laying three minus
one 50 on the money line.

1210
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:47,071
Seattle plus one 30 43 is the total right.

1211
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,090
We've been talking,
this came up enough.

1212
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:53,520
They had Denver minus three add
home Emmanuel Sanders case keen.

1213
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:57,460
Emma like that option obviously
for all Thomas plays and is 100%.

1214
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:58,330
Well I guess we'll see.

1215
01:14:58,331 --> 01:15:03,280
But Denver at home early
is a huge advantage. Again,

1216
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:06,340
the collective bargaining
agreement doesn't allow
these guys to quite get their

1217
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:10,000
conditioning right. And uh, I just,

1218
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,240
Seattle probably not a great team.
Maybe.

1219
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:16,300
Maybe they pull this out cause they do
have the best player probably on the

1220
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:20,860
field. Russel Wilson. But I feel
good about Denver Minister. Yeah.

1221
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:24,790
Not much to say here. Uh, I, I, I like
Russell Wilson to have a good year.

1222
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:28,060
Statistically,
I hopefully bald and we can stay healthy.

1223
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,900
I just think this is a bad spot.
I think the defense is going to struggle.

1224
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:36,790
There's no way Earl Thomas, this is
just going to play right? May I guess,

1225
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:41,770
who knows? Who knows? There's no way he
can be ready to play at altitude. Yeah.

1226
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:45,370
At altitude.
I do worry about case Keenum but I,

1227
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:48,790
I liked the receivers they put around him.
I liked the Royce Freeman kid.

1228
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:49,624
I think they're going to,

1229
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,510
I think they could do something on offense
and I know they're going to be good

1230
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:55,480
at defense. So Denver is very
obvious to me. Shawn and I,

1231
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:58,870
and I don't think we mentioned
this, Sean, but these lines,

1238
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:24,940
Me and Sean are going to slay everyone.
I'm predicting a top two finish for us.

1239
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,040
I love it. Next up Shawn, another one,

1240
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:32,041
25 kicked Dallas and the cowgirls
Jason traveling with his shine box.

1241
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,600
I'll go home and get your fucking shine
box. Does he checked the shine box?

1242
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,600
Is it carry on?
Uh,

1243
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:45,630
Dallas is heading the Carolina and to
take on your boy Cam Newton as minus

1244
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:50,470
Carolina's minus three minus
one 45 on the money line.

1245
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:53,350
One 25 for the cowboys,
42 and a half.

1246
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:58,240
This is an awfully low total. Um,
it, it, it's interestingly low

1247
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,210
Carolina roles.

1248
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:04,870
Carolina roles and I don't
like Cam Newton again.

1249
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:08,560
I was the one who came up with Sham
Newton. Don't try and steal that from me.

1250
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:10,460
That is intellectual property

1251
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,490
over time. I like how you get
more and more aggressive at,

1252
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,590
you're claiming of the nickname sham noon,

1253
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,870
Dallas name one matchup that
the cowboys have better. Listen,

1254
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:25,180
Luke Keekley is healthy.
He hasn't gotten a concussion yet at Kara.

1255
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:30,200
Dallas has no one to catch a pass.
Carolina's just gonna Stack the box. Yeah.

1256
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:34,520
They have so much more weapons on
the offensive side. Cam Newton,

1257
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:39,170
as much as I don't like him personally
is a better quarterback is a playmaker.

1258
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,800
Why would this be even on a neutral field?
I will say this,

1259
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:46,550
the potential strength of the
Dallas defense is those linebackers.

1260
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:51,050
And if those linebackers can cover the
combination of Greg Olson and Christian

1261
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:55,490
McCaffrey, it becomes an
interesting game. But again,

1262
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,300
Dallas is offense is or their strength
is their offensive line and they're not

1263
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:01,820
going to get that same push with
all the injuries. The classic,

1264
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:06,500
it's a three point spread. It probably,
I guess it could be, uh, you know,

1265
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:08,090
to me,
Carolina,

1266
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:13,091
Dallas is closer to three and
a half then chargers chiefs.

1267
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,170
So I will lay the points with
Carolina. Um, not, not to mention,

1268
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,220
I just, you know, we got to see,

1269
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,260
I mean we need to see the cowboys
offensive line do something too.

1270
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:27,770
So it's cowboys could roll,
but I'm taking Carolinas,

1271
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,920
came on Austin starting receiver.
Look,

1272
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,080
someone has to catch the ball.

1273
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,890
I don't know if you've watched the
NFL in the past 30 years. Allen Hurns,

1274
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:40,310
Allen Hurns that that's the
DFS guy this week. Sean,

1275
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:44,480
last of the late afternoon kicks,
early afternoon here on the west coast.

1276
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:46,700
The Washington to
professional football team,

1277
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:51,701
they had to Arizona for Bradford is
not a fucking franchise quarterback.

1278
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,290
Arizona is very excited to say Redskins.
Uh,

1279
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,210
Arizona minus one 44 is the total.

1280
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:05,120
I'm very torn here. Sean. Yeah, I know.
I'm the same way because Sam Bradford,

1281
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,350
as much as he sucks,

1282
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:11,351
he has randomly showed up at
a dome in a week one home.

1283
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,990
Um, but I, I'm going to feed them.
I actually think David Johnson,

1284
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:18,290
we'll have a good game.
So I do like that on the DFS side,

1285
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:23,120
but I think the skins pull this one out
as a, I'm not super high on the skins,

1286
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:26,210
but Alex Smith,
and again,

1287
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:28,430
sometimes you just don't
have to overthink it.

1288
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:33,490
Alex Smith is a guy who wins games and
Sam Bradford is the guy who loses games

1289
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:39,650
to Alex Smith 88 62 and one as a starter.

1290
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,380
I know you're not going to
look at some crazy trends,

1291
01:19:42,381 --> 01:19:45,440
but I think they have a
very conservative game plan.

1292
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:49,100
I'm really worried about Arizona's
defense as far as what they can trot out

1293
01:19:49,101 --> 01:19:50,780
there,
especially in week one.

1294
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:55,370
And I think David Johnson
again has it has a good game,

1295
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:59,360
especially from Ppr because he's just
going to get a shitload of targets and

1296
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:00,081
maybe that's enough.

1297
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:03,750
Maybe he breaks some but gun to my
head or I'm going to take the, uh,

1298
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:08,070
the Redskins here
mean I

1299
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,800
guess so. Sure. Arizona could be bad.

1300
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,360
I think that's the consensus is
Arizona is going to be pretty bad but,

1301
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,890
but it is Sam Bradford and it,

1302
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,490
it is the first game of the season and
he is healthy and he has had good games

1303
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:24,540
in the first game even
as recently as last year.

1304
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:29,430
So, uh, I don't know why.

1305
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,220
I don't know what's wrong with you Sean.
Cause you're,

1306
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:36,840
you're backing Gruden on the road
anchored and baby Jay Gruden.

1307
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,170
Yeah, sure. Alex Smith
was great with Andy Reid,

1308
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:44,250
but we've seen quarterbacks leave Andy
read before and it's not so pretty.

1309
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,180
No one's really talking about that.
That is not a narrative. Right.

1310
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,270
When you go for, when
you leave, when you go,

1311
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:56,990
when you go from a quarterback guru
to a self proclaimed quarterback guru.

1312
01:20:57,121 --> 01:20:59,220
I Dunno if that's the best thing.
Look,

1313
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,630
I don't think the Redskins
are going to be horrible.

1314
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,960
I think this is just a
tough spot and I like,

1315
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,990
dare I say Bradford to
have a decent game here.

1316
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:10,740
Can me the cardinals minus
one chigger not a great coach,

1317
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,830
but possibly better than Stephen Wilkes.
We don't know.

1318
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,440
He was a good d coordinator
for the panthers, right?
What? Right. It was all right.

1319
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,680
The giants wanted I,

1320
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,740
there were rumors that giants wanted
to hire him and I was very happy they

1321
01:21:22,741 --> 01:21:27,330
didn't. They got a Shermer.
All right, John Prime time,

1322
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:31,500
Sunday night football bears,
packers, Lambeau field,

1323
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Greenbay minus seven and a half minus
three 45 on the money line plus two 75 for

1324
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:39,390
the bears.
47 and a half is the total.

1325
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:45,840
That's a lot of fucking points, right?
A little too big. You see this news,

1326
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,170
Sean,
what the rams aggressively,

1327
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:53,000
aggressively went after.
Clear clue Mac. Uh,

1328
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:58,080
right before the Paris traded for him am
I don't know where they're getting all

1329
01:21:58,081 --> 01:21:58,914
this money.

1330
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:03,570
Did they get to some sort of tax exemption
when they moved to Los Angeles? Um,

1331
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:05,850
that, that would have been pretty
interesting. But yeah, the bears.

1332
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,890
Is Matt going to be a difference maker?

1333
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,000
Listen, I don't think that bears
defense. Was that bad to begin with?

1334
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,650
And if you throw Kahleel backin yeah, I
think they're going to be better. I think,

1335
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,830
uh,
I think Nagy decent coach,

1336
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,070
he has a scheme that they
haven't seen before. Again,

1337
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,880
you're going against Green Bay at home,
so I'm not taking them to win.

1338
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,590
Probably not. But yeah, Chicago
can keep this a one score game.

1339
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,640
Why do we,
why isn't it naggy going to be good?

1340
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,610
Like why isn't somatically
going to be good?

1341
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:40,650
Does that automatically
going to be good Ryan?

1342
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:44,700
But I'm predicting that he learned how
to scheme up quarterbacks in the same way

1343
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:49,701
that Doug Peterson came from the Andy Re
coaching tree and went to Philadelphia

1344
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:53,670
and and took a rookie quarterback
and developed a great system for him,

1345
01:22:53,671 --> 01:22:56,880
which helped lead them ultimately
to a super bowl championship.

1346
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,080
I think the Arizona or sorry,

1347
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:06,110
I think that Nagy can help
to ski a and they have some,

1348
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:10,180
they have some play makers around him.
I think Jordan Howard, solid player.

1349
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:14,290
I think he could have a big season
Terico and may still get a few catches in

1350
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:15,850
there.
Trey Burton,

1351
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:16,600
again,

1352
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,900
it's the kind of guy you want
in a Andy Reid type system.

1353
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,190
I think all that leads to a,

1354
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:25,780
a competitive bears team and I
think the team is excited, right?

1355
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:30,490
The bears are jacked up. Listen,
Green Bay at home and prime time.

1356
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,940
It's tough to go against some shit up,
but I think seven, I think this is a game,

1357
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,970
so I'll take seven and a half. They're
trapping you with the hook, Sean,

1358
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,310
because you know what still true.
Very sure it happened.

1359
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:43,980
Mitchell [inaudible] still sucks.
Yeah, I know. Why has that changed? We,

1360
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:47,790
we did this for five months,
no football and all of,

1361
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,330
I did have John Fox.

1362
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,120
All of a sudden,
Mitch,

1363
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:55,540
I washed and playing college. Dude. He
said two full years of playing football.

1364
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:00,520
Lay the points. Give me Aaron
Rodgers in total feu mode. Come on,

1365
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:05,440
do this at 10 point game, you can see
it. So it's a possibility. I mean,

1366
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:08,680
if someone teased green bay
down from seven and a half,

1367
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,870
have minus one and a half.
That's not a bad teas.

1368
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:13,420
But I'm finishing strong
with some favorite Sean.

1369
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:18,100
Next up the jets on the early, the
stupid early Monday night football game.

1370
01:24:18,101 --> 01:24:23,000
We'll rex rex Ryan be calling this game.
No, he will not. The Jerry's Rex Ryan,

1371
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,760
I thought he was,
wasn't calling mine somewhere.

1372
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,240
The jets had to Detroit
where Matt Stafford and the
lions are minus seven minus

1373
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:34,090
two 80 on the money line
plus two 30 for the jets.

1374
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:39,600
45 is the total Shaun Stafford beats
bad teams that he does what Willy Cover?

1375
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,800
No, he will not. Wow. Save
Your Sam and the New York jets.

1376
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:51,480
I liked this jet steam, rookie
quarterback, rookie quarterback,

1377
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,000
youngest quarterback to start,

1378
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,030
but

1379
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,840
uh, younger, uh, to start like a
Monday night game or I don't know,

1380
01:24:57,841 --> 01:25:00,870
whatever the stat was. He's,
he's only 21 not 22 yet.

1381
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:05,850
The guy has composure in the pocket.
I like what I've seen at a Sam Darnold.

1382
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,620
They have skill players,

1383
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,460
right?
They have

1384
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,560
skilled players.
I think their defense is good enough.

1385
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:11,750
Tadpoles,

1386
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:15,320
Anne. Okay. Coach he is to
me is the jet Superbowl.

1387
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:19,520
I love fading them next week on
a short week with Sam Darnold,

1388
01:25:19,521 --> 01:25:23,300
but I think same. Donald makes enough
place to keep them in this game.

1389
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,960
This is tough,
Sean,

1390
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:31,850
because Detroit is the kind of team
that you would want to fade when they're

1391
01:25:31,851 --> 01:25:33,440
laying seven points.
Yes.

1392
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:38,330
It is a strangely early kick.
Will everyone be there?

1393
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:43,760
Yeah. It's Detroit, so no one has a job.
Is that what you're trying to insinuate?

1394
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,700
Oh, c'mon. Right. All right.
You make enemies not booming,

1395
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:49,700
but I think if you're going to a lions
game, you're, you're available at six,

1396
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:52,190
10:00 PM on a Monday.
Is it six 10?

1397
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,130
Aren't they eastern or maybe they're
seven 10 the right on that edge.

1398
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:59,580
I think it's seven 10 either way they're
going to be at the game or whoever's

1399
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,340
going to show up to the game. I, I like
Sam Darnold here. You saw it with Wentz.

1400
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,770
You saw it with some
other rookie quarterbacks.

1401
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:10,670
There's an early window before they kind
of hit that rookie wall before enough

1402
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:15,671
tape gets out on them were guys who can
play in the league really thrive and

1403
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:18,020
they ended up winning because
they make a bunch of crazy plays.

1404
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:21,530
He'll make some plays at this feet.
I'll kind of be playing above his head.

1405
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,450
He'll kind of crashed down to earth,

1406
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:25,880
but I could see Sam Darnold
getting out to a hot start.

1407
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:33,390
I just don't see, this is another
game where I'm just inclined to take,

1408
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:37,290
it's hard for me to to
take chalk on Monday night,

1409
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,930
but that's where I think I want to go.

1410
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:43,410
Gimme gimme Stafford and
the fighting lions. Okay.

1411
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:45,483
Staff.

1412
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:49,990
I mean, come on dude. You're
the rookie is going to get it.

1413
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,970
It's a dome road. I
just don't, I don't see,

1414
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:55,100
I don't see him being
successful right away.

1415
01:26:55,101 --> 01:26:58,580
I think there's too many stories and
too much about his inconsistencies.

1416
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,610
I know he's looked good in the pre season,

1417
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:04,580
but this is one of those like not so
fast moments. Last game of the week,

1418
01:27:04,581 --> 01:27:09,350
Sean let her rep the
awkwardly late game on on the,

1419
01:27:09,351 --> 01:27:11,810
on the east coast,
the rams,

1420
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,770
they head down to Oakland
where John Ruetten. Yeah.

1421
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:17,000
It depends which way you're looking at it.

1422
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,630
They had up to Oakland where
Oakland and Jon Gruden art,

1423
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:23,030
four and a half point
home dogs. Sean, this,

1424
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:28,031
this line opened I think in a pick to
put it in perspective and it's just been

1425
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:33,740
bet by the rams over and over and over.

1426
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,920
All Rams money.
96% Sean,

1427
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:39,410
96%

1428
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:42,363
Aye.

1429
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:46,520
We were, I mean there's no way
96% of the monies on one side.

1430
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:52,760
It's gone from pick to four and a
half. Yeah. Do you like the Raiders?

1431
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,780
Four and a half points in the
NFL is a lot. I'm just so,

1432
01:27:56,870 --> 01:28:01,370
I so much want to take,
I want to say I want to Fade Jan grid.

1433
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:05,750
If John Gruden they come out and they
look amazing and their defense plays great

1434
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:09,040
in spite of the fact of
being Natika defense and the,

1435
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:14,270
and then getting rid of Cleo Mack. I'll
eat some crow, fill me up with a big bowl,

1436
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:17,270
bull crow. But uh, I think,

1437
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:21,170
I think the rams can handle Todd Gurley
who's tackling Todd Gurley on this rams

1438
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,073
defense

1439
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,630
conference road game.

1440
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,330
The lines moved four and a half points
and I still that that's how bad this is.

1441
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:30,080
Like

1442
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:34,370
plenty of warnings as far as why
you shouldn't take this. But uh,

1443
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,140
yeah, give me the ransom
at it's four and a half.

1444
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:42,240
I just don't see it with Oakland. I
just don't see it. Koons coming in.

1445
01:28:42,241 --> 01:28:47,070
She changing the culture of firing
video coordinators who've been there for

1446
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:50,880
years and Kinda reminds me of chip Kelly.
But I don't think they,

1447
01:28:50,881 --> 01:28:54,630
I don't think he has the athletes
and we're the brain. I like,

1448
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:59,330
I like Wade Phillips and that defense
versus John Group. Right. So if the,

1449
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:02,070
the raters do win the game,
it's by them. And I just

1450
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,890
don't see how that happens.
He's already not looked smart.

1451
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:10,080
It's just he's come off
really poorly. Yeah. Sorry,

1452
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:11,360
I'm just fading,
you know.

1453
01:29:11,361 --> 01:29:16,080
I'm sorry if I want to feed him and Hugh
Jackson Week one. Although I, I would,

1454
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:19,860
I will lie. Tie Rod almost had me,
he almost had me almost sucked.

1455
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:23,370
The Iran is a time.
Yeah,

1456
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:33,210
that's right Ryan. It is time for
our lock dog and tees of course.

1457
01:29:33,211 --> 01:29:37,560
Brought to you by my book. Eat Daddy
g Kramer. I'll give you the honors

1458
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:43,240
lock. Denver. Yes. Pretty obvious.

1459
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:48,610
I grabbed this at two earlier in the
summer. Uh, I still like it a three.

1460
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,570
I think this Seattle team,
perhaps a lot of questions and not,

1461
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,470
not the pass rush you want to see
week one when you have a questionable

1462
01:29:56,471 --> 01:29:59,320
offensive line for my dog,
Sean.

1463
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:05,410
I didn't, I don't feel like I took a
lot of dogs in that actual like, oh,

1464
01:30:05,411 --> 01:30:09,760
they could win this game range and I'm
not going to give you the eagles or the

1465
01:30:09,761 --> 01:30:14,360
giants. So I'll get, I'll,

1466
01:30:14,361 --> 01:30:16,490
I'll throw the complete like this.

1467
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:21,020
This is the game and I believe we were
out in Vegas together, Sean, when the, uh,

1468
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:24,740
the saints were hosting the rams and
we were sitting near a guy who had a

1469
01:30:24,741 --> 01:30:27,280
$10,000 wager and,

1470
01:30:27,281 --> 01:30:31,740
and w on like a minus 500 bet and lost.
Yeah,

1471
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:36,710
it was pretty awesome. Not recommended
in the NFL taken minus 500 Tampa Bay.

1472
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:41,000
Wow.
Strange feeling about this one.

1473
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:46,280
Super strange feeling about this one.
Uh, and I, and I just like, I honestly,

1474
01:30:46,281 --> 01:30:47,540
I was going to throw out the giants,

1475
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,670
but you were gonna you would
give me shit for that. No,

1476
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,760
I mean if you're scared of me giving you
shit and yeah, no, no, no, no. I, I'm,

1477
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:55,470
I'm going to throw out,
I'm going to go to a cop.

1478
01:30:55,580 --> 01:31:00,580
I'm going to go big week one and give you
a four to one dog all and everyone can

1479
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:05,750
come back and stroke it. I will
say this, I will say this survival,

1480
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:10,760
like I'm not getting near, I'm not getting
near the saints and the survivor pool.

1481
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,140
I'm not teasing the saints this week.

1482
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:18,370
That came worries me and a from its
speaking of teas is Sean first up,

1483
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:23,290
bring New England down to minus 600
or two minus a half, right? Yup.

1484
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,840
Step one,
step two

1485
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:28,863
bring,

1486
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:34,570
bring Detroit down to minus one because
we know what Stafford does against bad

1487
01:31:34,571 --> 01:31:36,730
teams.
He just wins.

1488
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:42,310
Step three you bring green bay
down to one and a half. No Way.

1489
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:46,360
You, no way. This goes in here.
No Way. This goes wrong for you.

1490
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,990
It will not go wrong.
It's too too well.

1491
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,180
I feel like getting the
Detroit angle in there.

1492
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,070
I'm going to have to
sweat it to Monday and I,

1493
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:59,100
but that's my t's New England minus a
half Detroit minus one green minus one

1494
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,550
and a half. All right. I'm
on the clock. Carolina.

1495
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:07,570
My Loc so many.
I mean I love feeding the cowboys,

1496
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:11,500
but so much just the matchups
alone panthers all the way.

1497
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,190
No one's going to listen to this lock
this week because you're going against the

1498
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:17,380
cowboys. Well, I mean I,

1499
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:21,040
well that's their loss run.
I Agree Jeff.

1500
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:25,150
Just letting you know
the jets plus two 30.

1501
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,870
I think they shock the world Monday night.
Shit gets crazy in Detroit.

1502
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:32,700
Gimme the jets and save your Sam my teeth.
If you're Sam,

1503
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,560
you just love saying that.

1504
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:40,150
It is fun to say I'll take a Baltimore
down to minus two. That's good.

1505
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,960
I will take New England
down to minus a half.

1506
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,860
That's the one that's
going to fuck both and uh,

1507
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:53,290
he kicked me Washington up to
seven mm smart adjustment there.

1508
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:57,730
Shown what you see what he did.
He took it through three key numbers.

1509
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:59,950
Exactly right.
Exactly.

1510
