1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,910
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:06,270
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,820
January 20th,

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,690
2014 what's going on? How
are you? How was your week?

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,090
Did you enjoy yourself?

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,460
Did you survive the weekend and all
the big football games and all this

7
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:27,950
screaming and yelling
there? Um, I had a fucking,

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,430
I had a great weekend. I have to tell
you that first of all before, uh,

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,140
before we get going just in case
there's any concern. I am. Okay.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,470
All right. And I'm not talking about
the Patriots lose in. Oh Geez. You year,

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,620
I'm talking about the fuck
in fires in California.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,630
You know,
it's fucking hilarious.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,680
One of the greatest things that can
ever happen to you is far as you. Uh,

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,140
did I spell douche wrong for my little
notes here? Douche on southwest.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,730
I spelled the deal. Uch. Let's
see, French spelling. Um,

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,400
I'll get to that story later.

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm one of the greatest things you can
do as far as like understanding the news

18
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:18,321
a little better is when the big news
story is happening where you live and you

19
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,990
just watch how it's
fucking reported. Um, I,

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,630
I had a Gig this weekend
in, uh, in Albuquerque, New
Mexico, and, uh, you know,

21
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,900
this time of year,
the hills catch on fire.

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,640
It happens every fucking year. This
year there's a drought. So what's worse?

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,570
All right,
but this happens every fucking year.

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,860
And the way they report this shit,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,460
they never just say that
this is completely natural,

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,500
that this is the natural cycle of a,
of nature out here.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,720
Basically what happens to recap, because
I think I went through this before.

28
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,310
Basically what happens is,
um,

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,400
here in southern California,
what happens is, uh,

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,670
for like a month,
every year we get rain,

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,520
it rains like a motherfucker
that is him rain.

32
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,810
Like it pours a few days and everybody
freaks out and they can't drive because

33
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,580
it hasn't rained in like 11 months.

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,380
So all the oil and transmission and
brake fluid gets mixed in with the water.

35
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,690
And it's, it's actually, it's,

36
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,800
I would say it's like a little
bit slicker than it is back east,

37
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,530
but everybody out here acts like
they're driving in two feet of snow.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,730
It's fucking ridiculous. Um, but anyways,

39
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:39,240
what happens is all that water comes in,
then all the hills, all the mountains,

40
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,980
all that shit turns a beautiful
color green, you know,

41
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,170
and it's lush and it's
beautiful looking and all that.

42
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:50,190
And then basically the rain fucking
stops and occasionally you will get rain.

43
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,330
And then sometime around the summer,
the fucking,

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,700
um, I dunno, like August,
September, whenever the October,

45
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,020
somewhere around there that we get what's
known as the Santa Ana winds there and

46
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,710
they come in from the east and these
fucking things will like, you know,

47
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,650
if he had shutters, they blow
them shut and open. I mean,

48
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,270
they're really strong winds, especially
if we're in the hills a little bit. Um,

49
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,780
cause it's just flat land out here.

50
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:21,580
And what happens is it goes across
the Mojave desert, all right.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
And it picks up all that hot air and
it's basically like a giant hairdryer and

52
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,990
it dries out the fucking hills.

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,400
And then inevitably a fire starts and
it burns out all the brush and then it

54
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:40,570
starts a new blush and beautiful
every year. But the problem is,

55
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,770
is we've out fucked the flatlands.

56
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,470
Yeah.

57
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,050
The problem is we don't
like living near one.

58
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:54,030
Another problem is we like to have status.
I want to look down on you.

59
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:56,610
I want to be away from you.
You're fucking music's too loud.

60
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,140
I don't like to smell your food. I don't
want my kids hanging out with your kids.

61
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:03,270
So we move up into the fucking hills.
And next thing you know,

62
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,590
rich people with fucking gold bracelets
start getting eaten by Bobcat's or have

63
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,540
a scratched up by them,

64
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,540
eaten by mountain lions and
they're fucking houses burned down.

65
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,810
But it is 100% natural.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,710
And then what always ends up happening
is some fucking Douche on the east coast.

67
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,150
What it is,

68
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,060
and it's not their fault because when
they show this shit on the news, you know,

69
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,170
I was out here and I went to, I went for
a hike and I was able to see out, uh,

70
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,220
and I could see a fire out in way out
in Pasadena. And that's fucking amazing.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,660
Giant fire in this type of
shit. But whatever. It's
just, but it's like fucking,

72
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:44,240
I don't know, 30 miles away or whatever,
20 miles away. It's not a problem, but I,

73
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:49,020
I landed in Albuquerque and
they were showing the fires.

74
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,200
Um,
and the way they were talking about them,

75
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:55,560
you would've thought the entire
state was engulfed in flames.

76
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,880
I had like five people call
me to make sure I was all
right. Hey, I'm seeing this,

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,970
I'm seeing this stuff on those.
I'm just making sure,

78
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,080
like the whole fucking state is on fire.

79
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,620
Like we're all out here
without fucking garden hoses.

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,573
Um,

81
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,310
and they just completely zoom in on the
fire and that's exactly what it looks

82
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,440
like.
It literally looks like hell on earth.

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,760
It reminds me of when I lived back
east and there would be a hurricane.

84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,420
It actually was downgraded to a tropical
storm. Then it just kind of reigned.

85
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,160
Do you remember that news clip with
that woman was in the boat, you know,

86
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,250
acting like she was in four feet of
water and then those construction workers

87
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:39,970
came walking by and it was like,
it was like fucking ankle deep.

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,170
That's what they do. So, um,
I'm just letting you know,

89
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,950
California beautiful fucking
state. Uh, it's not on fire.

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,070
The fires are natural. Um,
as they are with all forests.

91
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,680
I don't, I know I'm not a fucking nature
guy. I don't know what to that level,

92
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,290
but I do.

93
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,920
It burns it all out and it causes it
to come back even more healthier every

94
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,010
fucking year. Now if you
want to be, you know,

95
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,360
a gambler and build a house in
the middle of the shit, you know,

96
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,370
there's a chance one day it might burn
down. All right. But, uh, actually,

97
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,910
you know what, I, I'm,
I'm fucking up here.

98
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:20,810
I should just roll with it and act like
the entire place is on fire and maybe

99
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,020
less people will move out here
and we can drive a little, uh,

100
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,580
we can drive a little more. But a
verse, he actually sent me a text,

101
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,060
he said he was watching the La fires
or whatever, the, the California fires.

102
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,740
And he was just saying like, uh, you
know, the usual, that's God's way as say,

103
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:41,300
and you should live up there, you know,
meanwhile, he lives in fucking New York.

104
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,660
You know what's fucked up about New York
and why people are way more polite or

105
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,180
than they give him credit for it.
When you're on the subway,

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,300
pretty much people are polite because,
um,

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,560
you're all mixed in together and you
have no idea who or what is next to you.

108
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,260
And what the fuck they
did in the last 24 hours.

109
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:06,410
Forget about the last 24 minutes.
They could have just stabbed somebody,

110
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,130
they could have somebody fucking locked
in the closet and they're fucking apart.

111
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,440
You have no fucking idea.
So generally speaking, uh,

112
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,720
you're on your best behavior when
you're on the subway, but um,

113
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,160
you know, I don't fucking know. You
know, the, they, they, they always,

114
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,210
they always just show all the worst.

115
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:27,350
It's a fucking great state and whatever
catches on fire. I mean, we have to,

116
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,860
we have something has to happen to pay
for the fact that it's 60 degrees out and

117
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:35,120
I don't have to shovel my cat
out of the fucking package spot.

118
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,420
Right. So I'll just let you
know. In case you were concerned,

119
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,940
case you would think and like, Hey, I
always wanted to move to California,

120
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:45,650
but of the entire state is engulfed in
flames once a year. That isn't true. Uh,

121
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:47,930
yes, we are having a drought. Um,

122
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,170
and I don't know if that has to do with
just the natural cycle or the fact that

123
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,560
there's over 7 billion people getting
up every day and they got to take a shit

124
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,310
and asked to go somewhere and maybe
eventually that leads to a drought.

125
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,480
I have no fucking idea,

126
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,750
but I'm just letting you know the whole
fucking state isn't on fire. All right,

127
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,260
so in the words of Martin Short,
relax your crack.

128
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,020
Um, okay. So anyways, this is the, uh,

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,830
the Monday morning podcast.
Oh. And I, I get it.

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,220
So I gotta I gotta talk about
the Douche on southwest. So, um,

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,590
I went to Albuquerque this weekend
and I had a fucking unbelievable time.

132
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,200
I have not been back there since,
uh,

133
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,660
all those wonderful episodes of
breaking bad that I got to be on.

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,590
And, um, you know, I was
going to go on a hike.

135
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,050
That's what I wanted to do. I wanted
to do that. But, uh, you know,

136
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,810
Nia had some friends out there.

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,710
We were going to go to lunch
and you know how that is,

138
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:46,670
it only take like an hour,
that's three hours,

139
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,160
you know, so I'm just like,
I'm too fucking old too.

140
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,053
Um,

141
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,290
I'm too old to fucking hike and have a
social event in one day and then actually

142
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:03,750
give any sort of a decent,
decent, uh, performance.

143
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,170
So I was like, all right, fuck it. I'm
not going to go on the hike. I'll go over.

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,470
And we met, um, I met his friends
and they were, they were awesome.

145
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,460
Fucking cooked up burgers the
middle of the day, you know,

146
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,130
those homemade burgers that are way
bigger than the ones that you get in a

147
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,830
restaurant and then you eat m and a,

148
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:24,720
you don't feel 60 Assam stomach
afterwards. Fucking phenomenal.

149
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,290
And, uh, the people's
house, we went over to,

150
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,930
they had all these beers and that
type of stuff and I stayed away.

151
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,140
I was a good boy, so I could have the
show, but I know myself at this point.

152
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,740
So I still that I see, I can't do
all of those activities in one day.

153
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,320
So I just decided like, uh, all right,

154
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,900
I'll just do the social
thing and I'll chill out.

155
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:45,570
Which was actually really cool because
I've been to Albuquerque a bunch of times

156
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:49,050
and I never got to ride around and,
uh,

157
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,700
see any of it and, uh, it's really,
really fucking cool placement.

158
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,860
Really, really cool. Um, so anyways,
so that night I was at the, uh,

159
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,690
the 66 casino,
meaning basically route 66 and,

160
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:06,150
uh, it's one of the coolest
looking casinos I've, I've seen,

161
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,480
I'll try to have some
images up for, I, you know,

162
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,300
you tried to take pictures of those casino
lights and it never comes out on your

163
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:17,010
cell phone. At least the one
that I have, the four S. Um,

164
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,610
but it was really cool, like the
hotel had like that, you know, uh,

165
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,080
the route 66 sign instead of the 66,
it just said hotel,

166
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,920
it was all lit up and then, you know, it's
native Americans own it. And then the,

167
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,830
the,
the arrows pointing in where to go.

168
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,100
We're literally like arrows
and they looked like they
were stuck into the ground.

169
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,970
They were all lit up. It was
fucking bad ass. It was bad ass.

170
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,130
And then I got to play in the name of
the theater was the legends theater.

171
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,860
I played a place called
the legends theater.

172
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,660
I remember I was doing some
press for it and they said,

173
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:57,610
what can people expect when they come down
to the legends theater? And it's like,

174
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,230
well they should expect to see a legend.

175
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,180
Okay.

176
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,720
It shouldn't expect to see me. Oh,
fresh out of the fucking horse stable.

177
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,030
Where do I go?
Is this the way to the grade road?

178
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,300
They're going to be allowed people. I'm
scared. Uh, fortunately it all went,

179
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,920
it went great and a fucking great
people out there, man. Once again,

180
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:25,060
and this was another place that was
supposed to be a stop on the uh,

181
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,950
Billy red state tour. And um, I dunno
for any comics who are listening to this,

182
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:33,910
don't buy into that horse shit
that these are fly over states.

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,890
They're beautiful places to go.

184
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,040
And the people are ridiculously
appreciative that you
showed up this site and

185
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:44,380
they always say the same shit. Can you
tell this person to tell this person?

186
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,191
You know,

187
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:48,070
they're always asking for Jim Norton
and all these guys that I know from the

188
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:51,760
opie and Anthony showed telling
them to come out there. You know,

189
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:52,990
we like comedy too,

190
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,700
so I pass the word on to them in a
lot of them have started coming out,

191
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:02,200
which is cool. Um, I just
hope that they don't become a,

192
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,310
an old jaded like when you play the
bigger cities and it just like whatever,

193
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,350
whatever man, you know, I got other
things to do, man. It was great.

194
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,210
And they actually bought a bunch of DVDs,

195
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:16,480
which is phenomenal because I got a
bunch of, I'm sitting in my garage,

196
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,960
I feel like in my garage is
filled with fucking laser discs.

197
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,890
I got to get those things
out of there. Um, anyways,

198
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,580
so, oh, the doe, Shawn southwest,
sorry, I'm all over the place today.

199
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,250
So we're flying back, um, quick
flight back. I don't want 45 minutes.

200
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,490
Fucking phenomenal. And, uh,
you know, the southwest people,

201
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,760
they always try to be funny, put a smile
on your face. Most Times they're not.

202
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,800
And this guy was actually kind of funny.

203
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:46,390
Then we go to land worth landing in Los
Angeles and this fucking asshole gets on

204
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,410
the fucking mic. It
starts going, you know,

205
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,820
he's like going welcome to Los Angeles,
which is a

206
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,473
okay,

207
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,920
interesting place.

208
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,893
Yeah.

209
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,220
Yes.
Very interesting.

210
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,630
He kept doing this weird laugh and
I'm looking at me at, first of all,

211
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:15,210
it was sounded creepy is fucking hell.
Um, I don't want to be homophobic,

212
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,510
but the guy sounded gay,
you know, the gay accent.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,230
And so I used to do a joke on this,
like gay people come from all 50 states,

214
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:26,100
yet they kind of all have the same accent,
which isn't true.

215
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:29,370
But generally speaking there is a
gay accent, which makes no sense.

216
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,800
How did the joke, that's
how that joke, just to go

217
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,880
like if you were gay from
Alabama, we were like, hey bud,

218
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,580
add row lock to suck your Dick.
Like that's the way you should sound.

219
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,060
Just do a stereotypical redneck accent
with my stereotypical gay accent.

220
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,960
All right?
But they don't,

221
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,130
I grew up in Alabama and let's
just say I'm not going back there.

222
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,680
It's probably more valid. Go. You
know what the Fuck I'm saying?

223
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:57,380
That's what the guy sounded like. So I'm
just sitting there on the back and like,

224
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,420
did, uh, you know,

225
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,250
this guy get blown in west Hollywood
and somebody stole his wallet.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,210
Did he want to be the next
Jim J uh, uh, buffets,

227
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,610
whatever the fuck the guy's name
is from too close for comfort.

228
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,290
I don't know what his fucking deal was,

229
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,490
but I'm just sitting there and my head
going yet another most fucked up thing

230
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:14,870
about living in Los Angeles.

231
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,570
I've never lived in a city
where everybody trashes it.

232
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,450
Everybody just shits on it. And
that kills me about that. Let's see.

233
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,580
This is the only fucking
city where you could do that.

234
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,830
I guess you can kind of
make like a gambling joke,

235
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:30,310
but you can actually land in Los Angeles.
Not give a fuck that everybody,

236
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:34,120
their lives on the plane for the most
part lives there and then just shit on it.

237
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,473
Um,

238
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,140
okay.

239
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,470
I can, I fucking drove me nuts. Drive
me fucking eyes was a interesting place.

240
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:42,990
That's just sick. Well,
what the fuck are you doing?

241
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:47,190
What makes you such a good person?
What happened? You here, Huh?

242
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
What Sit-com did you test for?

243
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,520
And you got to coked up the night
before and you fucking blew it. Ah,

244
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,420
what were we supposed to be on?
Will and grace.

245
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,970
I'm sorry.
In order this,

246
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm defensive of La at this point because
I have to live out here because this

247
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,280
is the fucking business on it.
I don't have to, but you know,

248
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,340
it makes life a lot fucking easier
to be where everybody else is in this

249
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:16,430
business. You know, if I
was into fucking computers,

250
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,720
I go move up to watch the
fucking, ah, the valley up there.

251
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,410
The silicone valley, which for
the life of me, I don't know what,

252
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,890
why do they call it silicone?
Isn't it? What's in fake titties?

253
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,220
Is it? I don't know. Fuck it now. Anyways,

254
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,700
let's do a little bit of advertising here.
Um,

255
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,080

a very special

256
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,390
bonus podcast this week with Jay more.
If he didn't listen to it.

257
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,780
And you always wondered what Harvey
Keitel would sound like doing bad 80.

258
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:48,200
Stand up. It's a must
list. It really is a must.

259

one person shit on it was saying how lame,

261
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,980
uh,
Jay Moore was and he called him Jay snore.

262
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,930
So literally this person is telling me
that my guest is lame and then his joke

263
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:10,280
is a pun. You know, that Kinda
Kinda kills you. Credibility.

264
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,040
Uh, I think Jay is a fucking genius, man.

265
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,580
My face actually hurt from
smiling by the end of it.

266
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,900
This is fucking ridiculous impressions.

274
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,010
I always get stuck behind the low

275
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,660
paying with all or loose change from
the car ashtray with their blue wig. Uh,

276
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:54,080
it's like she thinks exact
changes a requirement. Um,

277
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,060
I can't, why do I always try to read that?
It says I'm a patient person, but heck,

278
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,390
I came in with scruff. Now I'm
leaving with a full beard. We get it.

279
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm there for a long time.
We all know you go in there.

280
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,100
Drug stores are the absolute worst.

281
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,020
It's just a complete a cross pollination
of everybody from alcoholics and drug

282
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:16,520
addicts. I was in the cvs the
other day or the Dwayne Reed,

283
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,230
Dwayne aid,
whatever the fuck they have out here.

284
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,820
And this fucking dude came
in with just pants on.

285
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,860
That's it.
Just pants on.

286
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,090
He didn't have on any underwear because
I could see at least three quarters of

287
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,000
his ass crack hanging out of
the back of his fucking pants.

288
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,130
And he wasn't even that fat.
He had a beer belly,

289
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,560
but he's still at his see
still at his high school hips

290
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,590
or maybe he just pushed his fucking
quarter. Roy's down that far, you know.

291
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,410
So he walks out,
I walk up behind him,

292
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:50,411
he has a dollar in his hand and for some
reason he fucking bitch a glob has spit

293
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:56,190
on it and then sticks it to the
side of the, of the, uh, the cvs,

294
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,260
Duane aid read fucking thing there,
right.

295
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,920
And then walks away and within two
seconds of blue down in the ground.

296
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,841
And I was just like,
well,

297
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:06,960
I guess that's what I would do if I
didn't have a wallet. I have no idea,

298
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,810
but I don't want to look at that.

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,600
All Milky legs himself.

342
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,360
It's going to be out in Hawaii on a
Lulu who I'm doing a show out there on

343
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,730
Friday night and it's just me,

344
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:07,690
myself and I um,
I don't have an opener,

345
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,840
a just going to be me and,
uh,

346
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,300
going to be doing a whole bunch of
material cause I'm getting ready to do a

347
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,030
special this year, baby.
Getting ready to do another one.

348
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,310
I gotta be honest with you. I don't
know what I'm going to put it out on.

349
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,370
I feel like I still have to make DVDs
for people my age and on up who liked to

350
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:28,930
have the hard copy, you know, did I
mention that Nia hooked up our stereo?

351
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,790
Um, I bought her this stereo
when we first started dating.

352
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,330
It was one of the,
I think our first Christmas together.

353
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,670
That's what I got her and I
was sitting there going like,

354
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,590
I don't know if she's going to like this,
but um,

355
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,950
she seemed like sort of an
artsy nerd like me and uh,

356
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,820
I'm not really artsy, but whatever. I'm
a fucking nerd. I get into shit and um,

357
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,460
I took a shot. She absolutely
fucking flipped out. She
loved it. So she was living,

358
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:57,761
you know,

359
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:01,270
it wasn't living with me at the time
and I hooked it up and I don't know what

360
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,260
happened. I forgot how to do it. The
wires got crossed through moving,

361
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:05,531
I don't know,

362
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:09,520
a few years ago when we were still living
in an apartment was the last time I

363
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:12,100
hooked it up properly and I
don't know what was going on.

364
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,410
I couldn't figure the fucking thing
out when we moved into our house.

365
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:17,020
So it's just been sitting there and
I figure it was a few years old.

366
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:20,890
I thought it was broken.
So I go on the road and uh,

367
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,220
when I come back she had the whole thing
set up and was playing like some pink

368
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,750
Floyd and all this type of,

369
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:32,751
it was fucking awesome and emasculating
all at the same time and I'm

370
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,430
kind of, fuck, did I get into that?

371
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,070
I was just going to Hawaii
to hell was my point there.

372
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,640
I fucking know. Oh, I know.
Yeah. I was talking about
what am I going to put out my,

373
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:50,470
uh, my new album on? I have no idea.

374
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,640
Well, maybe like, you know, people
were still like DVDs. I have no idea.

375
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,370
I'm still going to burn off some.
I can tell you right now,

376
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:01,450
I'm not going to make 5,000 of them and
have 4,500 of them sitting in my fucking

377
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:06,370
garage. Like I have a second car
that doesn't go anywhere. Ah, Jesus.

378
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,850
You don't, one of my goals in
life is to have a clean garage.

379
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,900
I don't want to be that guy that has the
fucking garage that you can't even put

380
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:18,730
the car in. Um, thank God I got
my old truck sitting in there,

381
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,630
so that takes up most of it. I got to pull
you guys want to hear about my garage.

382
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,590
We'll go around the garage.

383
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,610
I got my 68 f 103 on the tree
over there and then I got the,

384
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:34,360
uh, I get up, I got pull up dip
station and then on the ground.

385
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:35,980
This is thankful pushups if you want,

386
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,940
but I still have those perfect pushups
things. I Dunno if they're perfect,

387
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:43,240
but they're fucking hard. I
can tell you that. And um,

388
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,970
then what else do I have?

389
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,550
I have a 10 or a 12 speed bike that
I bought when I was like in either,

390
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,050
I think the ninth,
ninth grade.

391
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,370
I've had it forever and I still ride
the fucking thing every once in a while.

392
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,850
Um, can anybody explain to me why? If you
don't, if you ride a bicycle every day,

393
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:08,910
it doesn't really need air in the tires,
but if you just let it sit there,

394
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:09,930
the air goes out of him.

395
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,990
Can you guys answer some
just some day to day simple

396
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,490
science questions for me
that I don't understand.

397
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,760
How come I can lay on a couch
for four hours, catatonic,

398
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,800
barely moving and I'm fine.

399
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,420
But if I fall asleep for five minutes
on the couch at my, I wake up like, Ooh,

400
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,610
it's chilly and I need a blanket.

401
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,550
I mean it's just shifting my
weight every five minutes.

402
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:40,970
Is that enough to keep my body temperature
up that I don't need a blanket?

403
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,490
It could be the middle
of the fucking summer.

404
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,050
Okay.

405
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,930
I mean, unless there's a bunch of humidity
and you don't have ac or whatever,

406
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,940
I'm just saying he could be
just perfectly comfortable.

407
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,040
It can be like God damn 72 degrees.

408
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,230
Perfect weather in your God damn
living room. Any me anyways. And if I,

409
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,320
if I fall asleep for more than five,
seven minutes,

410
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,520
I wake up on my shoulders a cold
and I got to put a blanket on.

411
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,050
I have to grab a little blanky, like
a little twinkle toes there. Um,

412
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,680
why is that?
What else?

413
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,130
Okay,

414
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:15,963
what else is there?

415
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,210
I know I have a bunch of these little
ones that I just don't understand.

416
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,170
Those are two. If someone could
explain the same thing with the car.

417
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,900
If he leave it sitting there too long,
the air goes out of the tires.

418
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,340
They become flat after a while.

419
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,620
Does the air feel not needed?
Well through goose guys call me back.

420
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,170
It goes somewhere else. I don't
know. I know I sound like a moron.

421
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:42,170
I go fuck yourself. Um, so anyways,
I'm going to be in Hawaii this weekend,

422
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,370
which I'm really excited about and I'm,

423
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm going to go to the pro bowl this year.
So look for me.

424
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,090
I'd be wearing a Robert
Williams Hawaiian shirt, um,

425
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,290
drinking some milk.

426
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:55,790
Okay.

427
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,730
And, uh, I think it's going
to be a fun game this year.

428
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,950
I liked that they choosing upsides.
I heard that they're not,

429
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,810
it's not gonna be enough seat versus AFC.

430
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,560
They're gonna choose up sides and then
they're not going to have kickoffs do I

431
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:11,460
think is good because it's such a weird,
like it's,

432
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,970
you can't play the game because
no one wants to get hurt.

433
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,100
I think they should
just play flag football.

434
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,180
They should just play flag football and
they should just make up the players

435
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,660
because you can play hockey and all
star game and hockey. You can just play,

436
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,180
you just play, you know,
basically non contact,

437
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,290
not going too hard and guys can still
entertain the crowd with the stick

438
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:36,120
handling the shots and all that type of
stuff. Same thing with basketball. Um,

439
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:37,250
you don't have to go that hard and you've,

440
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,430
everybody can watch a one 50 to one
45 game and baseball, the baseball,

441
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:44,940
all star games the best
because it actually something
and they actually come out

442
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:49,650
and play. Um, but you know,
it's a non contact sport.

443
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,140
What are you going to do?
You know,

444
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,990
unless somebody tries to beat you with
the ball or if you're talking about the

445
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:59,730
ball hitting the bat
there. Um, so anyways,

446
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,250
I want to be out there and,
uh,

447
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,710
going to be doing probably at least an
hour and a half on stage cause I got it.

448
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:09,270
Well, I got to blow it out and then
tighten it up right before. Um, my, uh,

449
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,610
my special comes out and then I'm
going to weed out the weak ones.

450
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,390
It's like making an NFL roster.
I probably got it, you know,

451
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,040
55 guys on it and I got to cut.
Was it like 10 of them? 12 of them?

452
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,280
I don't fucking know.
But a cup you guys been asking me,

453
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:31,281
still have been asking me about when
my Carnegie hall album is coming out.

454
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,210
Uh, we were in the final stages and
hopefully it's going to be out May, June.

455
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,980
It took forever. Um,
because I was dealing with,

456
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,720
uh, you know, Carnegie's
very prestigious place.

457
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:50,040
They got to make sure all the
i's dotted and the t's across,

458
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:53,850
whatever the fucking expression
is. So it's, it's been
very long and very tedious.

459
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,930
And, uh, but eventually it is
coming out and I'm going to psyched.

460
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,870
And it's only coming out on album only.
So get your Stereo's today.

461
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,770
And um, you know, and if some of
you are going to be like, well,

462
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:07,050
how come you won't pull
it out all over the stove?

463
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,620
Because there's too much overlap
in material between that.

464
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,830
And it's basically the hour I was doing
when I was leading up to recording my

465
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:17,970
last special. So I don't want to fuck
people over and put out, you know,

466
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:22,830
two d DVDs of the same fucking thing
or a CD that's the same as the DVD.

467
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,720
So I'm letting you know right
now it's like three quarters,

468
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,790
the same material.
I tell it differently every night.

469
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,410
But basically it's the same shit.

470
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:34,140
There's a couple of extra lines and maybe
some lines from the special ed isn't

471
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:34,710
in there.

472
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,770
And then there's a chunk of shit that
I didn't make this special for whatever

473
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:42,210
fucking reason.
And it's only coming out on vinyl there.

474
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,960
I've told you what the deal is,
so don't come crying to me afterwards.

475
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,640
Um, except the worst selling
job of a fucking album ever.

476
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,580
Um, all right. So what am
I talking about? All right,

477
00:28:56,581 --> 00:29:01,020
let's get down to the pro football
this week. Everybody pro football. Oh,

478
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:04,770
Jesus. Um, let's see.

479
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,540
What are we going to say are that
first game? Like I kind of went the,

480
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,810
the Patriots Broncos kind of went,

481
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:12,480
went the way that I thought
it was going to go. Uh,

482
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:15,990
I didn't think that we
were going to win and, uh,

483
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,490
congratulations to the Broncos.

484
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:22,080
They definitely were the best team
in the AFC this year. And, um,

485
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,490
um, I, uh, I dunno, I still saw
some articles out there. I mean,

486
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,540
I'm surprised at how many people who
write and talk about sports that,

487
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,950
uh, talked about, you know,

488
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,480
the disappointing end to the Patriots
season and everything. I mean,

489
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,550
I just feel like, well,
what they were working with,

490
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:42,840
that was one of the best seasons
I've seen Bellacheck Brady have. Um,

491
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,750
I never would've thought in
September where the fuck we were at.

492
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,700
I will never would've thought that we
could have, uh, gotten as far as we did.

493
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,910
And, uh, you know, so I'm
looking at it like it's success.

494
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,940
I saw some great up and coming stars on
defense and I'm looking forward to next

495
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,590
year and uh, and I'm actually psyched
at the Broncos in a way. I'm psyched.

496
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:08,230
I never like seen my team lose, but I'm
psyched that they up because you know,

497
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:12,760
Peyton manning the fucking unbelievable
offense, they got a really solid defense.

498
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,320
They should be there.
I want to see a good super bowl and um,

499
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,690
I know Bella check was complaining
about a Welker and I'm going to use air

500
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:27,010
quotes hit until leap. I didn't
think that it was a, I mean,

501
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:30,310
I don't know the game the way he does,
but I didn't look dirty to me at all.

502
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
If anything looked like he got the worst
of the hit initially it looked like he

503
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:38,230
was trying to get out of the way. Um,
I've never known Welker to do anything.

504
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:39,610
He never did any of that dirty shit.

505
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,510
He's a little fell out there
with a giant football helmet.

506
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:48,511
Now was he wearing like an anti
concussion for the rest of my life helmet.

507
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:51,790
Did anybody else notice that his helmet
was like a third bigger than it usually

508
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,250
heads.
He looked like he looked like,

509
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,220
is it Kazoo in the Flintstones?
His head look,

510
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,180
look at his helmet was fucking eating
his head. It was like, oh look at,

511
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,830
look at, look at Wes Welker way
in there and that helmet. Um,

512
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,350
but anyways, the uh, oh the
Broncos look really, really,

513
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:18,310
really strong yesterday and I ain't know
this was a tough year for me to watch

514
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,370
football cause I got married and then
I also spent three weeks in Europe,

515
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,380
so I don't even know guys fucking name.

516
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,910
All I can tell you is that 88
net 80 fucking killed us. Uh,

517
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,280
especially at fucking 88
like, and I swear to God, like

518
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,980
guide for catches like a hundred
yards within like a quarter it seemed.

519
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,870
I just remember by the time
he caught that fourth one,

520
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm literally sitting there on the
couch going, I think in a fucking cover.

521
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,890
That guy, is it? Is it still a
mystery? What the fuck is going on?

522
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,380
Ada?
Right.

523
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,020
I'm hanging in there rooting for the
team and all that type of shit. Oh,

524
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:56,420
you know what? You know, it's
funny was I was on the, uh,

525
00:31:56,421 --> 00:32:00,380
the southwest flight with the dose
trash in La when the game started.

526
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:05,210
And I taped the game. I DDI
audit, I had my phone off,

527
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,050
I put my headphones on in the airport,
pulled my hat down, walk by all the bars,

528
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,280
didn't look at anything,

529
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,820
had the music cranked when I was sitting
at the little turnstile waiting for my

530
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:16,520
bag.
And I somehow I was able,

531
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:19,070
with all the technology
and all the streaming shit,

532
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:23,960
I was able to get home and having no idea
who was doing what, ran into the house,

533
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:27,200
sat down and I was able to put it on.
And um,

534
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,230
and it was great because I got to fast
forward through all the commercials.

535
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,080
I got to fast forward through halftime
and I got to watch this, this, you know,

536
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,260
this game. Everybody wasn't
a great game. I mean, uh,

537
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,840
the Broncos really dominated even
though we were in it somehow in the end,

538
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:52,010
I'll get back to that
later. Um, but anyways,

539
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,140
so congratulations to the Broncos and
all that shit and uh, good for pigment.

540
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,960
Cause you know, I read something
where he was, you know,

541
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:00,350
it was neck was all fucked up. He didn't
know if he was going to play again.

542
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:05,150
So He seems to really psyched, obviously
to be back. So good on him. Um,

543
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:10,040
and then onto, um, Seattle 49 is,

544
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,580
which I felt was the super bowl and
I'm kind of still feel that way.

545
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:21,170
I felt like whoever won that game
was going to be a, I just, you know,

546
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,570
it's just the ebb and
flow of the conferences.

547
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,550
There's always one conference
that is stronger and um,

548
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,590
I dunno, it was a fucking heavyweight
battle man. Just a great game.

549
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,570
And fortunately there was only
a couple of those soccer mom,

550
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:44,130
um, um, bullshit fucking
calls like that, that,

551
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:48,920
that one that they called in the first
quarter had me up off the couch. Um,

552
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,140
that unnecessary roughness where it was,
uh, it was against the 40 niners and me,

553
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:59,090
it was just a textbook
lead with your shoulder.

554
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,950
Wasn't helmet to helmet and Troy Aikman
goes, well he does launch himself.

555
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:07,880
It's like Troy, he has, how else
do you tackle? You supposed to eat,

556
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,830
you got to launch yourself at the target.

557
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,900
I that was one of the worst fucking
calls and I think eventually they said it

558
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:18,690
was a bad call. It was perfect. But the,

559
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:20,300
those are those fucking calls man,

560
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:24,680
that I think that's yet another reason
why all of Dan Marino's records are

561
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:29,330
falling because that should
have been the end of the drive.

562
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,130
Um, I think it was third down, I don't
remember. But, but generally speaking,

563
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,270
it ends a drive,

564
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,320
an incomplete pass and then they
call unnecessary reference roughness.

565
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:43,310
It keeps the drive going and then the
quarterback gets to continue throwing the

566
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:48,080
ball down the field, adding
more yards to their resume. Um,

567
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:51,500
in this era, when you can't really
cover receiver past five yards,

568
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,590
you can't even look at them or you
get a fucking flag. Fortunately,

569
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,490
there was only a couple of those calls.
Um,

570
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,730
and obviously there's going
to be a rule change with, um,

571
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,940
I really should know the names
of these guys. I just don't,

572
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:08,590
this year I've just been fucking
traveling so much. But, uh, uh,

573
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,870
the guy in the 40 niners this is so
disrespectful cause he gave up his goddamn

574
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,180
need to make the play.
He recovered the fumble he was,

575
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,310
he was touched by a Seattle player.
It should have been our turnover,

576
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:22,070
but fortunately it was justice where they,
uh,

577
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,920
Seattle turned over the
ball a couple of days later.

578
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:29,870
So what they really just got fucked out
of about 30 seconds on the clock. But, um,

579
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,820
I dunno, it was just an awesome,
awesome, awesome fucking game. And,

580
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:38,520
um, I dunno. I, I think

581
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,850
in the end I just think
Kaepernick is inexperience.

582
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,953
MMM.

583
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,300
Kind of caught up with them a little bit.

584
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,540
Just some of the decisions that he made,
but,

585
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,560
but that guy is the real deal and
he's not afraid of the moment.

586
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:59,160
So I just think that
unfortunately for 40 niners fans,

587
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:00,900
they're going to have to
wait at least another year.

588
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:04,880
But I think that that guy's got, he
definitely has what it takes, man. Um,

589
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,930
he's definitely a winner and that
type of thing. So it was just,

590
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,480
it was a great fucking game. And, um,

591
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,580
so now we're into the super bowl.
Now we're into the chauffeur bowl.

592
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:19,230
So now you have to wonder. You got
to wonder, right? If you like me,

593
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,370
um, all I want to do is see the fucking
game. I don't want to listen to the,

594
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:29,490
the pregame and postgame analysis.
You know,

595
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,220
there's always one person
that's going to make, you know,

596
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:37,020
all the quotes and all that type of
shit and Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, Yadda,

597
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:39,140
Yadda, Yadda. So this is what I do. This,

598
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:41,490
this is all you gotta do if you
just want to watch the fucking game.

599
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,720
MMM.

600
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,080
I would,
um,

601
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,060
just put it on the NHL Network for the
next two weeks is basically what you want

602
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:54,430
it to
get into NHL hockey.

603
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,720
You won't have to watch any of the
fucking analysis where they're going to go

604
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:00,400
the entire roller coaster.

605
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,983
MMM.

606
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:03,590
I don't know.

607
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,190
It's just lazy journalism and whoever
talks Shit and that type of thing,

608
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,540
they're going to get it 100% of the
fucking attention. And it's just gonna.

609
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:16,130
It's just, it's absolutely
fucking nauseatingly. Like,

610
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,200
um, yesterday, you know,
at the end of the game,

611
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,480
the Seattle, uh, 40 niners game,

612
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,510
I felt like a Tommy Lee
Jones and no country for old
men where it just sorta has

613
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:31,990
passed you by and you can't even
make sense of it anymore. Um,

614
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,530
I gotta tell you, I
talked about this on, um,

615
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,840
on forest Shaw's and Al Jackson's
podcasts. What the fuck is it called?

616
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,240
Jesus Christ. I'm so old. I
can't remember anything anymore.

617
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,263
MMM.

618
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,250
Whatever. Just Google that and you'll
find it. I talked about that. That shit.

619
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:50,630
Now everybody,

620
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,320
whether you catch a four yard pass or
you hit a layup and you get filed and it

621
00:37:56,571 --> 00:38:00,860
goes in like all these athletes,
now they've got to do that stupid fucking,

622
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,920
they do that. Yell like they're in
300. Like they just slayed a dragon.

623
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,640
He had a fucking lay up ticky tack foul
and one even Paul was Saul does it now.

624
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,700
What is that?

625
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,090
Okay,

626
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:22,440
did it? It's fucking the stupidest.
Did Jerry Rice ever do that?

627
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,630
Did Jordan ever fucking do that?

628
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,823
You know,

629
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,380
it's fucking hilarious. I
saw, who was it yesterday?

630
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,880
Was it golden Tate is a great fucking
receiver. Critical moment in the game.

631
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,420
They need a first down and catches
the ball. He has first down yardage,

632
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,030
I dunno if he didn't know
where he was in the field,

633
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,430
but rather than just dropping to
the ground, he cuts back inside.

634
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:53,410
Now he's behind the first down line and
then as to fight like hell to get across.

635
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:55,000
So he basically makes the play,

636
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,730
fucks it up and is able to
recover and then he gets up, ah,

637
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,500
screaming like he's God's gift.

638
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,480
I gotta tell you this right now,
this is why Marshawn Lynch is,

639
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,540
might be my favorite player,

640
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,720
favorite athlete out there because the
fact that he's doing what he's doing

641
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:21,200
every week and I guess he, my
buddy was telling me, he just said,

642
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:24,290
I'm not talking to the media this year
and get fined 50 grand and he didn't give

643
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:29,090
a fuck you all he wants to do is when
the God damn game like that guy and that

644
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:33,200
guy just runs over people and gets up,

645
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:35,660
basically gets, I'm going to say
it doesn't celebrate a touchdown,

646
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:39,590
but he just gets up and walks back
to the huddle. I love that shit.

647
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,680
And as much as they're
going to talk about,

648
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,580
um Oh,
what's his face there for running is Yap.

649
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,780
I have to tell you,

650
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,190
a cornerback is not going to
win the Superbowl for you.

651
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,990
He can shut down that part of the field,

652
00:39:55,991 --> 00:40:00,520
but what can I think what's going to
be the difference in the super bowl is

653
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,354
going to be,

654
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,390
I think it's going to be Marshawn lynch
because I think Seattle has a better

655
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:11,410
defense, but the Broncos have
also have a really strong defense.

656
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:16,670
So, um, I give the nod to Seattle there,

657
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:21,050
but it's not this such a giant gap
that the game is over. All right?

658
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:25,520
And then when you go to the
quarterback position, obviously, um,

659
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,550
you got Peyton Manning,
okay.

660
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,040
And Seattle's best weapon against
Peyton manning is not their defense.

661
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,550
It's actually Marshawn
lynch. Okay. Peyton Manning,

662
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,740
the way he's playing this year,
playing that guy. It's basically,

663
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:46,970
it would be like if you owned
a poisonous snake, all right?

664
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,550
And you got to take it out of the tank
to fucking clean the God damn tank.

665
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,920
And no matter how careful you are,

666
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,650
eventually you're going
to get bit by that fucker.

667
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,300
The only way not to get bit by that
fucker's to keep the son of a bitch in the

668
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:07,160
tank. And the best way to do that
is with a great running game. Okay.

669
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,560
And I've seen this before in past,
in,

670
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,310
in a championship games where you have
this unstoppable quarterback and the

671
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,670
guy's sitting on the fucking bench.
He's not even sweating.

672
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:24,671
He's been there so fucking long because
the other team is just running the ball.

673
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,800
And my big knock against the Broncos,

674
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,960
despite the fact that they are a great
team, is that they don't put people away.

675
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,100
They had both against San
Diego and the Patriots, they,

676
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:41,060
for the most part dominated the game.
But at the end of the fucking game,

677
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,560
they let, they let the chargers hang
around. They even let us hang around.

678
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,030
Like if we made that two point conversion,
that onside kick, if we get it,

679
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,480
we can actually drive down the
field and somehow could tie it.

680
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,370
Like that's the situation they were in
after absolutely dominating the game with

681
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:01,070
like four minutes to go, whatever.
They were still in that situation.

682
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:05,380
And I don't know, I think that
eventually bite you in the ass. So, um,

683
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,290
I dunno,
I just think that it's going to be a,

684
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,720
I think Marshawn lynch is going to be
the difference if they are going to,

685
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,020
and obviously their offensive line,

686
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,470
but they only need to open
this the smallest of hole.

687
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,080
And that guy is just,
I don't know, it's the,

688
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:28,430
he's like this devastating combination
of like Earl Campbell and like Walter

689
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,510
Payton. I mean, he's fucking
unbelievable. And um, and with that,

690
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,410
so what you're going to be now is you're
going to be inundated with people, uh,

691
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,160
you know, talking about,
uh, what's his face there?

692
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,260
Uh,

693
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,340
Shannon Sharpe Sharman they're going to
be talking about this guy up and down,

694
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:49,770
up and down, the brash, outspoken.

695
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,920
They'll go all the one once they've
exhausted that, and then there'll be like,

696
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,120
is it blood? Is it an inferiority complex?
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue,

697
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:59,130
blue.
And then they'll get tired of doing that.

698
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,070
And then we'll talk about his upbringing
and they'll say whether his father was

699
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:05,600
there, whether it was father
wasn't there and Yada, Yada,

700
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,840
all that fucking horse shit.

701
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:11,870
So what I do for the two weeks in
between is I just watch hockey.

702
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,340
All right,
this is how you do it.

703
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,350
It just fucking watch you watch hockey
or whatever. Go work out for two weeks,

704
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:21,840
get yourself in great shape because
you know you're going to eat like shit

705
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,230
during the Superbowl and just
don't put it on sports center.

706
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,920
Just don't watch the shit unless
you're into it. I'm, I'm not into it.

707
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,150
I think if you're one of those people who
watches the game with the Jersey on at

708
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:39,320
home and you put eyeliner under your
eyes and you yell things like all day,

709
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,190
all day at your TV, I think you actually
want to watch the super bowl coverage.

710
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,070
But uh,
if you're a fucking regular fan,

711
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:52,290
which I actually came to a piece here
with Seattle fans because I was looking at

712
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:56,900
Seattle fans, the way people look at
like the fires out here in California,

713
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,590
it wasn't fair hours looking at them
because they weren't showing the diehards.

714
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,210
They were showing the jerk offs.

715
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,500
Like did you see that guy in the lime
green pimp suit? You know what I mean?

716
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,770
Where the fuck is that Guy
Ben, you know, come on.

717
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,820
Who does that?
What kind of a real fucking fan does that?

718
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,030
You just go to the Goddamn game.
You Watch the fucking game,

719
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,420
you put a little money on it, it
drinks a fucking beers, whatever,

720
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:25,410
crack jokes or whatever and you
watch the fucking game. So anyways,

721
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,000
um, so this is our wash
again. Basically I, I don't,

722
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,060
I watch NHL hockey and then this year
I'm not going to a Superbowl party.

723
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,660
I'm going to be at home.
And uh,

724
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,520
what I love doing,

725
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:46,550
I told you guys this last year is you
start the game like 90 minutes after it

726
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,250
started.
Just wait like an hour and a half.

727
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,250
I have a couple people over
who really liked football.

728
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:56,520
You have a couple of beers, you shoot
the shit, blah blah, blah, blah, blah.

729
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:59,340
He got the grill going and all that type
of thing and about an hour and a half

730
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:03,300
in, you fast forward through all
of the crap in the beginning,

731
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,000
which I think is going to be the chili
peppers. I actually liked the two music,

732
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,470
Bruno Mars and a music acts, a, a Bruno
Mars and the Chili peppers. But I, I'm,

733
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,020
I'm there to watch the game,
you know what I mean?

734
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,060
If I went to see either one of those
bands play in like halfway through it,

735
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,220
they played a little bit of touch
football in the middle of it,

736
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,770
that would also be annoying.
Um,

737
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,390
so you fast forward through all of that
crap and then the person, you know,

738
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,090
trying to make a record career artist,
a singing the national anthem,

739
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,640
you fast forward through all of that
fucking shit and now you're into the game

740
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,900
and you can fast forward through all the
stupid fucking commercials and he just

741
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:37,734
watched the game.

742
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:43,320
And then you get to fast forward through
all of the halftime and then basically

743
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:46,860
you catch up somewhere in
like the third quarter. Um,

744
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,460
at which point the game is really
starting to get tense because you know,

745
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:55,170
a championship is on the line.
That's basically how I do it. Um, if,

746
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:00,210
if you, uh, if you like me, if
you're the Tommy Lee Jones of,

747
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,103
uh,

748
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,800
of sports fans at this point and you can't
even remotely relate to what happened

749
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:08,490
at the end of the game yesterday,

750
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:14,270
like why you would do that and how it
was actually mildly depressing like is

751
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:17,730
that's going to be the new
thing that you have to do. Um,

752
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,880
I dunno. I don't fucking know.
I just hope that that uh,

753
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,200
I hope that that's just a
unique personality and that
everybody doesn't start

754
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:31,620
doing that because uh, I
dunno, you play sports,

755
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,500
you fucking try to kick the shit out of
the guy and in the end you just go, hey,

756
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:39,120
good game. That's what you do.
Nobody choked in that game yesterday.

757
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:43,770
That was a fucking great game and I just
felt like that whole, all of that crap,

758
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,880
it just took away from my era.

759
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,930
I watched a great game and how I got
to sit there and listen to all these

760
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,370
fucking lazy journalists who all gonna
like moths to a fucking light are all

761
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:57,480
going to go up to that
complete non fucking story.

762
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,940
Just a non fucking story
anyways. Um, what that,

763
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,080
what that let's get to more, uh, let's
get some more advertising. Oh, by the way,

764
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:10,470
Seattle, you know, you might
finally have some to chair about.

765
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,360
You guys are one fucking game away.
And if you guys win,

766
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:19,470
I hope you understand how ridiculous
that loudest crowd thing was. All right.

767
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,080
And retiring your jersey,

768
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,920
you're retiring, you're fucking
come on. Real football fans in.

769
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,310
Come on.
They retired your number.

770
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,440
I mean, are you guys all dying out
there and there was some sort of,

771
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:39,750
make a wish thing that they had
to do for you? I mean, I just,

772
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:44,640
I can't get past that. And the fact that
the team's never won a championship,

773
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,410
what do they say it? I don't, I don't,
I don't understand it. So hopefully,

774
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,390
you know, either way it's going to be a,
it's going to be a great thing to see. Um,

775
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,340
either see Peyton manning when,
one, when another one, uh, which,

776
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,810
you know, Ryan's me when John Elway,
he also played for the Broncos.

777
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,430
Maybe that's a little storyline
they could run with. And,

778
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,360
and then the other thing is
Seattle, finally Wednesday, uh,

779
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,500
filing wins the super bowl gets the
monkey off their back. Either way,

780
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,500
it's going to be a, it's going
to be a good thing. And a,

781
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:20,610
I will definitely have be fast forwarding
through commercials and I will not be

782
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:24,930
watching any post game or any of
that fucking crap mute button.

783
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,250
We'll be right at the fingertips.
Oh,

784
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:32,070
Billy Lee Jones. I'm
trying to, I'm trying to,

785
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,240
what I'm trying to do is through modern
technology still make it seem like what

786
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:39,630
it was like when I watched the
Superbowl in the late seventies,

787
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:43,290
early eighties where it was
just the fucking game. Uh,

788
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,420
you know, uh, I just sound like a grumpy
old man. You know what, I'm, you're right.

789
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,670
I am. I, yeah, but we're either
way, congratulations to a,

790
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,670
the Broncos in the Seahawks.
It's uh, you know, this is the,

791
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,100
I liked it. There's no real
underdog. You've got to, to,

792
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,720
to really kind of the best teams. Although
I really felt the 40 niners are also,

793
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,780
eh, they should have been there too. Um,

794
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,650
so I felt NFC was the Superbowl, but
whatever, it's still going to be.

795
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,850
Hopefully it's going to be an
awesome fucking game. And uh,

796
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,703
you know,

797
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,000
there'll be nobody wigging out either
at the end of the fucking game.

798
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,740
I literally thought that dude
was going to start crying.

799
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:31,150
Um,
it's fucking uncomfortable.

800
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,170
Uncomfortable is health.

801
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,590
That was like seeing the nerd
finally beat up the bully. You know,

802
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:42,810
when you're finally ball up your fist,
you punch and you win the fight. You,

803
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,200
you're almost crying. It
was just, I don't know.

804
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,730
I don't fucking know. I don't know
what, what has happened to sports?

805
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,520
Can we a ESPN, can we,
you know, 100% access?

806
00:49:57,521 --> 00:50:00,730
Can you dial it back down
to like maybe 40% access?

807
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:06,340
Can you stop interviewing fucking coaches,
Fox and whatever.

808
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:10,510
NBC as a jogging off the field trying
to think of their halftime adjustments.

809
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:15,160
Can we just stop fucking doing
that? I don't give a fuck. Nhl.

810
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:19,580
Can we stop interviewing players
in between the fucking, uh,

811
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,673
periods?

812
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,910
Is this sitting there still out of breath
from their last shift and that fucking

813
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:28,010
drop a fucking sweat hanging
off their nose looking like,

814
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,760
not that they have to keep wiping
and then it comes back again.

815
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:36,590
Can we just enough? I don't give a fuck
what happened in that first period.

816
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:38,960
I just watched the first
period. I know. What happened.

817
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,970
What do you think you have to do in the
second period? Oh baby score. More goals.

818
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,210
Vinnie. Nhl players listening to this. Uh,

819
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,900
I'll give you a free podcast tee shirt
even though you're going to get fined

820
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:54,310
probably a hundred grand by the league.

821
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:57,430
Is there any way you could wipe your
nose and the blouse of the person who's

822
00:50:57,431 --> 00:51:01,960
interviewing you in between periods?
Just reach out and grab that tie.

823
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,010
Just Dab your eyes. You know,
I got nothing to give you a,

824
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:08,290
you're a millionaire athlete,
but could you just do it for the,

825
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,480
just for the fucking ridiculousness of it?

826
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,173
Yeah.

827
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,160
Like they're not going to interview
you after the fucking game.

828
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:16,240
Like I have to have it.

829
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,810
They got that fucking guy who stands
down there and what it looks like the

830
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:22,060
penalty box in between
the fucking benches,

831
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,400
whatever the fuck his name is,
prince fielder, the hell's his name.

832
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,770
Prince Harry standing down there. Well
it's really that ate up down area ice.

833
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,540
Like why do I need to hear that guy?

834
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:36,580
Okay.

835
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,280
Poor bastards got to stand up for three
periods and his loafers probably got

836
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,080
hammer toes by the end of the year.
Less access.

837
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,000
Do you think you could do that?

838
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:49,210
Do you think he could actually start a
sports network that could compete with

839
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:52,030
ESPN and the whole thing is less access.

840
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,293
Yeah.

841
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,980
No miked up players. You just fucking, uh,

842
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,230
just trim the fat.

843
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,770
Can I just go back to watching Bob Lobell
at the end of the news and just seeing

844
00:52:05,771 --> 00:52:06,940
five minutes of the shit?

there in a fucking blazer?

a day off in me. Comes in. Bob Knew Maya.

com Promo Code Bill. Okay.

889
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,230
I really upped my out
reading out loud game.

890
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,210
I don't give a fuck if you
guys still think I stink.

891
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,750
I'm not as bad as I used to be. How about
that? All right, where are we right now?

892
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:58,751
54 minutes and we haven't even added
so much to talk about this week.

893
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:01,910
We haven't even started
doing any of the reads. Um,

894
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:06,080
I did get a chance to watch a couple, uh,
about 10 minutes of the second period.

895
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:10,200
My flight yesterday was during the
Bruins Black Hawks game. And, uh,

896
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,490
I loved that the Black Hawks beat the
ducks and there's still the team to beat.

897
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,530
I really loved that franchise.
Did there,

898
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,340
they're doing it the right fucking
way. They really are. And um,

899
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,440
I don't know who's
going to knock them off,

900
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,210
but I gotta tell you if you
want to get into hockey,

901
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,900
I would definitely suggest watching the
playoffs when they come up out west with

902
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,250
Black Hawks, the ducks, the
Kings, the sharks, at some point,

903
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,300
are they going to push through?
I mean,

904
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:42,510
they just really got a lot of great teams
out there. Uh, they play great hockey.

905
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:47,990
Who'd ever thought that in
hockey going through Anaheim,

906
00:55:48,271 --> 00:55:52,710
Los Angeles and San Jose would be a
brutal road trip. It's fucking unreal.

907
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,690
It's a great thing. Anyways,
um, enough with the movies, uh,

908
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,920
big bad bill is sweet William now. Okay.
Hiccups, some criticism for the week.

909
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:03,550
I like this.

910
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,150
I like having the occasional criticism
you guys can start sending in your

911
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:11,250
criticisms of the week. Uh,
just put that in the, uh,

912
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:15,700
the subject line like she is. Okay. Bill
of all your comedic and podcast talents,

913
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:20,710
of which there are many. Look what
he's doing. He sent me up, oh,

914
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,690
he's patting me on the head.
He goes of all your Yadda,

915
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,480
Yadda Yadda towns and all that shit.
Movie reviews is not one of them.

916
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,770
Do I do movie reviews? I don't think
I do. He goes to beat, to be blunt.

917
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,700
You suck at reviewing movies when
you say things like, you know,

918
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:40,630
the one guy who was in that other
one where they did that thing.

919
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,900
You sound like Tony Soprano talking on
a compromised phone line and one was the

920
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:50,290
last time when every movie
you saw wasn't great.

921
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,810
The only moderately intelligent thing I
heard you say regarding movies was last

922
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,680
summer when you went off on the
whole PG 13 Zombie movie trend,

923
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,570
which of course was spot on.

924
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,380
It's entirely ridiculous to have a
Zombie flick that isn't rated r at the

925
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:13,360
minimum. They should all probably be NC
17. Well, you know what's funny, sir,

926
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,660
Mr Criticism was I was actually wrong.

927
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,100
Yeah,

928
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,720
I already forget the name of the movie.

929
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,520
That movie Mars Volta
the fuck was it called

930
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,490
bread a world war z.

931
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,850
How the fuck did I get Mars
volt with bars? Is there it is.

932
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,810
That was the Z in there. I have a
learning disability. You asshole.

933
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,100
And I was wrong about that.

934
00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:45,101
What was what actually made World War
z great was the fact that it was PG 13.

935
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:49,670
So then we're relying on Gore and
shock and three d and All that crap.

936
00:57:49,671 --> 00:57:51,650
They couldn't,
they actually had to build suspense.

937
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,890
And that's what's missing out
of a lot of fucking up the, uh,

938
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,190
the big time summer movies say go.
How's that critique?

939
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,940
How does that grab you are
actually fucking wrong about
that world board sees a

940
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:04,730
great fucking movie. Great. I loved it.

941
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,630
Two thumbs up to freckled thumbs
right up your fucking ass. All right,

942
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:10,760
let's finish this critique.
Here he goes,

943
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:12,740
but when talking about individual movies,

944
00:58:12,741 --> 00:58:17,360
you might want to consider not
doing that. Now, Jesus Christ,

945
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,140
you might want to consider having
some sort of original criticism.

946
00:58:21,141 --> 00:58:26,000
Instead of speaking in sound bites,
you might want to consider not doing that.

947
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,880
Um, he goes or maybe get one of
your comedy in quotes and quotes,

948
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,450
friends to guest review movies for you.
Oh, you don't think my friends are funny?

949
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:40,010
You don't think that I know people who
are funny. Is that what you're saying?

950
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:40,611
So what do you do?

951
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:45,250
Who are you shitting on here with
your little hipster air quotes? Uh,

952
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,520
he then goes on to sake.

953
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:51,500
I'm sure you have one or 20 that would
desperately be grateful for the exposure.

954
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,640
Look at that. Look at that. See
that now he's making fun of a,

955
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,200
the desperation of being in show business.

956
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,290
This is all kinds of just left
some little, little pitter.
Pat Wright's, you know,

957
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,270
little flyweight here, work in the body.
He goes, just trying to be helpful.

958
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,700
Anyways,
you will probably continue to do this,

959
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:11,300
but I hope from now on you will have a
little voice in your head telling you

960
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:15,260
it's a bad idea. There's his ego
wanting to help that, you know,

961
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,470
he affects my reads in the future or
whatever the fuck it is that I'm doing.

962
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,340
He'd go, that would be enough for me.
Even if you don't this on the podcast,

963
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,690
ps Bella check in is cheaters are no
different than all those roid pumping home

964
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:30,890
run record holders. All right.
Sounds like a colts fan. Um,

965
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,060
anyways. Uh, sir. I don't review movies.

966
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,040
I don't review movies. And when I watched
them, I can't remember who's in him.

967
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:43,340
I can't remember the names of people. I
can't, it's, it's, you know what it is?

968
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:47,780
It's part of getting old and you have
other shit to do with your life. You know,

969
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:51,620
I'm sure you still have a fucking,
uh, Orson Welles poster on your wall.

970
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:55,550
Whoever's the young hottie
today, Ryan Gosling, right?

971
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,610
I'm sure you have one of those up on
your wall and this is like a big part of

972
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:01,920
your fucking life. But it isn't a big
part of my life. It isn't. All right.

973
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,310
I only have so much time. I have too many
fucking hobbies. I can't remember that.

974
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,020
I can't remember the names of restaurants,

975
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,050
all the restaurants that we have
out here, I just, they're just,

976
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:14,600
I just have nicknames for him.
I don't know why.

977
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,010
Okay.

978
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:20,060
You know, maybe I talk on a cell
phone too much, but, uh, you know,

979
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:22,391
it was funny,

980
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:25,840
one of my favorite movies of all time
is no country for old men that already,

981
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:29,050
I can't remember if I even said this
already. No country for old men.

982
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,290
I just watched it again last night and I,

983
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,300
I always forget if it's
old man or old man.

984
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,190
I think I already said that
in this podcast at night.

985
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:37,600
Okay.

986
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,050
Did I, I don't fucking know. Um,
anyways. Well, whatever's sir,

987
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,810
you will be in my head every time.
I say it now,

988
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:47,110
but it's going to be in a good way knowing
that I'm annoying the shit out of you.

989
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,760
Um, and in the future, um,

990
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,500
if you ever want a comedian
to stop doing something, uh,

991
01:00:56,501 --> 01:01:00,520
one of the best things you could do is
not let them know that what they're doing

992
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:01,354
annoys you.

993
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,320
Because that's one of my favorite
things to do is to annoy the shit out of

994
01:01:05,321 --> 01:01:07,900
people. So a, there you go.

995
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:12,730
My movie reviews will continue and
I will be thinking about you sir.

996
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:16,950
Every time I do them,
um,

997
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,840
you might want to think
about not doing that.

998
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,040
Ah, Jesus Christ. Hey guys, how
about more Chivonne tee shirts?

999
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:31,660
They're all hilarious.
So she's come to Greece.

1000
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,010
A bill. If you ever come in, I can't
even, I didn't know what that is.

1001
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,530
FESA long eeky Greece.

1002
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:44,320
There will be a house waiting for
you. Huge Fan was, isn't that nice?

1003
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:47,830
Isn't that nice? Well,
I hope someday I get to,

1004
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:49,600
I would love to do standup and grace.

1005
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,240
Go over there and make a
couple hundred bucks, you know,

1006
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,430
go out there and look at some ruins and
some fucking Greek women. I'm up for it.

1007
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,480
Um, all right. Do those,

1008
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:06,481
those Chivonne t shirts or this
generation's I'm with stupid t shirts.

1009
01:02:06,551 --> 01:02:10,950
Jesus Christ.
Unfucking believable.

1010
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,110
I think I've seen every Chivonne

1011
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,470
okay.

1012
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:15,520
What does it carry on?

1013
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:20,070
Is that what it was relaxing
and that's what it is.

1014
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:22,530
Relax in.
I don't even know what the fuck they say.

1015
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,090
Okay.

1016
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,000
I just keep seeing people
with them and I just,

1017
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:28,850
it just always blows my mind like
how do you still think that's funny

1018
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,860
or just a funny tee shirt in general.

1019
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:36,350
I just love how it's like
the joke that doesn't leave.

1020
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:41,620
Like somebody reads it and it's funny
and then they laugh and then then you

1021
01:02:42,621 --> 01:02:44,780
still standing there with
the joker and your tee shirt.

1022
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,180
Do you guys remember how
they used to end that?

1023
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:52,420
That show police squad or they used to
make fun of when they would do the free

1024
01:02:52,421 --> 01:02:54,500
for freeze frames like on chips.

1025
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:55,760
Okay.

1026
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,481
When ships used to,

1027
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,630
and somebody would always make a joke
and then they'd start laughing and then

1028
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:02,860
they'd freeze it and then they'd show
some credits and then they'd had the,

1029
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,650
the footage move a little more than
somebody else would do something else that

1030
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:07,640
would make everybody laugh
and then they'd freeze that.

1031
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,490
They kind of made fun of that except
they weren't freezing the frame and they

1032
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:13,200
were just standing there.
That's basically what those t shirts are.

1033
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,770
It's the police squad ending version
of a tee shirt, right? Jesus.

1034
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:23,150
That was a long way to go. I
need a glass of water. All right.

1035
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:27,290
Response to college, kid
dealing with rumors. Hey Billy,

1036
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:30,080
but fuck Jesus Christ.

1037
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:35,930
Can we be nicer in 2014
he said, I'm having some,

1038
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,560
I have some advice for the kid who was
dealing with the rumor of him getting a

1039
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:42,680
younger girl drunk and fucking
her in the elevator. All right,

1040
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:45,290
so obviously you're assuming
that this dude was innocent.

1041
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,450
How can I get out of the abyss of
these sexual sex crime? Questions here,

1042
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,620
but potential sex crimes.
Um, all right, here we go.

1043
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:59,621
I'm a recent college Grad who had to
deal with tons of rumors being made about

1044
01:03:59,691 --> 01:04:03,590
me. I was in a fraternity. That's
a red flag. I partied a lot.

1045
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:08,450
Red Flag number two throughout my college
career. Career key comes from money.

1046
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,290
Red Flag number three. Um, and fuck,

1047
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:16,790
you don't think I'm just some typical Frat
Douche bag. You don't know my life. Ah,

1048
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:21,500
you busted me. You have busted the, yeah,

1049
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:26,720
that was awesome. Ah, Shit. He goes,
I used to deal with the same thing.

1050
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:30,560
I would go to introduce myself to girls
and once they found out who I was,

1051
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:35,450
they would either walk away or get that
fuck off. Look on their faces. All right,

1052
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,320
now what did you do?
What we will accused of here he goes,

1053
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:42,560
this kid needs to stop being a
pussy and just fucking go with it.

1054
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,130
He should be like, yeah, I fucked
that chick in the elevator. Yeah,

1055
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:49,120
that doesn't sound like a Frat
guy here. Frat guy advice. Uh,

1056
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,690
he gets some respect from dudes at
parties and if he walked around with

1057
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:57,470
confidence and embrace it, girls will
eventually come around to, all right,

1058
01:04:57,471 --> 01:05:02,450
so this guy's taking the, uh,
just continue being a Dick,
which I actually, it is.

1059
01:05:02,451 --> 01:05:05,540
It is very, uh, it is effective,

1060
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,600
I guess from personal experience as much
girls would want nothing to do with me.

1061
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,470
The same amount of girls would actually
come onto me because all of the

1062
01:05:15,471 --> 01:05:18,730
outrageous things I've done or
have been rumored to have done.

1063
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,380
None of what you're bringing up. He says
he's in college. There's tons of hot,

1064
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:27,490
easy chicks who want to hook up with
wild guy. All right. This guy's gross.

1065
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,750
All right. I'm moving on. Um,
article on comics being psychos.

1066
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,330
Uh,
Billy straight jacket.

1067
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,730
I was at the Wiltern theater Gig and it
was the best new years I've ever had.

1068
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,400
Well, you know what, it was one
of the best. I've had two man.

1069
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:46,090
You guys were a great crowd,
so thank you. Um, he says,

1070
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:49,870
I hope you come back next year.
Even if there's an overlap in material,

1071
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,900
people pay to see the stones trudge,
trudge through,

1072
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:57,280
jumping jack flash every God damn year.
Yeah, but you can't dance to my jokes.

1073
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,250
What's the fucking deal with Obama?
I can't, I can't sing them. It's just

1074
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,590
no, dude. You know what it
is. You think that you want,

1075
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:14,740
you don't mind if there's overlap.
Well, I guess you are saying overlap,

1076
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:17,200
but you're still saying come
with some new shit. Believe me.

1077
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:22,090
I would love to do the Wiltern every year.
That was such a thrill to work there,

1078
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:27,070
so I'm glad you were there anyways. Um,
he says enough ass kick ass kissing.

1079
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,450
I'm sure you've seen this article making
the rounds about comics being psychos.

1080
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,380
What are your thoughts?

1081
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:34,930
My girlfriend said you made a
comment about it on Twitter,

1082
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:39,870
was hoping you could elaborate,
uh, go fuck yourself. And Nia,

1083
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:43,240
we love her. Um, oh yeah. Yeah.
There was a study by scientists

1084
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,310
were trying to figure out,
I guess why comedians are funny.

1085
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,130
And then they just said that
because we're basically,

1086
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:54,750
we share the same traits
or we are psychos. Um,

1087
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,110
I started to read that and um,
it's ridiculous,

1088
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:01,243
mmm.

1089
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,860
To attributed to that. It's, first
of all, they're, they're making,

1090
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,150
it's just a giant generalization.
There are comics who are psychos,

1091
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,570
but there were also truck drivers
who are psychos. There's teachers,

1092
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,990
there's mothers, there's
dentists, there's lawyers,

1093
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,700
heads of corporations, politicians.
They're psychos exists.

1094
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,750
Um,
I really don't feel that it,

1095
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,890
yeah.

1096
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:32,600
That, that article has basically
no credit on for me anyways,

1097
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:36,470
as far as like, I'm not saying
that comedians aren't psychos.

1098
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,443
MMM.

1099
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,460
But I mean, this sounded like they
were saying literally psychos. I mean,

1100
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:45,980
we're out of our fucking minds,
but I think a lot of people are.

1101
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:48,183
MMM.

1102
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,170
But my, the, the reason
why I don't buy into it,

1103
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,820
it might be on defensive because I am
a comedian. I will entertain that. But

1104
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,270
okay.

1105
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,450
Nobody I know was interviewed
for that article and no comic,

1106
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,040
I know who's worth his shit would

1107
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:04,620
okay.

1108
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:08,940
Would want to take time out of that
day. Cause that's a, that's like,

1109
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,600
yeah.

1110
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,470
At the very least,

1111
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:16,220
the only people they got were
either struggling new or old,

1112
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:21,221
desperate like comics who just needed 25
bucks to be part of this study and then

1113
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,193
their comics.

1114
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:30,310
There's no fucking way I would ever go
into a lab in somebody like asking me

1115
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:31,610
questions.

1116
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,610
There is no fucking way I could resist
giving misinformation and watching the

1117
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:44,300
guy write it down and add it into
his lab book with fucking beakers and

1118
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:47,480
graduated cylinders behind him.
I would have all I could do

1119
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:52,850
to hold a straight face throughout
the entire process. So, um,

1120
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,200
look, if you want to know why
people are funny, it's a gift.

1121
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,230
You're just born with it
the same way somebody can,

1122
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,730
a carpenter is born with the gift. You
just, you're just born with gifts. That's,

1123
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:12,380
it's just a, it's a gift. It's not
like, oh, maybe if I'm more like this,

1124
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:15,380
I'll be funnier.
You just either can do it or you can't.

1125
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,170
And then like any gifts,
if you work at it,

1126
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:24,100
if you appreciate the gift you've been
given, and then you try to develop it,

1127
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:26,140
you can get better at it.

1128
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:30,670
You could actually get funnier if you
push yourself. It's weird. I didn't think,

1129
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:32,830
I thought you were kind of
born with your level of funny,

1130
01:09:32,831 --> 01:09:36,850
but it's like any other talent.
You just got to keep working.

1131
01:09:36,851 --> 01:09:41,800
But if you're not born with it, it's
like me. I can't, I mean I can't sing.

1132
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,490
I'd love to be able to sync doesn't stop
me from singing on the fucking podcast,

1133
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:49,440
but like you,
you gotta be born with that Geeky.

1134
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:52,660
I could take as many singing lessons as
I wanted to when you could sit there and

1135
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:55,420
try to break down the
psychology of a musician.

1136
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:59,050
I'm not a musician as much
as I would love to be.

1137
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:02,440
I still play drums as of as a fucking
hobby. I also cook a little bit,

1138
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:05,590
but you wouldn't want to go
to my restaurant there. Right.

1139
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,100
So that's what I think about.
I think it's ridiculous.

1140
01:10:09,101 --> 01:10:12,840
And I thought it was really funny that
some of the tweets I got where, um,

1141
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,350
I love this one guy,

1142
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:19,240
like just the fucking ego on
just the average everyday person.

1143
01:10:19,241 --> 01:10:22,150
Cause they always talking about how
people in the public eye are egomaniacs.

1144
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:27,070
I don't think we're any different than
anybody in the fucking crowd to Same

1145
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:29,080
Level Eagle. Some guy sends me
this fucking tweet and he goes,

1146
01:10:29,081 --> 01:10:33,550
this article proves what I've
always thought about comedians.

1147
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,253
Oh really?

1148
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,950
Your study that you never did with all
the comedians you never hung out with.

1149
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:44,190
And this, this one fucking
article proves it. I don't know.

1150
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:47,680
It's more like, aren't you just unhappy
with your own life on some level?

1151
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:50,650
And it's great to see that they're
saying that these people, uh,

1152
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:53,920
who do this admirable thing
or actually all psychopaths.

1153
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:56,740
So it makes you feel better
about whatever your lot in life.

1154
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:01,030
I don't fucking know. Um, whatever.
That's, that's what I feel about it.

1155
01:11:01,031 --> 01:11:03,940
I might be wrong. Maybe I'm a psycho
and I can't wrap my head around it.

1156
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,000
All right. Imperial
Japanese hold, hold out.

1157
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:11,470
Dies at 91 hey wild bill.
Read Cock.

1158
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:18,360
Oh that's so childish. Shit.
They always make me laugh. Ah,

1159
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,530
you'll like this article.

1160
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:24,750
One of several Japanese soldiers who
continued to fight the war until the 1970s

1161
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,320
deep in the jungles of the
Philippines recently died at 91 yeah,

1162
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:29,700
I talked about a couple of these guys.

1163
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:33,570
It was like three of them who didn't
know the war was ended and you know,

1164
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:38,010
even when the, the, the, the leaflets
of the flyers were dropped from planes.

1165
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:43,010
They thought it was a allied propaganda
and they just held the company line.

1166
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,990
I think one of them,
one of them,

1167
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:49,530
the first guy I think was the 1960s they
finally got him late sixties and then

1168
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:51,810
they got two others in like
the early seventies I think.

1169
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:55,740
One guy went all the way to 1974
basically the end of the Vietnam War.

1170
01:11:55,950 --> 01:12:00,750
He was still on some godforsaken island
out in the Pacific fight in World War II.

1171
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:02,600
Anyway,

1172
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,060
so he said it took his former commanding
officer to find them in the jungle,

1173
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:06,721
in his jungle,

1174
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:11,550
hide out and tell him it was a rap and
he needed to stop killing Filipinos for

1175
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:15,240
him to finally come home.
The guy was convicted.

1176
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:20,610
Guy was convinced seeing all the u s
military air traffic heading to Vietnam

1177
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:25,611
that the war was still on despite hundreds
of leaflets and newspapers flown in

1178
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:28,680
and dropped to his location.
Uh, the link is below.

1179
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:31,740
Go Fuck yourself and up to see you
in Cleveland soon. Yeah, that's it.

1180
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:32,970
It's a fascinating,

1181
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:38,070
fascinating fucking story that that's
what was a major chunk of that man's life.

1182
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:39,703
Uh,

1183
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,411
Jesus Christ,

1184
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:45,910
if I ever for some reason was chosen
to give a speech on sticktuitiveness,

1185
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:50,530
that would probably be the a, the B beat.
That guy would be the lightning rod.

1186
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,760
The crux of the speech. Um, anyways,

1187
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:58,300
our long distance hiking is this, there's,
this led is the last one. Everybody,

1188
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,380
this is it. And then that's all there
is for this week. Long distance hiking.

1189
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,030
Hey Bill,
on January on the January 7th podcast,

1190
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,030
you went off about getting stuck in the
woods alone in mauled by giant animals.

1191
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,990
Last September,
me and two buddies height in height,

1192
01:13:13,991 --> 01:13:17,680
a portion of the hundred
mile wilderness in Maine,

1193
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:22,630
which is the last leg of the
Appalachian trail, took four days.

1194
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:27,690
They went 40 miles in five mountains
with 35 pound packs on our backs.

1195
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:33,040
Dude, I'm getting scared. Just
fucking hearing about that.

1196
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,620
I know there's a lot of people
who fucking pussy go out there,

1197
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,610
go out there with you and a couple of
your fucking buddies when you can't hear,

1198
01:13:39,611 --> 01:13:42,130
see or anything other
than just fucking nature.

1199
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:47,230
And you start seeing tracks of animals
that could mall you to death and it is no

1200
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,220
fucking joke.

1201
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,123
MMM.

1202
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:56,160
He said on our fourth and final day in
the woods after getting rained on all

1203
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,590
night,
we encountered a bull Moose on the trail.

1204
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:03,920
If you've never seen a moose close up,
they're fucking huge. Jesus Christ. Dude,

1205
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,790
I thought you were going to go a
little more in depth than that.

1206
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:09,660
I was all excited. I've never seen
him most close up. Yeah, yeah,

1207
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,790
they're fucking huge.

1208
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:19,150
Oh, it goes on a little more like
a full size pickup truck. Huge.

1209
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,000
At first it didn't see us,
which is always dangerous.

1210
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,610
And then like a scene out of a movie,

1211
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:28,030
my friends stepped on a twig
and it snapped under his foot.

1212
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,950
What happened next was the most finked
sphincter that I say it tightening

1213
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:37,660
experience of my life.
This thing lifted his head up,

1214
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:42,400
looks me right in the eye and starts
charging down the trail at us. Oh my God.

1215
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:47,410
All three of us dropped our packs and
ran as fast as we could off the trail.

1216
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:51,070
Fortunately,
Moose have shitty eyesight,

1217
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,020
so we were able to lose it.

1218
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:56,410
You know what I was actually picturing
is I'm just picturing Zidane old Charisse

1219
01:14:56,411 --> 01:14:59,680
skating at me and just
hoping he can't turn.

1220
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:07,430
Fortunately Moose have shitty eyesight.
I figure what those long skinny legs,

1221
01:15:07,431 --> 01:15:11,570
they can't, you know, if you do a
little Barry Sanders move, you know,

1222
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:15,970
dodge it at the last second
you said they have shitty eyesight.

1223
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:20,930
So we were able to lose it and he
continued on down the trail. No doubt,

1224
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,530
uh,
to scare the shit out of some more hikers.

1225
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:30,070
What we later learn is that September
starts the Rut from Moose mating season.

1226
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:35,090
So not only was this thing pissed, we
were in his house, it wanted to fuck us.

1227
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:39,380
Um, Jesus Christ, you
know, as scary as that is,

1228
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:43,040
I would actually love to do
it just to see if I could, uh,

1229
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,850
if I could hike that far,
just the physical test of it,

1230
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,400
but I would have to go out there with,
uh, somebody really experienced too.

1231
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:54,440
We had a fucking firearm
cocked and loaded in,

1232
01:15:54,441 --> 01:15:57,080
pointed in all directions
and I'm in the center of it.

1233
01:15:57,081 --> 01:16:00,860
And then I think I could actually
fucking do it. Whatever. I have respect,

1234
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:04,700
respect for fucking, uh, the wilderness
and I'm, I'm terrified of the ocean.

1235
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:09,620
I won't go in it. It's
fucking nuts. All right.

1236
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,820
If you had a medium sized alligator in
a pool, I wouldn't go in that either.

1237
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:15,920
Why would I go into the ocean?

1238
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,120
We're all sharks other than
the ones in aquariums exists.

1239
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,750
I don't want to fucking do that.
All right. And anyways. All right.

1240
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:26,670
That's the podcast for
this week. Everybody. Um,

1241
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,430
okay.

1242
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:32,930
Yeah, that's it. I'm really excited about
the Superbowl and, uh, try it to share.

1243
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:36,590
Try One year, not to just watch all
the fucking hype. Start the game.

1244
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:40,640
An hour and a half late.
Drink a couple millers and put it on.

1245
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:43,430
I'm telling you can actually maybe
get for the old guys out there.

1246
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:47,340
Maybe you can get back to some
of the way it used to be. Um,

1247
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:48,520
okay.

1248
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,280
You know, back in the old
fucking days. All right.

1249
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:57,080
That's the podcast for this week.
Uh, that's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1250
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,540
I'll talk to you next weekend.

1251
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,240
Next week I'll be telling you stories
about Hawaii and the pro bowl always in

1252
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:04,130
that exciting. Well, it is to me.

1253
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:05,340
Oh.
