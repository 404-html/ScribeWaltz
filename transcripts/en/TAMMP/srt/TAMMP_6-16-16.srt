1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,890
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:09,891
just before Friday fucking Monday morning
podcast that I've just checking in on

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,340
you. How's that? Is that the worst?

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,860
Is that the worst you've ever
heard? Um, Dave kept no reference.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,570
Uh, sorry. My voice is a
little fucking blown out. Uh,

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,620
it did a record for episode six of the
10 that we're doing for a season two and

7
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,110
I don't know what the fuck I did to it.
Um, who's getting know when you know,

8
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:35,310
when you lack talent,

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,080
what should try to do is you're trying
to be loud so you can shout down all the

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,170
silence. That's what you do. You
throw in a couple of f words,

11
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:47,520
a couple of fucking shit jokes. And next
thing you know, you kind of have an act,

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,510
you know, and you scrape the bottom of
the fucking barrel. That's what you do.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,430
And when you scrape the bottom of
the barrel, next thing you know,

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,960
you have your party's nomination
for presidency of the United States.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,030
You know what's great about this job
is I get to meet a bunch of different

16
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:10,140
people and overwhelmingly people
on both sides or just going,

17
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:14,130
I don't know who the fuck I'm going to
vote for. These are my, these are the,

18
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,060
these are the two which
is supposed to decide,

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,580
added a fucking blue between
these two fucking lunatics.

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,500
I don't get it. Well, I get it. What
are you going to do? See the vote more,

21
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,750
the same or you step off into the abyss?

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,420
A,
I swear to God,

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,370
if Trump didn't hate non whites
as much as he seems to, uh,

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,650
or at least was wasn't
so fucking out of touch,

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,890
I'd almost be excited just
to see what the, what,

26
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,950
just just being a lazy comedian.

27
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,880
Just how this guy would just be fucking
feeding it to you. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,460
I found Obama was kind of
boring. You know, Bush was fun.

29
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:03,360
Clinton was Jesus Christ. Clinton
was fucking great, you know,

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,030
watch,
come over here and suck my Dick.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,510
I mean it was so easy to get
laughs on that guy. And then Bosch,

32
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:13,050
and he's got old after a while, we get
it. He's fucking stupid. But like Clinton,

33
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,830
every fucking week he was sticking
cigars and people's fucking twats,

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,760
you know, he's bombing people,
he's putting on weight.

35
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:24,220
He goes to Mcdonald's and he's got his
fucking thighs out. I mean, that guy,

36
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,054
how he was, he was, uh,

37
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,270
he was a comedy juggernaut because he
keep kept changing every time you thought,

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,140
you know, all right, it's this, this,
and this, and you've got this guy down.

39
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,090
He would add another layer,
Bush,

40
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,280
which just Kinda hinky and then
another fucking seven years.

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,000
It's like, we get it, we get it. He's
fucking stupid. And he's not stupid,

42
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,360
but he's a, I don't know. I'll
quote one of my relatives.

43
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:52,170
He's not the best speaker.
Um,

44
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,050
I don't even, I barely even watched a
bomb borrowers or there. Oh ha ha ha.

45
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,290
I was just felt like he was giving me a
fucking lecture. It's like, all right.

46
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,610
I never really found any whom I found
his wife Hilarious fucking going on Ellen

47
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,020
and shit and tweeting.
You know what I mean?

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,120
I can like some seventh grade on
Instagram. She was funny, but uh,

49
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,170
I don't know about him. Um, anyway,

50
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:27,310
so hopefully whatever one of the other
you're going to tell you right now,

51
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,600
the both of them,
either one of them,

52
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,320
Hillary or Trump is going to be plenty
of fucking material but then instantly be

53
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,080
hacky. So maybe that's
what it is. I don't know.

54
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,850
All I know is I got 'em I got
'em doing this Wednesday night.

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,310
The hockey is over.

56
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,940
You get so excited to see somebody
when the fucking cup and then,

57
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,990
then there's like the next day like,
oh fuck itself. Now what do I do?

58
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,950
Um, I'll tell you what you
do. You get into Formula One.

59
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,040
There's another racist Sunday.
The fucking,

60
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,370
I don't know where the hell it it's
going to be. Is this the European one?

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,870
I don't. I got them all on my
phone. There's a couple in July,

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,780
Dennis as like one in August,
two in September.

63
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:13,500
Then like fucking every
Sunday in October there's one,

64
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:17,640
then there's two more in November and
then that's it. It's pretty fucking easy.

65
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:21,300
They're only a couple hours. You get to
watch somebody go like 200 miles an hour.

66
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,710
You get through to look in the crowd,

67
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,070
see all the people that go to
the Bilderberg meetings, right?

68
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,770
And sacrifice people.
And then you see a couple of baskets.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,270
This is how much money's in,
in,

70
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:35,220
in fucking Formula One is when you look
at like the a list movie stars and like

71
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:39,060
fucking Zillionaire, you know, athletes,
they have a look on their face.

72
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,880
Like they can't even believe that
they're there. They're like, wow, these,

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,230
these people have money. We
thought we had money. And then,

74
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,250
then we came here and then we realized
that we did, we, we, we, we have money,

75
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:54,030
but we don't have that kind
of money. You know, you know,

76
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:56,340
back a fucking yacht into France.

77
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,710
He's fucking people back a yard into
France and fucking watch a race and then

78
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,380
continue on. Where do they go? You know,

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,220
you ever seen those people on yachts?
Every once in a while you're like,

80
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:15,050
where the fuck where they
go? And do you say like, you,

81
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:17,970
you cruise underneath of fucking,
you got your own mountain.

82
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,340
It's incredible. Um, you ever
been on a boat just by yourself?

83
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,890
Whenever I'm on a boat by myself,
I always had the same thought.

84
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,790
There's no fucking way I wouldn't do
something illegal if I owned a boat.

85
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,560
There's no fucking way,

86
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,490
the level of freedom that you
fucking have this shit. You can,

87
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,900
you're on a boat going
out of the fucking ocean.

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,020
Yeah.

89
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,220
All bets are off. You get out into
international waters. I mean it's fucking,

90
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,320
whatever you say becomes your law.

91
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,230
Literally do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

92
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,560
You're telling me right now if
you had a fucking bolt, right?

93
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,480
You know boss was at Dec,
right? Fuck. Ah, you know,

94
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,110
just so, uh, whenever they
promoted a woman, right?

95
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:07,400
Cause they had a fucking check off a box.
They got you a more qualified,

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,530
you came in every day with your qualified
swinging Dick and junk and they had

97
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:17,531
enough of it and they told you to stand
down and then they promoted this lady,

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,350
right? You're telling me
if you got a boat, right?

99
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,050
I don't know how he got the boat. You
didn't get promoted, but whatever.

100
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,470
This is my fucking fantasy.
Trash, trash and fucking,

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,900
it's hypothetical lady, right? I know.
This is be considered misogynistic.

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,810
This is the woman I ran
into the first 90 times.

103
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,440
I tried to get something on the air.
I just feel it's like this.

104
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,670
That would be the end of my dream,
but they don't have any power.

105
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,660
Uh, it's a glass ceiling. Well,

106
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm running into their shoes over here
is they're banging their head on the

107
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,670
ceiling. That was been my experience.
Anyway. Let's get back to the fantasy.

108
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,530
You're telling me if
you got a fucking boat,

109
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,870
you know you're not going to just,
I dunno,

110
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,750
just a kilo of cocaine
just for the fuck of it.

111
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:09,590
Just to have that cash laying around
your house, you know what I mean?

112
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,450
Get a keg or have some people over,

113
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,190
cook up some steaks. That's the
way you do it. When you, when you,

114
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:19,820
if you're fucking drug,
it's just every once in a while.

115
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,880
Is there a way to do that?
And the in the drug game was the kids say,

116
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,980
can you just every once in a while
deliver a Kalo said no one picks up on it.

117
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,560
Right.
You still drive your dented Prius,

118
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:34,190
like make Jesus my car needs to
fucking bath. Like you read about,

119
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,070
I literally walked out of a
fucking liquor store today.

120
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:41,690
It wasn't for me cause I'm on the wagon.
Buddy of mine got fucking married.

121
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,110
Um, I couldn't make it
cause I was on the road,

122
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,630
so I just got them some fucking
champaign, shit, whatever.

123
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,860
And I forgot to get a card
before on stand. I'm giving
it to him. I'll just say,

124
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:54,020
hey, and I've got a card. He goes,
I don't worry. You've got the booze.

125
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:58,850
That's what counts. Sorry,
what? He'd drink up. Ay,
Yay. Yay me. Look at my eyes.

126
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,680
Right. And when the same
boat. Oh yeah. So anyways, um,

127
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,840
I came walking out of the liquor store
and a, I looked at my car and I got,

128
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,350
this thing's a fucking piece of shit,

129
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,580
but it isn't just on the outside,
you know,

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,690
on the inside, everything's
been taken care of. Right. I've,

131
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:22,040
I've maintained that thing
meticulously on the outside.

132
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,710
It's a mess on the inside.
It's beautiful, you know,

133
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,430
it's like an ugly person just waiting
for somebody good looking to come along

134
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,480
and discovered that,
you know,

135
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,860
maybe they have something to add
to the conversation, you know? Um,

136
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,110
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about,

137
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:39,770
so I'm just saying this is
the way this is. If you're in,

138
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,090
if you're selling drugs,
this is what you do it.

139
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,260
If he can just do it like the way Bush
went to the fucking Army National Guard,

140
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,320
whatever the fuck he did,
we just showed up every once in a while.

141
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,120
You know what I mean?
Played Ping Pong,

142
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,850
dress like a sergeant and then you
went home for like fucking six months.

143
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,620
That's the way you deal drugs.

144
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,990
Okay.

145
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,700
Alright. Yeah. Befriended drug deal and
you go, listen, this is all I want to do.

146
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,570
I got a boat. Okay. Every fucking
once in a while, you know,

147
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,100
every whatever be fucking 18
months you call me up. Right.

148
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,670
You got to key is something why
you taught on the fucking boat?

149
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll have it on ice.

150
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,260
You're the coldest fucking cocaine in
the universe and I'll fucking deliver it

151
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:25,150
over here. Right. You break me off
like fucking 15 grant. All right.

152
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,220
Then you just take the cash.
She just got it.

153
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,040
You got 15 grand in cash and you
don't fucking buy yourself anything,

154
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,030
you know, go out and buy a fucking flash
you fucking car or any of that shit.

155
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:37,780
All you do,

156
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,980
you just have it in a jar or some shit
and every once in a while big games

157
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,070
coming up. You know UFC
event, you fucking order it.

158
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:46,950
Yeah.

159
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,270
That's what you spend it on. You fucking
blow it on your friends, you know?

160
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,600
Okay.

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,720
It's some fucking barbershop chairs
in your house. Just some stupid shit,

162
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,680
you know? Nothing that caused that. That's
how you blow your fucking cash, man.

163
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:02,290
You could keep shit on the inside.
Right.

164
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,190
You don't drive around some flashy car
with the fucking elevator shoes whenever,

165
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,340
whenever, whenever the kids do today
I, I don't, I don't pretend to though.

166
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,560
That's what I would do,
you know?

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,900
Okay.

168
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,540
Then every once in a while, and I don't
know how to get into your bank account,

169
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,960
why would he do then if you've got to pay
for the UFC event and who gives a fuck,

170
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:23,130
you pay for it out of your ready a clean
money, you know, and then all the booze,

171
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,880
money and all the other bullshit you
just take out of the jar. There you go.

172
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,620
Be hilarious when you finally get caught.
You know,

173
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,010
he'd just go to trial and just like,
look, I just, every once in a while I,

174
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,710
it was like every 18 months, it's
not even a felony a year, your honor.

175
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,270
And you know, I just, I,
I didn't buy anything.

176
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,470
I don't even watches the
shit. I just, you know, I,

177
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,490
I got the NFL package
and I had my friends,

178
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,010
oh everybody had their
own leather chair ever.

179
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,260
You ever watch shows the Elvis
documentaries? Well, you know,

180
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,720
everyone's going to go horseback
riding and it wasn't enough.

181
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:59,700
He bought everybody a horse
and he got him a saddle,

182
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,770
then a little pickup truck
to put the saddle on.

183
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,790
I did that and the judge be like, oh,
is that what you did? That's great.

184
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,220
Well maybe you uh, can take that
given nature and go to jail and uh,

185
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,740
start giving some hand jobs because
a c United States of America Buddy,

186
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,333
you know,

187
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,920
do you get a kilo of cocaine?
Right? And then you fucking,

188
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,730
okay,

189
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,530
take your boat all the way out
into international waters, right?

190
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:33,270
And then I meet you on another boat and
then I hand you the key, uh, cocaine.

191
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:37,110
And then you give me the
money in international
waters and what both captains

192
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:41,520
and what we say goes and
we say, uh, um, I say,

193
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,160
this is legal, all in favor. Or we go, hi.

194
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,420
I could they do anything. I mean, once,

195
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,420
okay.

196
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,290
It's the dude who comes back in with the
fucking key low. He's in trouble. You,

197
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,310
once you get back within the borders,
you know what I mean?

198
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,690
Can you sit there, I'm really fascinated
with boats now. Can you fucking,

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,850
I don't even do drugs.
This is just fascinating to me.

200
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:09,380
Can you sit in just just on the other
side of international waters with a kilo

201
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:10,880
of cocaine out in the open.

202
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,530
Just blow and stripes is to
coast guards looking at you.

203
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:20,300
Just waiting for you to float another
40 feet over and just be sitting there.

204
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:20,801
Gone on.

205
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:25,160
Now I am the captain of the ship and
international waters and I say this is

206
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,994
legal.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Okay.

208
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Yeah, it probably can't do that. Right,

209
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,150
because you know what they could do is
they could just come over and just say

210
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,690
that you were,

211
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,770
you were in within the borders of the u
s who's going to fucking know it's their

212
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,360
word against yours.
You brought there on the ocean.

213
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,230
There's a lot of questions
I have about the ocean.

214
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,650
This is one of the reasons why I don't
have a boat aside from the fact it's just

215
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,950
a fucking money pit.
You know what I mean?

216
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,780
Can have a boat. You can have a friend
who has a boat. That's the way to do it,

217
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:58,290
right? It's, my brother always said,
you don't want a boat pill. You want,

218
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,980
you want a friend to have a boat.
That's the deal. That's what it is.

219
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,540
Then you show up, you know,
bring Google, tango, rain
tonic, you were fucking heroin.

220
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,130
Then you guide dogs the
fucking boat and that's it.

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
He's cleaning off the barnacles.
You know what I mean?

222
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:15,060
He has to explain what happened to the
stewardess. She was here a minute ago.

223
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,160
I don't know. We were drinking and
she must have fallen overboard.

224
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:20,070
Right then that follows you around
for rest of your fucking life.

225
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,470
Um, anyways, so what do you guys think?

226
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,020
I guess when you listened to,
since it's Thursday,

227
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,110
so game six in Cleveland
to night to night to night.

228
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,630
Um, oh my God. Can you imagine if
they force a fucking game seven

229
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,960
that would be something else.
You know what I mean? Who knows?

230
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,120
Then you go out to fucking it lists.

231
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,560
I'm going to give some Cleveland
Cavalier fans some advice here. Okay.

232
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,260
God. Well and the force
of game seven. Okay.

233
00:13:56,261 --> 00:14:00,100
Cause we're all trying to avoid
the dog days of fucking baseball.

234
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
You know what I mean?
Nobody wants to watch that shit.

235
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,960
The baseball players don't want
to play the games. They don't.

236
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,880
The only reason why they
play is cause if they didn't,

237
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:07,930
they wouldn't make as much money.

238
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,931
But nobody wants to fucking play baseball
from mid June to fucking like the

239
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,720
second week of September.
Any ballplayer,

240
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,880
if they could fast forward to all of
those fucking games and just get to the

241
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:22,840
exciting part. You know who's gonna win
the division? There's nothing better.

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,870
Then when it finally fucking matters after
fucking 263 regular season, whatever,

243
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:32,770
they play 182 games, whatever
the hell it is, 180 games.

244
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,710
Jesus fucking Christ.

245
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,970
You know everybody in Chicago
getting all excited about the cubs,

246
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,140
you know what I mean?
Already rubbing one out.

247
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,420
They're going to bust a nut and
fucking the beginning of July.

248
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:50,890
You got to pace yourself.
If you're not watched any pornos relax,

249
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,660
cub, feds, put your
shirts back on. All right?

250
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,090
How many fucking times if you fell for
this, not saying I'm rooting against you,

251
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:03,260
but you know, slow your
roll here. Cubs fans,

252
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:06,620
the exp level excitement they get when
you watch them every fucking year.

253
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,220
It's literally like watching somebody's
fallen in love with a stripper, you know?

254
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,610
And you just sit in there like,
what are you doing? You know,

255
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,240
you fuck them. You don't fall
in love with them right now.

256
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,490
I'm kidding. The part of being a
sports fan, it's the fucking misery.

257
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,050
And you've got to believe
that's what you gotta do.

258
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,310
Take the kick to the seeds every fucking
year and then maybe one time they

259
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,980
actually win it. Then you talk about
that for the rest of your life. Oh,

260
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:35,960
what a year. They still live
in newspaper. A framed it.

261
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,360
Um, and then your wife throws
it out. Nah, maybe she doesn't.

262
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:45,110
Maybe she's cool. Right. Maybe
she wants us to sports too,

263
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,960
but then she'd probably fat,
you know,

264
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,870
looks like you got to start putting on
each other's genes in the morning and

265
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,800
just these minor, yeah. Fuck
that. They felt weird. Yeah.

266
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,430
Don't use and then not use of the cameltoe
fit here. I guess. These are yours.

267
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,050
Um, this has gotta be the most fucking
bizarre podcast I've ever done. Um,

268
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,660
it's cause I'm fucking exhausted
mentally from doing this shit.

269
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,370
Uh, I got halfway through this podcast,
I'm not drinking. And I was watching the,

270
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,390
uh, Jacopo story of Pistorious Sally
says named the fucking Bass player.

271
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:24,680
They're watching this documentary on him.
I read the book on this guy too.

272
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,050
And like the beginning is all great.

273
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,750
It's just once he starts
going off the rails, you know,

274
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,430
so I kind of paused it
right at the right part.

275
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,780
If you're watching the documentary
for the first hour and eight minutes,

276
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,110
but actually probably about
the hour and three minutes.

277
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,640
And then it starts to be like,
oh,

278
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,970
and then he did this and then did that
and then this fucking gap in this.

279
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,190
Then it's a shit show. Um, so anyways,

280
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,800
uh, to fuck are they talking about what
I'm talking about boats now I was talking

281
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,070
about the Cavaliers now is he had some
advice to Cleveland Cavalier fence. Okay.

282
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:58,220
God willing. You guys forced the
game. Six. Okay. Enough for you,

283
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:02,840
not for your city after the offense
for me. Okay. Cause they want another,

284
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,220
I want to more fucking games tomorrow
night and I want another one. Okay.

285
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,030
Before I slip into,
um,

286
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,660
the sporting a bis,
you know,

287
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,560
and I don't give a fuck that you only
have to wait another six weeks before,

288
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:22,430
you know, preseason football
starts. I don't give a fuck.

289
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,080
I don't give a fuck about the draft.
I don't give a fuck about preseason.

290
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,810
I don't give a fuck about analysis.

291
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,530
I don't give a shit that the projections
and don't give a fuck about any of it.

292
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,840
Just let me know when it counts.

293
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,450
I am so fucking sick of watching people
standing up on a fuck in front of a God

294
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:52,581
damn screen trying to explain to me what
the fuck I just saw what happened and

295
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:56,460
why it happened. I don't
give a shit. I get it.

296
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,390
You played the game and you
understand it on a level beyond,

297
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,350
you know, just, I dunno,

298
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,630
just fucking show who one Taco over the
highlights and end the fucking thing.

299
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,640
You're going to sit around and
have God damned debates. Yeah.

300
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,540
What do you think was
happening in the transit? Well,

301
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,150
I think the problem with everybody knows,
I don't know.

302
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,720
I don't know shit about basketball,
but I can tell you right now,

303
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,860
if you fucking the Cavaliers
as a fucking comedian,

304
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,310
I know what they're doing wrong.
At least I think I do.

305
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,060
I would think if you up by eight points
against a team that can shoot the

306
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,850
fucking lights out and you'd want to
throw the ball around a little bit when it

307
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,330
was in your possession rather than
whoever gets the ball and crosses.

308
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,470
Fucking mid court just says,
I'm shooting it right.

309
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:46,590
It doesn't even pass the ball and you
take like two seconds off the clock.

310
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,510
It's probably not what you want to
do. Right. See that? I'm a comedian.

311
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,180
I can figure that out. Do I need
four people in fucking, well,

312
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,610
three people in suits and he got
to get a lady in there, right?

313
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,160
She's got a fucking,
she's got to run her. Yap.

314
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,200
She's got to put her fucking
2 cents in, right? You're the,

315
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,270
one of the worst fucking things ever is,
is to be a beautiful woman, you know,

316
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,120
and you're with a really successful guy.
You know,

317
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:11,490
and you just go around a
parties and then you're just,

318
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:13,650
you just stand next to the guy going,

319
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:16,980
is he going to introduce me as
you're going to introduce me?

320
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,160
You get one tie there. Hi.
Then he just stand there.

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,180
The other night I did a
Gig and there was this,

322
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:28,290
there was a scene afterwards and
there was all these fucking, you know,

323
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,130
rich people with their beautiful
wives and I just, I dunno,

324
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,540
I just started watching the
wives after awhile. I don't know.

325
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,860
Why don't they peel off
and talk to each other?

326
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,930
It's sort of a weird thing where
they just got to stand there smiling.

327
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,550
You can see their face hurting, you know
their feet hurt from the fucking pumps.

328
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,650
It's fucking brutal. If you're a
beautiful woman, what you should do,

329
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,651
you got to marry like a fucking six who
just can't believe that he's with you.

330
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:02,640
Cause he'll let you go out and wear
some fucking flatties some moccasins.

331
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:02,971
He doesn't.

332
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:06,270
You don't have to jack it up in the air
and stand there smiling next to him.

333
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,480
Like one of those fucking
psychos on the prices, right?

334
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,780
Waiting to fucking act like they're
amazed about a washer and a dryer.

335
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,740
Get a stand next to your fucking
guy's wearing a sport coat.

336
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,040
Try to cover up his fucking man tits
and you've got to sit there smiling like

337
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,600
you're happy. You know, putting your
fucking makeup on like some clown.

338
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,720
That's about everybody shut out of a
fucking cannon. You don't need that shit.

339
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,110
What are you doing?
They got to start. Well,

340
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:35,160
I'll tell you these fucking good
looking women that marry these really

341
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:39,330
successful guys and then just stand
next to him smiling, you know,

342
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,010
for the whole fucking evening,

343
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,170
like a stewardess at the end of a flight
except the fuck it takes four hours for

344
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:46,350
the,

345
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,350
for everybody to get off the plane
because by thank you for flying high.

346
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,000
You know who's fault that is?
It's their fault.

347
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,410
It's their God damn fault for getting
yourself into their fucking position.

348
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:06,580
Some point, the relationship, you got
to say, listen, hey mark, sit down.

349
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:11,320
We got to talk. Guess what? Fucking
Susie ain't putting on the shows tonight.

350
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,800
All right. Deal with it. Not
Standing next to you. Smile.

351
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,950
You want to go to a fucking brunch
and stand next to me smiling with some

352
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:22,510
aftershave on for fucking four hours.
I didn't think it did. Shut up.

353
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm not finished. At some point you got
to have that conversation. You know,

354
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,110
I'm not trying to be mean here.
This is supposed to be empowering.

355
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,170
I'm saying you have the power and an up
just fucking standing there smiling like

356
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,020
a God damn. I don't know
why. I don't know what it is.

357
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,923
You know?

358
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,390
I don't know. I'm talking about,
I don't even know if I saw that.

359
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,250
I watched an episode of House of
cards, you know, house of cards.

360
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:45,330
I last like three.

361
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:48,660
I lasted like three episodes and I
just got sick of him fucking turning me

362
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,780
talking to me. It's like, dude, will you
just live your life? Stop talking to me.

363
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,990
They are right there as a secretary
of state. He doesn't know.

364
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:58,800
Then I'm fucking as well. I
shut up. I get it. I get it.

365
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,080
Just stop talking.
What does this,

366
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:05,160
the wonder years for adults? Um, Oh God,

367
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:08,130
I'm in a grumpy fucking mood
and I love Kevin Spacey.

368
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,220
Why would I say these sinks?
Why would I say these things?

369
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:14,040
Because I'm mentally fucking exhausted
and I got another eight minutes where I

370
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,360
got to run my fucking Yap

371
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,090
running my yap on the
Thursday afternoon podcasts,

372
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,270
talking about issues.
Um,

373
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,580
what else?
I don't know there have anything else.

374
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,000
I still haven't watched peaky blinders
because I'm trying not to drink and

375
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,240
there's no way to to watch that
show and not want to fucking start.

376
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,220
Just pounding.
Maybe I'll wait til like the 4th of July,

377
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,340
you know, I'll just watch.
That's what I'll do.

378
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:46,170
That's a good way to
spend the 4th of July.

379
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:49,470
I'll ignore my wife and just get blind
drunk watching a show that she can't

380
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:53,280
understand. You know, I put
on the subtitles, but she,

381
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,770
she didn't need is just not into it.
She just doesn't give a fuck.

382
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,340
We actually had this, we had this
argument the other night, right?

383
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,660
She goes to when we go to bed,
right.

384
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:06,410
She puts on the TV and she always has a
shows on and what's fucking hilarious to

385
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:06,890
me.

386
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,940
And she's always coming at me about my
temper and my yelling and flipping out,

387
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:15,230
screaming Atlanta and shit, or
yelling at the TV or my computer. Oh,

388
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,190
me and my computer, if you ever heard
the way I yell at my fucking computer,

389
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,890
you don't like that couple that just
needs to fucking break up. You know, we,

390
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,230
we got it in my neighborhood,
dude.

391
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:28,010
I'm telling you like fucking two houses
up that they've been very good lately.

392
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,520
You know?
But I'm telling you this like times,

393
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,980
like you're literally like
waiting to hear the gunshot.

394
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:37,280
It's like this just fucking insane
the way they scream at each other.

395
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:38,890
Okay.

396
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,140
It's the most unhealthy
fucking relationship.

397
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,943
Okay.

398
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,640
I've ever heard. And I gotta
be honest with man, you know,

399
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,170
sometimes I hear it and I just, I go out
on my porch and I just, I just listen.

400
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,600
You don't light up a cigar and just enjoy
it like it's a show not fuck with yet,

401
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,490
don't. Um, but anyways, so she's always
getting on me about my temper. And Shit.

402
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,510
You know what's fucking hilarious?
It was every fucking show she watches.

403
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,910
It's just a bunch of people
screaming and yelling at each other.

404
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,880
Those reality shows that it just wall
the wall clams. That's all. I mean,

405
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,620
you would think all these feminists out
there who is sitting there trash and men

406
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,760
up and down. All the bad stuff we do to
them. Admittedly. You know what I mean?

407
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,720
We make you stand next to us and
smile for an entire fucking party.

408
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,040
You know? Oh, I'm sorry. This
is my wife. Oh, I'm sorry.

409
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,400
This is the person that
committed my life to, I'm sorry.

410
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,600
Did I agnostic? Did I not even
acknowledge that you will fucking here?

411
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,450
They deal with that. I'll fucking
night. Right. All that bullshit.

412
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:44,810
I know we do that shit. But you would
think that these fucking feminists, right?

413
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,680
You'd think that they would,

414
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:51,150
they would have issues with these fucking
reality shows because the way they did

415
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:55,370
depict women is, I don't give
a fuck how many pairs of shoes,

416
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,600
how big the fucking houses, how much
Jules they got hanging off of them.

417
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,810
They still going to bitch that just
fucking bitch and each other out.

418
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,290
She was watching one of these
shows, right? And there was
just like, I don't know,

419
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:09,650
15 it seemed like there was 15 to
20 of them. So you know, there was,

420
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:10,910
it was probably just three,

421
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,720
but that's the amount of noise
of fucking woman can make. Right.

422
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,550
Three of them were sound like 15.

423
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:19,100
It's like their defense mechanism
because generally speaking,

424
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,400
they can't beat the shit out of men.
But if they just start complaining,

425
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,490
it just sounds like a platoon
in your back down. Right.

426
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,820
Instead of giving all three of them,
I'm one of those most slaps, you know,

427
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:31,880
when all three stooges would
get slapped at once. Um,

428
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,560
anyways, one of the episodes I
saw like, you know, like I said,

429
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,440
it sounded like 15 so realistically it was
probably like six of them, right? They,

430
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,640
they went to like Rome or some
shit. And I'm thinking, I finally,

431
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,140
they got these fucking women out
of this culdesac now they can,

432
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:51,050
now they can be excited to be in romp.
They go to fucking room.

433
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:55,610
They do the same goddamn think.
You know this bitch come up to me.

434
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:59,000
He started talking about, it's like
you're in Rome. You had dumb fuck.

435
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:03,620
Go look at something. Go eat some food.
I know it's just a show and whatever.

436
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:06,770
She watches that shit and I'm just
laying there. I hate the fucking show.

437
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,650
I'm trying to go to sleep and I just,
she just watches.

438
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,570
He's fucking shows where they
scream and yell at each other.

439
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,930
Now she's watching a fucking
show that's about a show.

440
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,550
That's a show that's like that.

441
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,200
It's a show about a one of those
reality shows like the bachelor.

442
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,200
You know what I mean? And I don't
know. I don't, I don't w w w what?

443
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:32,030
What? What the fuck do I
know? Right. 26 minutes.

444
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:34,370
Let's read a little bit of advertising
here. Why don't we do that? All right.

445
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,520
Type in the password.

446
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,850
You wouldn't want anybody to break into
your computer bill with all your secrets.

447
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,690
Oh my fucking slap fight
videos that I watch.

448
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,290
Why do I have a fucking
password? You know? Yeah.

449
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:52,940
I know this isn't going to work either.
At anytime.

450
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,710
I tried to do the past
with one fucking hand.

451
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,440
You know what kills me too is I wanted
to, yeah, of course. It didn't work.

452
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,050
I wanted a nice simple fucking password.

453
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,730
That was stupid content that keeps
telling me that it wasn't sick.

454
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,790
Sure enough,
you don't know.

455
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:12,370
All right, here we go. Loot crate.
What the hell is this shit? All right,

456
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,780
here we go. Loot crate. Everybody
ever been to comic con? No.

457
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,700
Wish you could take it home with you.
What an aqua man suit.

458
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,750
Oh Jesus. Bill, just read the copy.
Already. Have a little bit of,

459
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:30,700
it's sent to your home every
month with loot crate packs.

460
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,870
E three and comicon happen just
once a year. All this is some fun.

461
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,400
This is like some mega nerd
shit. All right, here we go.

462
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:43,720
Nerds perk up your ears. This is
like when they, after the super bowl,

463
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:46,720
when they sell like the programs and
the hats and all that and I'm like

464
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,500
[inaudible] don't know. Going to save it.
It's going to be worth something. Right?

465
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,660
Um, this is for the
nerds. Here we go. Okay.

466
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:58,330
So I've been definitely,
there's something called packs.

467
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,150
Evidently there's some called e three and
I know about comic con and they happen

468
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:07,120
just once a year each. That's like the
Grand Slam. Like you know when Golf,

469
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:11,680
you got the master's, she got the
British open, the US Open and the PGA.

470
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,230
Alright. Nerds have the packs,
the e three comic con, Eh,

471
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,060
uh, I dunno, some wonder
woman thing. I don't know.

472

Usually that shit doesn't happen in
a town near you. But with loot crate,

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,590

Um,

495
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,010
I did a Gig the other night where there
was like professional gamers there and

496
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:51,910
stuff. They make all this fucking money.
It's like the greatest thing ever.

497
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,710
You play video games for a living,
you know,

498
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,420
that's what this country has become.

499
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,700
It's become like you
turned your hobby like me,

500
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:04,570
I turned fucking around telling
jokes in a warehouse into a career.

501
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,190
Skype plays video games, you know
what I mean? You like Robin one out,

502
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,070
you get into porn.
God knows we don't manufacture anything.

503
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,350
And there's like two things
left in this country, uh,

504
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,070
growing weed and fucking,
uh,

505
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,380
starting a nonprofit.
You know what I mean?

506
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,710
Most of those are bullshit anyways,
right? We got to help people. Uh,

507
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,410
we got two pinkies. There's
a bunch of paint, you know,

508
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,820
parent to Pankey's affects most people.
A lot of people don't even talk about it,

509
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,900
you know, all they do is
just make it sound like it's,

510
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:41,340
it's a bad thing and then you all of
a sudden you just giving them money.

511
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,580
It was probably a bad example,
but you know what I mean?

547
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,060

Joey. Yeah. Joe Rosa. Joe Doe.

550
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,620
Rosa.
Where there's something,

551

something and there's something
I was supposed to read.

552
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:27,710
Some all think comedy thing too. Where
the fuck is this? Say, where is it?

553
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,040
Hang on a second. Hang on a second.

00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,260
I got a tweet about this. I was supposed
to do this five fucking days ago.

562
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:06,110
What an asshole. I'm a tweet
about that right now. All right.

563
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:10,030
This has been the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday, Monday body podcast,

564
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:14,600
and I just checked in on you, uh, be a
little music here and then we'll play

565
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,720
a half hour is shit for a
podcast a long time ago.

566
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:25,040
Maybe a little bit of time ago, but, uh,
it's not gonna be this one. All right.

567
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,500
You can't have a great weekend.

568
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,073
Faster,

569
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,033
faster.

570
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,100
Hey,
what's

571
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,540
going on? It's a bill burr.
It's the Monday morning podcast.

572
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,190
Um, what is it? One 48,
one 49. There we go.

573
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:52,930
Just change west coast time and,
uh, I'm in a great fucking mood.

574
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,060
I'm not in the God Damn Airport,
you know?

575
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,800
Why don't we say, you know, like
you're gonna fucking talk back to me.

576
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,810
Um, no, I haven't. Great mood. I'm
actually in my apartment laying in my bed,

577
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:12,100
chilling the fuck out and uh,

578
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm in a great mood. Even though I
had a, uh, I had a fucked up week.

579
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,320
Really? Bill, you had a fucked
up week. Why is that? Well,
I'm going to tell you, um,

580
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,680
I've been making jokes over
the last four months about me.

581
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I'm driving a dented hybrid and
talking about how emasculating that is.

582
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,950
You know,
it's like already I'm driving a hybrid,

583
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,150
so I had to deal with everybody
going, oh, what do you effect?

584
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,913
You know what I mean?

585
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,390
Suggesting depth because I'm making the
air a little bit cleaner that for some

586
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,770
reason that on some level that means
I want to suck a dick, which is,

587
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,040
that's very childish,
yet effective yet effective.

588
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,450
It's very hard in a group situation,
one on one maybe can defend it,

589
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,530
but in a group situation when somebody
yells out, what are you affect?

590
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,420
What ends up happening is we'll even
guys who aren't in the social circle,

591
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:14,530
we'll start laughing and then it's
like, you know, you're fucked.

592
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,660
His people are laughing at the question
of what do you with saying like if you

593
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:24,520
suck Dick or whatever, you know, if you
were to start talking about, you know,

594
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:25,600
how,
uh,

595
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,280
you know how you're thinking about the
environment that actually digs the hole

596
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:34,000
deeper, you know, and the people
like, well maybe. Yeah, look at him.

597
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,860
He's talking about the environment.

598
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,740
Only people who are into the same
sex, uh, are into the environment.

599
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,330
They know. Funny actually about the
hybrid is a, when I bought it a year ago,

600
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,860
I got a ton of shit for it.

601
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,420
People make fun of the little tires
and everything else. You know,

602
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:55,990
but as gas prices have crept up,

603
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,660
I feel like for 60 to 40,

604
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:02,530
70 out here in the last Congolese,

605
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,080
um, all of a sudden people are now coming
up to me being like, oh, so what's,

606
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,130
uh, what's the deal with
those cars? You know?

607
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,840
And then they asked the usual dumb
questions like, can they go up the hill?

608
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,450
No, no, they can't.

609
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,510
Fortunately everywhere I want to go
involves driving on a perfectly level

610
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:27,220
surface if not a little bit downhill.

611
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,960
And then I have to say I take the long
way around and somehow I get back without

612
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,740
having to go back up the hill. I
just fucking drove down. I'm like,

613
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,770
what the it sell it God goddamn car
that doesn't go up the hill, you know,

614
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,300
asked me that question was my mother,

615
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,710
my mom asking me that
you were on a hybrid?

616
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,470
No, mom. I moved to Nebraska, moved
in Nebraska. That's what I did.

617
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,680
And it's funny,
there's no hills in Nebraska,

618
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,930
but there are tornadoes. Okay. Um,
okay, so this is what happened.

619
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,800
I've been driving around this fucking
dented car. Oh. If he knew that my page,

620
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,640
this is the Monday morning podcast and
I do one of these every single week,

621
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,040
you know,
people ask me questions,

622
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,880
people send me information and a whatever
and I babble about my life while I

623
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:23,161
hype upcoming gigs like the fact that
I'm going to be doing stand up on the

624
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,860
guys' choice awards this Sunday night,

625
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,810
June 22nd on spike TV guys,
choice awards.

626
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,840
I believe that comes on somewhere
between eight at night and four in the

627
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:41,050
morning. No, I think it's 10 o'clock
I don't know when the fuck it is.

628
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:44,320
If I was organized, I know that, but I
did six minutes of stand up that day.

629
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,320
I believe I'm going to whittle down to
three minutes and I had a great time and

630
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,890
there were a bunch of famous people there
and I was jumping up and down like a

631
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,700
girl scout inside, outside. I
was playing it cool. Like, Hey,

632
00:39:57,701 --> 00:40:01,570
they're a person who I've always admired.
How are you? Yes. Nice to meet you too.

633
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,940
And inside of like God, I can't believe
I just shook their head and they said,

634
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,420
nice job. You're funny. It was a thrill.

635
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,430
I had a great fucking time. Um,
so I got that coming up. Oh.

636
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:18,490
Also this week I'm going to be
at the punchline in Atlanta.

637
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,670
One of my favorite clubs. See
little boy, a great mood on man.

638
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,340
What's the last week's podcast?
That was not a good mood.

639
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,240
That was me in an airport wanting to get
the fuck out of there. Oh, by the way,

640
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,150
for those weekly listeners of my podcast,
you know,

641
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:35,020
I was going from Raleigh trying to get
back to la because it's fucking Raleigh.

642
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,220
There's no direct flight.

643
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:41,200
I had to fly from Raleigh up to Cleveland
and then from Cleveland to fucking La.

644
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,530
Well, uh, my connecting
my Raleigh to Cleveland,

645
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:48,790
the flight was late because wind,
if you remember. And when I,

646
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,610
by the time I got to Cleveland,
my flight to La had already left.

647
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:56,611
So I had to spend five fucking hours and
the Goddamn Cleveland fucking airport

648
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,980
with, with, with, with, uh,
what was the big give me.

649
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:04,981
They give me a $15 voucher to spend
five hours in that fucking airport.

650
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:09,550
And I was a, I did my usual, I flipped
out a little bit. I was like 50.

651
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,920
And The lady's like, well, you know, I
actually hooked you up. They usually, uh,

652
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,720
I gave you the dinner voucher.
The lunchtime voucher is only eight.

653
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,323
You know,

654
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,930
that's one of those times you just
want to reach them across and just grab

655
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:28,990
someone by the throat even though they
didn't make the rule just to make you

656
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:30,040
feel better and be like,
bitch,

657
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,380
you don't give me fucking those to
fitness fucking airport for eight hours.

658
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,530
All right,
I want,

659
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,570
I want one fucking 30 bucks and I want
free Internet. That's what I want. Okay.

660
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:43,340
I don't want some $50 voucher so I can,

661
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:48,230
they'll get a chicken sandwich
with mushrooms. Oh Shit.
Was that good? God dammit.

662
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,670
I had a good chicken sandwich in there.
It all worked out. So anyways, this,

663
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:55,530
this is, this is what happened
this week. So anyways,

664
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:59,810
so I've been driving around
this, uh, my, uh, my hybrid,

665
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,011
there was dented,

666
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:05,720
it got dented initially
cause some douchebag backed
into me and I got that fixed

667
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:10,250
immediately. And then the next time it
got dented it was because my girlfriend,

668
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,210
uh, I dunno, she misspoke
in a parking way,

669
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,780
put it that way and she fucking,
I dunno what she did,

670
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,720
but it came home and it looked like
fucking big foot had a pair of timberlands

671
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:27,950
on and stomp the Goddamn quarter panel.
So I've been driving around with that.

672
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,440
Right. Was scrape marks on the
side. It just, it just, you know,

673
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,220
as a man,

674
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,830
you don't want to have a car with a
den that it just makes you feel like a

675
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:37,664
fucking loser.

676
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:42,170
Forget about the fact that it's a hybrid
and it has those little fucking search

677
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:44,810
roll up size tires.
Okay.

678
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,890
So I finally get the thing
fixed after four months,

679
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,120
you know, cause I want to make sure she
learned how to parallel park, you know,

680
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,680
full. She fucked the thing up
again. So that's taken care of.

681
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,570
So I get the Goddamn thing fixed.
This is how excited I am.

682
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,180
I have, my girl comes to pick me up at
the airport as I'm hugging her, right?

683
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,640
Like World War II ended.

684
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,620
I'm looking over her shoulder looking
to see that there's no dent in the car.

685
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,880
And you know what I mean?

686
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,990
It's almost like I was cheating on
her in like an automotive kind of wet.

687
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,850
So I was excited. The fucking thing
look great. Everything was fantastic.

688
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:28,370
And I drove this car that was on Monday.

689
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,790
Thursday I go over my management's office.

690
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,080
I valet the fucking thing, one
of those deals where, you know,

691
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,940
I valet it but I park it cause there's
a spot right there. I go to my lunch,

692
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,660
I come back from lunch and there's
a fucking dent, my car again,

693
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,400
the exact same spot, the exact
same sites and now it's the bumper.

694
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,890
And I,
I swear to God,

695
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:56,030
I never understood the
expression I was beside myself.

696
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,310
I never knew what the fuck that meant.
But when in that moment I get it,

697
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,610
it's some sort of out of body
experience where I was just,

698
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:07,790
I had to look at my driver's license,
my license plate,

699
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,120
like seven times. I was
like, there's no fucking way.

700
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:14,240
That's my car is his camping my car.

701
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:18,480
And I just kept looking down and it was,
it was my fucking pot.

702
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,780
So then I look over at the valets,

703
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,280
okay mind you listen to the exact same
spot and they're not looking at me.

704
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,170
This is all shit I put together
afterwards. But I was so flustered.

705
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,273
I came up there,

706
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,310
I fucking voice went up like
nine office. Oh, he's even mad.

707
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,130
I was literally like a,
I felt like it was going to fake

708
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,750
it. Don't see those old movies when
they got some broad and you know,

709
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:49,320
they get their,

710
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,220
those dresses down to the floor that has
like 52 layers of underwear underneath

711
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,040
him.
That's why I should have had all my loads,

712
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,630
a fucking hoop skirt and I
should have just fainted.

713
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,020
Would one of those little umbrellas that
you spin around and it doesn't really

714
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:02,440
keep the rain or the sun off yet.

715
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,770
It's just supposed to make
you look more attractive.

716
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,300
I should have been holding one of
those and I, that's what I should've,

717
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,550
that's how flustered I was.

718
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,230
So the fucking parking attendants
are like, I'm like, well,

719
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,440
you know what happened to my car? And
they were just like, uh, yeah, they, uh,

720
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,290
somebody, uh, somebody hit
hit it, somebody, he, I might,

721
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,660
who hit it, I don't know. And a day
we backed it over there and, uh,

722
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,880
somebody here did back in the day,
that day, you know, everything,

723
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,130
the fucking word sounded like it
started with a d, You know, so,

724
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,893
um,

725
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,590
like I can't fucking believe in and then
they give me the sheet of paper to fill

726
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:41,710
out,
you know,

727
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,080
they should have told me that they fucking
did it because someone else hit me.

728
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,810
First of all,
you saw the fucking dentist con,

729
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,140
there's no way these guys didn't hear it,
you know,

730
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,770
and they just automatically give
me this form saying that they,

731
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,250
I guess they're going to pay for it.
So I'm filling the shit out.

732
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:03,020
And it wasn't until I drove away
that I started thinking about it,

733
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:07,820
I pulled over and I'm looking at the
dent and it's the exact same shape as the

734
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:09,980
polls in the garage.

735
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,370
So obviously one of those fuckers

736
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:19,040
drove it into a pole and then
after they drove it into a pole,

737
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,790
they stuck it back in the space where I,
where I had left it

738
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,100
and then tried to fucking, then they would
look and down, not make an eye contact.

739
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,880
I think they were trying to
hope that I didn't see it.

740
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,200
I hope one of those fucking guys is one
of my listeners every week. All right,

741
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:38,810
dude, why don't you just
fucking constantly and let
me know you did it. Okay.

742
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,890
I know. Like you don't want to get
fired, right? Is that what it is?

743
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,690
I just can't fucking
believe it, man. I just,

744
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,500
I it just so goddamn depressing my
fucking car. It's got another God. Damn.

745
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,260
I just got to fix four days.
I drove around for four days.

746
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,530
I don't understand it.
You know what I mean?

747
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:00,260
It's not like when my car
didn't have a dent in it.

748
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:03,230
I started driving around and making fun
of people who had dents in their cars.

749
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:05,270
So there was some sort of
fucking calmer going on.

750
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,650
Why didn't deserve to not
have a dentist fucking car. So

751
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,200
that's it. Now it's unreal,
man. I can't have a car.

752
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,030
It doesn't have a fucking Bennett.
And uh,

753
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,540
I really wish I didn't tell this story
because I started off in a great mood.

754
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,260
And as you can tell by my tone,
I'm not in such a great mood anymore.

755
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,860
It's just really fucking freshman.
I'd say what's extra frustrating?

756
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,210
They gave me this piece of paper with
some lady's name on it and they're like,

757
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,430
yeah, she doesn't call you in the
next five days. Give me a call.

758
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,600
And like I said, I was so
beside myself. I said, okay.

759
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,940
And it wasn't until day three.
I was like, wait a minute.

760
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,120
He doesn't call me in the next five days.

761
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:51,010
How about in the next five
fucking minutes? Fucking
idiot. You're ruined my car.

762
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,380
Or this phantom lady ruined it.

763
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,590
And then you got in it in it for some
fucking reason to put it back in the same

764
00:47:56,591 --> 00:48:00,760
spot. You five foot, two
inch fucking jackass.

765
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,450
I just, Oh, maybe that's why I put it.

766
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:09,150
Dennis came to see over the
fucking steering wheel. All right.

767
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:09,730
You know what,

768
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,970
I listened back to last week's podcast
and I just really felt like I sounded

769
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:15,700
like I was too God damn upset
on it and it was too depressing.

770
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:20,290
So I tried to start this one off and try
to stay focused in a good mood and then

771
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,303
look what happened.

772
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,290
What am I had 13 minutes
in and I'm already flipping
out again. I just, you know,

773
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,580
anybody else? Anybody else got any
fucking stories out there like that,

774
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:33,550
that can make me feel better?
Maybe I could read to some
of the listeners. I mean,

775
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:34,570
I want to hear some of your,

776
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:40,350
I fixed my car or I just bought a brand
new car and then some fucking cunt.

777
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,150
Jesus. No, no, no. I'll drop it.
The C word. All right. Let's look,

778
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:48,850
let's get back to my dates here.
Okay. Um, so that's the deal.

779
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,150
I haven't ended hybrid again. You know,
let's think of some positive shit.

780
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:59,440
The Celtics won one game,
like they had to out in la,

781
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,570
one of the greatest comebacks ever.
And, uh, they get to more in Boston.

782
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,170
Let's hope they're going to win it.
I actually went to game three,

783
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,200
Celtics lost that one, but
it was still awesome to go
to the, uh, go to the finals.

784
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:19,150
But I got to admit, man, they'll go,
referees were, uh, they were little,

785
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,200
they were crazy.

786
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,490
The amount of files that was the game
right after Phil Jackson was complaining.

787
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,080
Remember that game too when they called
56 files on the liquors and like three

788
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:33,460
on the Celtics. So he bitched about it
and I think the referees get pissed,

789
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:39,610
but kind of knew he was right. So they
were like calling a ton on the Celtics,

790
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,410
but they also kind of going, fuck you
Phil Jackson, we're still running shifts.

791
00:49:44,411 --> 00:49:48,040
So they still called a bunch on the
Lakers and I don't think the ball went up

792
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:51,190
and down the court three times
without them blowing the whistle.

793
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:55,810
Like there was never any sort of like
slow to the game and it kind of sucked as

794
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:59,290
a fan because they kept cock
blocking the excitement.

795
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,470
Even when the Lakers were going on a run,
you know,

796
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:04,680
even as a self expanse sitting
there, it was pretty, you know,

797
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,870
it was cool to see them going bananas
and feeling like I was at a finals.

798
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:11,470
But every time they'd start to go nuts,
they pull some ticky tack file.

799
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,150
And then the other way when they would
start getting quiet and I just touched

800
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,720
standing up talking shit, they, they,
they call another bullshit once. So

801
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:24,280
I don't know what the fuck they're
doing it. But in the last night's game,

802
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:27,500
I thought the officiating was really
weird. It was like the beginning the game,

803
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:29,060
like, all right, they're
going gonna let them play.

804
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,070
They will lighten the Mug each other,

805
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:32,720
and then all of a sudden
they stayed start calling.

806
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,950
They just ticky tack that it's not
consistent. Does that mean consistent?

807
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:41,750
Plus we lost, so I'm probably a
little cunty too. Um, but anyways, uh,

808
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,310
here we go.

809
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:47,310
The punchline in Atlanta this week from
June 19th to the 21st this is one of my

810
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:50,660
favorite gigs and I absolutely
loved going to that club.

811
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:54,100
It's just an old school club. If you live
anywhere near there, please come down.

812
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:58,400
I've got a brand new hour and I also have
a solution to the uh, the gas problem.

813
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,590
I really do something
that would be effective,

814
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,170
a very effective if did I say ineffective,

815
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,390
very effective within eat
and that wasn't a aspect.

816
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,080
Did like it. Uh, you know at,

817
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,150
that's one of those things I never know
the difference, the effect or effect.

818
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,420
It might have to look that up.
Um, all right. And then, uh,

819
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,770
July I'm going to be at the
Improv and Pittsburgh from uh,

820
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:25,000
July 10th through the 13th. Then, uh,

821
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,390
the next Gig I have after that
is July 31st through August.

822
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,980
The fuck is it? Hang on, hang on the page.
There's somebody at the comedy works.

823
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,730
That's what it is. Economy works
in Denver, Colorado from August,

824
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,820
I mean July 31st or is it 30th in to turn
the page the last fucking day in July

825
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,820
through a Saturday. August
2nd. Nice. No Sunday.

826
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,300
Got To love that. Yeah.
It's 31 days in July.

827
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:58,670
31 days have November except
for September and Friday.

828
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,040
Honestly, that one go. All right.
Um, do I have anything else to hype?

829
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,990
I think that's pretty much
it. Uh, podcast questions.

830
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:12,320
All of a sudden nobody's asked me podcast
questions about what happened last two

831
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:16,250
weeks. I didn't answer any questions to
now you guys, you can't ask me anything.

832
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:21,290
I got a question for you. Where the fuck
are all the questions? How you over it?

833
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,600
Um, I don't know why. Okay. I think
it's time to wrap this fucking thing up.

834
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,750
What the hell was I just looking up?
Oh,

835
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,970
effect an effect.

836
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,620
I'm trying to teach you guys something
effect and effect you like how I don't

837
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:40,310
know the difference and I'm going
to act like I'm teaching you.

838
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:42,200
Which of these sentences are correct.

839
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,040
Rising oil prices will have
an effect on nearly everyone.

840
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,130
That's correct. With
an [inaudible], right?

841
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:53,320
Why don't you just give me the fucking
definition I hit when they do this?

842
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,700
Her emotional outbursts
first was purely for effect.

843
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,510
You know, wait a minute. All
of these sentences correctly,

844
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:04,160
employee effect and effect.

845
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,150
In most situations we use effect
is a noun and an effect is a verb.

846
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,670
Well, what the fuck did they mean? How
about giving me a definition first?

847
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,490
You know what? This is like. This is
like how they, I was taught Algebra,

848
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,463
you know what I mean?

849
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:24,250
Like everything would math up
until eighth grade for me anyways,

850
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,340
was numbers.
If you fucking Asian,

851
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:28,470
I'm sure you were doing
calculus in the third grade,

852
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,530
but let's just stick with your random
fucking stupid American hair. All right?

853
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,940
Right up to eighth grade,
it was all fucking numbers.

854
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:38,730
Then all of a sudden ninth grade comes
around and they throw the fucking

855
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:43,160
alphabet in there and there was no soda
before they go in, you know, little,

856
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,990
little speech like, Hey, this is
going to be a little different.

857
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,940
The do just started doing it. He
just started throwing, you know,

858
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:54,900
foil first outside,
inside last, uh, you know,

859
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,400
dial it all that high school man,

860
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,610
opposite angles are congruent and
none of his shit may and you just,

861
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,420
you just repeated it like you were
in a cult. They just stand up.

862
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,540
They opposite angles are congruent.
Opposite angles are congruent.

863
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,930
Did nobody had any idea what the fuck
they went to and they just had a triangle

864
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,750
on the board?
That's what this website is like.

865
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,710
Get it right online.com.
Uh,

866
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,650
there's no fucking definition

867
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,750
how these fly correctly. Webster's
curse this birthday. Fucking thanks.

868
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,250
All right. Hey, is this exciting?

869
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:33,510
Is this an exciting podcast as I attempt
to fucking look up Goddamn word and

870
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:37,290
fail miserably.
Effect effect.

871
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,290
Cause you didn't do this shit at work
and that's the mission, you know,

872
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:47,010
and you try to look up like Robbie
Knievel and try to guess what year he was

873
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:48,930
born. All right, here we go.

874
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,860
Perfect definition of effect

875
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,490
to have an influence or
effect or a change in,

876
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,570
you know what? Fuck this word.
Okay. You know what I mean?

877
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,930
That's like the difference
between a truck and a car.

878
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:12,270
And in the definition of
car, they describe it as a
fucking truck. You know what?

879
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,940
Sometimes you got to cut your losses
and you got to realize that you're not

880
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:19,790
going to know some things in
life. So that's just one of
them, you know? All right.

881
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:23,520
What does this podcast, this has just
been spam for the last three minutes.

882
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,910
I apologize. Um, you know
what? I just had to eat.

883
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,310
You know what?

884
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,250
I should actually turn this into a
contest and say I'm going to give out,

885
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:36,780
give you a free 100 DVDs. If you
could guess what the fuck I just ate,

886
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,100
cause you'll never guess what
it was thicker than most. Okay?

887
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm going to give you hints and
you can all play along at home.

888
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:49,560
All right? This is
something, it's a dessert.

889
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,650
It's uh,

890
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,180
something that they used to have creepy
commercials about with a high pitched

891
00:55:57,181 --> 00:56:00,450
voice and you put it in the freezer.

892
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,630
Three answer into one.

893
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,780
I actually just has slice of cookie puss.

894
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,660
There's no way to say that
without fucking laugh.

895
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:21,140
And I just had a piece of cookie ice
cream cake, whatever the fuck you call it,

896
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:25,870
it's ice cream and cake. Just like
affect an effect. Did the same thing.

897
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:29,440
It's fucking incestuous. And
you, I got to tell you something.

898
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:30,550
If you've never had it,

899
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:35,110
it's just as disgusting as it sounds.
You know what I mean?

900
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:39,670
Some things are just named perfectly
and cookie posts. It just what it is.

901
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:44,671
It's a stank ranked slutty
ass fucking disgusting cake.

902
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,470
Like if, if, uh, who's
the right horde of pickup?

903
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,300
Just going to say a Paris Hilton
was a cake. She wouldn't be,

904
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:01,120
she'd be like a fucking blow pop.
Sorry. Uh, I don't fucking know.

905
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,820
All right. Whatever. My sugar
levels up through the fucking roof.

906
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:06,310
Why do I have up God damn
fucking ice cream cake?

907
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,220
Because I turned 40 last Tuesday

908
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:14,620
gym on Sunday. That's the way I was
dying. I rejoined, I'm like, fuck this.

909
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:18,460
It turned 40 on Tuesday. Let
me, let me bang out 500 sit ups.

910
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,120
The last 500 sit ups would
be in 39 years old. Um,

911
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,130
yeah. Yeah. It's pretty fucking brutal.

912
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,900
But I'll tell you something and
somebody shows up, you know,

913
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:31,360
you have a party place and somebody
shows up with a cookie, puss,

914
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:35,860
ice cream and you know, it's not that bad.
Not because you eat it, it tastes good.

915
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:37,270
You're more thinking like, well, you know,

916
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:40,630
maybe I was addicted to sweets I need
and his fucking horse shit every day.

917
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,250
All right. Did we learn
anything this week? Yes we did.

918
00:57:45,251 --> 00:57:49,330
We're going to learn that bill burr.
It's going to be on the fucking the, uh,

919
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,550
that's like guys choice
awards this Sunday. And uh,

920
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,760
somewhere between eight and
4:00 AM on Spike TV and a,

921
00:57:58,761 --> 00:58:02,740
I am the VP at the punch
line in Atlanta and uh,

922
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:07,770
I don't know the definition of
effect and aspect and a cookie puss.

923
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:13,310
Ice Cream tastes like
it tastes like Eskimo.

924
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,720
Uh, yeah. You went down on
a fucking Eskimo cooker.

925
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,490
It's really fucking, it's,
it's just, it's fucking awful.

926
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,850
Let me see if I can just,
first of all, some Carvel.

927
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,440
It's got a big green fucking
ice cream nose with a Conan.

928
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:34,810
And I just can't imagine like
you ever see those people?

929
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,030
They're so fat that
like fucking bedridden.

930
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:41,170
This is the kind of shit that
they eat because you know,

931
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:43,510
everybody's out of shape.
I'm fucking out of shape right now.

932
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:46,330
You know what I mean? Everybody, once
you get past 30, you got a fucking gun.

933
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,830
Nobody looks good without their shirt on.

934
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,370
It's everybody stopped winding on
that fucking biggest loser. Okay?

935
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,740
No one looks good to quit
your crying. Okay. But uh,

936
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,350
those people who gets so big that
they're just fucking bed written,

937
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:01,150
you really have to go out of your way.

938
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:06,810
You have to go above and
beyond to get that big,

939
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,990
you know what I mean?
Slow metabolism.

940
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,920
Fuck you and your fucking metabolism.
No you don't.

941
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:19,780
You are eating cookie puss nightly,
nightly basis.

942
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,430
I had just had a snack. What
did you have? I had cookie puss.

943
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,470
All fucking 3000 fucking calories a slice.

944
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,290
Here we go. And that's how I like
to fucking ended. I liked to,

945
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:35,680
to attack the band written and that's it.
That's the Monday morning podcast APP.

946
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:39,530
Please, uh, re up with the questions.
I swear to God, I'll read them.

947
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,130
I will answer them next week, and somebody
please give me a fucking definition,

948
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:48,290
the difference between effect and effect,
because, you know, I said, you know,

949
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:51,170
I looked it up and they use the definition
of the other word in the fucking

950
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,830
definition, which is annoying.
All right. Um, that is it. Uh,

951
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,540
thanks to everybody came up to me to
see my show in Raleigh, North Carolina.

952
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:03,950
It's the most disjointed fucking podcast
ever. Um, did I use that word correctly?

953
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:09,530
Um, in Raleigh, north Caroline's, um,

954
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,620
I'm adding a bunch of new dates coming up.

955
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,600
I got a date coming up with
the stress factor in New
Jersey. Uh, I got to college.

956
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:20,740
Umass Amhurst going to be
adding that date shortly.

957
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,600
Uh, what else? What else? I
don't know. Sometime in August,

958
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,540
beginning of September. So look for
those dates and, uh, anything else,

959
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:34,120
just go to billboard.com and,
um, and that's it. All right.

960
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,780
You have to weaker.

961
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,840
[inaudible]

962
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,240
[inaudible].
