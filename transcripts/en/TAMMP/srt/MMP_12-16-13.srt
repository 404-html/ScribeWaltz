1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,990
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,900
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:09,230
December 16th,

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,620
2013 and I am recording here on,
um,

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,450
it's actually December 17th.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,780
I'm finally back from Europe.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,533
Uh,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,030
I apologize for the podcast
being so late, but, um,

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,110
I was in Iceland and when the fuck
am I ever going to be there again.

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:31,090
So I had to do some shit Sunday and then
Monday I was flying all the way back

11
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:35,270
and uh, I'm actually not that
jet lagged. It worked out nice.

12
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:39,070
I tried and I tried to, I tried
to stay up on the plane. Oh.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,680
Try to stay awake as long as I could a
for most of the flight because I knew

14
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:43,700
that I was landing.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,793
MMM.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,960
At 7:00 PM La time,
seven 25 or something.

17
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,600
So I figured if I could just
fucking stay up, you know,

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,360
Nia picks me up the airport. I just get
my ass home and then if I fall asleep,

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,771
it'll be like nine,

20
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:02,200
10 o'clock at night and I'm back on
the clock and it worked out good.

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,000
I woke up right. But we do
little dude. And I looked at
the clock. Why, why, why, why,

22
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,920
why?
And I wondered what the fuck time it was.

23
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:11,410
I thought it was like two something
in the morning because my clock,

24
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:14,860
it fell off the bed day or the digital
one day that I've had since to fucking

25
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,290
seventies there.
And uh,

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,050
I thought it said two 30 in
the morning and I was like,

27
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:24,580
you gotta be fucking kidding
me. I thought, I, I thought
I did it right. And uh,

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,760
then all of a sudden I'm at six o'clock
and I realized the clock was upside down

29
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:30,640
and that was five 30.
Is this even remotely exciting?

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,080
I don't know if it is or not.

31
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,650
I'm trying to keep my voice down because
the lovely knee is still sleeping

32
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:39,200
upstairs. Beautiful Angel
that she is. And uh,

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,960
I got my dog down Ham psyched
going to go hiking today.

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,400
Get back into it.

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,170
I swear to God I don't have the
nerve to step on the God damn scale.

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,220
All right.
And if I sound like some skinny bitch,

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,750
well fuck you.

38
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,190
I'm in this business and I read your
tweets and I see when you see my face,

39
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:02,440
you start calling me a fat cunt.
All right.

40
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:06,820
And I gotta tell you it hurts
sometimes, right? No, seriously, no.

41
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm saying you gotta be if
you're in this business.

42
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,950
So I think I put on at least 10,
12 pounds.

43
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,940
I started eating like a
fucking Goddamn Roman God

44
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,240
three weeks ago in Italy. And
it never, it never stopped.

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,720
I kept thinking to myself like, all
right, when a, when the tour starts,

46
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:29,140
when the tour starts, I'm going to
be fucking good. And we discipline.

47
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,390
But it just didn't work
out that way. It was, um,

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,893
okay.

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,470
This past week, I just, uh, I
think I mentioned it last week.

50
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,900
I did a seven country,
seven city run and uh,

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,120
what was it? Six cities? London, Dublin,
Helsinki, Copenhagen, also Sweden.

52
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:51,530
Okay. Six. But I did two nights in
London, so it was seven nights in a row.

53
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,413
MMM.

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,720
Basically touring like a band, how
they do it. And I have a whole new,

55
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,960
for anybody that's touring as a band.

56
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,060
And that was hard enough to do
by myself with no equipment.

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,860
I don't have to bring anything. I just
fucking show up. Mike and I, Mike Stand,

58
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,090
go up to the microphone.

59
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,060
I love when they want to or you want
to do a sound check? It's like, well,

60
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:19,360
did it sound okay when you talked to
do it? Well, yeah. Well, there you go.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,940
What am I gonna do? Go up there.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Cunt con con,

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,230
you know. So anyways, uh,

63
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:33,820
I lost another mixer on this fucking trip.
Fool me once.

64
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,290
Shame on you, fool me twice.
Oh, red faces a dumb fuck. Uh,

65
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,200
there's something about these hundred
dollar mixers. Believe it or not,

66
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,010
they don't have any sort of a,
I dunno,

67
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,590
something to prevent the surge.

68
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,910
I don't know what it is
because I had the adapter, um,

69
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,630
or the converter or I should
say convert and all the adapter.

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,570
I forget what that fucking guy in
Helsinki dressed me down two years ago on.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,390
It does not a a,
doesn't though.

72
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,960
You are not converting the electricity.
You are adopting it towards your devices.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes. Oh, fuck you. Hans.
Um, uh, what's the,

74
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,000
no, it's a good Swedish name.
I don't, our fin finished name.

75
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,210
I have no fucking idea. This podcast
is going to be all over the map.

76
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,340
I Apologize One more time for the,
uh, the sound quality here. Um,

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,500
you know my mixes, shit, the bed,
I just discovered that. So, uh,

78
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,900
but the good thing is the
all things comedy networks,

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,520
new studios are up and running and um,

80
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,720
hopefully,
uh,

81
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:41,980
I have a nice surprise guest that
I'm going to try to be interviewing.

82
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,940
He's got a big movie coming out.
Look at me, teasing it, teasing it,

83
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,950
tickling you with it.
Uh,

84
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,410
but I don't want to say that he's going
to be on it because I know he's fucking

85
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:54,790
busy doing press for it. But, uh, I
ran into him when I was in Dublin,

86
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,890
which was the greatest fucking thing ever.

87
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,890
Him and his friends were fucking hype
in the movie and I was in Dublin and we

88
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:04,420
just went out and fucking drank and sang
Christmas songs. It was fucking awesome.

89
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,980
Such a great tour. And, uh, yeah,

90
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,230
at the risk of being Corny,

91
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,260
I got to tell you at one point I was
doing the second show in Finland and I had

92
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,360
this feeling when I was on stage that
I was doing exactly what the fuck I'm

93
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,970
supposed to be doing in life.
I can't explain it.

94
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:29,140
There's something about making people
laugh that far away from where,

95
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,850
uh, where you live and
where you speak a language.

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,280
And if you're still connecting that,

97
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,050
that's pretty much about as great an
affirmation that, you know, I'm really,

98
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,370
I'm supposed to be doing it.
This shit is still working this far away.

99
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,120
Um, oh, what a fucking week.
What a week. I got sites,

100
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,000
subs right now I did a show in Dublin,

101
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:59,150
Ireland and all
the crowds were great,

102
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,920
but I gotta tell you those fucking
people in Ireland as a funniest,

103
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,500
I can't even explain.

104
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,430
Okay.

105
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,121
I sweat it.
Well,

106
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:12,060
there's something about like when I
go through Great Britain and Ireland,

107
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,370
it's like Scotland and Ireland.

108
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,110
They liked the knuckleheads that I
grew up with and when I go to London,

109
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,800
London is like,
was,

110
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,170
is kind of like all the people that I met
when I went to New York that were from

111
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:29,350
Boston. So they, they did move
away from where they were from,

112
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:33,430
but they still brought that thing with
them cause people in London are hilarious.

113
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:38,431
But I was doing a show Dublin
on Monday night at the,

114
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:42,820
the, the vicar, a vicar street theater
or something. Just this awesome venue.

115
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,780
By the way, Jim Gaffigan's going to
be there if any UI, Irish console.

116
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,820
Listen to this. You got to go see him.
I was supposed to tweet about that.

117
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm going to do that today. I'm hilarious.
Jim Gaffigan's going to be there. Um,

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,890
and uh, anyway, so it was,

119
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,220
it was on a Monday night and it's a
really hard night to try and sell tickets

120
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,830
and these people showed up in force
and I can't even tell you how they,

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,240
they,
they were fucking hilarious.

122
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:14,241
Like I was on stage and there was this
thing I was talking about about people

123
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:19,170
hugging their kids and how
that could put is a good thing.

124
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,750
But if you do it too much it could
potentially make a week or so.

125
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,250
I mentioned it all.

126
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,290
I've been telling this story for like
six to eight months and I've been saying

127
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,600
how that, you know, my
mother wasn't a hug,

128
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,160
hug her and didn't hug us when we were
kids and people just listen and it's just

129
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,760
a small detail that leads to this
other part that I want to talk about.

130
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,600
So I've said that line

131
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,320
uneventfully that's even a
fucking work with, with no,

132
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,490
no issue whatsoever for like six months.

133
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,990
Now I'm in fucking Ireland and I just
throw that line out there like I'm not

134
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,520
even thinking about it and
say, yeah. I said, you know,

135
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:00,880
my mother didn't hug me when I was a kid
and I'm getting ready to say the next

136
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:04,630
sentence. And like 15%
of the crowd goes, aw,

137
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,630
I'm not even doing it the way they did.

138
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,320
It just collectively broke my boss.

139
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,590
It was just such the classic fucking,

140
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,060
it was like that Boston Irish thing that
I grew up with distilled to its purest

141
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:26,890
form with actually real Irish people were,
I,

142
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,290
you'd almost have to be that a
fucking understand what was behind it.

143
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,070
It was like I opened the emotional door,

144
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:38,570
just a crack in automatically.
It's just,

145
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:41,660
they just bust your balls about it.
Like, ah, you're fucking, you know what?

146
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,640
Like you think they,
I think we got hugs.

147
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,730
You freckled can't shut the fuck up and
tell the judge I can't even, it just, I,

148
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:52,580
I've been trying to, I would
try to explain it to Nia.
She laughed, but still, yeah,

149
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:57,480
you kind of had to be there and
you know,

150
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,940
so I left that when my fucking
trying to get your sympathy,

151
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,290
I'm trying to get to this mess.
Next part.

152
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,160
You assholes and the whole crowd fucking
left. And then like a half hour later,

153
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,890
what I had done when I was over there
was I bought a bunch of DVDs with me. Um,

154
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,630
like just the,
uh,

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,230
basically the DVD itself
with this little paper thing.

156
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,840
And I was just handing them out to people
cause I'm trying to get them to show

157
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,000
other people,
you know,

158
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,880
when I'm out there so
I can keep coming back.

159
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,790
Basically trying to get them to
spread the word and my comedy.

160
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,340
And then someone's just like,
well why don't you just put it on Spotify?

161
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:31,980
You dumb fuck. And I'm like,
yeah cause I'm old. Alright.

162
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,550
I feel like I have to bring the hard copy.
So I tell these assholes

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,080
that I'm giving him free DVDs at the
end of the show and I'm halfway through

164
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:46,680
that Spiel, telling them that they're
getting a free DVD. All right?

165
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,550
And I'm in the middle of it and I hate
this guy in the back of the crowd goes,

166
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,230
Oh fuck off.

167
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,440
I don't even think I even
explained what I was doing.

168
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,780
I don't know if I had gotten to
the part where they were free.

169
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,820
I don't know what the fuck.

170
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,630
Always the fact that I was trying to
once again go to a nice place where, hey,

171
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,640
you know,
I really appreciate you guys coming out.

172
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:15,360
This really means a lot to me and I want
to keep coming back here cause I think

173
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,720
you've got a great comp country
or whatever it. And I said,

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,570
just opening the door that much.
Oh fuck off.

175
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,350
So I finally just looked and I went,
Jesus Christ,

176
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,380
they were already laughed and I was
like, you know what? I played in 20,

177
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,240
almost 22 years as a comedian.

178
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I have played in front of some
miserable motherfuckers but you guys,

179
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:40,260
and they were already laughing or the
most miserable fucking concert I've ever

180
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:44,970
been in. And they loved it,
absolutely loved it. And um,

181
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,960
it killed me that I couldn't go out
drinking with the crowd cause they had a

182
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,320
fucking go a head, an early flight of
course, all the way over to Helsinki.

183
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,970
But um,

184
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,010
and it was just kind of those moments
all the way through the tour that were

185
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:03,210
unreal. Like, uh, in Helsinki, I hope
I'm not boring you guys with this shit,

186
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,470
but I'm in Helsinki.

187
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:09,471
I did two shows and the first show I
went out and I just like felt like I

188
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,090
couldn't get on a roll for
like a lot of the show.

189
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,920
Like I that get last
and then it would stop.

190
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:20,630
I would get laughs and then it would
stop. And I was like, and, and,

191
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,530
and it got to the point that there
was one point in the first show that

192
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:30,510
something I said bombed so hard that
I almost got a little depressed.

193
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,280
And I definitely thought,

194
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,960
because in my head I was
thinking about like, wow,

195
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:41,580
I think I've reached the limits to where
my act works once I get on the other

196
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:42,870
side of the Baltic Sea.

197
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,900
And you really feel that when you get
on the other side of the Baltic Sea,

198
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:50,400
you get that feeling like, you know,
we're, I'm not in Europe anymore.

199
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,920
You're starting to feel like I am
heading towards the Soviet Union. Um,

200
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,050
even though, you know, a good one,

201
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,190
20% of that country is in Europe or
you just get this, I can't explain it.

202
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,960
You're definitely,
you're in eastern Europe.

203
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,420
You starting to get like that Baltic
Slavic fucking vibe and, and um,

204
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,380
I had to use all these tricks that I've
learned as a comedian over the years to

205
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,250
basically stop the, uh, I dunno what the,

206
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,630
the proverbial comedy jet from
going into a spin and you know,

207
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,480
crashing into the ground. I just
committed harder. I started, um,

208
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,840
Improv on f trying to tag
every joke with something new,

209
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:35,350
something to get me present.
Um, and I was able to,

210
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,900
I still had a good show and everything
and I know they had a good time,

211
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:41,320
but I was thinking in my head like, man,
this guy wanted me to go to Astonia,

212
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,050
which is basically like a fucking
50 minute boat ride from, uh,

213
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,270
Finland. And I was thinking like,
there's no fucking way I'm going there.

214
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,410
I think I've reached the end.

215
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,690
And then something happened during
the second show or I was talking about

216
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:03,691
getting a gun and how I liked this one
gun because it was quieter and those

217
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:06,730
bigger ones at too fucking loud and if
you pull the trigger you're going to

218
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,880
fucking destroy your ears and
they're laughing and shit.

219
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,520
And then as I come to the end of the joke,
you know,

220
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:16,570
they laughed and then it was kind of quiet
and then some guy in the crowd yelled

221
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:21,040
out, you know, get a
silencer. And I was like,

222
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,900
well silencers are illegal where I'm
at. I know in Jacksonville, Florida,

223
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,640
their legal,
cause I used them but they're illegal.

224
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,520
Rahmat they basically say that,
you know,

225
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:35,440
I want to murder somebody and I don't want
anybody to know, um, in the next room.

226
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,890
And then it just dawned
on me and I was like, I,

227
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,433
I,
I just,

228
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,360
I've been in front of really smart crowds
before and they laugh and shut up and

229
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:49,540
laugh and shut up these fucking
guys that people were so smart.

230
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,050
They were sitting there, they were
trying to solve the problem of the joke.

231
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,980
They're laughing at the joke
while coming up with solutions.

232
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:00,430
So I finally said to him, I said, listen,
I was like, is this what you guys doing?

233
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,060
All right. I'm like, this isn't a,
this isn't a fucking think tank.

234
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,650
It's just a comedy show.

235
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,650
And then I somehow connected with them
in that moment and then I had him for the

236
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:15,190
rest of the way and I just
started riffing on that.

237
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,840
Anytime a joke would only do okay.

238
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,320
I would just start riffing on like
the solution to whatever the joke was.

239
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,320
And that got them back in it
and I was able to get on, uh,

240
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,810
get on a roll with them.
And um,

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,360
it was just kind of that all
all week dude. And I was,
oh my God, fucking Helsinki.

242
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,370
I watched the sun go down at like three
30 in the afternoon from my hotel.

243
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,810
I think by the time I got there. That's
right. By the time I got to Helsinki,

244
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:44,970
cause I had to connect
in London at a frau. Um,

245
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,060
which by the way is,
um,

246
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,440
if you ever have to go
to Heathrow airport,

247
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:54,650
I would suggest doing two hours
of yoga before you get there.

248
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:58,130
It is a unbelievable
test of your patients,

249
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,140
of your cardio is sanity and it's fucking,

250
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,710
and I, of course, you know me, I failed
miserably. I lose my shit at LAX.

251
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,290
Um, put it this way, if
you, if you can avoid,

252
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,130
if you ever go to Europe,

253
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:18,910
here's a travel tip for you
and you could avoid connecting.

254
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,460
If you're not going to London,
I would highly, highly recommend

255
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,570
not connecting in London because
it's not like connecting in other,

256
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,950
other,

257
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,690
I've never had to.
You get off,

258
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,160
you got to run through a whole terminal
and then wait for a bus that isn't

259
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,480
coming for seven minutes.

260
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,110
And then by the time the bus
comes to so many fucking people,

261
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,520
or there's already too many people,

262
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:47,000
you got to wait for the next bus and
another seven minutes you finally get on

263
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:47,834
that fucking thing.

264
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,790
And it is a shit show.
Um,

265
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,070
oh and by the way,
if anybody lights up a cigarette,

266
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,270
it's going to be too foggy for anything,
the land.

267
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:59,570
So you're going to be delayed
wherever the hell you're at. A,

268
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,650
I went through that fucking thing

269
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,420
three times. Um, it, it's
still, it's still an a,

270
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,120
it's an incredible airport.
It's stills,

271
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,040
just the sheer size of it you have
to respect. But I have to tell you,

272
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,410
give yourself plenty of time
if you can to connect. Uh,

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,920
yeah, it's uh, it's a, it's a fucking
nightmare. Um, I don't know what,

274
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,210
so where the hell did I go from there?

275
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,790
I think I went to Copenhagen after that.

276
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,140
Copenhagen. Yep. I did a show there
that was fucking amazing. And uh,

277
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,170
I got you guys got to forgive me.
All the comedians that I work with,

278
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,870
cause I went night after night
after night after night and uh,

279
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,610
you guys had some pretty crazy names.
Uh, I think this guy's name was,

280
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,630
was a Christian or something like that. I
can't remember. Really, really smart guy.

281
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:52,750
Really cool guy and gave me
a bunch of tags for jokes.

282
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,770
And they were actually really funny. A
lot of times when somebody does that, uh,

283
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,120
the fucking horrific but up and you got
to sit there smiling like, yeah, you know,

284
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,090
we're going to try that.
His were actually great. Um,

285
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,820
uh, so what else? What
else? What else? Um,

286
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,490
AH, fuck. You know what? I just realized
I left it upstairs when I was in Iceland,

287
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,180
one of the two comedians that opened
up for me, both of them were great.

288
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,620
I couldn't understand what the
fuck they was saying, but uh,

289
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,600
one of them gave me a book. I'm going to
hit pause and I go upstairs and get it.

290
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:27,720
If you guys like, you know, like
those, you don't like those,

291
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,850
those cartoon strips like the far side,

292
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,450
which just a picture and they
write something funny. All right,

293
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:38,280
well if you like something absolutely
just completely sick and twisted.

294
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,110
I just sit down and record her.
Hang on. I'm going to look,

295
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm going to look it up right now.

296
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,910
I got to find this because
it's fucking hilarious. I mean,

297
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,980
he was killing like all the
comics I was with. We would just,

298
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,380
after we did the show, went to dinner
and we were uh, passing the book around,

299
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:56,790
laughing our asses off.
Let's see. I hate dolphins.

300
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,780
There it is.
I hate dolphins.

301
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,560
A
book.

302
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,600
Where the fuck is it? Come on man.
It came up. I saw when it came up.

303
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,920
Hold on.

304
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,390
I mean one of his uh, one of
his cartoons, there it is,

305
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,970
one of his cartoons has a stick figure.
It like stick figures,

306
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,040
drawings and he's running is a,

307
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,060
it's a father running after his kids
with this like acoustic guitar over his

308
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:38,184
head.

309
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,280
Okay.

310
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,570
And screaming. It's your
fault. I'm not a rock star.

311
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,630
And then one of the little kids
running away is going daddy. No,

312
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,180
and it's just

313
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,730
another one is you got two guys are
standing over another stick figure that's

314
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:03,970
laying on the ground and it looks like
it's just blown his brains out and one of

315
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,800
the stick figures looks at the other end,
goes

316
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,610
something like you want to fuck them.

317
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,250
It's just the darkest,

318
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,530
sickest shit he's got two books is other,

319
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:25,660
one's called something like
my pussies Hungary. I don't
know what it is. This guy,

320
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,890
I don't know how to say his
fucking name. It's just search.

321
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,900
I hate dolphins and the
comedian's name, it's who, who,

322
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,790
who, who will occur. I don't know.

323
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,660
Hug Liquor Dobson and it's spelled h.

324
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:45,740
U. G. L. E. I. K. U r.

325
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,870
And his last name is d. A.
G. O. S. S. O. N. M. Man.

326
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:55,070
This fucking focus. Hilarious. Half the
shit. That's funny. As you look at it,

327
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:59,300
you laugh and then you hand it to your
friend and he's looking at it and his,

328
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,631
you know,

329
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,360
you read what it says and he got to
kind of look at the picture and put it

330
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:06,530
together. So watching your
friend taken in the joke is,

331
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,070
is I think it's even more enjoyable.
But um,

332
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,870
he was fucking funny man.
He broke my balls when he brought me up,

333
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:18,940
like switched into English and uh, I
forget him. What the fuck he was saying.

334
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,900
It was just great. And the guy who
came on before, I was also awesome.

335
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,390
They're just really, really funny
people. Dude, Iceland is insane.

336
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,840
You know,
they have an app over there

337
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,700
that basically when you meet somebody
and you want to start dating them,

338
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,820
you just search it and you
see how you're related.

339
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,710
It'll show how you're related.
I want to say that again.

340
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,240
They have an APP over there.

341
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,070
You meet a woman in a bar or a
woman meets a guy or whatever,

342
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:51,880
a couple of twinkle toes
meet each other there. Um,

343
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,990
you're fucking,
you're just a,

344
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,060
there's an APP that will say,

345
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:03,010
not if you're related how you're related
because everybody there is fucking

346
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,960
related. Um, and you know
what's funny there? Absolutely.

347
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,880
The fucking great looking people. So I
think they spread it out far and wide.

348
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,080
Oh they, they actually, the,
the cab drivers over, they
have a joke in Iceland. Uh,

349
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,310
and people in Great Britain and
Ireland aren't going to like this.

350
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,270
They basically sit cause people always
talk about how beautiful the women are.

351
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,190
And they said they,
well basically the vikings,

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,110
when they would conquer other people,
they would just take all the good look,

353
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,530
good looking women and they would
take him away with them. Um,

354
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,540
talk about the ultimate defeat. Yeah.
Take my farm land. I don't give a shit.

355
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,210
You take all the beautiful women
for the fuck am I supposed to do?

356
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,930
Just kill me now.
So they're saying that they,

357
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,850
they took them all out of Great Britain,
took him out of England, Scotland,

358
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,130
Wales, and Ireland, and they took him
off to Iceland. And that's why they,

359
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,840
women are so much better looking and
that there's no good looking women.

360
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:00,850
And the other one, which isn't
true, but of course they say that,

361
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:03,400
but it's fucking hilarious.
Um,

362
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,470
and also they fucking eat everything
because they live on an island.

363
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,030
So when you go to the menu, um,
they had pigeon on the menu,

364
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,930
but I think that that's
their word for dove. Um,

365
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,010
a buddy of mine, he ordered it. I
had a piece of it tasted all right,

366
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:24,520
little fucking gay me.
And then they also had whale and I was,

367
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,370
the only thing that I didn't like
about Iceland was there's a number of

368
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,490
restaurants that you went into
when you could actually eat whale,

369
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,110
which to me is like eating an elephant.
You know what I mean?

370
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,780
There's just certain animals.

371
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,723
MMM.

372
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,440
You know,
like look,

373
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:46,700
if they had like a jackal sandwich or
a fucking hyenas sandwich, you know,

374
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,880
this certain animals where you just like,
you know what, you a cut. All right. Or,

375
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,950
or there's enough of you like, I'll eat
venison. I don't give a fuck. You know,

376
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:59,330
there's plenty of God damn deer running
around with their disease ticks. Okay.

377
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,440
Fucking up the front ends of a bunch of
cars. I don't give a shit about that,

378
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:07,490
but whales, I mean, they're
like endangered. Oh, he must
not be in danger because,

379
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,500
or at least Iceland doesn't give a fuck.

380
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:13,030
I don't really understand how that works,
but um,

381
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,150
did you could actually eat one meal

382
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,050
and I was just like, I, that
that was the only thing that,

383
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:26,180
that upset me when I was a,
when I was in Iceland.

384
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,180
Iceland is fucking unbelievable.
Uh,

385
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,460
you walk around and I recommend
going in the winter time.

386
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,950
Don't go in the summer when
there's a bunch of people,

387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,520
Jean shorts walking around. Fuck
that. You go in the summertime

388
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,420
and,
uh,

389
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,020
I got this thing, the blue lagoon spa
there that you go into. It's, it's fun.

390
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,390
I can't even describe it to it.
It's fucking insane.

391
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:50,660
You're in this fucking giant salt water,

392
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,680
like pool that's heated.
There's steam coming off it.

393
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,550
You're surrounded by snow and
everything just looks blue.

394
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,870
It's like you have on those,
uh, someone was saying, uh,

395
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,280
Mitch Hedberg rest his soul,

396
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:08,720
those blue tinted sunglasses that he
used to where it's like you're wearing

397
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:12,030
those fucking things. Um, I don't know.

398
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,830
It was an absolutely amazing,
amazing fucking amazing, uh,

399
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,870
trip. Uh, had a great time
in Sweden. I just don't want
to leave any city out here.

400
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,810
Sweden, I performed in this, this
theater. Uh, it almost looked like a,

401
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,600
you were in like a, uh, a circus
tent, but it was a theater.

402
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,120
Like when you looked out, you felt
like he was standing in the middle,

403
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:35,030
but it was like, cause it was like
in the round, but not totally.

404
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,120
It was like a semicircle kind of thing.
MMM.

405
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,330
And Oslow also was a place I spent
the least amount of time, but I,

406
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,960
I just had a great time for smoke.
The fucking Cuban cigar.

407
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,710
That's another great thing.
Cubans aren't legal and um,

408
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,440
there are ways to get them back
in the country. Wink, wink. Um,

409
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,730
let's just say that daddy is going to
be fucking drinking a lot of scotch over

410
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:05,640
the next month. Um, and
it's also a great thing too.

411
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:09,570
If you get buddies who smokes cigars,
you know, he'd sneak something for them.

412
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,020
Um, or maybe you don't, you
allegedly do it. All right,

413
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:16,200
this is the Monday morning

asked that question for you.

418
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,210

grilling brush brush, Jesus
Christ. You know what?

434
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:34,590

new year, but I think that she,

whiny cunt. Um, all right.

Um, what did we guys here? Left?

463
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,810
We got two more left.
All right,

464
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:09,240
we'll do some more podcasting and
then I'll get back to that. So, um,

465
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,390
is there anything else I
can tell you guys about? Um,

466
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,050
oh, here's one. Here's a good one for
jet lag. I like to, uh, fly at night.

467
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,250
Leave wherever you're going.
Like if you're flying east to west,

468
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:26,680
if you fly around three,
four in the afternoon,

469
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,770
that's also the sweet spot
at the airport by the way.

470
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:33,430
Cause then he'd come in around two,
one, two o'clock in the afternoon.

471
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,520
And for the most part, people,
wherever they're staying,

472
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,790
they either want to get the fuck out of
there or they want to try to stretch it

473
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,530
another day. So they, they get, you know,

474
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,130
fly between six in the morning to
10 or they start leaving around,

475
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,150
you know, five or maybe seven cause
they want to skip the rush hour traffic.

476
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:56,260
So that's a good time to go.
And you're basically,

477
00:28:56,261 --> 00:29:00,880
you're flying in tonight so it's easy
to go to sleep. You can get eight hours.

478
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:03,400
She definitely gonna be jet lagged when
you get to Europe. But coming back,

479
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,330
um,
when did I leave?

480
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,211
I ain't know it sucked.

481
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:11,490
The only suck when I was coming
back was I was in Iceland,

482
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,050
so I'm halfway across the Atlantic,
the Atlantic Ocean and,

483
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,080
but it was like a zillion dollars and
way more miles than I had to try to get a

484
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,590
nice business class seat.

485
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,333
MMM.

486
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,621
Straight to La.

487
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:30,420
So I had to fly back to fucking
eighth row connected any frail.

488
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,800
And um,

489
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,970
I was getting off Icelandic air
and switching to virgin air.

490
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,620
So I checked my bag and I had to fucking
go to baggage claim and had to go

491
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,010
through

492
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,843
customs,

493
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,380
go down and get the fucking bag and
then do the bus thing to this thing,

494
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:50,890
to that thing. With the fucking bag and
dude, you want to hear about a whiny cunt,

495
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,240
Kirsten up a fucking storm.
And then I ended up having plenty of time.

496
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,750
Yeah,

497
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,880
I had plenty of time and ended up
drinking a couple of scotches there and I

498
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,940
talked to some woman who was from
Poland and I was saying, you know,

499
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:07,580
I had some people come out to my
shows and Poland in Copenhagen. I,

500
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,880
I'd love to go there. And she's like, well
where do you want to go? And I was like,

501
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:14,770
Warsaw. And she just shook
her head. She say, Hey, you
know, I go there, it's too uh,

502
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,640
too commercial. And she fucking
broke down all the Poland for me.

503
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,400
So I'm telling you guys, you've
got to do it. You got to do it.

504
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,710
If you've got the time or
whatever, or make time, fuck that.

505
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:26,080
Even if you've got kids,
fuck it. All right,

506
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,250
fuck getting that second flat screen TV.
Fuck their college education.

507
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,470
It's going to be there.
Okay.

508
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,860
They're not going to get a college
education because you spent fucking seven

509
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:38,860
days in Europe one fucking time.

510
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,420
One time you spent it there
and you dropped him off with,

511
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:44,980
with the parents to watch them.
That's great.

512
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:47,920
They're going to be close to
your grandparents. You know,

513
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,460
your parents would get to spend time
with your kids and you'll get to go over

514
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:54,520
there, get to see the world
from a different perspective.

515
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,630
You got to fucking do it a
highly recommended and you
can do it on the fucking

516
00:30:58,631 --> 00:30:59,380
sheep.

517
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,140
You really can't just get your fucking
asses over there and have yourself a

518
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:06,940
sandwich sandwich. All right? Um,
I really hope it's many people's,

519
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,860
you know, fucking gold.
You know what's great,

520
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:10,990
and I've been reading when I was
in Scotland, something I told you,

521
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,040
somebody gave me this book,

522
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,110
David Lee Ross Book that came out in
the late nineties crazy from the heat.

523
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,870
And I gotta tell you, this is
a fucking killer book, man.

524
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,510
And what I love about it
is he's not dishing a bunch
of dirt about van Halen and

525
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,750
going, Eddie's a content, Michael
Anthony and Alex and all that.

526
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,910
He definitely takes a shot here or there,

527
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,080
but he went through a real painful
fucking thing with the ending of that.

528
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:39,260
And God knows they trashed him enough.
But a lot of it is he,

529
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,080
he's describing what it's like
to be on the road. And um,

530
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,000
right now he's talking about the extensive
travel that he's done talking about.

531
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,210
He ended a tour in [inaudible]
83 with van Halen and Argentina.

532
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,090
So he's with his security guide,
big Ed.

533
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,720
And not to be confused with Eddie van
Halen. This is a different guy, big Ed.

534
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,040
And he's like, well, you know, we
kind of have to go past the, uh,

535
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:07,480
the Amazon to get back to a la.
Why don't we go there?

536
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,650
And Big Ed was like, Oh yeah, I've
always wanted to go to Africa.

537
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,510
And David leads just like, all right,
close enough, whatever. So they ain't,

538
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:20,511
he talks about just like dropping a boat
into the Amazon River and going fucking

539
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,330
down the river, up the river, whatever
he's doing, getting dysentery,

540
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,040
feeling like he's going to die,
having 12 second convulsions. Um,

541
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,100
this is a fucking rock star. Who the
hell does this shit, man, it's really,

542
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,150
really amazing. And I, when I
put down the book this morning,

543
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,970
he was about ready go up.
Uh,

544
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:45,140
he was in the Himalayas, uh, going through
the valley approaching Mount Everest.

545
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,773
MMM.

546
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,550
He has this great theory of
like, you know, because he's,

547
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:54,460
he's a nice guy that he's
seen all these great cities.

548
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,450
He always brings his bicycle on. Torney
rides a bike through the city at night.

549
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,380
And he said, you really get to see the
city and feel the spirits of the city.

550
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,460
And I was thinking,
fuck man,

551
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,520
maybe I told you this last week is I kind
of had that moment when I was sitting

552
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:11,020
there outside the Vatican. You got to
fucking do it. You got to fucking do it.

553
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:15,010
Okay. And if some shit head
like me who fucking flunked,

554
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,480
didn't flunk everything in
high school, but I swear to
God, I got C's, D's and e's.

555
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:22,480
They weren't called apps where
I was from a, it was a fucking,

556
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,780
I told you this before,
when I was a freshman in high school,

557
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:29,890
I was going to go to Notre Dame and
become a lawyer and by the time I was a

558
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:34,660
sophomore I was like, well maybe I'll get
into roofing. That's how bad I did. Um,

559
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,880
just completely shit the bed,

560
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,690
the bed like fucking fumbled the punt,
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

561
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,363
MMM.

562
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,800
Yeah, it was awful. So, uh, so anyways,
that's, that's my travel talk. All right.

563
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:52,550
That gives all the people who hate sports.
When I talk about a,

564
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,400
when I talk about sports too much on
the podcast, I gave you a break and uh,

565
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,480
I have no fucking idea what is going on
in any sport other than hockey cause I

566
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,760
got the Bruins App on my phone and uh,

567
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,560
I know they had a great west coast trip.

568
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,750
You've got their asses kicked too on my
hand it to him or asses kicked our asses

569
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:14,930
handed to them or asses kicked to him.
Is that a new one?

570
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,060
I got my ass kicked to me.

571
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,930
It's like they removed your ass and as
you then they walked across the street

572
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:23,750
and then punted your ass back over to
you because they felt so bad about the

573
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:27,700
beat death. They go, there's a new
one, um, by the Vancouver Canucks.

574
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,800
So it was funny. They're all
giving me shit on Twitter,
uh, doing that stupid, this,

575
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:36,460
this, this being the Bruins.
Six to one. Priceless self.

576
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,160
I don't know why you would say
that to me. I'm like, well, uh,

577
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,150
losing the first two games in the finals
and coming back to win five out of the

578
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:47,050
next six or five. Oh wait, wait a
minute. That doesn't make sense.

579
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:51,910
Does it for the next five, Jesus Christ
bill, there's my high school math again,

580
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,770
losing the first two and then coming back
to win for the last five in game seven

581
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:57,820
and you're fucking building.

582
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,300
I think that's a little bit better
to win a Stanley Cup. All right,

583
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:04,910
so congratulations on your regular
season win and all you cuts out there who

584
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,450
have given me shit because the
patriots lost to the dolphins.

585
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:13,180
All you fantasy football
playing fucking morons. Okay.

586
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,760
Who actually think that
Brady's lost to step in.

587
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:20,761
They're so fucking dumb when it comes to
watching sports and analyzing what the

588
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:24,400
fuck's going on because you get your
nose half an inch away from the paper

589
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,860
looking at numbers.
Uh,

590
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,530
you better wake the fuck up because
there's only like another week I guess of

591
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,730
regular season football.

592
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,090
Tom Brady is in the middle of one of
his greatest seasons he's ever had.

593
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,460
The fact that they have
the record that they do

594
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
with,
uh,

595
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,600
the level of injuries and the shift
that as people we lost to free agency.

596
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,920
It's been fucking unreal.
Like somebody brought me on Twitter,

597
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,600
like really hadn't had a fuck do lose
to the dolphins. It's like, well,

598
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:52,230
first of all, it's easy if you score less
points than they do in second of all,

599
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,430
whenever you play a division rival,
they see it twice a year. Every year.

600
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,720
They know who you are, they know what
the fuck you do. Um, if you're a gambler,

601
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,430
if you ever want to bet on an upset,

602
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,180
I would definitely say bet
that the division rival,

603
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,750
especially if they lost the first time,
is at least going to cover,

604
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,300
if not fucking beat them.
It happens all the time.

605
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,690
I don't know what sport you
fucking watching and, uh,

606
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,570
we have catastrophic fucking injuries
on defense. I'm not making, I might,

607
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,050
I actually, I am making
excuses, but like, um,

608
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,800
what I'm really saying is that if I was
in the states and I was watching the

609
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,710
patriots versus the dolphins, there's no
fucking way that I would just be like,

610
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,160
oh, there's no way we're not going
to win this game. Um, so anyways, uh,

611
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:36,600
that's all I know about what's
going on in football. Um, I,

612
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,480
I completely missed the
Cleveland browns game,

613
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,960
I guess with the Patriots got all those
new age calls where it doesn't seem like

614
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,630
it's football anymore,
you know what I mean? Um,

615
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,250
so anyways, uh, let's get onto some,

616
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,130
let's get on some,
oh,

617
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,460
and I got a new TV show whenever
I go overseas and I'm jet lagged.

618
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:03,510
I always put on Netflix and I get into
something else, or I buy a box set,

619
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,140
I got into the killing.
I don't know if anybody's watching that,

620
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,760
but I am three episodes in and I'm
watching every second of the series.

621
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,450
Phenomenal series,
definitely not for the emotionally light.

622
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,213
Uh,

623
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,570
you don't want to deal with something
that's pretty fucking heavy and they do

624
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:23,130
not pull any punches.
They take you,

625
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:27,090
they walk you right through it
where you feel like you're living,

626
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,910
living it. It's, it's a amazing
fucking amazing show so far.

627
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,400
Phenomenal, which shot the
acting and all that type of shit.

628
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,650
And I'm looking at him like, fuck,
I'd love to be on a show like this.

629
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:41,520
So who knows. I'm going to bug
my agent today. Hey, can I, yeah.

630
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,950
Can I play a body or something
on that show? I'd love to
be on it. Um, anyways, um,

631
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:50,790
I want to thank everybody for joining the
podcast. Tee shirts. Uh, my tee shirt,

632
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,890
uh, slash podcast guy,
Andrew Feminists, uh,

633
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,050
slash standup extraordinary who will also
be at that New Year's eve show at the

634
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,610
Wiltern out here in Los Angeles.

635
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,200
If you want to see the
crew of knuckleheads that
gets fucking hammered every

636
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,150
year out on the golf course, they're
going to the rose bowl. It's Andrew Demo,

637
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:13,680
Emily's Joe Bart, Nick J, law head,

638
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,630
Jason Lie had in myself and there are
very limited tickets left. So, um,

639
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,760
if you need a few plans fell through,
come on down. We'll make you laugh.

640
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,360
And um, I dunno, I think we're
going to stay, stick around,

641
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,820
do a countdown and all that.
We're going to be boozing it up.

642
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,910
Love to see guys down
there. But um, anyways,

643
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,910
he was mentioning that I
believe the podcast t shirts
are sold out at this point

644
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,250
for the most part, except for
some of the bigger sizes, I think.

645
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,643
MMM.

646
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,880
And if you have any
problem with your order,

647
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,660
the email to check in is a bill burn.

648
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:52,661
merge@gmaildotcomalllowercasebillburrmergedmdrchatgmail.com.

649
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,300
Uh, we take pride in getting
this stuff out to you.

650
00:38:56,301 --> 00:39:00,500
I think Andrew's done a great
job. Really, really killed it. Uh,

651
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,900
but let us know if you're
having any problems.

652
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,573
MMM.

653
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,700
You know, we are human beings. We do fuck
up, but we don't want to fuck you over.

654
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:13,480
So let us know if there's a problem as
soon as possible and we'll make it right.

655
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,670
Okay. All right. Here we go onto the
questions and the lettuce this week.

656
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,820
Finland show. Hey Bill, loved to
show in Helsinki. Well thank you. Uh,

657
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,300
I definitely pay to see you again.
I don't know if it was just me.

658
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:31,660
There were a few moments where I felt
you worried about offending the audience

659
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,700
or something that's extremely hard to do.
Yes.

660
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,710
See would probably there at the first
show. I was feeling you guys out, man.

661
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,220
And I think I also had that long
flight from Dublin where I got,

662
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,490
I got delayed at a fro,
connected in AFL

663
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,240
and I literally landed, went right to
the show. So I might been just a tad off.

664
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,140
He said, that's extremely hard
to do a here's the next time.

665
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:59,560
Don't worry about any, any of
that. The less you pull punches,

666
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:03,850
the more you're gonna get out
of the audience and Finland.
Oh, that's awesome man.

667
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,670
Thank you. Thank you for a
reading from your playbook. Why?

668
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,160
I think I figured you guys out.
As I just mentioned the story,

669
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:14,770
a story on the podcast. Tell
them that, that story anyway,

670
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,250
he goes, PSB, ex girlfriend was
a ginger. She was a real cunt.

671
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,353
MMM.

672
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,160
I didn't even know she was a
ginger until I took her pants off.

673
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,250
Okay.

674
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,330
Ah,
Shit.

675
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,330
I fucking funny.
Um,

676
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,790
yeah, no, you know what it was was
I came out and I, it's just like,

677
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,490
you guys are really fucking like Surrey.

678
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:45,730
Any comic who's going to
play Finland over there?

679
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:50,200
There's like mean I can't say this is
just my experience because it was my

680
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,380
fucking jetlag,

681
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,120
my act that I was doing and whatever the
fuck was going on with me chemically.

682
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,810
So I can't say that this is
going to happen, but, uh,

683
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,820
there are fucking great crowd and now
this guy is saying that you can't offend

684
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:06,150
them. You know what's great when
you go through all of those? Um,

685
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,170
I basically did all of a,

686
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,090
the Nordic countries,
I've told you guys this before,

687
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:18,310
Scandinavia consists of Norway,

688
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,490
Sweden and Denmark.

689
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,320
And those three countries that
Scandinavia, but within them,

690
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,660
Scandinavia is part of
the Nordic countries.

691
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,640
And that includes all of Scandinavia,
the three, I just, and then Finland,

692
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,870
Iceland, and I think they're
called the federal islands.

693
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,910
That's the only place I didn't go.
The Faroe Islands,

694
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:45,500
which are like northwest of Scotland.
Um,

695
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,670
but what's great when you go through
all of that is for the most part,

696
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,900
it's predominantly Lutheran,
Lutheran or a Lutheran,

697
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,670
I don't know how to say properly,
but they,

698
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:59,240
and they basically believe
that when you die, you're dead.

699
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,320
You just go into the
ground and it's just like,

700
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,790
and I say, well, don't you
wonder, like, can you wrap
your head around not existing?

701
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,640
And they're like, yeah, it's
just like before you were born,

702
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:14,500
you don't remember that same thing.
And

703
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,733
okay.

704
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,700
Because of that, they're
really fucking logical. Um,

705
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,420
if that, it makes sense, if that's
any comedian listened to this,

706
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,670
I would basically describe the,
give it to a college gig.

707
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:29,820
And you think you're bombing, but
then you realize, oh wait, these,

708
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,290
this is a really smart school.
And they just laugh in a different way.

709
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,040
That's basically what a Helsinki was
like. So, uh, thanks for the heads up.

710
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:40,500
I did have a great time.
Um,

711
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,160
and I hope those people on the first show
had a good time too. I was, you know,

712
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,980
I don't want to let people down,
you know,

713
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,840
I'll make sure I give him the whole
fucking thing. And I told him,

714
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,670
I made a rule that I wasn't going to
bitch at all on this tour because I knew

715
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,620
what was going to be brutal going from
place to place to place to place everyday.

716
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,020
Fucking waking up,
going to the airport,

717
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,890
landing and then trying to figure out
how fuck making my jokes work. Um,

718
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,080
so because I made the rule
that I wasn't going to bitch,

719
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:08,520
I only bitch like 30 times
as opposed to like 3000,

720
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,780
although if you counted each
individual bitch going through a frown,

721
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,300
connected any foul, um, that I'd
probably pitch like 700 times.

722
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,770
But I was compartmentalizing.

723
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,030
That's a word to a Heathrow airport.
Um,

724
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,110
for the most part. All right.
Hey, bill, loved from Morocco.

725
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,380
Um, Bill, before I start,

726
00:43:31,381 --> 00:43:35,940
I just want to let you know that my
sister and I attended your show in London

727
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:40,120
last week. Uh, you did a great job,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Uh,

728
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,220
you had the whole crowd. It's
puppet, blah, blah, blah.

729
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,320
But enough with the ass kicking. Okay.
Here's a little conspiracy theory for you.

730
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:50,760
At the end of the show, we had a little
argument about your ghosts segment.

731
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,540
Yeah.
I don't believe in ghosts,

732
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,350
which was fucking hilarious to go through
a place that doesn't believe that you

733
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:58,930
go anywhere when you die.
You know,

734
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,190
when I was going through Scandinavia
in the Nordic countries, because I was,

735
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,850
I'd be like, usually when I say there's
no ghosts, I don't believe in ghosts.

736
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,650
There's someone in the crowd that's like,
oh no, you know, I believe in ghosts.

737
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:09,520
Yeah,
absolutely.

738
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,420
And they were just sitting there and those
other countries just like, yeah, yeah,

739
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:18,060
why the fuck would you believe in
ghosts? That's stupid. Is that?

740
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,400
And he goes, he goes, remember when
the your bottle fell off the stool

741
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,150
and the water spilled on stage?
Yeah,

742
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:27,310
I did this whole segment about
how I don't believe in ghosts.

743
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,490
And I remember when I went to set
down my bottle for some reason,

744
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:33,510
the cushion on the seat,

745
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,620
it was sort of doing like the leaning
Tower of Pisa thing. So anyways,

746
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,240
I finished the ghost bit,

747
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,130
then I was into some other jokes and
all of a sudden it looks like the bottle

748
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:45,390
tipped over by itself.

749
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,110
One of those great standup
moments where you can't plan it,

750
00:44:48,111 --> 00:44:51,420
it tipped over itself. And then, uh,

751
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,740
and I didn't realize that
the crowd is reacting and it,

752
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:57,410
and it was like a full bottle.
So it's just pouring out, um,

753
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,520
got all over the stage and everything.

754
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:02,730
And then of course I riff that it was
actually a ghost and that is trying to

755
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:07,170
electrocute me and all that type of shit.
And um, and it worked great. But anyways,

756
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,280
he said, my sister think, thinks
that was part of your act,

757
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,060
the ghost thing. And there was no
way you could be that good at Improv.

758
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,200
I better 50 pounds that it
wasn't planned either way.

759
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:22,560
It was beautifully done. Do you
mind settling this for us? Yeah, no,

760
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:26,730
it was not planned. You realize how
cheesy that would be if you plan that.

761
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,840
And also not to kill
the whole improv thing.

762
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,790
It's really not that difficult to come
up with some funny shit when water spills

763
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:39,790
by itself after you just
did a ghost thing. Um,

764
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,660
it isn't,
you know,

765
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,110
and you don't realize how many times,
I mean,

766
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,360
you fucking Improv,
everybody's improving.

767
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,300
When you walk and you're
having a conversation,

768
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,560
you're totally in the moment
with somebody and you're,

769
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,960
you're without realizing it
because you understand language.

770
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,630
You're listening and
translating and you're also,

771
00:46:01,631 --> 00:46:05,230
which is reminding you some other shit
that you're thinking about that adds to

772
00:46:05,231 --> 00:46:09,430
where the conversation
goes. Um, what it is.

773
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,870
So everybody can do that. It's just
when you get on stage, it's, it's,

774
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,711
you're,

775
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:19,230
you're going on stage starting your career
and you're dealing with stage fright

776
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,880
and forcing yourself to do this thing
that scares the shit out of you,

777
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,080
which causes you to think, which shuts
down all of your improv abilities.

778
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,450
But over the years,
as you do it,

779
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,190
you get more and more comfortable and
you become as comfortable on stage as you

780
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:37,770
are offstage.
And then once again,

781
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:41,910
you tap back into that power of improving
that everyone in the crowd is already

782
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:46,710
doing. Um, but for, but it's just
not defined as it. So that's,

783
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,550
that's basically what it is. So
no, that was not, that was a,

784
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,810
uh,
that was not planned.

785
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,863
MMM.

786
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,960
Actually had another great one that I
was doing a another great moment I should

787
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,610
say.
It's not like can pat myself on the bed.

788
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,230
I had another great moment of Improv when
I took the Mike's dad and pretended it

789
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:12,060
was a skinny little bit. Um, and she,
she held eat something for an hour. No.

790
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,610
Um,
I was in Iceland when I walked on stage.

791
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,030
They had a fucking giant Christmas
tree just to the right of the stage.

792
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:21,150
All lit up looking beautifully.
But I saw,

793
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:26,151
I went into this stupid thing where I
was acting like it was stealing focus and

794
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:33,221
I was being a diva and I refuse to tell
any more jokes until somebody's fucking,

795
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:38,170
what are you Reykjavik sons of bitches
comes up here and takes his God damn tree

796
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:38,620
down.

797
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,250
And I went on this whole long thing and
it just happened right at the beginning

798
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:43,930
of the show.
I just saw it and I just,

799
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:46,903
I dunno,

800
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:52,850
I just fucking started talking about
it and it killed and they loved it.

801
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,870
And then later on in the act,

802
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,070
I apologize to the tree like it was,
you know,

803
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,970
like I was in some abusive
relationship with it. Like, hey listen,

804
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:05,400
I'm sorry about what I said
earlier. You're not, you know,

805
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,700
I feel about Jay and blah blah blah, and
just kind of went on this thing. Like,

806
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,570
that's the most fun thing as a comedian
was when you get comfortable enough to

807
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:15,990
do that shit because I'm not going to
lie to get you get sick of telling you

808
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:20,850
jokes.
Um,

809
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,710
but anyways, he finishes
off. He says also,

810
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:27,180
I've been introducing you to my Moroccan
friends over the years and as soon as I

811
00:48:27,181 --> 00:48:30,610
can get 10,000 people like you,
I'll email you so that you, uh,

812
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,030
so you can come visit. Um, thanks and
go fuck yourself. Well, you know what,

813
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:40,740
send a fucking email to a bill,
burn merchant,

814
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:44,140
gmail.com and Andrew, we'll
hopefully get back to me. Maybe a,

815
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,540
I could figure out some fucking,
uh, I'll send you some promotional,

816
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:51,060
a promotional package of some shit.
I'll send some of my,

817
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,010
my ways over there and a young thing
you gotta do is hand them out to your

818
00:48:56,011 --> 00:48:59,430
friends. Okay. That's it. All right. Um,

819
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,210
where the fuck am I? Oh,
there's the ending. Thanks.

820
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:09,150
And Go fuck yourself. All right,
you go fuck yourself too. All right.

821
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:13,890
Underage girl equation. All right, let's
hope this doesn't get creepy again.

822
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,390
A bill, longtime fan listener caught a few
shows. Glad you kicking ass. Thank you.

823
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,110
Ah, here's the important part
is the important part. Yeah.
Fuck my career. Exactly.

824
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,950
A to calculate acceptable age
differences between partners.

825
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:27,900
Here's my rule of thumb.
All right,

826
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:29,630
for those of you who are
just new to the podcast,

827
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,340
I haven't listened in the past couple
of weeks because you have a life. Um,

828
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,440
lately,

829
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,230
lately I don't know what's been going
on but people who have been sending me

830
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,070
these fucking emails and uh,

831
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,270
it's somehow it's like, yeah,
you know, 27, my girlfriend's 19,

832
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:48,930
we've been dating for six years and
uh, it's like, wait a minute, wait,

833
00:49:48,931 --> 00:49:52,110
what the fuck? You know, it gets weird.

834
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,680
So this is what he's referring to.
He goes,

835
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:59,730
here's the important part to calculate
acceptable age differences between

836
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:02,700
partners.
Here is my rule of thumb.

837
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,220
Half Your Age plus seven,
that's it works for everyone pretty much.

838
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,330
If you're 22,

839
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,540
half your age is 11 plus
seven equals 18. Uh, dude,

840
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:19,080
I got to say 22 to 18. That, is that
still a still a huge age difference but,

841
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,780
but it is legal.
It is legal.

842
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,070
I don't know how you don't feel like
fucking Matthew mcconaughey in dazed and

843
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,860
confused with that one too.
Cause you're literally talking like,

844
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,920
you know you got a mustache
by 22. Come on man. She's 18

845
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,050
yeah,

846
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,670
finishing up high school.

847
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:40,990
Okay.

848
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,960
And you've just wrapped college. That's
a huge age difference. But you know,

849
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,570
26 to 22 is not a big deal.

850
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,040
Yeah.

851
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,690
Um, anyways, but I like, I like what
you're saying. You said 18 is your cutoff.

852
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,600
So yeah, that does make
sense. It is legal. He goes,

853
00:50:55,601 --> 00:51:00,490
if you're a d half your age is 40
plus seven is 47 boom. There it is.

854
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:04,450
Again, reasonable differences
regardless of age. Yeah.

855
00:51:04,451 --> 00:51:06,070
It depends on who you are and that one,

856
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:07,900
I think I would rather be the 80 year old.

857
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,980
I feel like I'm stealing money at that
point. But I like, I like what you get,

858
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,720
where you're coming from here. He
goes, I'm not saying there aren't,

859
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,500
there aren't anomalies out
there for every situation,

860
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:21,670
but for a simple guide to
not being a pervy fuck bag,

861
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,370
stick with the half plus seven rule.
Uh,

862
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,580
been meaning to share
this with you for awhile,

863
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,570
but seeing is every week we seem to have
a new douche bag trying to justify as

864
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:35,110
perversion. Well, it's time. Yeah.
Thank you. All right, there you go.

865
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,390
People half your age plus seven.

866
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:41,560
If it doesn't fuck a workout while half
your age plus seven and she's still 18

867
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:42,394
or older,

868
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,273
right?

869
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,600
Cause if you're 18 half year,

870
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:52,070
age is nine plus seven is 16.
I mean,

871
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:54,140
you're in trouble there.
That's statutory rape.

872
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,540
That's still kind of works out good.
I'm 16.

873
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:02,100
Half my age is a plus seven is 15.
That fucking works.

874
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,540
Okay.

875
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,190
You're 12 half your age is six plus
seven. She's 13. You fucking slaying it.

876
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,460
I love this theory.
I love this fucking theory.

877
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,130
God dammit. That works.
This son of a bitch,

878
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,190
he's like Matt Damon and that fucking,
uh,

879
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:24,590
where he's got the mop and he's good at
math one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

880
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:28,100
Dazed and confused fucking,
uh, I got to see about a girl.

881
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:31,190
What the fuck is it called?
Goodwill hunting.

882
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,400
They get go. I shook it loose.
Um, oh, you know what I watched,

883
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:41,570
I watched a couple of movies. I watched
all Boston guy movies, Mark Walberg.

884
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,940
I watched the one with him and the rock.

885
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,160
I did fall asleep because
I was trying to stay awake.

886
00:52:47,161 --> 00:52:48,560
That has nothing to do with the movie.

887
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:53,330
I loved any move up fucking
weight lifting. It's got
mark Walberg in it, right?

888
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,870
That takes me back to the 80s when
nobody did squats and everybody just kept

889
00:52:56,871 --> 00:53:00,740
fucking, you know, doing
upper body, upper body.

890
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:05,780
Um, I got a friend of mine, comedian,
uh, it, Boston, Wayne Brevity's stories.

891
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:06,471
Talk about that.

892
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:09,440
How back in the day nobody used to
fucking do squats and then you just put on

893
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,400
your puffy pants.

894
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,960
You see Kava reaches over there to try
to make it look like you had thighs,

895
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:24,090
video. Um, so anyways,
I watched that one. Uh,

896
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,300
whatever that movie was. I never remember
the names. Then I watched the, uh,

897
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:31,920
the Matt Damon movie where he's in
the future and they put that thing in,

898
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:36,080
that bionic shit around them. Fucking
great movie. Just fuck. That's a,

899
00:53:36,081 --> 00:53:39,300
that's a great fucking movie.
I, I stand by both of those.

900
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,770
And also I watched a movie called,
uh,

901
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,040
called drinking buddies that,
um,

902
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,510
Jesus Christ, I never watched a movie. It
was about dating and that type of thing.

903
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,360
I never watched a movie where I felt like,
uh,

904
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,790
I was kind of every guy in the movie,
you know what I mean?

905
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,940
Like the guy sneaking around
fucking around the guy,

906
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,660
the PSAP taking back,
the girl that's fucked around,

907
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,400
the guy wants to commit,

908
00:54:09,401 --> 00:54:14,170
but can't the guy who fucking not
committing the whole God damn thing. Um,

909
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,110
it was a really, I really enjoyed that
movie and it had a, who's had gotten it?

910
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,170
Olivia Wilde, uh, Jake Johnson,
who I fucking worked with on, um,

911
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,380
AH, Jesus Christ new girl. I
swear to God, man, I can't,

912
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,320
I can somebody send me some fish pills,
whatever the fuck he supposed to take.

913
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:38,180
I can't remember anything. A
really enjoyable movie. Um,

989
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:12,190
burr and then you go,

990
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:16,360
that is your at Virgin Ms
advertisement for the week.

991
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:21,200
Your adverts as they say over there
in England. I guess they say that.

992
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,713
MMM.

993
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,150
What are we doing here? Let's go
to the next one. Sparkling water.

994
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,550
The next email here.
A sparkling fucking water

995
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,020
bill pickles. Oh, I get it till
tickles bill a dope deal tickles.

996
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:43,320
Dill pickles. Bill pickles again. It all
right. There's no one, there is a new one.

997
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:44,154
My friends,

998
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:48,180
he said I saw in one of your tweets
that you were upset about accidentally

999
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:52,590
ordering sparkling water.
Yeah, that happened to me when
I was in, I was in London,

1000
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,120
uh,
going to eight round connected any from

1001
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:58,760
okay.

1002
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,970
You know, they, they put it in the
clear bottle. It looks just like water.

1003
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:07,400
And you know when you're in a different
country like shit gets hard shit.

1004
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:11,420
You just take for fucking grant like that.
I never accidentally, I very rarely do.

1005
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:15,620
I accidentally grabbed sparkling
water when I'm uh, in the states here.

1006
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:19,910
Cause I know Poland Spring, I know,
I know what the fuck bottled water,

1007
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:24,260
there's still shit looks like. But, uh,
that is the most amazing thing. When you,

1008
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:28,090
when you travel abroad, is this part
of your brain you have to use that you,

1009
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,090
you'd never use?

1010
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,080
Like I never realized how much
shit I recognized just out a color.

1011
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,363
MMM.

1012
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,780
And then all of a sudden you go
overseas and he just like, all right,

1013
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:42,490
is that a taxi or a police
car? You know, this,

1014
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,870
is that a pharmacy or
are they selling clothes?

1015
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:48,680
And I'm not even joking because the way
that some of the stores look over, over,

1016
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,870
over, uh, overseas, they, they,

1017
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,230
this style that they'll do the store in,

1018
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,170
that's their style for a fucking pharmacy.

1019
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:59,040
All the pharmacies are pretty
easy over there cause they have a,

1020
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,720
they have a neon green like cross.
It's really easy to find.

1021
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:04,970
So that's probably a bad one. But
anyways, yeah. So anyways, he goes,

1022
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:08,810
I hope you come around on this score.
It's never too late to change.

1023
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,913
MMM.

1024
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,390
Oh, I think this guy's just telling me
that he likes sparkling water. Well,

1025
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:15,230
Jesus Christ.
Bill,

1026
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,920
why don't you just read the fucking
thing so we can all find out? All right.

1027
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,250
He said, you know, men have great
character and sophistication,

1028
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:26,350
have long been enjoying sparkling
water. Oh Jesus Christ. Well,

1029
01:01:26,351 --> 01:01:28,480
let me go dress up for this fucking email.

1030
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,470
This guy sitting there with
his legs crossed where and
it was an ascot does that

1031
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,280
and he said,

1032
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:38,280
he says it's a satisfying bevy that you
can drink endless quantities and endless

1033
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:43,930
quantities of why you battle the
temptations of various other addictions.

1034
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,730
Like when you're off the bottle,

1035
01:01:45,731 --> 01:01:50,530
I highly recommend reaching for a bottle
of San Pellegrino and as a punch that

1036
01:01:50,531 --> 01:01:53,200
plain water or fruit
juice just can't give you,

1037
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:57,370
it's like hard alcohol in the
sense that it's an acquired taste,

1038
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,200
uh, on top of the hard
alcohol. A Nice, I can't,

1039
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:07,201
I don't know how to is Cheryl Steiner
mixes wonderfully with alcohol's of all

1040
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:11,920
kinds.
My preference being vodka and Whiskey,

1041
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:16,570
it's a much better mix than fruity
juices and sodas and all that other,

1042
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,260
uh,

1043
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:19,823
pussy shit

1044
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,600
just cuts a bit. It's like water.
Water is bad ass big brother.

1045
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,540
I remember you saying that
you don't drink coffee.

1046
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,940
He was saying you've missed out
on all that coffee house posts.

1047
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:35,580
He over the years. So this is one
pairing that I probably can sell you on.

1048
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,503
Um,

1049
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,550
what, so this is one pairing that
I probably can't sell you on,

1050
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,960
but an espresso drink, no sugar
with a Perrier air to hydrate you.

1051
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,340
Fucking delightful.

1052
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,990
Or I know you've been to Italy and
antipasto plate with a glass of wine and a

1053
01:02:52,991 --> 01:02:56,730
glass of sparkling water. Uh, Bueno.

1054
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:02,230
I hope I said that right. I don't
have one off. B u. O n o uh,

1055
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:03,250
love the stand up.

1056
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,110
Love the podcast as a working poor type
nine to five or the podcast makes Monday

1057
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:11,230
almost bearable. Look at you
getting all fucking, he goes,

1058
01:03:11,231 --> 01:03:15,490
wait for the Canadians hockey cities dates
here in Montreal. Not a habs fan. Uh,

1059
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:19,120
senators fan. All right.
Um, yeah, I do it.

1060
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:20,920
I don't like drinking carbonated shit.

1061
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,800
I think it makes you bloated and
makes you fat for no fucking reason.

1062
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,380
And you should be drinking water.
Uh,

1063
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:30,250
I'm not into the shit and when I'm off
the bottle I just get off the bottle

1064
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:31,870
totally.
And I drink water.

1065
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:34,750
And then I looked down and my stomach
getting flatter every day and I fucking

1066
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:37,310
enjoy it. But uh, yeah, I'm just not a a,

1067
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:42,500
I'm not a sparkling water guy and I'm
just not, I don't like the shit. Uh,

1068
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,910
if I'm going to drink
something carbonated,

1069
01:03:45,911 --> 01:03:50,911
I'll have a soda or pop or a pap is they
see in the Midwest and what do I like?

1070
01:03:52,151 --> 01:03:57,151
I like the Mexican cocacola that
has the real sugar and I like 'em.

1071
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,570
I like Orange Soda, but only if
that has the good sugar too. Um,

1072
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,680
all right, dude, the
jet lights hit me here.

1073
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:10,760
I'm just fucking talking about what kinds
of soda I fucking like. Uh, all right.

1074
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,640
Opposite of Anorexia.
Yeah. Speaking of which,

1075
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:18,430
I mentioned earlier that I gained some
weight here. Opposite of Anorexia. Hey,

1076
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,273
they've built,

1077
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:23,150
I think I might have the
opposite of Anorexia because
when I look in the mirror,

1078
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,470
I see a skinny guy.

1079
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:29,770
While I've trained with
pushups and weights and gain
like 10 pounds right now I

1080
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:34,460
am 18 years old, six two and 187
pounds, which should be normal.

1081
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,580
Also, when I look at my
classmates, classmates,

1082
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:40,910
I seem bigger and more muscular.

1083
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:45,560
But when I'm home and stare in the
mirror, I just seem skinny. Anyways.

1084
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,560
Love your podcasts. Greetings
from Holland. Yeah, Dude. Um,

1085
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,320
opposite of Anorexia. I don't
know what that means. Yeah,

1086
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:56,860
but you got some sort of body issue, dude.
If he's six, two, one 87, yeah, you look,

1087
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:01,790
you look fine and you're also 18 years
old, you're going to fill out. Um,

1088
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:07,360
my suggestion is to look into the mirror
and override those negative thoughts

1089
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:11,560
and think something positive. And I got
to tell you, dude, when you get older,

1090
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:12,461
okay,

1091
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:15,340
and you've got to go to the gym for two
fucking weeks to get yourself looking

1092
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:16,151
halfway decent.

1093
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:19,720
And then you have one French and it
negates all two weeks that you did.

1094
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,880
You're going to fucking look back and go,
God,

1095
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:25,720
remember when I was six to when I
was 187 pounds for the love of God.

1096
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,430
Enjoy this period of your life as much
as you can because there's no way to

1097
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:35,090
enjoy it fully the way some
old bastard like me could. Um,

1098
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,890
because I know what it's like now to
fucking do all the work I did and then go

1099
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:44,350
away for a couple of fucking weeks and
come back and look like, oh my God, dude,

1100
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:48,100
I fucking pat on a pullover
sweater the last fucking night.

1101
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:52,360
And I took a picture with somebody and
I was sucking in my gut and I still look

1102
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:55,480
like a fucking, ah, I knew it.

1103
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:58,040
Somebody took a picture of me when I
was at Iceland and I saw, I'm getting,

1104
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,090
I'm getting my fat head back
again. It killed me. So Dude,

1105
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,360
you're killing it. You're six to,
yeah, 187 pounds. You're 18 years old.

1106
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,920
He got your whole life ahead of you.

1107
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:13,270
You should just be focusing on
finding fucking places to go.

1108
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:15,850
Have a good time. All right, go up,

1109
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:19,270
go chat up the most beautiful
women you can find it.

1110
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:22,480
Just have a great fucking time. All
right, put looking in the mirror.

1111
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:25,000
Think and you're some fucking
skinny loser. You're not all right.

1112
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,090
You're a God damn fucking rocks.

1113
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:31,330
You're the rock star a year of
your life right now. All right.

1114
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:35,020
And then don't use this as some negative
of goods. Little Down Hill from here.

1115
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:38,680
Stop being a fucking pussy. Go out and
enjoy your goddamn like you look great.

1116
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:42,730
You son of a bitch. Go Fuck Yourself.
All right. Accidentally racist.

1117
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,050
Hey Bill, I was waiting in line, uh,

1118
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,860
for the Water Fountain at my gym with a
buddy and this African American guy was

1119
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:53,860
taking forever to fill up
his gallon size water bottle.

1120
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,970
Don't you fucking hate people
to do that at the gym? Cheap,

1121
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,030
cheap fuckers. I get that.
You're doing it. I get it.

1122
01:07:01,031 --> 01:07:04,380
But if you see somebody behind you,
you got to gallon water ball.

1123
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,230
Maybe it was just the bigger one.
You know what? You'd be a good shit.

1124
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:11,050
Turn around and be like, can you just
getting a drink? Yeah, let me step aside,

1125
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:14,800
you know, be a fucking asshole.
You know what that's like?

1126
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:18,160
That's like people who stand in the middle
of sidewalks with four other friends

1127
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:22,180
and have conversations and the whole world
has to walk around them or they do it

1128
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:24,890
in the airport. If you're
stopping and you, you're,

1129
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,080
you're going to make your flight.

1130
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,150
Are you trying to figure out
where the fuck you supposed to be?

1131
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,980
We'll go grab the wall, get over to
the fucking wall. Let people, you know,

1132
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:37,300
if your car fucking breaks down,
if it's safe to do it,

1133
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:42,520
fucking push it to the side of the
road. You dumb cunt. All right. Sorry.

1134
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:46,570
Anyways, he goes, I was getting
impatient as you should have. He goes,

1135
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:48,630
I remembered that the
gym recently got rid of,

1136
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:53,530
of a separate fountain with a big nozzle
so you could fill up a water bottle

1137
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:55,690
quicker.
So I remarked to my buddy,

1138
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:00,670
didn't they used to have separate
fountains for these people? Oh Shit.

1139
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,570
Oh No.
He goes before my buddy can respond.

1140
01:08:06,571 --> 01:08:11,160
The African American guy turns
around and says, excuse me,

1141
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,900
Q foot and mouth.

1142
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:14,710
Okay,

1143
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,410
so the best accidentally

1144
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:18,030
racist story you've got.

1145
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:24,450
Uh, wait a minute, dude. Yeah. I hope you
explain that to them. Uh, you know what?

1146
01:08:24,451 --> 01:08:26,640
I have to think accidentally,
right? I know I've done that.

1147
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,480
I know I've done that way.
I, what did I do that,

1148
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:36,610
oh, I remember when I was in DC,
I just made a joke in the guy,

1149
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:39,700
didn't find it funny and then
I felt like a fucking asshole.

1150
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:41,040
Yeah.

1151
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,680
Um,
it was right after Obama got elected,

1152
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:47,340
I was in DC and I was fucking hammered
and I was coming back to this hotel with

1153
01:08:47,341 --> 01:08:49,920
Joe to Rosa. And, uh,

1154
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:55,560
the security guy who was black,
African American said something to me.

1155
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,510
And as a joke, I go, oh,
what the president is black
now civil. And I'm hammered.

1156
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,750
And I thought he was going to laugh.
And he stared at me like all my,

1157
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:08,190
like this is a white person who actually
thinks this shit. And I was like,

1158
01:09:08,191 --> 01:09:11,670
I was just fucking around Joe's
like dragging me away. Like I went,

1159
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:15,960
like it was a joke that would've worked
if I was sober and I was in a comedy

1160
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:20,760
club and I'd set it up right.
But I didn't, oh. And I kind
of fucking knew the guy,

1161
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:25,650
but I didn't know the guy. It was three
in the morning. I was drunk and it like,

1162
01:09:25,651 --> 01:09:27,410
dude, it was fucking horrific. And I,

1163
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,170
and it kills me that I wasn't able to
explain myself cause I guarantee that that

1164
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:36,020
guy's still fucking at least told
that story for two weeks. So, um,

1165
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:40,650
I dunno, that's actually a good top.
If anybody else has accidentally racist

1166
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,850
shit. Oh my God. That's too,

1167
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,510
that's like I would submit
that to fucking Larry David.

1168
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,610
It doesn't that seem like an
episode of his Shell. You know,

1169
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:53,870
that had happened in the beginning.

1170
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:56,630
Like you don't just whining that he
has to go to the gym and all that Shit.

1171
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:57,710
Bitch moaning and complaining.

1172
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:02,330
He sees the guy with the water
bottle and then the misdirection is,

1173
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,710
he talks about how cheap these people
are and he actually defends the gym for

1174
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:11,570
all the water that they're using. Um,
and then when he shows up, it's gone.

1175
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:16,140
And then he stands behind. I mean the
whole fucking thing is right there. Hey,

1176
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:20,290
put that music underneath it. He
got yourself an episode. All right.

1177
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:25,230
Ski Lodges a there. Billy Bunny
Hill. Uh, what's, should take,

1178
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:31,000
what's your take a good weekend.
Come on people, you know,

1179
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:32,530
I can't read out loud.
Can you,

1180
01:10:32,531 --> 01:10:36,520
can you at least help me by at least
trying to put all the words from the

1181
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:39,400
sentence in the fucking email?
What's your take?

1182
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:44,401
I'm going to guess on a good weekend of
bagging snow bunnies and drinking hot

1183
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:47,620
chocolate. What's my take on
it? What that sounds like.

1184
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:51,790
One of those fucking titty
movies I watched when I
first got cable. What, what?

1185
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,180
Okay.

1186
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,120
What? Take what I have on our other
than that's fucking awesome. He goes,

1187
01:10:56,121 --> 01:11:00,230
the occasional outdoor hot tub
seen wood fires and turtlenecks,

1188
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,580
some marijuana and monopoly
washed down with the dark red.

1189
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:07,430
I don't even ski,
but if I ever start,

1190
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:11,750
it's to be able to live in that dumb and
dumber aspen type scene. Oh, absolutely.

1191
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:15,090
Somebody asked me recently,
asked me if I skied and I said,

1192
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,550
I told them that story.
How I,

1193
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,560
when I was in that was in Utah with Jay
lie ahead and we stayed an extra day and

1194
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:26,070
went skiing up in, uh, what did they do?

1195
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:29,990
That film festival Sundance.
We were up around there.

1196
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:32,990
We went skiing up there and it was
great. But I, I don't like skiing.

1197
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:36,980
I love the workout and I love all
that aspect that you're talking about.

1198
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:40,400
Like a calming down and they got the
fire going and you drink beers. Dude,

1199
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:41,750
it's fucking awesome.

1200
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:47,050
But I have just never participated
in a more blow your knee out.

1201
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:52,370
Fucking sport did skiing,
but uh,

1202
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,140
just your description there like that
right there is why I want to go. Um,

1203
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:58,980
okay

1204
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:03,150
as fuck. And it's just, that's the
shit. Who's that guy? That guy there.

1205
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:06,810
The guy in Holland. There you are the
six foot two one eight s on an 87 pounds.

1206
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,080
There you go. Go skiing, go scale.

1207
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:13,020
This is what you should be doing instead
of fucking staring at yourself in the

1208
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:16,680
mirror going, oh, I'm ugly, I'm too
skinny. Fuck that. Do this shit.

1209
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,170
Yeah.

1210
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:19,441
You know what?

1211
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:23,070
I want to buy all the skiing shit in and
not go skiing and then just go on the

1212
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:26,070
treadmill and get all sweaty and then
put the ski and Shit on and just act like

1213
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:30,540
I fucking came off the mountain.
Wash it down with a dark red.

1214
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:34,440
How good does that sound? It's
7:34 AM the me. All right.

1215
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,300
That's the podcast. A what
is my take on that? Like I,

1216
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:41,100
I think that this is what I would do.
Take skiing lessons.

1217
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,490
Something I never did. I
was like, whatever. I play
hockey dude, I fucking skate.

1218
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:50,940
Just shame shit. Nobody's
trying to hit you, right?

1219
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,140
You don't realize that there's trees.
You forget that, which is like the, uh,

1220
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,100
I can't even, it's like a fucking
defenseman times like 9 million.

1221
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:04,980
You never went in that contact.
You never knocked the fucking tree over.

1222
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:09,140
You basically die like
Sonny Bono or some shit. Um,

1223
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,190
I just hate when you fall and like one
are you skis is going one way and the

1224
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:18,330
other's going the other way and
it's never a convenient fucking way.

1225
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,960
You always feel like you got
to fucking blow out an ACL.

1226
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,520
But if you survive and you get
down that hill a couple of times,

1227
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,690
you know what's funny about skiing?

1228
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:32,220
I always love when you get to that point
where you know you're exhausted and you

1229
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:36,870
try to do one more fucking run and you
get up there and you're so tired by you

1230
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:41,490
get halfway down, you just fall down.
Every third time he tried to make a turn,

1231
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:45,000
like whatever that fucking acid is that
builds up and your muscles in your legs.

1232
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:45,721
It just,

1233
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:49,770
you're just completely gassed and you're
laughing and you're friends laughing at

1234
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:54,150
you and you just get down
to the fucking mountain.

1235
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,980
You get to the ski lodge.

1236
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:59,970
Hopefully there's not a bunch of
cons taken up the whole thing. Um,

1237
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:04,080
you know that rich family that has five
kids in a can afford to buy them all ski

1238
01:14:04,081 --> 01:14:08,340
stuff despite the fact that they're all
growing and shit. Um, you resent them.

1239
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,620
They looked like the Kennedy's like,
okay, that was fucking blue blooded cons.

1240
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:16,180
But if you can somehow get yourself a
seat, ah fuck, I want to go. I'm going,

1241
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,560
I'm, I'm calling up law ahead. I'm going
to go skiing over the Christmas break.

1242
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:25,150
Fuck this. I'm going, Jesus Christ.
Because they did that person.

1243
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:29,020
Paint a picture of what? I'm
fucking guard. All right,

1244
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,910
here's the wrap up everybody. Um,

And um,
I got it.

1253
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:11,320
I got to thank everybody who
came out to my shows in Europe.

1254
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,370
I have to thank all the promoters
who got me out there. Uh,

1255
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:19,840
I got to thank everybody who took
me out, you know, to the bars,

1256
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:23,890
to that premier league
game. Tuh, Tuh, Tuh,

1257
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,960
all these sites, all the to the lagoon,
all this stuff. I, I can't even like,

1258
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:32,890
it was absolutely, I'll
never forget that tour. Um,

1259
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,560
and I'm just going to
keep going over there.

1260
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:40,590
It was just an unbelievable experience
to end an unbelievable year where I had

1261
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:44,350
some of the biggest shows in my career.
I did the most shows,

1262
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:47,740
the most cities I've ever done.
I did the red state tour,

1263
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:53,220
I did that bus tour through the south
with all my buddies and I'm Jason La,

1264
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:58,300
hadn't his legendary Father Jim lie.
Lochhead um,

1265
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,970
just all the people I got to meet,
man.

1266
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:05,320
It was just the exact reason why I got
in this business was to have fun and to

1267
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:09,940
travel and make people laugh. And
I really, I did that this year.

1268
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:13,240
Like, I dunno, it just went to a
whole other level. I don't know.

1269
01:16:13,241 --> 01:16:17,920
I can top it next year. I'm
fucking exhausted, but I'm
tired and a great way. So,

1270
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:22,510
uh, thank you to everybody
and uh, that sit man,

1271
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:26,860
I hope you guys enjoy your a merry
Christmas. Happy Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah.

1272
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,920
Happy New Year.
Hope you guys have a nice Christmas break.

1273
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,170
And I'm like, I said, man, fucking,

1274
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:37,870
if you can scrape together some quarters,

1275
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:43,360
I get your ass on a plane and go travel.
I wish I did it when I was younger and,

1276
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:48,130
uh, I'm an old fuck man. 45. He never
to never too old to do it. So, uh,

1277
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:49,510
I want that for all of you guys,
man.

1278
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:53,260
I hope you guys have a great
successful 2014. That's the podcast.

1279
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,280
Go fuck yourselves. And, uh,
I'll talk to you next week.
