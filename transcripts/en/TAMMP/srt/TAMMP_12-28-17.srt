1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,780
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,170
Hey, what's going on as Bill Byrd
is time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,930
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast, and

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,250
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,010
You're not going to believe
what the what I just did a,

6
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,670
you probably will having you listen to
this thing enough to know that I'm a

7
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:22,600
fucking moron. You're not going
to believe what I just did.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,090
What did you do bill? Well, I just
recorded the Thursday afternoon podcast.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,620
Right.
And I forgot my cord that I usually,

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,750
I have a routine and the second I do it,
I upload it and I've done it,

11
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:40,480
but I forgot the cord, the UCB
Chord, whatever the fuck it is.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,350
USBC fucking public bank cord.
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,780
Okay.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,610
So it took me out of my routine and I
just wanted to like robot mode and I

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,310
fucking erase the podcast.
I just did.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,440
Why would I go there? I
was so psyched. I was done.

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,470
I just came back from Boston, dude.
I came, you know, I woke up early,

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,270
I'm still on east coast time. My
beautiful daughter, lovely wife.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,430
I was sleeping, I paid all the fucking
bills. I got everything ready to go.

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,880
All I had to do was knock out my podcast.
It's a quarter, eight in the morning.

21
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm done. My kids just getting up,
I'm ready to make everybody breakfast.

22
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,850
I'm crushing it.
And what do I do?

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:25,990
Okay.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,570
I just hit a, and I hit a race and
you know when she had her race,

25
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:32,290
she can't stop it from a racing.
And I was like going, oh my God,

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,250
what did I just do it?
It's just it gone

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,263
over.

28
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,090
So now the big thing is,

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,410
is I can't compete with myself
from a half an hour ago.

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,993
All right?

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,900
I can't be looking into the past and
thinking about what I talked about.

32
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,580
I need to go into the fucking future.

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,863
All right?

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,480
I hope you guys all had a merry Christmas.
Okay?

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,420
Have you noticed Mary
only goes with Christmas?

36
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,470
Do you notice that it's happy Hanukkah.
It's happy Kwanzaa.

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,870
It's go fuck yourself and it's
merry Christmas. Isn't that weird?

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,900
Mary Hanukkah.
Merry Kwanzaa.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,660
Marry Muhammad.
What is their Christmas?

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,203
MMM,

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,610
have a merry,
merry Mohammad.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,380
It's the best time of the
year Buddha to to dude,

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I know there won't be snow
cause we're in the Middle East.

44
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,020
They have any moms out there.
Do people

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,840
have I ever sounded dumber
in my life? Well, you know,

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,200
considering I just recorded a podcast
and then promptly fucking erased it

47
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,434
properly.

48
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,020
Like within fucking two minutes. That's
all I'm going to do. I'm going to bitch,

49
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:08,130
Moan and complain and whine about what
I just did rather than move on with my

50
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:12,900
life. All right, setting the
tone for 2018 once again,

51
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,620
we're going to look back rather
than being in the moment.

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,130
That's one of my goals for 2018

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
is to tell somebody who tells me to
be in the moment to shut the fuck up.

54
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,920
And when they say, well, why? Why
did you say, Hey, I'm in the moment.

55
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,270
You're annoying me in this moment.
Now that moment's gone.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm still talking about it. Did I
not take your advice? You can't.

57
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,220
Can you stop acting?
Is there anything,

58
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,150
you know some of the most spiritual
people have the most fucked up lives?

59
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,170
Are you enjoying it? Did you take it in?
Did you take a moment to fucking enjoy

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,650
dating a married guy?
The fuck out of my face?

61
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,503
MMM.

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,470
Anyway, sorry, sorry. Whatever.
Whatever. Well, there's four minutes.

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,700
All right. Four minutes. I just, I
just got it back. Oh, guess what?

64
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,660
I got some big news for you.
Um,

65
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,130
after a 131 days of being sober,

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,140
Oh, Gja age, oh,

67
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:27,130
Billy red face fell off the fucking wagon.
Um,

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,110
I put up a good fight right through the
holidays. I made it to December 26th.

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,770
What kind of a fucking
asshole falls off on the 26th?

70
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I could see New Year's eve. I
could, I mean, Christmas Eve,

71
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:43,270
I could see Christmas Day.
I could see New Year's Eve,

72
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:48,220
but the 26th and the history of
people falling off the fucking wagon,

73
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,180
who falls off on the 26? What do
you, what are you crying about?

74
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:56,650
The fact he didn't get a fire
engine the day before for Christmas?

75
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,220
Um, yeah, fell off.

76
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm going 131 days and very
proud of myself. I, yeah,

77
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,430
I can definitely have. It's definitely
in the moment. Uh, this is what happened.

78
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,580
Um, first of all, I had,

79
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,650
I had the best Christmas I've had since
I was a little kid and I still believed

80
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,460
that some fat stranger came
down the chimney. All right.

81
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,080
Uh, it was awesome. And
I was actually like a,

82
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:30,790
had a lot of stress about it because
I was flying back with my lady and my

83
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,770
lovely daughter and I was thinking like,
oh my,

84
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:37,390
all I've ever heard is people talking
about flying back with an infant.

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,650
It's a nightmare. Everyone,
you know? Yeah. You know,

86
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,140
by the end you're ready to get a
divorce and all this type of shit.

87
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,040
I gotta tell you something.

88
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,630
It was the fucking best Christmas I've
had since I was like eight years old.

89
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,530
When did I find out there was
Jake and the fat man was bullshit.

90
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,860
When did they find that
out, ma? First Grade

91
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,230
I find out in first grade because my
older brother found out in third grade.

92
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,130
He quickly told me,

93
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,770
and I remember I wasn't mad either. I
actually felt like an adult, like, oh wow,

94
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:19,330
man, I'm in a, I'm in on the
secret. Right. So anyways,

95
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,970
uh, coming back with a kid ended
up being the greatest thing ever.

96
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,010
It just, it takes all the pressure
off for you in your relationship.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,530
You just come back like, hey,
we did it, we got married,

98
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,790
we reproduced no more questions of when,
when,

99
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,810
when that's over.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,670
And then the best thing too is you come
home with a toddler and all everybody

101
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,360
wants to do is interact with the kids.
So nobody's asking you about your life,

102
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,680
nobody's giving you the third, what do
you got going on? What are you doing next?

103
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,200
What do you think about this?
Are you sure you're going to do that?

104
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,090
Was that the right move?
And next thing you know,

105
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:02,220
you're fucking boozing it up and
you're all fucking depressed. Um,

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,220
or getting into arguments or talking
politics or, I don't know what,

107
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,350
um,
all of that was God and I,

108
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:12,940
okay.

109
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,280
It was just great. I came in and
he was like, how are you doing?

110
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:21,270
Oh my God, look at your daughter. Then
that was it. There was no, you know,

111
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,830
I got a lot of social anxiety.

112
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,230
Like when I go to like
parties and that type of shit,

113
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,570
I was always the guy up on
the wall, you know? Okay.

114
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,020
It's a bunch of guys sitting around
watching a game. Then I'm in my element.

115
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,130
But once it becomes like the social thing,
there's no game on.

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,380
And uh, I, I don't know,

117
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,720
there's all this fucking weirdness going
on. Look at adults are so fucking weird.

118
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,220
You know,
there's all this like,

119
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,030
yeah,

120
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,190
it's just like the playground
when you were a kid,

121
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,080
but it becomes like adult shit.

122
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,660
Okay.

123
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,630
Like a, you know, I don't
know, competing. Right.

124
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,131
You know,

125
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:04,131
I dunno how much you making dreams if
you getting married or whatever the fuck

126
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,000
you going through. It just
becomes this, all this,

127
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,080
there's all these storylines
that are going on.

128
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,090
Yeah.

129
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,720
Maybe that's why my wife
has always watching those,
those reality shows I guess.

130
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:19,410
Cause all of that shit that's just
going on. You know what I mean?

131
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,160
Of just watching people so caught
up in bullshit that, you know,

132
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:27,900
your neighbor gets a better spatular
than you and it like affects your fucking

133
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:31,020
mood.
MMM.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,660
So anyways, so we went back there
and, uh, just watching people,

135
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,390
meeting my daughter and her like,
you know,

136
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:43,950
her big thing now she knows she
just waves at everybody and uh,

137
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,790
she could say hi now, although
she, she's yet to say it,

138
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,400
she looks in the mirror and says me.

139
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,360
And then she also says hi and I've
yet to see her do either either or.

140
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,560
Although this video of her saying hi,
um,

141
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,713
anyways,

142
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,830
okay.

143
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,660
Everybody was, you know, flip his sheet.
She, she killed it. She killed it.

144
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,240
She was a little starlet.
Everybody absolutely loved her and um,

145
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,940
her personality is really coming out.
And uh,

146
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,970
I got tell you what it was really fucking
crazy is like the more her personality

147
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,760
develops, like the more
I love her. It's crazy.

148
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:27,380
Like every time you
think he hit the ceiling,

149
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,240
like I could not love this kid anymore.

150
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,780
There's like another level and uh,

151
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,000
okay.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,860
I always hate it when I didn't have
a kid and people were going like, it,

153
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:41,530
you don't get it. You don't
get it. It's like, dude, I
can't, if it's a kid, you know,

154
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,090
I hate to say this, but they were right.
They were right. But having said that,

155
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:50,080
I will never tell somebody they
don't get it. Who doesn't have a kid?

156
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,140
That's a douchey thing to see. Now.
You don't get it yet. Okay. Yeah.

157
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:56,920
Neither did Joe. All right.
Stop acting like you're smart.

158
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,150
All right, there's 10 minutes.
20 more minutes to go. Um,

159
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,150
so, uh, I don't know. It was
just so many great things.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,900
Uh, I got together and jammed with a
couple of my brothers. We used to play,

161
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,710
used to butcher hair metal tunes back
in the 80s into the early nineties.

162
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,830
We had not gotten together and try it.

163
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,520
Attempted to play music in almost 24
years. And one of my brothers, uh,

164
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,790
rented this place. Uh, I got to give
them a shout out. It's in Somerville,

165
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,110
Somerville, which was known as
Slummerville when I was a kid.

166
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,010
Now it's all hipstery with like cupcakes
and fucking burger joints and shit.

167
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,840
Um, it's like an upscale thing, right?

168
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,720
And, uh, this place is called the jam
spot out in Somerville. Somerville Lumber,

169
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,210
that's all I remember from
out there. It was, uh, uh,

170
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:53,770
the jam spot was just a beautiful
clean place. Rooms were awesome.

171
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:56,500
All the equipment was the shit.
And the guy who worked there was just a,

172
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,760
just a great guy. Family man actually
got a kick out of the fact that a,

173
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,020
we were all brothers going to go down
there and play and we hadn't been playing

174
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:06,130
together and that fucking long.

175
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:10,180
We went in there and we
butchered some songs.

176
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,800
Sounded all right though.
Um,

177
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,240
and then at the end a couple more of
my relatives came down to like doing

178
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:20,260
karaoke at the end and they sang and we
actually had the place from 12 to four

179
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:22,390
in the afternoon. I remember
thinking like two, two hours,

180
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,710
it's going to be more than enough.

181
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,940
We know like six songs from almost,
you know,

182
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,560
a decade and a half ago.

183
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,070
We're going to play for about 20 minutes
and we're just going to be staring at

184
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:37,630
each other. And, um, that's
actually not what happened.

185
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,910
It flew by and uh,

186
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,490
and what we were trying to
work on a couple songs, uh,

187
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,090
ACDC walk all over. You touched
too much. How would it hell,

188
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:52,180
we always had that one down.
And uh,

189
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:54,210
then one of my brothers always
play Stevie Ray Vaughan.

190
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:55,620
So we played a bunch of that stuff.

191
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,240
And then a few more relative showed up.
Next thing you know,

192
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:05,130
we were playing Zeplin the ocean
and uh, it was, it was just,

193
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,320
it was fucking awesome.
And then after that,

194
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:10,770
that's when we went out
and got a steak and a,

195
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,380
one of my other relatives
hadn't been drinking since June.

196
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,710
I had been drinking since August. So we're
like, we're going to do this. He's like,

197
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:20,220
yeah, let's do it. Fuck it. So he
orders a Johnnie Walker black and like,

198
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:24,510
come on man, we're going off the
wagon after to six and four months.

199
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,580
Say we got to, let's get the
blow. So we ordered the blue,

200
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:29,220
but it was a steak house. So it was around
the holidays and they were out of it.

201
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,910
So I forget if we've got the gold or
the platinum, but it was really good.

202
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,760
And my buddy stopped at
one, I had one more. And uh,

203
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,500
and then that was it.

204
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,740
We called it a night and then like two
hours later I was back in the hotel room.

205
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:48,030
I gotta be honest with you, I felt
like shit. And I was just like, wow,

206
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:52,860
I do not miss feeling like this. Um,
I don't think I like drinking anymore.

207
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,760
And then yesterday I went to the airport
and of course they had the American

208
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,510
Airlines terminal at Logan,

209
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:04,680
they have to Cisco brewery and I loved
Nantucket and I love Cisco Brewery.

210
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:09,600
So I'm like, well, I got to go in there
and get a fucking beer. So I had the,

211
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:13,890
a whale's tail Pale Ale had that nurse,

212
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:18,240
that thing that was delicious. And
then I get on the plane, I'm like, hey,

213
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:22,170
we don't have a fucking drink. And I know
I don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

214
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:26,900
Right. Fortunately, uh, I
avoided that. Uh, and, um,

215
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,930
I think what I'm going to do is basically,
um,

216
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,613
I think,

217
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,640
okay,

218
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm just going to take a few days off
as far as not drinking and then just go

219
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,370
back on the wagon on January
2nd I'm going to the Rose Bowl.

220
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,470
I got to have a couple of
cocktails when I'm there,

221
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,680
but I don't have to drink today. I don't
have to drink up until the rose bowl.

222
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,070
And I think that's just how I'm going
to boost rather than trying to go like a

223
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,880
whole fucking year and, you
know, so many days or whatever.

224
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,300
I just think I'm just going to pick
my spots. So being at the Rose Bowl,

225
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,690
it's a playoff game. That's a good
time to have a couple of drinks.

226
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,740
And then I really don't see any excuse
to have one for the rest of January. So,

227
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,920
or February or March,

228
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:11,270
I had a really don't see any event
coming up. Maybe a super bowl party.

229
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:12,104
I don't know.

230
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,950
But I think that's the way I'm going to
booze and I'll keep the weight off. Um,

231
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,430
I won't be a drunk dad
or whatever. And, uh,

232
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,980
I think that's basically the
way I'm going to do it. But, uh,

233
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,490
my daughter actually caught a cold,
you know, sewing people picking up,

234
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:31,370
holding her, you know, it's that time of
year was it, I guess it was inevitable.

235
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,620
So we were flying back and I was like,
Oh God,

236
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,740
six hours on the plane
with an infant with a cold,

237
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:40,790
this is going to be a nightmare.
And actually, uh, she was a trooper.

238
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,320
She fell asleep for like the first,

239
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:46,900
like 40 minutes and then was just up
for the rest of the flight. And uh,

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,120
she was a little bit whiny or whatever,
but anytime she would whine,

241
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,010
I just take it for a walk up
and down the aisle, you know,

242
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,660
because I don't want to bug other people
on the plane with my crying kid. And, uh,

243
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,030
I never resented people
if their baby was crying.

244
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,810
The only time it bugged me is if they
just weren't making any sort of effort to

245
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:08,440
try to entertain the kid. So, uh,

246
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,180
I was just walking her up
and down the aisle and uh,

247
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,330
cause she went over the stewardesses and
then they were holding her for a minute.

248
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,440
So it all worked out.

249
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,500
And I'm funny fucking
dad moment changing a,

250
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,710
uh, a diaper, you know,

251
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
on the plane, you know, in the bathroom
there. I never even noticed it.

252
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,900
Got a little thing that
fucking comes down.

253
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,980
I sterilize the whole thing with one
of the wipes the best I could. And uh,

254
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,751
that's a big thing.

255
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,540
Making sure your kid doesn't
touch anything and then
you got to wipe down their

256
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,880
hands and their feet and
everything when they come back out.

257
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,510
But a change in a fucking shit
diaper during turbulence on a plane.

258
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,660
I was like, all right, this is it.

259
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,590
I'm officially a dad. I knocked
it out, I knocked it out.

260
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,180
And um,

261
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,760
okay.

262
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah,
I got to tell you something too,

263
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:09,940
like all the things that I loved about
my lovely wife, you know, seeing one of,

264
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,493
okay,

265
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,110
seeing what an incredible
mother she is is, uh, I dunno,

266
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,390
that's a whole other level too.
It's a whole other level.

267
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:21,510
So I don't know what to tell you. This
is weird. I'm actually really happy.

268
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,110
So I don't know how know how funny
this fucking podcast is going to be,

269
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:28,260
but I had an awesome Christmas and um,

270
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,390
I was really at all this
stress thinking like, oh,

271
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:32,730
I'm like all I've ever heard is,
oh my God, going back to holidays,

272
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:33,960
bringing your kids and everything.

273
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:37,750
It's like as a parent you don't get
to rest and blah, blah, blah, blah,

274
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:42,020
Blah and all that. Uh, I had
a great fucking time and um,

275
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,770
I was thinking that we were just going
to fly back this time and then start

276
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,000
establishing Christmases out here by,

277
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:52,320
it's such a good time with like two days
left. I even said to me, I was like,

278
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:56,130
if you want to do this again next year,
I'll do it. Cause you know, it snowed,

279
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,370
it was out. It's just,
it was the shit. And um,

280
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,830
yeah. And my kid is awesome.
Even though she wears me out,

281
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,400
she'll literally wear me out and then
she'll finally go to sleep and then I

282
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,940
closed the door and I get this to, you
know, to lay down for a second like, ah,

283
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,510
and like five minutes I'll just sit
there and laugh and five minutes later I

284
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,510
just start thinking like,
I miss her.

285
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,830
I was at possible, how is that
possible? But I dunno, that's,

286
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,280
that's how it works. So
I'm not complaining. Um,

287
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,480
so anyways, uh, oh, you know,

288
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,300
when I could drink again
after new year's baby,

289
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,620
the night of the Patrice O'Neal benefit
to get that plug in there. There you go.

290
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,030
The Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit,
uh, entering, it's, let's see,

291
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,430
is this the sixth to the seventh one?
The seventh one,

292
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,070
right. Let's see here.
At 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

293
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:58,850
18 is the sixth one. And I want to thank
everybody that's been buying tickets.

294
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:02,740
We're almost sold out again
this year, which is really, uh,

295
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,520
it's truly amazing. And, um,

296
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,860
I have to thank Maureen Taren
and everybody else who, uh,

297
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,020
gives their time every year.
Jim Norton, Collin Quinn, uh,

298
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,660
Dave Attell, Bobby Kelly, Dane Cook,

299
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:21,590
all of his friends that
have taken time out of their
lives. And, uh, it's just fun.

300
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,200
You know, it's like a high school
reunion. And then also to see like a,

301
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,570
okay,

302
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,120
you know, we always have a couple of
the young, you know, I call them kids.

303
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,490
I went old fucked out. But, uh, it just
see, you know, they were teenagers when,

304
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,390
when Patrice has stuff standing up first
started coming on TV and he actually

305
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:42,460
influenced them to be comedians.

306
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:47,200
So getting to hear those stories and get
to see the young, the young guys, the uh,

307
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,250
Michael Che's,

308
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:51,460
the Hannibal Bursas and see them coming
out and how funny they are and all that.

309
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:54,700
It's just, it's just
a great thing. So, uh,

310
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:59,440
I will once again tweak the link.
I'll keep tweeting it until we, uh,

311
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,660
sell the whole thing out.
But once again,

312
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:05,320
thank you to everybody who's been over
the years been a helping to support that,

313
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,210
a wonderful cause. And as always,
after we pay for the theater,

314
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:14,500
all the money goes to Patrice has loved
ones that he was supporting while he was

315
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,670
still alive, taking care of them. So, um,

316
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,270
with that,
what are we going to do now?

317
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,360
How are we going to talk a little sports
here? A little fucking sport. Oh Shit.

318
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,890
Do you know what I watched
what documentary I watched
that was only like an hour

319
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,490
and 20 minutes long, but it took
me six hours to watch because, uh,

320
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,610
my lovely daughter would not go to sleep.
I watched

321
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,650
this documentary called, uh, Newman.

322
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,873
Right.

323
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,660
So I was initially attracted to the
title cause I thought it was going to be

324
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:50,200
about Paul Newman, who's like one of
the coolest guys ever saw. I'm like,

325
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:53,650
I gotta watch this, see what
they're talking about. Right.

326
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,400
And uh, you know, what's
it going to be about?

327
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:02,401
It's going to be about racing
career is acting career or his,

328
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:04,480
uh,
his charity.

329
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,790
I always wondered how
involved he was with that.

330
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,420
I just can't see the great Paul Newman
sitting there listening to people talking

331
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:13,850
about that Balsamic
vinegarette or spaghetti sauce.

332
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,570
Okay.

333
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,271
I bet.
I bet.

334
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,220
In the beginning he just wanted to
have a business and he's just like,

335
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:20,530
I don't want to deal with this shit.
Just not just fucking running.

336
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,100
Give them money. The port. Um, by the way,

337
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,760
did you see some fucking jerk off?
Bought his watch,

338
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,920
his actual watch for 17 point $8 million.

339
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,610
What,
what kind of a fucking asshole?

340
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,670
Then what do you do with it
then you put it on like, oh,

341
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:41,570
like I feel as life force, maybe
I can act now. Maybe I'm cool.

342
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,090
Um,
I just don't,

343
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:50,750
I don't understand that type of shit.
I Dunno.

344
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,060
I guess I do a little bit,
maybe it's like musical instruments.

345
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:57,230
I think it'd be cool to see a
couple of really famous instruments,

346
00:20:57,231 --> 00:21:00,500
but I wouldn't want to own them.
You know,

347
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,510
like if you had somebody like
some famous person's guitar,

348
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,930
they pass away and you have that guitar
and then you're playing their music on

349
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:13,460
that with your skill level. You
know, I know the guitar is an alive,

350
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:15,490
but if it was when it started crying.

351
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,173
Okay.

352
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,270
Um, anyways, uh,

353
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:25,641
so I,

354
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:30,641
I rented this documentary called Newman
and it was about this guy who came up

355
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:37,510
with a electromagnetic
device that produced energy.

356
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:42,511
And the big thing about it was not
only was it clean energy was the device

357
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:43,570
itself,

358
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,570
somehow it created more energy
than it was using to run.

359
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,750
And I didn't know that that was a
problem because I have a horrible science

360
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:59,370
background. So, uh, just, just watch
it. See what you think. Alright.

361
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,610
Basically, I wasn't aware of this.
Any engine, any sorta turbine,

362
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:10,500
anything, whatever. I guess what,
even if it's used to create energy,

363
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,900
maybe they all are, I guess, you
know, some sort of turning forest.

364
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,540
I don't know what I'm in.
I'm in way over my head.

365
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,380
They had always day, always like you're
always in a deficit because it, it,

366
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,293
I guess it,

367
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,190
it uses more energy than it
actually fucking produce as well.

368
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:31,620
This thing that this
guy created allegedly,

369
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,940
like it used 10% of the energy
that it actually created,

370
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,850
which was fucking unheard of.
So when he went down to get a patent,

371
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
they will like what you're
doing is impossible, sir.

372
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:50,841
That sounds like witchcraft is it
basically defied the laws of physics as we

373
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,290
know them right now.
So they were all saying what,

374
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,590
you probably got some transformer
hidden somewhere on your property.

375
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:01,260
They tried to find it,
they couldn't find it.

376
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,540
They just refuse to believe that this guy,
what he was doing was true,

377
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,650
which then goes,
you know,

378
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:11,580
they wouldn't give him a pat and then it
goes into all of this conspiracy theory,

379
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,350
you know,
that a big oil company,

380
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,040
politics and all of this shit,
we're standing in the way this guy,

381
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,740
cause he was basically going
to put them out of business.

382
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,700
And um,
I gotta be honest with you,

383
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:30,240
I believed everything that I saw in it.
Uh,

384
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,630
and spoiler alert, cause I'm going
to continue talking about this.

385
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:38,190
You should definitely watch it.
I believe that his device worked.

386
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,970
I believe that the patent company
probably with pressure from the oil.

387
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,230
Okay.

388
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,570
Um, wouldn't give him a patent.
I believe he got death threats.

389
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,660
And then I also believed that
he was out of his fucking mind.

390
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,370
I believe that he had
a god complex and um,

391
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,050
he certainly had a temper.
Just check this disguise,

392
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,630
one of those fascinating people ever.

393
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:06,730
And then there's no way to
watch this for me anyways,

394
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,260
for me to watch this.

395
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,090
Yeah.

396
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,810
And I'm not talking about the genius side
of this guy I'm talking about is floss

397
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,420
the Newman dude, his, the
is flawed personality.

398
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,600
I couldn't help but watch that guy.
You know,

399
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,760
when the investors would
come around and he'd be like,

400
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:28,770
I know what you want to do.
You want to steal from me,

401
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,280
I'll punch you right in your
fucking face. Right. I couldn't,

402
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,990
and I might even exaggerate.
I couldn't help.

403
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,030
Okay.

404
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,650
When I was watching that
to not see myself going,

405
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:47,030
that looks like me. When I try
and rent a car or when I try to,

406
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,400
okay.

407
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,360
Get customer service, that's what I ended
up doing. And even though I'm right,

408
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:55,420
I become wrong because
of the way I behave.

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,270
And um, it's really fascinating. And
just one of those things where you age,

410
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,040
you just,
you just want it to be true.

411
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,850
It will be so great if there was just
a way to seamlessly have that thing

412
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:11,500
developed.
Give the Guy Newman is credit.

413
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,590
He makes a ton of fucking money.

414
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,130
You let the fucking oil companies run
the God damn thing and they keep making,

415
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:22,580
I don't give a fuck.
I'll keep paying what I pay for oil.

416
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,663
All right,

417
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,000
let's quit.

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If we could pollute less and have to
liberate less people around the world

419
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,420
because of our fucking
dependency on this shit,

420
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,853
you know,

421
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,600
I really believed, you know, I
actually, I know you guys. Yeah.

422
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,550
They always say you get
your tin foil hat on.

423
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:47,230
I don't even know where
that reference comes from,

424
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,853
but

425
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,070
there seem to be this
incredible progression.

426
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,910
It's far is like,
uh,

427
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,130
in energy and in curing diseases and
then all of a sudden it just came to a

428
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,900
screeching fucking halt.

429
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,920
And it's my belief that it's because the
amount of money that is being made and

430
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:16,851
how entrenched those entities are and
how many is people's livelihoods are

431
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:21,510
attached to them that
they don't want that it's

432
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,840
okay.

433
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,310
There's just too much conflict
of interest to have it progress.

434
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,310
Like, uh, I dunno,

435
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,670
I'm one of those people that believes
that they can cure a way more diseases

436
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:38,620
than they let on. And I doctor told
me one time, a long time ago, he said,

437
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:42,100
look, there's no money in the cure.
The money is in the treatment.

438
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,110
And I know that's thought that human
beings would actually fucking do that.

439
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,210
But the way a corporation works is
kind of like the way back in the day,

440
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:54,210
the war games, the way they would
shoot off the warheads where it's like,

441
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:57,800
it took two people. Everybody's fucking
got a turn, a key. And every or,

442
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,520
or when they would gas somebody
or shoot somebody, you know,

443
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,840
and the firing squad, somebody had like
a fucking rubber bullet or an empty gun,

444
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,250
so everybody would fucking
do it. Uh, I dunno,

445
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
I ain't, you know, something
half by the end of that,

446
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,830
that didn't even make sense
to me. But I, I just, I don't,

447
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:20,100
I don't believe in people when it comes
to that doing the right fucking thing.

448
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:25,050
Well, that's to what happened. Watch the
fucking thing and decide for yourself.

449
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,930
I explained it so much better.
Oh,

450
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:32,430
now living in the past and
the podcast I already did. Um,

451
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,660
anyways, being back in Boston, you know,

452
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:40,020
something I really fucking missed was,
uh,

453
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,770
the Herald sports page and the globe
sports page. I was at fucking heaven

454
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,790
reading that sports page.

455
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:52,530
One day I sat down and they had all
the Bruins stats for this season,

456
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,200
all the Celtic stats,
all the patriots stats,

457
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,440
and then they had these giant
articles about all three teams.

458
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,960
There was still breaking
down the Patriots.

459
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:06,340
Buffalo bills game and rating the
quarterback, the running back,

460
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:10,540
the receivers, the offensive
line to defensive line, the
linebackers to secondary,

461
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,570
the special teams, the
coaching, grading them.

462
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,640
It's fucking phenomenal.

463
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,810
I'll tell you what wasn't phenomena was
watching those fucking assholes trying

464
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:24,290
to stir up some bullshit.
Right as we're going into the playoffs,

465
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,110
about Tom Brady in his fucking personal
trainer who gives a fuck whatever it's

466
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,550
personal trainers doing,
it's obviously working.

467
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,660
The guys ran out of digits on
one hand was Superbowl rings.

468
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,860
Now he's moved onto the other one.
I swear to God, the local media.

469
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,120
What would they be?
I tweeted that.

470
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:44,180
What the fuck would they be doing if
they weren't trying to sabotage the local

471
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:48,830
team and all you fucking cops out there
who then pile on and start commenting

472
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:50,360
and calling into these sports shows.

473
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,130
Anytime there's shitting on the fucking
home team like that. Like, look,

474
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:58,610
if it's deserved, it's deserved. But
if they're just trying to stir up shit,

475
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,890
just stop. Just stop listening. Turn the
channel. So I mean, that's what I do.

476
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,763
Uh,

477
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,110
by the way, you know what's funny
is, uh, I saw yet another, uh,

478
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,780
eat guy at ESPN talking
about bill Belichick's press
conferences going on like,

479
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:18,410
God, there's, there's so intimidating.
It's like what is intimidating by it?

480
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,910
Stop acting like you don't know exactly
what the fuck the guys do and he knows

481
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:23,744
what you're doing.

482
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:28,810
You're trying to get him to give you a
quote so you can build your story around

483
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:33,170
that and then you can exaggerate and take
all this shit out of context and give

484
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,920
the other team bulletin board material.
That's why he doesn't talk to you guys.

485
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,040
Jesus fucking Christ.

486
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:44,170
Did you see that coach for after they
beat Georgia the first time they play?

487
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:47,020
We beat dog shit out of them.
Whatever the fuck he said.

488
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,820
I bet that was all over their locker room.

489
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,870
Fucking on the ceilings above their
bed until they played him again.

490
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:55,704
And what happened?

491
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,070
Yeah,

492
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,700
Georgia bulldogs.
Hey,

493
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,330
they came back and paid him
riding a fucking ass man
and they came back and beat

494
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:06,180
him. That's why I built Bella. Check
doesn't do that shit. All right.

495
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,230
That was another thing I liked
about Newman was that this guy was,

496
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,990
this was a good old boy
from fucking Mississippi.

497
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,860
And just being out here in La and
watching all these fucking actors and

498
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:20,070
actresses just openly shitting on
anybody who lives in the middle of this

499
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:24,360
country because they have the audacity
to vote for somebody different than they

500
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:25,770
do,
you know?

501
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,250
And evidently because they don't live
next to an ocean that makes them a fucking

502
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:33,690
moron. Just watching what this
guy did, allegedly, you know,

503
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,020
Johnny Carson was from like Nebraska.
I just don't understand. I just,

504
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,790
I don't get people out
here and then I might say,

505
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,670
I shouldn't act like it's everybody,
but it's just really fucking ignorant.

506
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,020
Anyways, that is the podcast. All right.

507
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,180
And that is the last
podcast for this year.

508
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,650
2017 was the greatest year of
my life becoming a dad. And,

509
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:59,710
um,
I know just so many great things,

510
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,940
you know, happened to me this year.
So I'm going to thank all you guys.

511
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,860
Everybody came out to shows
and all that type of stuff.

512
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:07,840
I really want to take the time.
I never do this.

513
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,900
I always call you guys because
I like to think it's a daring,

514
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:14,470
but thank you guys for the
best year of my life. And um,

515
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,730
I hope 2018, I don't even think it
needs to be better. Just match this one.

516
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,690
Just be in the cruising altitude job,

517
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,360
the path you have to be the
presage shut up. You can't.

518
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,240
Um, but anyways, uh, that's it.

519
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,080
I'm not doing shit.

520
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:36,460
I have basically all a
fucking January off and uh,

521
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,550
I'm going to put together another 20
minutes to add to all the bullshit that I

522
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,990
have,
that sort of thing

523
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,990
goal. And uh, I'm going to court,
I'm going to tour a lot this year,

524
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,220
put it that way and I'm looking
forward to an amazing year. Alright.

525
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,310
Enjoy this music. And then a throwback
episode of Thursday afternoon,

526
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,430
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. Have a great weekend.

527
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,740
[inaudible] happy new year
and I'll talk to you in 2018.

528
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,060
[inaudible]

529
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,200
Hey,
what's going on?

530
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:30,430
It's bill burr and it is the Monday
morning podcasts from Monday,

531
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,510
December 28,

532
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,410
the final Monday morning podcast for 2009.
Can you believe it?

533
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,510
Another decade. Has Flown by
through, this was like the most,

534
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,740
um,
stealth decade of all time.

535
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,010
And I'm going to tell you why,
just in case you're worried,

536
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:56,310
I would make such a bold fucking statement
about the Goddamn calendar and then

537
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:00,220
never give you an explanation.
I'm going to tell you why,

538
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,080
because every decade that I've lived in,

539
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,120
at least that I can remember that I lived
in the 70s everybody would discuss the

540
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:11,530
seventies one of the 70 [inaudible] like,
and then the eighties the big eighties.

541
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:14,380
Right? And then, you know,
people talking about, you know,

542
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:18,190
the 90s people would make
references on sitcoms, you know,

543
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,720
about the coming nineties,
right? It had a fucking name.

544
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Every decade that I've been in
has had a name seventies the 60s,

545
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,980
the eighties and the nineties but
this decade had no fucking name. Ah,

546
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,790
the art,
the two thousands we had,

547
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,770
we never decided on a fucking
name. Therefore, you know,

548
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,620
I wasn't really paying attention.

549
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,040
I wasn't really paying attention
as this decade whipped by,

550
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:52,060
because it's Kinda like the
odometer went back to zero. Right.

551
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,390
Uh, this is getting
this, getting shaky here.

552
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,700
I just realized I'm really
getting into some shaky territory.

553
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:02,350
It's kind of like it went back to
two to zero, right? Except it didn't,

554
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,540
it was,
it was at 2000,

555
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:09,340
which actually comes back after 1999.
I'm just saying. You know what I mean?

556
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,900
It's like, what the fuck? What happened
to this decade, you know? I Dunno.

557
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,100
That was pathetic. I really sounded
like I had something to say there.

558
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:20,720
And it went absolutely fucking nowhere.
Um,

559
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:25,210
which is the theme of this podcast
every damn week. Every fucking week,

560
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,390
you know, for the last few weeks.
Look, give me with a gratuitous fucks.

561
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:31,090
Why am I saying fuck so
much this fucking week?

562
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:34,810
You know why I have not been on stage
since I taped my latest special.

563
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,500
I have been on vacation

564
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,180
vacation and uh,
I haven't been doing shit.

565
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,210
I've been stuffing my fats
face with holiday cheer and a,

566
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:52,980
I dunno what you guys have a good
Christmas. Did you have a merry Christmas?

567
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,190
Isn't that just put a song in your
heart to say that to somebody?

568
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,180
Merry Christmas. Ah, what the
fuck? Who's calling me now? Ah,

569
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,670
Shit. Hey, I'm doing my podcast.

570
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:08,340
Let me call you back in about 40 minutes.
Okay,

571
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,140
there we go.
Anyways,

572
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,780
merry Christmas to one and all. Um,
yeah, I got to get on stage here because,

573
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:19,170
uh,

574
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,170
now that I've basked in the glory
of not fucking up my special,

575
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:29,370
everything went great. Now I can
take a vacation. Now, you know,

576
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:33,780
there's this little voice in the back
of my head going, dude, you know, um,

577
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:38,520
you don't have an act right now.
Technically you really don't. So, uh,

578
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,840
why don't you go do some shit and
hopefully some funny shit will happen.

579
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,220
Um, um, speaking of which, um,

580
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,200
some of my girlfriends family came out
and we took them out to Venice beach out

581
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:55,530
here in California and a, if you
know about out there, you know,

582
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,940
there's a bunch of freaks out there,

583
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:00,450
but there's enough regular people
sort of tours that it waters it down,

584
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,680
but a big to beating the fact
that it was the Christmas week,

585
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,020
there wasn't a lot of tourists out there.

586
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:09,900
There wasn't even a lot of regulars
out there. So when we showed up,

587
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,640
it was pretty much wall
to wall freaks and uh,

588
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,970
just had a fucking great time out there.

589
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:21,900
This guy was standing in front of some
sort of fun house shit that I'd never

590
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:25,920
seen before and he was that
classic, you know, you know,

591
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:30,000
step rad have stepped right up
and he's going see the rubber man,

592
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,180
see the electric boy.
And then he goes and look,

593
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,070
look what just came in from the space
station and he reached into a bucket of

594
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:40,980
water and he pulled out
a two headed turtle.

595
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,240
It was one of the greatest
fucking intros to something. Yo,

596
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,620
look what they just look what just
came in from the space station. Right.

597
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,461
First of all,

598
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:58,440
I like the fact that this fucking shit
on Venice beach standing next to a crack

599
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:02,820
head has some sort of direct link
to the space station. All right.

600
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,260
I also like the term the space station.
Is there a space station?

601
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,470
I haven't seen a report on space for a
long fucking time considering NASA really

602
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,500
fell off. They really
fucking fell off. You know,

603
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,040
when I was a kid,
you know they were going to the Goddamn,

604
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,510
they'd been to the moon. All right.
That was like the godfather moment,

605
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,390
or at least they pretended to go to
the moon. I don't know what they did,

606
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:32,391
but I bought it and they would literally
feeding us Tang at school and for all

607
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,180
you youngsters out there,
this was,

608
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,270
it was powdered orange drink that
they is what the astronauts drink.

609
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,330
You know when they're up there and I, you
know, outer space and they don't have a,

610
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,800
they don't have the, I dunno what
I'm trying to say. They, they,

611
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:52,060
they can't get into any decent
fucking food or liquids.

612
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,140
Would you like to see what it's like
to drink a poor excuse for a raw orange

613
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:59,710
juice and be like an astronaut? And
of course you did. Of course she did.

614
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,390
There was actually a dream
of many kids growing up.

615
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:06,490
What would you like to be?
I'd like to be a hockey player.

616
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:08,530
What would you like to be?
I think you'd be a heel keeper.

617
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,000
What would you like to be? I'd like to be
a fucking astronaut. Well. That's nice.

618
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,510
Tim. He could you say it again without
the curse words? You little cunt.

619
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,280
Why do you have a fucking bowl cut?
Because it's the 70 sweetheart.

620
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,260
They're my dad. Grow up with malaria
and curly. Um, remember that?

621
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,020
Remember the seventies number?
That shit when it was still okay,

622
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:33,520
it was still acceptable for your parents
to cut your fucking hair even though

623
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,760
they had no beautician skills whatsoever.

624
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:40,690
My Dad cut my fucking hair
right up until sixth grade.

625
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,981
Sixth grade,

626
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:46,600
just laying a template for no pussy right
through fucking a right through high

627
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:51,430
school. What am I trying to say? So
there was, this guy goes, this guy,

628
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,820
look what just came in
from the space station.

629
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,480
Now obviously there's no rubber man.
There's no electric boy.

630
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,380
I know it's all bullshit. But you
figure if you're going to make uh, a a,

631
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,480
a reference to space,

632
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,100
you're going to pull out something that
looks like it came for fucking space.

633
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:12,760
I'm sort of rock that you found on the
beach claim. It's part of an asteroid,

634
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,910
maybe part of a bigger asteroid
that's headed right towards us.

635
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:19,150
Whatever you got to do. This fucking
guy pulled out a two headed turtle.

636
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,270
Look what just came in
from the space station.

637
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:25,900
They were up in the fucking space station.
And look what came floating by

638
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,090
a deformed,
uh,

639
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,110
fuck an amphibian that needs to be within
this atmosphere and a fucking know.

640
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,830
And I'm trying to say here, I just
thought it was fucking hilarious. And me,

641
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:42,220
my girlfriend and her family
laughed for like fucking 10 minutes.

642
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,030
You know that when someone just does
something stupid out in public and then

643
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:49,120
that just becomes like the catch phrase.
You know what I mean?

644
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:52,510
The keep on trucking moment of your
afternoon, anytime the, you know,

645
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:55,540
the conversation would die down.
Someone would just say, hey,

646
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:59,620
look what just came in from the space
station. Oh, when we would laugh,

647
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,070
we had a great fucking time,
bunch of freaks out there.

648
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:06,610
I saw a black guy in a yellow
fung walking on broken glass.

649
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,980
Now he didn't have a thong.
The other guy,

650
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,540
it was an American flag fung and the
other guy was dressed and as skin tight,

651
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:17,300
fucking yellow. I don't
know what it was. Um,

652
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,100
he was basically walking
barefoot on trash, but I got
to admit, he pulled a crowd.

653
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,963
I was impressed,

654
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:27,030
very impressed at the best one I saw
was I saw this dude who was wearing a

655
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:32,110
derby, which is a type of hat. I
don't if it's a bowler hat or a derby.

656
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:32,650
I don't,
one of those,

657
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,650
one of those like Charlie Chaplin hats
and his big Shtick to get money was he

658
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:43,250
would walk backwards in front of tourist
with his hat on and he had an empty,

659
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,980
uh,
like Paper Cup that you'd have cocaine.

660
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:51,170
And he was just sort of hitting it up
in the air and before it would land,

661
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,240
he'd hit it up with the
other hand and it would,

662
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,850
and would go no higher than
just the top of his hat.

663
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,360
And he had this look on his face
like, Eh, am I doing something?

664
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,310
And then there was another dude out there,

665
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,820
this drug addict who had his side
kick me in the ass for a buck.

666
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,270
He started yelling at me to do it.
And I,

667
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:11,830
I just was laughing cause I'm saying I
can't, I can't do that. I'm not, I don't,

668
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,990
first of all, I'm not going to kick in the
ass for a buck. I don't want, you know,

669
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,850
it's humiliating.
I don't want to do that too.

670
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,200
And then not to mention the second you
bend over, I'm going to fucking do that.

671
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:24,350
You know, you know you have a kick your
friend in the ass and you kick him.

672
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:29,270
So you want to kick him so hard that
you misjudge it and you actually hit his

673
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:34,220
ball bag from the, from the
other side. That's what I,

674
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,970
I envisioned myself doing it at that
point. I, I would think that, you know,

675
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:42,890
then I've got to fight a fucking drug
addict and I get hit hepatitis, whatever.

676
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,410
Look at me acting like a, you know,
that's what I was going to do. No,

677
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:47,870
you weren't bill. You weren't going to
do that. That's what you wanted to do.

678
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,070
But you didn't have
the balls to do what's,

679
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:52,460
he laughed like a little girl and
he continued on down the boardwalk.

680
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,510
That's what the fuck you
did. You know, you know,

681
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:58,130
speaking of a new hour of comedy,

682
00:42:58,131 --> 00:43:01,040
that's something I always wanted to talk
about on stage and I always thought it

683
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:01,874
would be funny,

684
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,100
but I never really kind of was able to
make it funny was those fucking people

685
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:09,950
will always, you tell, tell him something
that happens, something bad to you.

686
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,980
And then the second they'd done
listening to it, they always go, dude,

687
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,390
you know what I would've done? You
know what I woulda done? Let me guess.

688
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,040
You would have done something that worked.

689
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,450
Now that you're basically in the
future and saw what the fuck happened,

690
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,610
asshole. Yeah, and I'd leave. I parked
my car and I go to get out of it.

691
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:30,830
All of a sudden it started
rolling down the fucking street.

692
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,380
I don't know what happened. I
had the thing in gear, dude.

693
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:36,190
You know what I would've done?
I would've had it an emergency.

694
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,590
It would have put the emergency brake
on and I were to turn the fucking tires

695
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:40,251
towards the curb.

696
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:44,750
That's what I would've done
in anticipation that the
one fucking time you didn't

697
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:45,990
put the emergency brake on,

698
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:50,000
that your car that never slipped out of
gear before was then going to slip out

699
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:52,790
of fucking gear. Shut up,
you asshole. You know,

700
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,470
if you had that sort of intelligence,

701
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,250
he wouldn't be friends with me hanging
out in this shit hole fucking bar. Right?

702
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,780
Well, all right then. All right. Now that
it got myself worked up into a lather,

703
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,070
look at me wearing my Christmas
patriots. Jersey. What a fucking nerd.

704
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:07,904
How old are you?

705
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,810
It looks like if she's standing with a
book bag waiting for a bus, you know,

706
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,520
it's just not cute anymore. Um, all
right, let's get on with the podcast.

707
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:20,750
If you're new to the podcast,
welcome, welcome. Um,

708
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,090
I got some news this week. Everybody. Uh,

709
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:26,540
I know I keep threatening to join
Facebook and I'm going to have to do it.

710
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm going to have to do it because there's
just nobody left here on my space. Uh,

711
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,990
I'm a, I'm giving up. I'm pulling the
flag down and putting up the white flag.

712
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:40,290
I surrender you when Facebook you when
got damaged if it wasn't for those

713
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:43,450
meddling kids. Um, all right,

714
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,990
so let's get on with the podcast
and if you knew the podcast,

715
00:44:46,991 --> 00:44:50,830
I try to hype my shit. This is what
I got going on. I'm on vacation.

716
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,300
Okay.

717
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,950
I just taped a new special called let
it go and it'll be out in 2010 at some

718
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:58,450
point.
If you can't wait that long,

719
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:02,230
why don't you go on iTunes or going to
my website [inaudible] dot com and go buy

720
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:06,070
my fucking DVD. Why do
I do this? All right,

721
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,840
so I can get a little check.

722
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,110
I can get my little fucking $3 or whatever
the fuck I make on those things. Um,

723
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,750
anyways,
my next Gig is an uh,

724
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:21,250
Seattle January 15th,
and I'm doing the Marty reamer.

725
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:25,680
Funny Fest. Martin Green was a great
guy, great radio guy up there in Seattle.

726
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,290
He's got this, uh, this big comedy show
that I have been trying to do for years,

727
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,460
and I'm going to be up there with a bunch
of other big shots like a Jeff garland

728
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,050
and a, and a bunch of other people. I
can't even fucking remember who else.

729
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:40,600
Me Up there with Christian
Finnegan number. I hate that.

730
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,640
The other white dude
in the Chappelle show.

731
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,150
Who would some people you want the
Chappelle show? Will you on the, uh,

732
00:45:46,151 --> 00:45:49,540
the mad real world? No, I
wasn't. That was the other guy.

733
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,000
And then people try to argue with me.
Not that we show that we shoe.

734
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,910
Why would I lie? Why would I, why would I,

735
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,240
why would I try to knock down my
pathetic entertainment resume?

736
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,370
I'm all about padding it. All right,
let's get on with the podcast here. Um,

737
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,310
what do we got here? Let's start off with
Douche bag of the week. All right. And,

738
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:10,144
um,

739
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,240
my nominee for Douche bag of the week
is the NFL network for showing a fucking

740
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:19,240
game on Christmas. That was only on their
goddamn network. You know what, dude?

741
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,710
Fuck the fucking NFL network.
All right.

742
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:28,810
Have any guys out there actually looked
into what it takes to get a God damn

743
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:32,170
dish? First of all, if you're
renting somewhere, right?

744
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,030
You landlord is going to be a cunt.

745
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,020
If you start drilling into the side
of the building, right? You know,

746
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,360
a repair that's probably
going to cost him $80,

747
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:44,830
but somehow we'll take the entire
12 to $1,500 a year fucking deposit,

748
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,920
you know? And then also, you
know, I don't know about you guys,

749
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:50,860
but when I actually first moved out here,
I was getting the flat screen.

750
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:54,430
I was like, fuck it. She's going to
light up the card. And they're like,

751
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:57,100
would you like to get direct TV?
And I'm thinking, yeah, fuck it.

752
00:46:57,101 --> 00:47:00,310
I'll get the NFL network. I can
watch the pats games. Why not?

753
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,420
And they wanted me to sign up for like
two or three years. Like it's a, uh,

754
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,710
like a cell phone company.

755
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,660
I don't have to do that with cable cable
right now. I could call them and say,

756
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:15,080
you know what? I'm sick of
your shit. Go Fuck Yourself.

757
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,370
And they'd be like [inaudible] or tearing
your Karen [inaudible]. She Ain't,

758
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:20,630
if you didn't use sign language,
fuck you.

759
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,500
You fucking Sunday work
in cable cont right.

760
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,920
And they would just shut it
off and then that would be it.

761
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,800
And then I could back on Monday and
be like, yeah, listen. You know,

762
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,890
I don't know. I was, I
was drinking. I was Ah,

763
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,890
I lost some money on the
games and I took it out on,

764
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:40,150
I believe her name was Samantha.

765
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,430
I don't know where she was
stationed and your states,

766
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:46,840
but is there any way you can turn
it back on? Absolutely. Absolutely.

767
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,630
There'll be a UI $80 Ra.
Go Fuck Yourself.

768
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:54,370
Restart up fee to match
the $90 cancellation fee.

769
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:58,810
You know, that's the way they
get ya. Okay. But I got mobility,

770
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,190
I got freedom.
I mean,

771
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,190
I have a feeling of control going to
sign a fucking three year contract,

772
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,640
you know,
the level of,

773
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:14,730
of of Douche baggery by the NFL network
to show a game on Jesus's birthday.

774
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,740
God's son, he sitting there trying to
think, Jesus has fucking direct TV.

775
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:25,660
I don't think he does.
You know, fucking hippie.

776
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,860
You think he's going to be involved in
some sort of corporate contract? Man,

777
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,740
I dunno. You know what I mean? Look,

778
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,540
I don't mind if you can show the
random Thursday game. I get it.

779
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,680
You're trying to get me,
you know,

780
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,370
you're trying to get me all right and
you have your best matchups. Okay.

781
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:45,610
And you got to ll cool j on the
fucking TV licking his lips,

782
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:49,080
telling me about all the fucking
games that I'm missing. Uh,

783
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,000
how many fucking tubes a chapstick
does that guy go through a year?

784
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,180
It doesn't make your lips
chapped if your own saliva,

785
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,520
if you keep them glistening
with your own saliva.

786
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,700
That's one of those uh,

787
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,200
those evidently urban sexy
moves that makes, I don't know,

788
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:09,040
white people in the suburbs just cringe.
Like really they do that.

789
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,780
They lick their lips and that's
like a good thing. Um, anyways,

790
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,350
I like how I just made all white people
in the suburbs feel the way I feel about

791
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:21,130
ll cool j licking his lips anyways, Douche
bag of the week. NFL network. All right,

792
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,060
you fucking assholes.

793
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,020
If you want to show a random Thursday game
and you know into to try to get me to,

794
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:28,870
to, to buy it. I get it. You're a
business but don't do it on Christmas.

795
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:32,890
You asshole. You know what you did. You
just made me more of an NBA fan. Okay.

796
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:36,520
Cause they had the Celtics magic and
they did their best guys out there.

797
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:39,220
They had Lebron, Kobe, Shaq. All right.

798
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,100
The big three up in
Boston and Dwight Howard,

799
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,580
who's got a bicep the size of my entire
body and has absolutely zero fucking

800
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:52,540
baseline moves. Jesus,
what's his one movie? Dunks.

801
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:53,711
You know,

802
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:58,711
if that guy would just steal one move
from fucking Kevin Mchale via a Keem

803
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,590
Olajuwon he would be unstoppable.
But he doesn't, he's got nothing.

804
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:04,090
He's got no turnaround jumper.
He's got nothing.

805
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:08,560
He's just got a bicep the size of a
fucking credenza. He's got two of them.

806
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,320
Um, anyways, seriously dude,

807
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,200
that's like the biggest fucking
human being I've ever seen.

808
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:17,640
So douche bag or the week is
the fucking NFL network and I'm

809
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,200
fucking cough. Um, I dunno, I
really want to write them a letter.

810
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,740
I just have to take all the fucks and
cons out of it and I think that they're

811
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:29,780
really going to give a shit,
but I'm going to go biblical on him.

812
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,510
You know what I mean?
Because everybody pays attention.

813
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:35,330
When someone starts saying that
you offended me religiously.

814
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,530
And speaking of which,

815
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,180
I am introducing a new
segment here on the podcast,

816
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,950
and this is the,
uh,

817
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,160
the religious segment where you can
ask questions about other religions.

818
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,060
You can bitch about your own religion or
you can say why it's great and why you

819
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:54,010
like it. All right? Uh, the name
of this segment is, oh Geez,

820
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,760
because you know, last week,

821
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:00,350
I don't even know what
the fuck I said about, oh,

822
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:04,010
I remember that guy was saying how you
were, um, how we think share a you,

823
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:07,770
you make a choice to be gay.
And then he starts, you know,

824
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,820
making some quotes with the Bible. And
I was just like, Oh, you fucking people,

825
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:15,200
you know, with the Bible, right?
So this guy writes in and he goes,

826
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:19,370
trash in the Bible at Christmas.
What have you gone?

827
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,530
Stark raving mad or something.

828
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:25,850
This guy sounds like a a
born again Christian cause
he's obviously not going to

829
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,340
curse here.
Have you gone stark raving mad?

830
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,490
I mean Jimminy cricket spill. Anyways.
Did you hit your head or something lately?

831
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,580
Okay. Let's see. You do
believe in God, right?

832
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,750
But you went to a Catholic church where
they filled your skull with guilt,

833
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,760
horror and hypocrisy. And then he puts
in parentheses the little boy thing. Oh,

834
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:49,370
is that what you call children?
Getting molested

835
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,690
grown men. Fucking children. You call
that the little boy thing. Alright. Uh,

836
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,560
or whatever they did to turn you off.
Okay. Understandable. Understandable.

837
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:04,850
But for crying out loud,
this, this right here,

838
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,880
this email is why I don't work clean
as a comedian because you have to use

839
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:13,130
expressions like for crying out loud.

840
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:17,000
Have you gone stark raving mad?
Um,

841
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,660
many ways for crying out loud.
What makes you think God is like that?

842
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:26,000
He's not exclamation point. I
never said he was, he's fucking,

843
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:30,290
people don't even listen to me. I'm
saying the Bible was written by people.

844
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:34,760
That's what I feel. Okay. It was with
my people a long fucking time ago.

845
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,590
They thought the earth was flat. Okay. A
lot of its metaphors, a lot of the shit.

846
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,720
I know a lot of stuff, you
know, make sense of whatever,

847
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:43,700
but it's written by people,
all right?

848
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,560
And I don't believe that Jesus
was the son of God, okay?

849
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:52,010
I don't believe you'll rub
Buddhist stomach. I don't
believe any of that stuff.

850
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,760
Okay?

851
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,760
All those stories are the bridge between
right now and back when we used to draw

852
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:00,920
a deer on the inside of caves,
all right?

853
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,170
I'm not saying there's not
a fucking higher power.

854
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,390
I'm not saying I don't
believe in an afterlife.

855
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,420
All I know is that you don't know what
the fuck is going on until you die,

856
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,930
all right?
So you can make you guesses.

857
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,330
Your guesses are, are, are, are,
you know, qualified. You know,

858
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,030
I'm not saying you can't make your guests
if that's what the fuck you want to go

859
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:23,864
for,
but you know,

860
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,380
I'm not saying you can't believe
what you want to believe.

861
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,790
I just don't believe in that stuff. I
just don't. Do you really believe that?

862
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,620
You really believe Jesus was the
son of God and he, and he just,

863
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,740
he had a wicker basket and he just
was pulling fish out of it and fed 800

864
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:44,991
fucking people out of this little basket
that you usually throw a fucking hot

865
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:48,810
steam and washcloth into,
you know,

866
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,320
and he walked on water and
then he rose from the dead.

867
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:56,400
You really believe all of that. I don't
know. Why is my voice going up so high?

868
00:53:56,401 --> 00:54:01,110
You ain't
even Jesus Christ.

869
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,390
Um, I'm envious of that.
I remember you said that.

870
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:10,830
I, um, I dunno. I just, I
don't, I don't believe that, uh,

871
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,040
you know, I don't believe Noah, I
don't believe in any of those stories.

872
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,170
None of those stories a believable to me.
They're just not.

873
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:19,650
I could see the earth flooding
and everybody drowning.

874
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:24,270
I can see that. I can see, I can
even see a guy making a fucking boat,

875
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,990
or maybe people who are already on a boat.
You know?

876
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,880
Why didn't those people survive with Noah?

877
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,830
See, I can't even fuck an
answer. I don't know why.

878
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,950
Then you gotta fill it up with all those
animals shitting all over the place.

879
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,190
You've got to capture all the
animals. It's just, it's not,

880
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:47,080
it's not fucking believable on any level,
on any level. It lacks credibility.

881
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,150
I liked the Ted Commandments. I
love the seven deadly sins. Uh,

882
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:55,660
I like the end of the world shit,
but I don't take it that seriously.

883
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,810
And this is not me slapping anybody
in the face. I just, you know,

884
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,510
and I would think of to say this
because you have an open your,

885
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:06,310
she'll fuck Jay's is when you open your
shelf full up and you shipped him as

886
00:55:06,311 --> 00:55:10,660
your one and only savior. Yeah. Why can't
I do that? Why can't I just do that?

887
00:55:10,661 --> 00:55:14,440
Why do I then have to go to church and
fucking pay for somebody else's lifestyle?

888
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:18,610
Who wants to dress like James Brown's
in the fucking blues brothers? Huh?

889
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,000
And you guys out there
going a mega church,

890
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,810
you guys seen those things down the
south, down, down the south, down south.

891
00:55:25,811 --> 00:55:28,570
You'd be seen. I was, I didn't know
what the fuck I'm talking about. Look

892
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,070
the same way, that guy standing
out there going, you know,

893
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,920
look what they just brought
in from the space station.

894
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,390
That's what preachers are doing.

895
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,360
And let's say that they're
giving you like life advice,

896
00:55:40,361 --> 00:55:41,090
but when they just started

897
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:45,110
talking about that, uh, you
know, and then on the third day,

898
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,850
God created the swingset. Yeah. Gi,

899
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,210
it was written that children need
something to play on that would swing them

900
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:54,960
back and forth and you
have to do a flagger

901
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,100
brutal fucking brutal. This is really
just going to cause a shit storm.

902
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:03,680
And I hope it does. All right.
And, and, and all of this,

903
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:07,430
I'm not disrespecting your
religion or what you believe.

904
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,720
I just don't fucking believe it.
And I don't believe that you believe it.

905
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:17,000
That's how unbelievable it is to me. All
right. But I believe in and in something,

906
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,080
you know, you know that
shit where you like, yeah,

907
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,900
you'll walk to the phone and before you
say you'll get, just know who it is.

908
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,280
That kind of weird shit or
a Deja Vu. This. There's a
lot of weird shit out there,

909
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,160
you know?
Uh,

910
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:35,910
you forget to look and you change seven
lanes and you don't die and then you

911
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:38,460
think, wait a minute. Then I did. I just
looked back that I can't really remember.

912
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:42,930
You were in this fucking zone. I
don't know. I don't believe in ghosts.

913
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:45,040
You know?

914
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,650
I don't get what can it go studio other
than wake you up in the middle of the

915
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:53,940
night? I guess I can do
that. Go on beyond that,

916
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:56,520
what can they do?
You know?

917
00:56:56,550 --> 00:57:00,000
That's how I got over my fear
of the dark when I was a kid.

918
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:03,690
When I would imagine that
there was a monster in there.
I got so mad at the fear.

919
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:07,230
One night I started giving the monster
the finger and it didn't kill me and I

920
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:07,711
was like,
all right,

921
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:10,530
any respectable monster's not going to
put up with that shit and would come over

922
00:57:10,531 --> 00:57:13,740
here and fucking, there's no
monster is not much to the stupid.

923
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:18,950
This is actually just nature's way of
telling me it's time to go to sleep and

924
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,780
they're making it easy by
not having the sun there.

925
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:26,580
Did I ever tell you that time?
Uh, one of my friends was on this,

926
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,440
I can't say he was on a date.

927
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,150
You know that shit when you
went to like high school,

928
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:33,940
when you're basically drinking outside
and you just start talking to some bra

929
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,300
and you try to hook up with her.
All right,

930
00:57:36,301 --> 00:57:40,740
so it's getting the dusk and there was
this moment, okay, right around dusk

931
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,430
where the sun's going down and the moon
was a, it sounds like a fucking song,

932
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:51,180
doesn't it?
The Sun was going down in the moon,

933
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,600
like sounds going down in the west of
the moon was kind of like, I dunno,

934
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:59,430
I guess at like two o'clock or whatever.
And this girl was go and someone's like,

935
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:01,800
Oh wow, the sun and the moon are
out at the same time. Wow. You know,

936
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,100
and this girl was like,
wait a day.

937
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:10,420
How can the fact San and the movie?
Yeah.

938
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,313
It's sad.

939
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:16,820
And at first they thought that she didn't
believe that you could see the moon

940
00:58:16,821 --> 00:58:20,150
until the sun completely went down,
which I guess would be understandable.

941
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,600
But they quickly realized that she thought
that the sun and the moon where the

942
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:32,210
same thing and that evidently
at night,

943
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:36,890
I guess God or Jesus or Buddha would,

944
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,960
I don't know,
not necessarily blow this,

945
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,270
I guess she thought the sun was on
a dimmer and they would just sort of

946
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:48,390
gradually bring it down and uh,
I dunno. I don't fucking know.

947
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,660
And that's just one of those
moments where they always a kid,

948
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:53,840
you just have that first moment of,

949
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:58,760
is this thing too dumb to try and fuck,
you know,

950
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,930
I always had that I could
never fuck somebody. Whoa.
I really thought was stupid.

951
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:06,950
It just,
it just felt like it was a form of rape,

952
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,600
you know what I mean? If you just sold
like, I don't even stand, I'm a smart guy,

953
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:18,590
but you know, when someone's
just like borderline, like wow,

954
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,930
high school really. And
College. College. Wow. Okay.

955
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,140
All right. Uh, anyways, let me
read the rest of this though.

956
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,150
Jesus here and Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. The kid thing.

957
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,450
Um, he's not a he, he does. He
doesn't, oh, this is a great line too.

958
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,280
He's saying that God is not mad.
I,

959
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:41,840
this is one of my favorite sentences
of all time. He's addressing, um,

960
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,940
the view of homosexuality.
He says,

961
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:46,910
God doesn't hate fags either.

962
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,190
Oh, that's good. That's good. He doesn't
hate the, he doesn't, hey, cock suckers.

963
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,310
God loves the faggots.
Um,

964
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,350
he loves everybody and that is
written in a big letters. Um,

965
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,170
even people that hold up
traffic, a gay guy or not, uh,

966
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,600
he died for everyone.

967
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:13,040
Everybody's sins so they can accept
that free gift at the seat. That's,

968
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,880
that's right there.
That's what I find annoying about Jesus,

969
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,210
is the whole guilt. He died for you. Dude,

970
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:24,140
I didn't ask you to do that idiot.

971
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:29,480
Give fucking walk on water, you know,
float off the cross. Wow. I'm really,

972
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,550
yeah, this is really getting
bad. But I'm just saying,

973
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:33,140
isn't that common fucking sense?

974
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,620
Like when you watch a karate movie in
Bruce Lee's doing all this shit and he

975
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:38,540
like, just get a gun. Why
don't they just shoot them?

976
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,330
All I know is if I was the son of God,

977
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:46,100
I would not sit there getting crucified
or at least I cheated a little bit.

978
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,680
You know,
I had sort of semi levitate,

979
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:52,190
so it looks like the nails are really
fucking ripping at me and they,

980
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:57,200
you wouldn't, you wouldn't
everybody caves under, under,

981
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:00,690
under torture. They all do. I don't, I
don't buy any of this shit. You know,

982
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,430
it'd be funny is if all of this stuff
that I'm saying isn't true is true.

983
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:08,750
And then like I die and
then they play Mike,

984
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:12,530
my damnation is this podcast and you know,

985
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,680
they just playing this podcast and God
is just sitting across from me, you know,

986
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:20,430
with his hands up. Uh, you know
that shit where you, uh, okay, you,

987
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:21,710
you don't have your hands together,

988
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,590
you just have the tips of your fingers
together and they're kind of spread apart

989
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:28,970
and you just sort of bouncing
them, you know, the classic, um,

990
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,470
what am I going to do with you?
I am in a position of authority over you.

991
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,310
What is your sentence going
to be? Um, anyways, we'll
fuck it. Let's see. Oh, how,

992
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,580
how far into hell I can dig myself.
Um,

993
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,950
what else does this guy say
that I don't agree with a no.

994
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,310
We know Jesus didn't sit
down with stationary and
write the Bible at some desk,

995
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,640
but it is his words. You know
why? I would love to know why.

996
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:56,570
I would love to know your proof.
Okay. I'll tell you why Jesus.

997
01:01:56,571 --> 01:02:01,571
He anticipated my answer because I fuck
is it because I know you don't know it

998
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:07,190
was inspired by God.

999
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Jesus through the certain chosen
people that physically wrote it.

1000
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,840
Yeah,
I hear you saying bullcrap.

1001
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,390
Why can't you curse if you in Jesus?
I don't understand

1002
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,223
that.
You know,

1003
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:25,430
you don't think when they were nailing
his fucking limbs to that piece of wood,

1004
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,110
he wasn't going,
fuck yeah,

1005
01:02:30,111 --> 01:02:33,190
Ma fucker did.
Oh,

1006
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,710
do you know my dad is your mother

1007
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,410
fuckers? Come on. All right. All right.

1008
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,520
Jesus Christ. I'm really fucking,
you know, this is stupid to do this,

1009
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:50,480
but here we go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's keep going. Um,

1010
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,770
you know, something that they
never really fucked with his balls.

1011
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,620
I always thought that was amazing.
You know, this smashing like, uh,

1012
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:02,920
reads over his back, you know, and
putting thorns into his head went,

1013
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,020
just kick them in the nuts his whole year.

1014
01:03:06,021 --> 01:03:09,840
Then now nuts his ball bag.
That fucking died. They,

1015
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:14,810
I did it for you. Oh God. Is that
annoying? It's really annoying.

1016
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:19,160
I swear to God, if Jesus at the mall
signing autographs, I walk right by it.

1017
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,450
I'd rather meet Charles Bronson.
He was still alive, you know,

1018
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,340
talk to him about being in Poland
and that mind. Um, anyways,

1019
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,890
I hear you saying bullcrap,
but you are wrong.

1020
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,910
If you're saying that I didn't say
bull crap. I said Bull Shit. Uh,

1021
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,900
that just means you don't understand
spiritual and supernatural things. See,

1022
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,840
that's another thing about these really
religious people is if you don't agree

1023
01:03:41,841 --> 01:03:45,230
with them and they can't be like, oh, you
know, this is what the fuck you think.

1024
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:48,050
You know, I'm not saying what
this guy is saying is wrong.

1025
01:03:48,051 --> 01:03:51,740
I hope it's not coming off like that.
I'm just asking questions. You know,

1026
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:54,020
how come they never
kicked him in the balls?

1027
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,270
You think he didn't curse
when they were fucking,

1028
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,670
when they were playing the upright bass
with his juggler or whatever fucking

1029
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,100
horrific thing they did to him.
Um,

1030
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:09,020
I actually understand spiritual things.
I don't understand supernatural things.

1031
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,720
No, I don't. I don't believe in
ghosts and neither do you. Okay.

1032
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:14,240
And just because you read a fucking book,
it doesn't mean you understand it,

1033
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:19,070
right? You don't. All right. Uh,
so like so many other people,

1034
01:04:19,071 --> 01:04:23,210
you feel the need to stop on something
just because you don't understand it

1035
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:27,710
fully, and that makes
you mad. Okay. Uh, well,

1036
01:04:27,711 --> 01:04:29,510
how about instead of getting mad you,

1037
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:34,520
you asked Jesus himself to explain it
to you. Okay. I will hang on a second.

1038
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,423
Jesus,

1039
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,590
could you explain the Bible
to me cause I don't get it.

1040
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:54,290
Okay. All right. So now what do I
do? This is really getting creepy.

1041
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:58,120
This is, I feel like I'm about to
fucking weegee board right now. Um, I,

1042
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:00,560
I can't even read the rest of this. All
right? That's probably a fucking stew.

1043
01:05:00,561 --> 01:05:04,370
I really should not do this podcast.
I should just fucking hit a race,

1044
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,370
you know? All right. Let's talk about
movies. Shall We? Let's get out of this.

1045
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:13,140
I saw the movie Sherlock Holmes,
uh, this week. Me and half of,

1046
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,540
uh, the, the, the American population

1047
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,560
all went out this Jesus
get me back. Um, yeah,

1048
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:26,910
so Sherlock Holmes and uh,
this is my movie review.

1049
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:28,740
This is the best way that I can put it.

1050
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,030
It was watching Sherlock Holmes.
It was like a,

1051
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,240
that's how he said it to my friend
or friend of mine who actually have,

1052
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,510
who also it does not believe in Jesus.

1053
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,060
I said it was like
Sherlock Holmes was like,

1054
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,460
it was like the first time
you ate a fat free cookie.

1055
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,430
Do you remember that confusion?
You just looking at the cookie being like,

1056
01:05:49,431 --> 01:05:53,560
you know, how can this not be good?
It's, it's a fucking cookie. You know,

1057
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,820
how can a cookie be bad?

1058
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:59,030
And that's literally what I
felt like when I was watching,

1059
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,960
when I was watching Sherlock
Holmes. You know, I'm like,

1060
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:06,200
how is it Robert Downey Jr
has given a great performance?

1061
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:10,450
Fucking what's his face? Jude
law was great in it. Guy Ritchie,

1062
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:14,320
I loved all his movies.
How is this not fucking good?

1063
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,550
And I don't even know. I can't explain
it. I don't know why it wasn't good.

1064
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:24,730
It just wasn't bad. It
just, it was it, I dunno,

1065
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,350
it just, what it wasn't good. Um,

1066
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:32,550
I liked how they dumbed down Sherlock
Holmes l rather than having them be just

1067
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:35,640
an egg head. They, they
made him like this guy,

1068
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,230
like they turned it into like fight club.
First of all,

1069
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:43,231
it was great about the movie was that
they had elements of Jujitsu in England in

1070
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:46,650
the 18 hundreds which I thought was
hilarious cause as far as I knew it came

1071
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:48,420
from the fucking Gracie family.
Right.

1072
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:53,100
Then they get credit or
very least Brazilian Jujitsu
and he came up with it and

1073
01:06:53,101 --> 01:06:54,990
like the twenties or the 30s right

1074
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,070
now what happened? I
don't know. They did that.

1075
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:02,810
They had a little bit of Zeitgeisty in
there, a little bit of fight club and uh,

1076
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,960
and then after he beat the shit out of
people, then he would do all that Sherlock

1077
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,571
calm shit.

1078
01:07:06,571 --> 01:07:09,810
And he would say all the Sherlock
Holmes is fast as like an auctioneer.

1079
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,580
You're probably wondering how I knew that
because that thread indicates that you

1080
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:14,870
were in the Middle East
and blah, blah, blah,

1081
01:07:14,871 --> 01:07:17,720
and they would fucking fly through
the whole thing. And uh, I don't know.

1082
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:21,350
It wasn't good. I'm thinking about
seeing Avatar though, you know,

1083
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:24,500
but that even that movie annoys me.
I don't like the whole, you know,

1084
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:29,000
I wrote this and I had to wait till
technology caught up with it. Oh my God,

1085
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:30,770
you're such a fucking visionary.

1086
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,050
Jesus Christ

1087
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,310
having you want enough wards,

1088
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:36,830
you don't have to fucking rub
your own balls and public.

1089
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,430
I don't think I'm ever going to book a
movie again if anybody ever listens to

1090
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,790
this fucking podcast. All right, let's
plow ahead. Speaking of which date night,

1091
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:45,500
I actually saw a preview
for it and I was like,

1092
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:49,490
I'm in this motherfucker and I was so
afraid I was gonna see my big fucking head

1093
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,180
that I actually stared down at my,
uh, the fuck was a junior mints,

1094
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:55,531
Junior Mints,

1095
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:59,070
the Classic Candy that you would never
buy if you actually had a choice,

1096
01:07:59,071 --> 01:08:02,610
but you just do at the movie theater.
They're awful.

1097
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,090
And there's so much pepper or
whatever, spam or whatever, that mint,

1098
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,850
I'm a fucking idiot.
It actually had the answer in the name.

1099
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:12,180
There's so much mint in it
that after like three of them,

1100
01:08:12,181 --> 01:08:15,030
your fucking throat starts to hurt.
It's like you're eating Vick's vapor rub

1101
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:20,570
covered in chocolate. Um,
anyways. All right. Uh,

1102
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:23,660
I'm probably going to pay for
that. Oh, Jesus fucking segment.

1103
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:26,780
But maybe that'll just be a onetime only
and I hope the fucking people who wrote

1104
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:29,840
that shit and don't be a [inaudible]
about it. What would Jesus do?

1105
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:35,020
He just looked down, shake his
Gregg Allman hair and be like, ohh,

1106
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,040
golly, Gee, what are we going to
deal with this guy? Um, all right.

1107
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:45,041
Last week I talked about men who
abandoned their families and um,

1108
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,030
I mentioned obviously that I don't agree
with that and I'm sure Jesus doesn't

1109
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:53,990
either. Forget about Buddha, although
Buddha was too fat to leave his family.

1110
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,120
What's he going to do? You know,
he'd have to hit the lottery.

1111
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,460
When you get that fat as a man, you need
some sort of, uh, it needs some power,

1112
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,300
you know, to pull the
hot broads, you know,

1113
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:10,370
a little bit of Viagra, you know,
they have liquid Viagara they,

1114
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:13,850
you guys see that commercial
yet it's fucking unreal.
They show it late at night,

1115
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:17,450
liquid Viagara you pour in your hand and
you literally start rubbing one out and

1116
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:18,270
your dick comes up.

1117
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:22,130
I was watching it and it was a
fucking unbelievable commercial.

1118
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:26,300
And if you believe that you
believe in Jesus is um, all right,

1119
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:32,150
I'm really being an asshole right
now and I don't mean to be all right.

1120
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:36,800
I respect all religions and I'm actually
jealous that you go to bed every night

1121
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:41,600
thinking that there's a real life Santa
Claus waiting to Koresh you and rub your

1122
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:45,410
forehead and your brow.
Um, all right. So anyways,

1123
01:09:45,411 --> 01:09:49,760
I talked about guys who abandoned their
families and I was saying how, uh,

1124
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:53,960
obviously I don't condone it,
but I am jealous of,

1125
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,760
I want to feel that level of euphoria
because in order for you as a man to do

1126
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:02,720
something like that,

1127
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:07,721
to leave somebody who you actually
agreed legally to dedicate your life to,

1128
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:12,830
and then you then had children with.
Right now I don't have any kids,

1129
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:17,180
but I see the look on people's faces when
they talk about their kids. You know,

1130
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,820
even if it's a pain in the ass and
that they really could go back,

1131
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,570
they wouldn't have kids. There's a
look they have on their face that,

1132
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:26,540
that unconditional love to
fucking walk away from that.

1133
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,313
All right.

1134
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:33,860
Like the level of misery that you
have to be in. I just, you know,

1135
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,420
and it must've been like,

1136
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,870
like how men della felt when he
finally got out of fucking all right.

1137
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:40,070
It was a little big,
but you know what I mean?

1138
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,260
So I was talking about it and I was
thinking like, you know, last week,

1139
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:47,300
like what music would you listen to?

1140
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:52,030
What is the soundtrack to fucking
leave in that? And you guys all like,

1141
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:57,170
wait in, somebody said highway
to hell and another person said,

1142
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,730
you listened to wish you were here.

1143
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,910
I don't know what I would listen to.
Um,

1144
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:11,930
I would just, it would be
just, I would just some,

1145
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:16,710
any song that just made me go, like
I would just, I dunno. It's unreal.

1146
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:20,220
But anyways, beyond
these fucking songs, uh,

1147
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,360
Saudi actually had a story about it and
this is a great contribution by the way,

1148
01:11:24,361 --> 01:11:27,360
to the podcast.
As was the stuff about religion,

1149
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:29,490
even though I was a jerk about it.
But you got an a stand.

1150
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:34,460
I got to keep this shift funny. That's my
out. Um, anyways, uh, Bill, during, uh,

1151
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,940
your last podcast you mentioned,
uh,

1152
01:11:36,941 --> 01:11:39,870
about fathers decided to suddenly
abandon their family. Well,

1153
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:44,100
about 11 years ago when I was
stationed in South Dakota,

1154
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:49,710
a guy that I work with did exactly that.
He left his wife, he left his kids,

1155
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:54,510
uh, in hopes to start a new life. All
right. The story goes something like this,

1156
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,230
settle in everybody. You're still wearing
your course, your Christmas sweaters.

1157
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,550
All right. It was back in
1997 a what a great year, Huh?

1158
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:07,620
Clinton was getting blown.
Nobody knew about it. Boy
Bands were popular. All right.

1159
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:11,850
How innocent. What a great fucking
time before it all got ugly. You know,

1160
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:14,940
people started liking it and nuts on fire,
trying to fucking take a plane down.

1161
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,400
Um, anyways, uh, Mike,

1162
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:23,090
this Guy Mike was assigned remote duty
for six months in Panama at this point in

1163
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:28,770
Mike's life. He had about 14
years in the air force, um,

1164
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,630
that is being tasked with rum,

1165
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:35,690
remote duty playing bullshit war exercises
and being restricted to a military

1166
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:40,410
lifestyle. So one day when I showed
up to work, my squadron's first shirt,

1167
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,440
I don't know what that means.
I guess the guy in charge, um,

1168
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,790
and a few officers hadn't had
maps laid out on the table.

1169
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,670
I asked what was going on and
one of the sergeants replied,

1170
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:55,970
we have a briefing at 15 minutes
information during that briefing,

1171
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:59,880
I believe it was the base offers
officer who mentioned that Mike has been

1172
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:04,881
missing since the day before the FBI
had some other military branch and some

1173
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:09,390
other military branch was involved to
find Mike by Searching South Dakota,

1174
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:12,870
by feet,
automobile and air with helicopters.

1175
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,420
So my coworkers and I,
uh,

1176
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:20,421
were tasked to drive about 50 miles to
some remote location in South Dakota to

1177
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:23,940
post missing posters
of Mike See Attachment.

1178
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:27,060
And he actually has the attachment
here. So anyways, he says, uh,

1179
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,270
we thought he was in danger.
Uh, we were concerned for him.

1180
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:35,250
He was a good guy helping people
out, um, when p when help was needed.

1181
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,060
So I'll be telling me there was no sign
that this guy was going to do this shit.

1182
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,260
And he said he plays bones, which
I guess is Domino's during, uh,

1183
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:46,140
during lunch with us while
listening to classic rock,

1184
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:49,110
he never came across as being disturbed.
But then again,

1185
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:54,060
I was much younger so I might've, I
might've missed some signs. All right.

1186
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:57,030
Back to the story. Uh, searching
for him a few days after the search,

1187
01:13:57,031 --> 01:14:02,031
someone reported they found supposedly
his lunchbox with his military id in it.

1188
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,690
It was several miles north of where we
were stationed close to a North Dakota,

1189
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:08,870
South Dakota border.
Um,

1190
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:13,060
then they found his car in a
parking lot of a Canadian airport.

1191
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,040
Shortly after finding his car,

1192
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:18,730
they detained him in
Panama where he was found.

1193
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:23,410
Mike left his family in exchange with
some Panamanian woman he met during his

1194
01:14:23,411 --> 01:14:27,640
duty there. Uh, we always wondered what
the hell he was thinking when he did this.

1195
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:32,020
Supposedly he left his lunchbox
near a road with his ID,

1196
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:35,890
this id in it as a decoy.
And when we drove to the car,

1197
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,790
when he drove to the Canadian airport
to fly to, uh, he then flew to Panama.

1198
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,060
And a,

1199
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:45,580
the big joke was that he was listening
to the song by Van Halen called Panama

1200
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:46,414
when he left.

1201
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:50,980
So they arrested him and discharged him.
Uh,

1202
01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:54,200
his wife forgave him.
So evidently I guess he went back

1203
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,170
through, you know what I love about that
story? That is the perfect fucking song.

1204
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,790
Oh my God.
Just driving away from your family.

1205
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,170
It would, it would, it would
reach down. He's the seed pack.

1206
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,070
Ah, fuck. You know what? I think you
know what? I think the, the, the,

1207
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:19,060
the feeling of euphoria is you guys ever
watched Ferris Bueller's Day off? Sure.

1208
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:23,230
We all have. Do you know when those two
guys, the parking attendants, you know,

1209
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:27,430
take the car out for the day and they
show that slow motion thing of when they

1210
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:31,660
go up and over the hill and they get
that look of absolute joy with the wind

1211
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:32,620
blowing through their hair.

1212
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,920
I think that's what it feels like to
abandon a family if you're that fucking

1213
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:40,690
miserable. So, uh, God bless
that woman for taking them back.

1214
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,720
That's either a deep kind of love
or just no options whatsoever.

1215
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,850
Um,
so there you go.

1216
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,730
And I think that's going to
be the podcast for this week.

1217
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:56,410
Let's do some classic stuff here. Some
overrated, underrated, real quick. Bill.

1218
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,970
Overrated.
Skinny girls.

1219
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,780
I've never understood the
appeal of super skinny girls.

1220
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,870
They look more like little boys
than women. Plus they're a,

1221
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:07,990
they usually snobby and expect
you to do all the work in bed.

1222
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,460
They like Coby Bryant. They are jaded
and sex is more like a job for them.

1223
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,260
Do what you hook up with coke.

1224
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:18,430
They don't understand the magic
of the game anymore. Okay,

1225
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:21,700
I see what you're saying. Do we talking
about Colby? Did you see Cobia? Yes.

1226
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:26,200
On Christmas it down by like 20 points
and he's still draws an offensive foul.

1227
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:26,890
That guy,

1228
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,860
I'm a Celtics fan and I admit that's
the fucking best player in the league.

1229
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:34,220
All right. But my big complaint
about Colby Bryan is um, uh,

1230
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:39,820
Jesus Christ my fucking
alarm. Um, anyways, my uh,

1231
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,280
my big complaint about Coby Brian,

1232
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,740
I just want Laker fans cause
you guys watch him every night.

1233
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:48,640
I'm not being a jerk, but when was
the last time you saw him take a shot?

1234
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:53,050
Missed the shot and not look
over at the ref for a file?

1235
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:56,860
It's almost like he's saying ref, it
didn't go in. They must have fouled me.

1236
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,940
That's how fucking good I am. It's
annoying. But I totally respect that guy.

1237
01:17:00,941 --> 01:17:05,080
I love his game and he's a that whole
teams riding on his fucking coattails.

1238
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:10,190
Um, alright. Underrated fat
chicks. Fat are the real deal.

1239
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,130
They do everything they
can to please you in bed.

1240
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:17,750
They're the only ones who can give you
a decent hump. They, I liked the Guy ta,

1241
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:22,460
uh, taking the half court shot for
10 grand, no matter what the outcome.

1242
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:26,870
They still have a smile on the face and
they're just happy to be there. Do that.

1243
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:30,150
I'm telling you, some of you fucking
listeners really ought to do stand up.

1244
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,590
Let's just, you know, do you know any
comedians could write something that good?

1245
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,990
All right. Probably a few of
them, but it's really impressive.

1246
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,720
I forgot to do the life advice.
Doctor Bill,

1247
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:43,580
I get a blow through this and speaking,
speaking of, uh, becoming a comedian,

1248
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:46,010
somebody wants some life advice
and this is a rough one. He says,

1249
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:49,580
I got some shit going on in my life and
it's really starting to make me reflect

1250
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:54,020
on where I'm going and what I want to
be. Okay. So I need some answers. First,

1251
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,000
my grandfather were raised
me from the age of two,

1252
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:58,970
almost died and recently had a
quadruple bypass on his heart.

1253
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,580
No idea how long he's going to make it,
but uh,

1254
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:06,280
it's definitely given me a new perspective
on life. All I think about now is, um,

1255
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,480
what were the things that he
didn't do and always wanted to, uh,

1256
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:15,470
fuck regarding things you did. I wonder
about the things he regrets not doing. Um,

1257
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:17,990
I'm 29 years old.

1258
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:22,100
I work as a senior manager for a
major company that builds airplanes.

1259
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:25,780
I make over a hundred grand a year
and I fucking hate it. I'm in a,

1260
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,610
this part of the world and
I'm not going to mention, uh,

1261
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:33,200
I do stand up comedy almost every other
weekend at one of the comedy clubs there.

1262
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,250
My question is this,

1263
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:39,430
can I ever make a trans transition from
work to stand up performing outside of

1264
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:43,940
La or New York or do you think I will
have to quit everything and move to one of

1265
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:48,440
those locations also? Do you think
it's worth it? I know I'm funny.

1266
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:52,580
I know I'm a good comedian. I
feel, I make like, uh, uh, wait.

1267
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:56,510
I feel like making a living as a comic
would be similar to winning the lottery.

1268
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,010
Even though I'm funny.

1269
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:02,300
It's still one in a million shot that I
would ever be able to make it a career.

1270
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:06,410
Thank you. Thanks for the, any advice
you have. All right dude. That's,

1271
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:10,640
those are tough questions because I've
never seen your act and those are really

1272
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:14,660
questions that only you can answer.
I'm not trying to cop out here.

1273
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,670
All right. But, uh, I do know this.
If you do a job and you're miserable,

1274
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:23,390
you know, I mean, we want the, if
you're making $1 million a year,

1275
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,410
I mean a hundred grand, something
that fucking sneeze. It, uh,

1276
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:32,750
I dunno dude. Um, all I can do is
tell you how I looked at it. Um,

1277
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:36,290
when I went into being a comedian,
I was not making a hundred grand a year.

1278
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:39,080
So it was very simple for me to
make that choice to go there.

1279
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:43,970
And I never really thought about not
making it other than a couple of times,

1280
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:47,540
if I was doing a college gig in the middle
of fucking nowhere and I was sitting

1281
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:50,870
in a super raid and I bombed that night,
then I'd be going like,

1282
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:54,620
what the fuck am I doing?
This is crazy, you know? Um,

1283
01:19:55,610 --> 01:20:00,140
but being able to make a living as a
comedian is not a one in a million chance.

1284
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,750
And, uh, believe it or not,

1285
01:20:02,751 --> 01:20:05,930
making it as a comedian is not a
one in a million chance because a,

1286
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,090
I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

1287
01:20:07,091 --> 01:20:09,100
there's not a million
standup comedians out there.

1288
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:13,210
Your rods are better than that.
It might be 750,000.

1289
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,620
Now, dude, you gotta, you gotta look,
do you go down to the club and in like,

1290
01:20:17,621 --> 01:20:21,820
you just, you go in there and you just
feel like this is home. You know, like,

1291
01:20:21,821 --> 01:20:25,450
this is where I'm supposed to be. If
that's what you feel, then I would do it.

1292
01:20:25,451 --> 01:20:29,530
And you don't have to live
in New York or La to, uh,

1293
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:32,440
to get a career going.
Um,

1294
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:37,300
AH, Jesus, I'm trying to give you an
example. I mean, there's, there's every,

1295
01:20:37,301 --> 01:20:40,920
every stand up, um, town has the,

1296
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:45,490
the local guys who never left, who
make a living at it, you know, um,

1297
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,930
it's just one of those things where
you want to expand your horizons after

1298
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:52,760
awhile where, uh, you know,

1299
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:55,500
you want to start making better
money or whatever, but, um,

1300
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:01,170
I dunno dude, like if it's your dream
in life, that's what you want to do,

1301
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,610
then I would definitely do it.

1302
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:05,070
Especially because if you're at
work and you're fucking miserable,

1303
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,420
then I would do it. And making a living
at it is not as difficult as it seems.

1304
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:13,290
You know, you get a college agent, he
started booking college gigs. Granted,

1305
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:17,790
you got to fly all over the
fucking country. Um, but you know,

1306
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:21,000
if you want to go fucking see Sherlock
Holmes in the middle of a Tuesday,

1307
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:21,863
you know,

1308
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,350
address like a shithead and not take a
shower until seven o'clock that night,

1309
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:27,680
that's one of the great things
about being a comedian. But dude,

1310
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:31,890
that's a huge decision. You gotta
make that on your own. But, uh,

1311
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,120
I would make the happy choice.

1312
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:36,090
Don't choose money because you're gonna
end up like one of those Stepford wives.

1313
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,450
You know what I mean? We've got
all this shit. Any of your fucking,

1314
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:42,950
you got all this stuff but
you're miserable. So, um,

1315
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,130
I dunno man,
that's too big.

1316
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,920
That's too big a question for me to ask
you to answer for you without knowing

1317
01:21:49,921 --> 01:21:54,360
you. So I hope I helped you
out. I probably didn't help
you out at all, but uh,

1318
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,110
it, it, it, believe me do it. It's not
as hard as you think it is. All right.

1319
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,560
It's not fucking easy, but it, it's,

1320
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:03,420
it's really not as hard as you think
it is a to make a living as a comedian.

1321
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,920
All right, let's get
to a question bill. Hi.

1322
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:09,730
My question is when you are a cup
in a couple situation, situation,

1323
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:10,740
spelt with a c,

1324
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,910
what is the protocol for who or how
you decorate your Christmas tree?

1325
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,890
Do you do it together or
separately or in stages? You know,

1326
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:23,420
one puts it in the stand, one
puts the lights, et Cetera, or uh,

1327
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:26,300
do you put a not put one up or not?
Um,

1328
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,790
all right. Uh, Christmas tree question
questions are real light this week.

1329
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,210
Um,
now my thing is if I buy it,

1330
01:22:35,211 --> 01:22:39,490
you decorated and if you decorate
it, no. If you buy it, uh,

1331
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:43,700
you better decorate it because I'm
not doing it. In other words, I don't,

1332
01:22:43,701 --> 01:22:46,220
I don't decorate Christmas trees.
That's how I do it around here.

1333
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:50,840
I go out and I buy it. I stick it
in the stand. And uh, then my girl,

1334
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:53,960
she goes nuts. She decorates it and
she goes, it does not look nice.

1335
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,870
What do you think about, you didn't
say anything. No, I think it's nice.

1336
01:22:57,871 --> 01:23:01,530
I know that I thought, I thought you were
just going to come in and be like, wow,

1337
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:04,440
look at it.
It looks beautiful.

1338
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,650
Christmas tree fell Christmas. See, I
thought you are going to do that. Really?

1339
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,390
What would you do if I did that?

1340
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:18,020
Speak of the devil,
NATO.

1341
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:25,220
Hey, I'm doing my podcast.
I'm doing it right now.

1342
01:23:25,221 --> 01:23:26,054
You're on it.

1343
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:36,480
All right. All right. All right. Okay.
Okay. Let me call you back in two minutes.

1344
01:23:36,481 --> 01:23:40,380
I'm almost done. Bye Bye. He's Christ.

1345
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,840
I'm such a space shot. I like half.
Forgot that I was doing a podcast is, hey,

1346
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:49,100
just calling to let you to know that I'm
not home yet and I'm gonna be home soon

1347
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:55,470
and I just want him to start talking
to you already. Um, you know,

1348
01:23:55,471 --> 01:23:57,450
a lot of people, a couple of people
have been emailing me saying,

1349
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,320
I'm mean to my girlfriend. I'm not, I'm
not meeting my girlfriend. I give a shit.

1350
01:24:01,321 --> 01:24:05,550
It's my way of, um, protecting
what I have in this relationship.

1351
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:10,260
All right? I keep it light. I
fucking break balls. Oh, by the way,

1352
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:14,070
I'm doing this on a Sunday because I'm
going to the Celtics fucking clippers

1353
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,220
tonight.
And uh,

1354
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,310
I'm actually walked away from the
TV and last I saw was like 15,

1355
01:24:20,311 --> 01:24:23,670
14 cults over the jets.
Um,

1356
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,070
I don't know if I should say,
I'm not going to say this.

1357
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,800
You don't want you guys remind me next
week to tell you my prediction of rex.

1358
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,241
I actually,

1359
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:36,241
my prediction earlier this year of Rex
Ryan was that he was gonna break his tail

1360
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:41,461
bone and a failed attempt to
hang himself at some point.

1361
01:24:41,711 --> 01:24:46,480
I've never seen, I have not seen
such a desperate need to be liked.

1362
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:52,900
I'm telling you,
that guy is emotionally on the edge.

1363
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:58,180
All right? That fucking bizarre
Christmas wishlist thing that he did.

1364
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,990
Like, you know, I'm hosting SNL,

1365
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:06,991
but I'm actually fucking a coach and east
to that guy is out of his fucking mind

1366
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:11,530
and he's broken down crying
a couple times, and I've
made predictions this year,

1367
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,590
Dad, I'm telling you, I can't tell
you who's going to win a fucking game,

1368
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:19,080
but shit like that. I'm
telling you, I watched that.

1369
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:20,930
Packy I'll fight and I fucking.
