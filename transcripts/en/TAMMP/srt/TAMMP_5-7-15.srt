1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
Hey, what's going on?
It's build bar and a jet.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,713
Yeah.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,380
On a Thursday afternoon.
What's going on? How White?

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,000
I am a, as you're listening to this,
I'm probably already on an airplane.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,220
[inaudible] fade you
think is my aero plane.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,140
Ooh.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,730
Is that the fucking album that uh,
the chili peppers, they don't like.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,430
I liked that album.
I'm a little pee.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,420
I love this guys and the tree,
I like it right until he goes,

10
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,840
you're homophobic reggae leg kick.

11
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,940
And then he just sounds like he
should be beaten with his base.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,110
And I liked fleet,
but that's one of the lines.

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,860
I was with them right up until then. And
then I was just kinda like, you know,

14
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,020
fleet maybe just maybe,

15
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:00,590
do you ever think maybe you're bringing
it on yourself just a little bit.

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,920
MMM. Anyways, so this is the
Thursday afternoon podcasts.

17
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:11,020
It's just a quickie, just a little
half hour, just to half hour on payday.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,930
At least old school pay day,
pay day. When I was a kid,

19
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,040
I think before me,
you know,

20
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,040
all those people used to sell
their own pants together.

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,210
They used to get paid in like
lambs and sheep and shit whenever,

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,840
and then after them,
then people got those little Buller caps,

23
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,610
those fucking clockwork orange things.

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,880
And then they got paid on Fridays and
then some point and moved to Thursday.

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,740
And that's when all freckles
came down the pike. Oh.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,160
I've looked on loads of trucks.
Right. Next thing you know,

27
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:38,420
I'm getting paid on a Thursday.

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,770
So I assumed that that's
the way it was going to be.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,040
Um, but unfortunately they moved it back
to Friday. I don't fucking know why.

30
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,510
I have no idea.
God knows.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,350
God knows it wasn't for the working man
right there where we just fuck it over

32
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:57,820
to work in men, every guide, da Da. I
don't know nothing about real wobbly. MMM.

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,690
So anyways,

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,200
I just fuck around on this
one and basically the last
half of the podcast that

35
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:05,800
play a little bit of greatest hits,
you know what I mean?

36
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,490
Get you over the fucking Humpday
there, uh, before it gets,

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,490
um, speaking a staton. I'm on
my way to Boston here, you know,

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,520
for my, my, my, um, homecoming,

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,620
going to wear one of those little fucking
crowns and the sash and playing the

40
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:30,040
fucking Wilbur. I'm doing it
from a, what the hell am I doing?

41
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,420
Me Check out my, uh, my pit bulls
calendar here in the corner.

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,550
Like I'm fucking nine years old.
Oh,

43
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:40,290
look at those cuties jumping through the
little fucking thing together. Right.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,780
Enjoying themselves,
not trying to kill each other.

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,860
No sign of Michael Vick or anybody with
the fucking neck tattoo that they'll

46
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:51,830
live in the life.
I am there from this Saturday,

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,820
May 8th until Tuesday.
Hang on.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,600
Who's they the fuck gay 19th.
Tuesday the 19th.

49
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm doing like a week and a half
run two shows every night, but

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,090
during the Wilbur run, so,
uh, it's gonna be great.

51
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,830
I've got a bunch of family
and friends coming out.

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,590
It's going to be like a mini high
school reunion on some nights.

53
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,950
Some of my old drinking buddies
and people I went to school with.

54
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:20,530
It's going to be a, uh, it's going
to be a phenomenal time. But, uh,

55
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,520
if you can't make it up to Boston,
you can't jump in your car.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,360
Can't get on a plane,
but you live in the New York City area.

57
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,390
I have a show that you should go to.
Right?

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,500
Why would you want to come see me when
you want to see somebody on their way up,

59
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:35,830
right?

60
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,060
You don't want to see some fat pasty
freckled jerk off who's was just a little

61
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,290
bit too impressed with himself.

62
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,680
Why would you want to watch that for an
hour when you can actually go to a show

63
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:48,790
and be like, Hey, I saw them when
that's always the best, right?

64

down there before they get famous.

68
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,940
That's what you want to do.
So you can seem cool.

69
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,740
Like you knew what the fuck was up.
All right.

70
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:13,000
Why don't you go to the Gotham comedy

Saturday night tickets are going fast,

79
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:51,490

trying to help the boys sell it out. Uh,

80
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,090
push the last few over.
It's a great fucking club and a,

81
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,820

salt of the earth. Fucking people.

The shit that he said to people,
he doesn't take any shit.

87
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,410
If you come in there and
you're a fucking prima Donna,

88
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,540

He's not even a fucking asshole about it.
All right?

90
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,910
He just in the most
eloquent dapper way ever,

91
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,911
if it's a dapper with this a possible way

Let's get into what the fuck we want it.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,520
I want to talk about this week. All
right. As I keep an eye on game.

103
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,600
Three of the Canadians,

104
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:14,601
Tampa Bay taping this on a Wednesday
first period has ended Canadian zero

105
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,110
lightning one huge game.
Huge game.

106
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,450
Does Tampa Bank put their
foot right on the throat? Oh,

107
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:28,451
those silly software and Montreal
Canadians or Canadian crawl back into this

108
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:33,861
series reaching back into time when
they used to be successful to draw some

109
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,790
inspiration. But to fuck the Iq.
I don't have a dog in the fight.

110
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,200
I'm actually enjoying.
Um,

111
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,380
I'm actually a join all the
hockey that had been watching.

112
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,840
I can't even like watch a Canadians and
hate him right now cause we're not even

113
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:49,800
in the fucking when I'm in in it. So,
um, I'm actually watching the game.

114
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:53,670
I'll see PK do something. I go and I'll
just inadvertently be like nice play.

115
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,110
Like what am I doing? Um, so anyways,

116
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,660
fuck the world of sports for a second.

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,410
Let's get into the world of nothing that
actually includes the world of sports

118
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:09,150
today. So have a deadly, there
was still investigating, um,

119
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,460
the under inflated balls.
Where would that game,

120
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:17,150
the Patriots won like fucking nine
years ago. Way Back in January.

121
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,520
Do you remember that?
Let me refresh your memory.

122
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:25,290
They one 45 to seven
okay.

123
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,060
And at the end of the game,
Jimmer say said, okay,

124
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,380
that's what he said. A grown man
shed that at the end of the game,

125
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,820
he had the nerve to say that we cheated
a man who sits on the rules committee of

126
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:52,131
the NFL and on numerous occasion has
changed rules that were advantageous for

127
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:56,830
rezone fucking team because he couldn't
beat those patriots, right? New England,

128
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,050
he did that fucking 10 years ago.
They changed it.

129
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,250
They were covering our receivers to horde.

130
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,540
Him and Peyton manning
made a fucking tape.

131
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,730
They whined about that after the game.

132
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
They whined about it
during the super bowl.

133
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,180
They whined about it at the fucking pro
bowl, paid madding brought that shit up.

134
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,510
And then at the draft they was still
crying about it. And next thing you know,

135
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:24,100
this is new fucking rule saying that
all you can do as escort people down the

136
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:27,130
fucking Goddamn turf.
And next thing you know,

137
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,310
all of Dan Marino's records are falling
left and right. And Lo and behold,

138
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,680
the cults finally beat compatriots
and when a God damn Superbowl,

139
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,650
that's what old freckles here said.
Wait a minute,

140
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,290
why the fuck did they change that to
have what kind of fucking pull does this

141
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,530
guy have? One fucking owner
complaints. They make a tape,

142
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,270
they wind for a couple of months and all
of a sudden the entire game of covering

143
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:48,830
a receiver gets changed.

144
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,090
Who sits on this rural committee
and one name stuck out like that?

145
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:58,091
Fucking Oliver Stone's movie who's sitting
there dressed in drag with a powdered

146
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:02,680
fucking wig talking to Joe Pesci with
lipstick on his fucking lips. Ah,

147
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,861
old gym.

148
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:07,790
Or say this fucking jerk off is sitting
here whining about the New England

149
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,120
patriots. First of all, the ball. Okay.
If they were under inflated, right?

150
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,770
Like they're suggesting,

151
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,930
I don't even know what they're saying
because they keep going like Tom Brady.

152
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,430
He could know he could possibly,
there's no proof,

153
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,100
but we think he might have done it.

154
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Do you know how fast you would get laughed
out of court if that was your opening

155
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:36,920
argument? Yeah, you're on air on
the night in question. We are,

156
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,783
uh,

157
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,240
we are proliferating that the defendant
in the proximity over there that wasn't

158
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:49,271
table could possibly have been involved
in something that he didn't do but maybe

159
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,680
know about.

160
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,660
And we would like to press forward with
this trial and waste more fucking time

161
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:58,400
and money.
Now granted,

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,880
having absolutely no fucking proof
what's so fucking ever whatsoever fucking

163
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:09,011
ever has never stopped sports talk
radio or ESPN from marching ahead.

164
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,730
They'll be like, there's no proof. We
can't say it. But having said that, yeah,

165
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,800
if they'll sell stro one
is this, say, what does,

166
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,480
what does this say? Sorry thing turned
out. What does it say about his legacy?

167
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,110
What does this say above the game
about competition? What does it say?

168
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,320
What does this got to do?
What does the sake of the children

169
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,470
is how you do sports talk radio.

170
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,970
And all they're doing is staring at the
phone lines to try to get it lit up.

171
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,850
And the more it doesn't
light up, the bigger they go.
What does it say, uh, about,

172
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,840
uh, how we conduct our
foreign affairs with Isis?

173
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm a, I'll be enough fuel if
you can, if you can have a ball.

174
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:55,130
That was his bills fully a floater.

175
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:56,810
Okay.

176
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,810
What's to say that Isis isn't right off
little shore and a sub that they bought?

177
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,610
Yeah.

178
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,780
Awful. The Russians were second
calls right now. One 800.

179
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:13,430
Who gives a fuck here on Fox sports?
West first caller,

180
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,610
Michael from Indianapolis.

181
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,500
Every dirty joke about Derek.
Oh wait my pigs.

182
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,270
I already knew about it. You'll do,
you'll do like he knew about it and that.

183
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,110
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa.

184
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,880
Do you have any sort of
football background beyond
watching your pig fucking a

185
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:36,570
chicken. Is there any sort
of sports professional or,

186
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,210
or possibly just down at the y? No,
I played terribly wake up on time.

187
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,130
I like playing corn hole and uh,
you know,

188
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,910
play horse shoes every once in a while
we got Tom, you know, but you know,

189
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:49,240
the banks were really trying to foreclose
on my property here, so I don't know,

190
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:49,451
man.

191
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm just Kinda mad my team whilst in or
if there's any fucking excuse I can make

192
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:56,490
six later I made shit. I'll call
it shit man. I'll throw some buck.

193
00:11:56,491 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm manure on that fire. I'll do it.
Bucket. We're taking them all calls here.

194
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,080
That's all they're going to fucking do.
This absolutely fucking,

195
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,100
there's nothing going on
here. It's over. You know,

196
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,890
I think know I want to tip my cap here
that I'm not wearing to fucking Seattle

197
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:15,330
for just saying, Hey, great game.
You know we throw it to him.

198
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,100
Malcolm Butler fucking jumped around and
yeah, and you beat us. You know what?

199
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:18,790
But you know what?

200
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,430
We're going to come back next year and
we're going to try to kick your fucking

201
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,070
ass. So I hope you guys, you'll
help you work out this weekend,

202
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,850
this fucking off season.
You know that's what a team of men does.

203
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,940
Okay.
That's what they do.

204
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:34,720
But when you fucking owner is up there
with the God damn wearing adult diapers

205
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,520
and has a rattle, that's what they
did. Underinflated fucking ball.

206
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,960
This is a funny thing too,
cause they said, well,

207
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:45,640
we noticed it by the half and then we had
the fully inflated balls and we scored

208
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:49,060
even more points and kicked
their ass even worse. I don't,

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,190
I got to tell you something,
man. I don't know what,

210
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,250
I don't know what the Patriots have done.

211
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,920
I don't know what the fuck
they did to these people. Okay.

212
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,820
And it's really only two people. It's
fucking gym or say, and it's fucking,

213
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:05,140
what's his face there? Uh, Tony, uh, uh,

214
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,910
main genie, man. Jeannie, who by the way,
you notice is completely out of football.

215
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,640
Completely out of fucking football.

216
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,060
Did you see when he tried to
commentate about it on ESPN,

217
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,880
he sounded dumber than I did in
this guy actually coached a team.

218
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,390
Who the fuck would hire him as a head
coach? That j e t s just jet jet's. Um,

219
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,500
anyways, you know, give me a fucking
break. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

220
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,290
We want again. And by
we, I mean the Patriots.

221
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,960
I don't have a dog in this fucking fight,
but um,

222
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,960
have added all you guys on Twitter
and all you people in sports bars.

223
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:45,040
If you want to say what you say, I
don't give a fuck. He's got the rings.

224
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,550
If you want to whine about some
underinflated fucking balls,

225
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,850
if you want a bitch,
I mean,

226
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,580
you know what's the dumbest thing ever
is that don't film the teams on the

227
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:59,410
sidelines, but there's nothing to
say. You can't do it up in the booth.

228
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,500
There's no rule against that.
I hope you guys realize that there isn't,

229
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,780
as far as I know, as far as what
I've overheard in sports bar series,

230
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:07,660
and I remember when that shit
was going on, I would did it.

231
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,690
I went to a football game in Georgia
and I met somebody that used to play for

232
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,530
one of the teams.
I'm not saying Georgia,

233
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,870
the other team not trying to get anybody
in trouble and he laughed. He goes,

234
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:20,110
do we used do that shit all the fucking
time? I love what people just think like,

235
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,260
oh,
you got to do is just filmed somebody.

236
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,810
You're going to win four Superbowls
just under inflate the fucking ball.

237
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,020
Do do you realize if that
was a guaranteed victory,

238
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,270
let's just say under inflating the ball
in an AFC championship game or just in a

239
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,350
professional football game in general
would cause you to beat a better team?

240
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,440
45 to seven what the fuck do you
think they would be doing every game?

241
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,930
You know when the fucking coach,

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,430
when he runs during halftime as he was
sitting there talking to the reporter,

243
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,030
you know, you know they always have the
fucking, the little lady out there, coach,

244
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:02,230
you know your dad by 17
points you haven't scarred.

245
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,280
You've punted every play that you didn't.
You didn't turn the ball over.

246
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,070
What would you like to do? And
the second I have, well you know,

247
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:12,850
we'd probably like to stop doing that
Shit and put some points on the board.

248
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:14,800
They're fucking cutie pie.
All right.

249
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:18,210
And in the meanwhile you'd
hear in the background. Yeah,

250
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,670
they would just be letting you know. I
know we're going to do on the second half.

251
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:21,140
We're going to go with,

252
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,050
we're going to let a half a fucking
cunt hair out of the ball and all of a

253
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,850
sudden our fuck,
we're going to beat these guys.

254
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,510
We're going to score 45 points to this
seven. Give me a fucking break. All right.

255
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,910
Okay.

256
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,860
Jesus Christ.
You know,

257
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:38,400
we can't really prove
that, that, that he did it.

258
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,293
Um,

259
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,150
this Eric Walden coat cults,
linebacker,

260
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,860
I told TMZ that it's gross that
Tom Brady would resort to cheating.

261
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,770
He hasn't been there. There's nothing
that proves that he did anything.

262
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,350
Okay.

263
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,060
Well,
his report stated it was more probable.

264
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:57,850
Okay.

265
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,440
They're not that the Patriots quarterback
was at least generally aware of the

266
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:06,550
inappropriate activities do.
This is the most vague horse shit ever.

267
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,150
It's unfortunate that they did this,
but there's still the chance.

268
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:16,290
What a fucking good Lord.
You got to give them credit.

269
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,850
They did it and they got away with
it and they won the Superbowl.

270
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,100
It's this fucking Walden guy.
Serious. You lost 45 to fucking seven.

271
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,040
Wow. I, I can, I can I actually, uh,
how about you guys? Can you guys,

272
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,710
you guys who aren't colts
fans or a patriots haters.

273
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:34,980
Can you guys maybe a update the patriot,
the colts logo

274
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,231
two,
I don't know.

275
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,350
Maybe put like one of those little baby
bonnets on it and a fucking rattle.

276
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,880
Okay.

277
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,190
Yeah, that's what it is. Everybody. Wow.

278
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,910
They've been under under a deflating
balls for the last 15 years and he finally

279
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:51,750
got caught because Tom Brady is actually,
he really is a six round pick.

280
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,160
Any absolutely stinks.
And all those throws that you saw make,

281
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:59,440
you know what most of the people in the
stand could make them if you just under

282
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:03,480
inflated it just a little bit. It's
incredible. It's absolutely incredible.

283
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,800
And then,
uh,

284
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,030
Andrew luck who had the disadvantage of
playing with the ball that weighed the

285
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:13,560
same as every other ball he's ever thrown
in his fucking professional career.

286
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,160
You know, because it was the right
weight that caused him to throw,

287
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,830
pick sixes and incomplete
passes and all of that.

288
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,230
It's because of the weight of the ball.

289
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,140
See a lot of people don't know that it
really has nothing to do with athletic

290
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:25,560
ability.

291
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,560
What it really has to do is what the
ball ways and all you need to do is just

292
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:36,171
take a little bit of air out of it and
all of a sudden you'll beat the cult so

293
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:42,020
bad that you actually beat Seattle.
Isn't that incredible? That's what,

294
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,740
that's the level of cheating that's
going on here right now. In fact,

295
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:51,560
what I'm going to do during
my run of dates here is a,

296
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,530
I'm going a little blood,

297
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,000
a little bit of air out of the theater
so people get a little lightheaded and

298
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,790
I'll see him. They'll get a little high
and I'll see me even funnier. Meanwhile,

299
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,040
I'll secretly have,
you know,

300
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,640
pure oxygen going up my fucking nose.

301
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,240
So what I'm going to do this weekend,
you know, and then maybe someday, uh,

302
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,050
Nick's comedy stop across the street.
We'll investigate it. All right,

303
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,140
let's get off this dumps subject. By the
way, I am playing the Wilbur theater.

304
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,630
And what's great about that is,
uh,

305
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,060
doing this whole run of dates is my
comedy career started right across the

306
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:25,530
street on warrants and street.
Nick's comedy stop March 2nd, 1992.

307
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,240
Sorry about the phone there. 1992. And uh,

308
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,000
to be right across streets.
Pretty cool. I swear to God,

309
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:36,210
if there was a show at Nick's comedy stop,

310
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,930
you know that I can run over
and do a quick five minutes,

311
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:42,450
I'm going to try to do
it. Um, but anyways,

312
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:46,860
I want to thank everybody that's come
out and uh, that's actually, you know,

313
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,790
bottle these tickets and everything.
It's really insane. And I'm, Oh,

314
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,680
I'm coming with a poster. Oh, you know,
I am and I'm bringing my fucking a game.

315
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,860
It'd be nice to be around some patriots
fans who actually fucking, there's,

316
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,290
I can't say the only patriots fans,

317
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,780
cause there's so many sports fans that
I know just sitting there going, dude,

318
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,150
this is fucking ridiculous.
But I know people hate the Patriots,

319
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:09,390
so they'll try to say that's why they won.

320
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah.

321
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,920
So all you guys out in the West who
can't beat Seattle these last two years,

322
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,770
what you want to do is
right before you play him,

323
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,920
deflate the ball a little bit in the
first half when 45 to seven against an

324
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,960
incredible opponent and then
somehow you'll beat Seattle.

325
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:28,860
That's all you have to do. And
then you to, you will have a ring.

326
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,650
And I want to commend the
colts for, uh, you know,

327
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,170
for never cheating on any level,
no gamesmanship whatsoever.

328
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:41,040
They've always been on the up and
up over there and, uh, you know,

329
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,670
I'm surprised they don't have those little
girl scouts sashes going across them.

330
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:49,380
I mean, they just sell on the up and
up and wholesome Indianapolis, Indiana,

331
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:51,720
Indiana in general. What it, what a
great state, you know what I mean?

332
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,040
Still keeping the clan alive despite
the fact that they are up north. I mean,

333
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,730
that's, that's, that's a special
kind of hatred. Um, all right.

334
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,500
Anyways,
you know,

335
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,980
one of the cool things about
traveling and meeting other people is,

336
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,610
uh, is, uh, just, I dunno, I,

337
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,610
I grabbed like newspapers and shit like
that. I got to find this fucking thing.

338
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,530
I was sitting there reading like,
you know,

339
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,750
I'm one of these fucking liberal
comes out here. I'm not really,

340
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,690
I thought it was liberal til I moved out
here, but I'm, I'm sort of a, uh, no,

341
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,573
j law had,

342
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,770
I'm not going to say when he calls
himself because I don't want get them in

343
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,450
trouble,
but like liberal is in there.

344
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:31,170
But it's actually a funny way
he defines himself. But, um,

345
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,340
I don't, I'm one of those guys where
I said, you know, I call people cons,

346
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:39,090
but you know, I'm also interested in
having chickens in my backyard, you know,

347
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,820
growing my own food, right?
I don't fucking know.

348
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:48,890
I Like v eight engines, but
I also drive a, I'm a fucking
Weirdo, man. I'm all over.

349
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm all over the fucking
map. Um, so anyways,

350
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:56,070
so I saw this thing says mother hen
raising backyard chickens teaches life

351
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:56,904
lessons.

352
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,770
And this was at the Hamburg journal and
I can't remember if I got this. And,

353
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,200
Oh, I got in Kentucky,
Lexington, Kentucky, uh,

354
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,670
where I had the great time
or the seersucker suit had
a awesome fucking show and

355
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:12,210
they really treated us right out there.
So I'm reading this thing and this woman,

356
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,720
this lady, she did what I did.
She watched one of these, uh,

357
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:20,370
you are what you weed or
fucking food inc and you know,

358
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:24,630
basically bought into it the way I did
where I saw, I was like, Holy Shit,

359
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:27,600
I got to make sure I go
down to a farmers Ma.

360
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,523
Yeah.

361
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,670
And um, get myself, you know,

362
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,530
some shit that doesn't have a little
bit of cancer spray on it, which I get,

363
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,500
I mean, I kind of get with it do when
you got to feed 7 billion people, I mean,

364
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,990
you've got to take out some bug spray.
It's just how it works.

365
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,970
But I'm trying to lessen the bug spray.

366
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,990
So I did that maybe for about three
days and it was, it was really hard.

367
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,580
It was really hard. And I
quit. You know, you know,

368
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,970
like a lot of these women who consider
themselves feminists like, oh my God,

369
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:58,650
I'm a feminist. No, no. You
know what you really did?

370
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,960
Life was hard and you quit and now
you're looking for a scapegoat.

371
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,390
I'm not saying all of them,
but I'm talking about the bottom feeders.

372
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,160
You know the ones I'm talking about,
right?

373
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,850
The ones that want the world to buy him
a drink and then give them the credit.

374
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,890
Those ones, you know, the
ones who don't think that,

375
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,040
they just think being a guy is easy and
you don't have to work for anything.

376
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,130
You just walk in and gum drops fall from
the fucking ceiling. Oh, you got a dick.

377
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,690
What dream would you like to have
come true today? Right. Anyways,

378
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,310
so this woman actually was like,
she went the whole fucking,

379
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:30,990
which she actually planted a garden.
Granted she had a fucking yard. Um,

380
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:34,530
she planted a garden but still raised
all, you know, raised all this,

381
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:37,290
grew all his fucking food.
The kids loved it and all that.

382
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,680
So then at one point she's
just like, all right, fuck it.

383
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:44,610
I'm going to get chickens and uh,
you know,

384
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:47,490
the chickens lay the eggs and they started
selling to the neighbors and all that

385
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,001
type of shit.

386
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,880
And here's something I did not realize
because I actually was thinking like,

387
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:52,380
you know, facts. He had
the space or something.

388
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,730
I'd love to have some fucking chickens
running around a goddamn goat. You know,

389
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,180
you fucking bend over to
pick up the morning paper.

390
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:03,420
He comes in and you across the yard and
exhale your flock and wrestling with it.

391
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:06,330
Huh? Sweeping. It's four
legs and having a great time.

392
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,540
Little farm action in the city.
Um,

393
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,290
this is something I didn't know is that
chickens after a while can't lay any

394
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:20,820
more eggs. Right? Like they went through
menopause or something. Sorry ladies.

395
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,920
I'm just, you know,
whatever. I'm, I'm, you know,

396
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:27,810
I never took any of those fucking
biology classes help me out here. So, um,

397
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,730
anyways, their kids love the chickens
and everything. So what happens is,

398
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:32,790
is once the chicken
can't lay eggs anymore,

399
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,390
that's when you gotta make a decision.

400
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,580
What am I going to do with
this fucking thing? Right.

401
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:43,581
Does it come and TV sit next to me and
asked me for the fucking collect or do I

402
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:48,750
take this thing up? Um, so let me just
read a little, as she said, she goes,

403
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,730
this is the middle of this story. She
said, uh, my daughter does her part too.

404
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,150
It's her job to pick through the leftovers
and food scraps and tossed them out

405
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:59,640
to the chickens.
Soon after I signed her that jobs,

406
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:03,210
the chicken learned to come
running whenever they saw
because they knew she had

407
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,330
something for them. Uh, but
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

408
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,470
She wants to treat them as pets though
I Warner that chickens are for making

409
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:15,471
food first eggs and then one day meet
because hen stop laying at some point and

410
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,450
I'm not running a chicken retirement home.

411
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,560
This is so refreshing to read because
I would never read this in La.

412
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,060
This person would get
tarred and feathered. This
woman's like you that pets,

413
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:29,730
they're fucking food. Make me some
goddamn eggs. And when they'd done,

414
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,390
I'm lobbing your fucking head
off and where it happens,

415
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,180
where I'm a chicken dinner.
So anyways, she goes,

416
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:40,050
I've only had to kill one
chicken from me before too.

417
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:44,920
I killed because they were suffering
from in injuries. And it was kinder. Uh,

418
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,850
that chicken was death beak.
That's what she named him.

419
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,650
So named by my husband because she was
jet black with BD red eyes and look like

420
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:57,200
trouble from the get go, uh,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Let me get to this stuff. Um,

421
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,890
so anyways, she could've paid. So
anyway, so the moment of truth comes,

422
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,600
it's fucking, thing's not laying any
more eggs and she's got to take it out.

423
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,240
Right. She's got to stick an ice
pick in the back of his head.

424
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:09,960
I thought I'd never shut
up. Um, so she goes,

425
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:14,790
I could have hired a guy to do it
for me for five bucks. All right.

426
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,710
But that roll around your
fucking head for a second.

427
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:21,360
There's somebody in Lexington,
Kentucky who's five bucks a head,

428
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,930
just goes array, makes five bucks
to kill a chicken every day.

429
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,900
You know what I mean?
That's like when that's in Kentucky,

430
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,070
that's like an Uber driver.

431
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,090
Your work. I work
whenever I want. You know,

432
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:38,420
I just fucking turn on the APP and they
tell me to come out and go kill a couple

433
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,900
of chicken. Five, 10, 15, 23rd,

434
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,870
I'm at one day I made a horror and $27.

435
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,310
I've got a $2 tip and I ain't telling you
for what, but I'll tell you right now,

436
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:53,870
I still rub one out to it.
Um, so anyways, she goes,

437
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:56,570
I could have hired a guy to do it
for me for five bucks. She goes,

438
00:25:56,571 --> 00:26:00,110
but I'm not squeamish.
So I decided to do it myself.

439
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,450
The kind of thing that made this
country great, right? You Get up,

440
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,880
you put your pants on one leg at a time,

441
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,190
you go out and you murdered
somebody else that's in the way.

442
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,540
You don't hire somebody else
to do your dirty work. Right.
Uh, my grandfather left.

443
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,380
My grandmother laughed yourself sick when
I confessed that I had learned how to

444
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:19,250
do the deed,

445
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,930
basically killed the chicken from an
ultra ultra crunchy youtube video called

446
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,760
respectful chicken harvest. And
yes, we will have a link. Um,

447
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,910
but it did, uh, it did at
least show me the ropes.

448
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,300
When I announced to that death
peak was about to meet her doom.

449
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,480
The kids were appalled
for about a hot minute.

450
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,530
Then they remembered how mean she
was and weren't so sad after that.

451
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,950
This isn't fucking regular publication.

452
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,810
They insisted on sticking around to watch
when I wasn't trying to avoid getting

453
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:53,350
clawed in the face by a
chicken's death throes.

454
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,830
I watched the kids faces to basically,

455
00:26:56,831 --> 00:27:00,040
when she's holding this
fucker down lopping it's God
damn head off or choking it

456
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:04,630
out, whatever she's doing, passing
its guard. As far as I can tell,

457
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,560
she's occasionally glancing over at a
kid. So this is like some fucking, uh,

458
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,790
what's that show about?

459
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:13,000
The castle and the little cunty kid
runs it and he puts people to death.

460
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,770
Okay.

461
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,200
Ah, fuck. What's it
called? Lord of the flies.

462
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,050
Lies gimme back my crown.

463
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,310
Yeah.

464
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,340
Duty. You're watching. Are you watching
Lord of the Rinat Lord of the rings.

465
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:27,040
What does it call come on and
everybody fucking loves that show.

466
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,560
Uganda and Queen,
I can't remember what it's called.

467
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,420
I want to watch it medieval times. You
don't what it is. It's on fucking cable.

468
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,570
They're there. They're in
their last scene, right?
There's a dragon or some shit,

469
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,400
I think. Anyways. Uh, she thought,

470
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,720
okay,

471
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,970
can't, he's got the, the
little fellow there, Fox,

472
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:50,910
all the women crushing it.
Full head of hair.

473
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:53,940
He's got that fucking Eddie Rabbitt beard.

474
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,310
I love a rainy night. Who Do? Ooh.

475
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,770
Why do I keep thinking Lord of the Rings?
I can't get it out of my head. Fuck.

476
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,480
All right. Anyways, she said, I asked
her if she wanted to stop eating meat.

477
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,650
Oh, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Sorry. I missed this thing.

478
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,730
I looked at the kids' faces.

479
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,120
I could see how deeply it affected
my daughter in particular. Yes.

480
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:22,290
You fucking murderer in this chicken. Uh,
she had never seen an animal die before.

481
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,100
She never saw you kill one either.
I could see the awareness of mortality,

482
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,320
mortality,
shadowing across her face.

483
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,490
She cried at bedtime and said she
hated that death beak had to die.

484
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,020
All right. The death die. Got to
give it a more sympathetic name.

485
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,440
I asked her if she wanted to stop
eating meat because all meat comes from

486
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,720
animals who must die for us to eat.

487
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,690
She thought carefully and said
she's still wanting to eat meat,

488
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,370
so we lay there late into the night and
talked about the food chain and informed

489
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:51,204
choices.

490
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,890
My son was far more practical about it
when I interviewed him for this story,

491
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,710
he shrugged and said,
Eh, at first I was sad,

492
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,890
but then I was okay because that
was some good chicken and dumplings.

493
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,030
So you're right there. Isn't that
great. That's why you travel around.

494
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,540
I swear to God, man, if
anybody out here in Hollywood,

495
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,020
yeah,

496
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,170
fucking ever did that with a chicken,
held the fucking thing down.

497
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,700
It's it's fucking leg

498
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,740
fucking freaking out and you
got your kids watching it.

499
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:23,770
You probably get arrested,
at least down here in Los Angeles.

500
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:28,690
You get a little bit north to Bakersfield
in between San Francisco and Los

501
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:28,990
Angeles,

502
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,610
Reagan country where they're growing the
food and they're actually dealing with

503
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:37,630
the fucking drought as opposed to
the conch down here, myself included.

504
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,020
Okay.

505
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,510
Trying to take a shower. Can, can we
get Fiji water polo into our in shower?

506
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,910
Um, anyways, I just thought that that was
interesting. Like just to read it. And um,

507
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,320
do you think you could do it?
Huh? Did you get killed a chicken?

508
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,180
I could fucking kill a chicken.
I just take out a meat cleaver.

509
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,343
I would,

510
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,160
you got to get like those
fucking psycho gloves.

511
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,250
Like I'm picking up something
crazy that could scratch me.

512
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,090
You just got fucking boom Bam really
quick. I would think. You know what?

513
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,790
I'm going to watch that
fucking video anyways.

514
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,170
Whatever the fuck do you want from me?
You know, I was just checking in on me.

515
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,220
I had a great day today.
Everybody, I took the,

516
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,680
I'm getting ready to get my
pilot's license here and I,

517
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:28,270
today I had the written examination,
the one I've been studying for,

518
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:32,320
for like the last month,
600 questions of which they snagged 60.

519
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,250
And, uh, you know, you got to
get a 70 or better, you know,

520
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,080
sounds a little bit easier than it is,

521
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:42,570
but there's all kinds of math and charts
and all this fucking density altitude,

522
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,050
that fucking wind correction angle and
all of this shit. And you know me. Okay?

523
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,960
You guys have heard me read out loud,
read out loud, read out loud right there,

524
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,980
right there. You know how hard I was
struggling with this shit. So I studied,

525
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,180
you know, for the last couple of
weeks. And uh, even on the bus tour,

526
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,770
I'd go in the back of the
bus and I would just go,

527
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,930
I gotta I gotta put my two hours in and
I took it today and obviously I passed

528
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:07,120
or I wouldn't have fucking brought it up.
So I'm psyched.

529
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:10,720
Although the couple things, I got
an 85, I wanted to get the 90.

530
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:15,490
I got an 85 and I fucked up a couple of
those. I'm not good at that. Uh, you know,

531
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:18,610
taking out the little fucking slide
rule and graph and shit. I, I, you know,

532
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:21,010
I just blew it off. It was on my
computer screen. I'm like, yeah,

533
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,870
I wouldn't have lasted me
like one or two of those.

534
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:24,190
And it was like fucking three of them.

535
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,950
Yeah.

536
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,050
Um, anyway, so I passed that.

537
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:32,160
So the next thing I got to do
is I gotta I gotta talk to uh,

538
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,110
one of the representatives from the FAA
and he grills me for an hour and if I

539
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:42,111
pass that then I go out and fly
and that happens on the same day.

540
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:45,090
And if I do that Bing
Bang, boom, I got it.

541
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,550
So that's what the fuck
I'm up to after my show.

542
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,770
So that's what I'll be doing
during the day when I'm in Boston.

543
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,780
You can eat the food.
No,

544
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,510
I'll be studying my fucking ass
off and saying the shit out loud.

545
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,670
So it sounds like I know what I'm
talking about. You know what I mean? Um,

546
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,340
as opposed to being
like, ah, yeah. Um, wait,

547
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,520
that's a translational lift
when the coming out of a horror,

548
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,190
I don't sound like a fucking
moron. I just want to be like you.

549
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,290
What kills me is when I'm taking this
thing is they have so many students from

550
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,124
China.

551
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,610
They opened up something over there where
I guess they wouldn't let people fly.

552
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:22,760
Now anybody, not anybody, but you
know, way more people can do it.

553
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,460
And they had an overflow of people
in their schools couldn't handle it.

554
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:30,461
So these kids flight all the way over
to Los Angeles and in a second language,

555
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,340
not only learn how to fly a helicopter,

556
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,570
but sit down across from some hard nosed
person from the FAA that's going to put

557
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:43,560
you in the air if you don't pass the test.
They do this in a second language.

558
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,080
And every time I see him, like I just
feel like such a pussy. I'm just like,

559
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,680
could I go to chuck? Can
I go to Beijing? Right.

560
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,290
You know what I mean? Not Hong Kong where
they actually speak English, you know,

561
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:57,290
a lot. Um, can I go into mainland China?

562
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,430
Okay.

563
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,940
And fucking learn how to fly a
helicopter. He fucking unreal. You know,

564
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,250
the instructors are amazing.
I was like,

565
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,730
some of them can't even speak
English that well. I'm like, so

566
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,000
okay,

567
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,510
if they can't understand you, like how do
you communicate? And this one guy goes,

568
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,890
they understand tone.

569
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,090
It fucking killed me because I know
God damn well if I was in China and the

570
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:25,700
fucking dude's talking to
me, I can understand them
and all of a sudden he goes,

571
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,790
I know. It'd be like, Hey,
you got controls buddy.

572
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,170
Well, the terrifying thing is it's
like, I know I'm doing something wrong,

573
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,004
but what?

574
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,303
Fuck,

575
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,200
you'd have to immediately learn. No, stop.

576
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,470
Oh my God.
What the fuck does the first four express?

577
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,980
If I was learning how to
fly a helicopter in China,

578
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:56,670
those are the first four things that
I would learn how they say that.

579
00:33:56,671 --> 00:34:00,750
And if anybody who's speaks Chinese
could tell me, spell it out phonetically,

580
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,500
I would love to learn it. I would
love to fucking learn it. Just,

581
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,570
I don't know for what it'll,
it'll come up at some point.

582
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,310
At some point you're going to need
to say that. Right? Um, you know,

583
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:15,030
next time you're in China or fucking
Chinese food, it's taken a while.

584
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,470
Okay.

585
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,150
He'd be like, oh my God, what the fuck?

586
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,380
After you just ordered an English,
you could hit them with that and Chinese,

587
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,700
they can't tell me not getting a
laugh there. Anyways. All right. Um,

588
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,930
before I get Outta here, uh, Bombas socks,

589
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:33,931
everybody chances or if you have
some fucking feed you like to wear,

590
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:41,710
nice saw half socks and face it,
it says,

591
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:42,880
chances are if you have feet,
sorry,

592
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,770
I want a little Johnny
Mathis there and face it.

593
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,820
Socks haven't changed since they
were invented. They fall down,

594
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,440
they wear out and they always,

595
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,710
and there's always that toe scene
that's never in the right place.

596
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,480
Our new fucking spots of Bombus
has changed. All of that.

597
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:03,460
Bob has dedicated two years to
engineering socks engineer's socks said,

598
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:06,130
stay up and last forever and
feel amazing on your feet.

599
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,020
I have a pair of bombers and you
know what? They feel great. You know,

600
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,670
I like to do,
I like to wiggle my toes in them.

601
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:13,990
Okay.

602
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,823
Going off

603
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,590
of that and a Goodfellas, ah, CIBC.

604
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,660
I do that when I put on my bombs
in the shower, if my feet all wet,

605
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,630
the prima cotton they use is so soft.

606
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,420
It's amazing to know
what I'm talking about.

607
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,130
You really need to try a pair
for yourself. Come on, man.

608
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,100
You put on a pair of socks, you feel like
a winner. You got a spring in your step.

609
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:38,850
You'll have a smile on your when
you get fired. I don't care.

610
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,990
I'm going to click my heels as I walk out
of here grabbing Mog deck. But listen,

611
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:47,810
Bob has doesn't stop with your comfort
with every pair of socks. Bomba sells.

612
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,120
A pair is donated to someone
in need because socks is,

613
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:54,030
it turns out and the number one
requested item at homeless shelters.

614
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:57,240
So I helped us it some over to India
after that earthquake. Speaking of which,

615
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,090
I'm doing a benefit tonight. Hang
on one second. Right now for all,

616
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,140
and for a limited time,

617
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Bombas is offering my listeners 20% off
their first order and free shipping.

618
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:10,710

622
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,660
you know,
they could pick up somebody homeless here.

623
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,850
I think a lot of times we're always
thinking about people in other countries,

624
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,690
but you know what,
I had such a great time and a Mumbai,

625
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,560
India and uh,
you know,

626
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,620
it was awful to see what
happened over there as always.

627
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,980
So a Judd Apatow put together a benefit
tonight at Largo and a actually by the

628
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,990
time you hear this is going to
be over, but, uh, it's sold out.

629
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,320
We made a bunch of money.
You know, we made some money.

630
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,340
I can't say a bunch of money,

631
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,860
the amount of money that's going
to take to fix that, but uh,

632
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:56,130
I had a great time and they really treated
me right over there and met a bunch

633
00:36:56,131 --> 00:37:00,990
of great comics. So, uh, it's good to
be able to do something. All right.

634
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,350
That is it. That's the podcast for this
week, not the podcast for this week.

635
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:08,640
I'm just checking in on you. All right
guys. Have a nice fucking weekend.

636
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:12,840
You can't, Eh, uh, here's a little
throwback from back in the day.

637
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:13,530
Back when I was like,

638
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,820
cool, younger, smarter,

639
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,540
had a little more flows on top of mind.

640
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:06,870
I don't know.

641
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,030
You know what?
This podcast fucking sucks.

642
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,440
I'm going to call it out before you guys.

643
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:13,290
This is a podcast is just
sucked this week. All right.

644
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm all over the fucking place.
I'm fucking exhausted.

645
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,720
It's a Goddamn holiday weekend.
You can you guys, everybody,

646
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,140
how hard are you working
this week? You know, has it,

647
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:24,120
somebody's gone come in
and brought a pie in.

648
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,910
Somebody is wearing an awful brown and
orange Thanksgiving sweater. You know,

649
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:33,930
maybe it's your manager to show
that he has a human side, you know,

650
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,740
he's not the worst when you hate your
boss. And then around the holidays,

651
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:40,760
all of a sudden he just lets up a little
bit and tries to act nice, you know?

652
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,000
Or it's a female.
She gets a little bit nicer and you know,

653
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,910
and the whole time she's sitting there
wishing you a happy thanksgiving.

654
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:48,830
You just want to fucking
kicker right in the box.

655
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,440
You know,
but you can't you fucking chance.

656
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,153
Okay,

657
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,110
well that was sad.
What the fuck is it?

658
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:03,740
It's one to one 1515 minutes left
in the third period. You don't,

659
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,060
one of the hardest things to do I think
is to be an announcer for hockey now

660
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:11,000
that they took, I've taken out the red
line, the fucking game you breaking next,

661
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,970
sitting there watching the fucking game.
That's why I like it.

662
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:16,630
Watching it on TVs cause I don't have
to keep turning my head. The camera,

663
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,320
it's a camera

664
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,120
moves for me. It does all the work.
What I'm literally out of Shit to say,

665
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,370
you know,
I feel like

666
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:27,270
right now this how bad this podcast is
when you bomb is a comedian is that works.

667
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:31,410
When, when, when shit is going great,
when everything is saying is killing,

668
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,920
when you're on stage,
basically what happens is,

669
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,630
is you've done about 20
minutes of material and you
look down at your watch and

670
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:42,030
you watch says you've been
up there for 55 minutes.

671
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,720
That's when you know that you're
fucking killing. And conversely,

672
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,340
when you're bombing,

673
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:52,370
you will do an hour's worth of material
and 17 minutes and all you have left is

674
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:53,970
your closing bit.

675
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:57,030
And you look down at your watch and you
realize that you've been on stage for

676
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:01,680
just under 20 minutes and you're like,
wow, now what the fuck am I doing?

677
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:06,180
You know your mouth gets dry. That's
when you start going into the crowd.

678
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,720
Hey Z. You know, so what's there
to do around here and a Raleigh,

679
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,160
North Carolina. Huh? Look
at this guy over here. Huh?

680
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,080
What do you do sir?

681
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,460
Okay.

682
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,760
Oh, you're a plumber. Really? Oh, so a,

683
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:26,590
I bet your butt crack is always
show a fucking kill me. You know,

684
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,060
and you just, you just fucked. Hey,

685
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:33,040
how about a round of applause for the wait
staff? You know, keep it going for him.

686
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,560
You know, and I just want to
thank all you guys for showing up.

687
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:38,800
I know it's a recession and I appreciate,
uh,

688
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,510
you know how bad I am for the
tropes. You know, you know,

689
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:45,220
whether you support going to war or not,
you know,

690
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:48,940
these kids are out there that laying
down their lives and they're away from

691
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:50,920
their families in thanksgivings this week.

692
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:55,921
I think we should all sit back and give
thanks and be appreciative of that.

693
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:59,020
I've already done an hours worth of
fucking jokes and you conserve and left in

694
00:40:59,021 --> 00:40:59,854
anything.

695
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,660
So now I'm technically in overtime
even though contractually I already,

696
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:07,240
I owe you like another 40
minutes of fucking comedy,

697
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,523
you know,

698
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,470
and let's not forget all the people who
have died in boating accidents this year.

699
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,581
You know,

700
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,370
a lot of people don't know that boating
accidents is one of the leading,

701
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,880
leading causes of death when
human beings are out in the ocean.

702
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:23,923
Okay.

703
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,660
Start remembering jokes from the early
party or act and you start telling him,

704
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,733
you know,

705
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,040
yeah,
they did a study

706
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,240
the other day. They said, you know,

707
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:39,080
90% of shark attacks actually
happened in shallow water.

708
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,240
No Shit. That's where the people are.
It's called the fucking beach. Oh,

709
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,620
one of their people swimming to Europe.
Let's go to France. You pussies. Ah,

710
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,600
you like that joke.

711
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,860
That's a joke for my act in 2001
I'm do fucking old jokes in my act.

712
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,750
What else did I used to fucking do?
Okay,

713
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,370
I already did one of my original jokes.
You guys see these uh, rap group.

714
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:07,930
Criss Cross. What would up Chris? Warm
it up, Chris. Hey, go to bed. Chris.

715
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:10,940
What do you like nine years old.
Oh.

716
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,840
Oh my God.
I had horrible jokes.

717
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,970
He's do jokes about working in a dental
office. A people. I got news for you.

718
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,250
Six years. Neglect is not cured by
a tic tac in the waiting room. Hey.

719
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,540
Ah, you guys ready for
your next deck? Too Bad.

720
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:33,730
I still got another 30 minutes to do.

721
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:36,330
Yeah,

722
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,750
ladies back me up.
Guys are crazy rise.

723
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,910
I mean, you know, where are we?

724
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:49,911
We don't give a shit that's going to
be searching for shit to say what,

725
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,020
but I'm here. It's great to be here
in Raleigh. You know what I mean?

726
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,660
Okay.

727
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,900
It's scary. You know, you come out
here to Raleigh, you know they got a,

728
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,510
he got a mall. All right folks, I'm
not gonna lie to you. I'm out of jokes.

729
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,140
I wish you could just do that and
just fucking become honest. I'm a,

730
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:10,370
I'm not a fucking material.
I don't know what the fuck you guys want.

731
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,210
I've actually been talking about this
shit on stage. I don't give a fuck luck

732
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,070
because it's such a topical bit.

733
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,210
I don't even know if people are gonna
think it's funny in a month. But, uh,

734
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,240
can we please talk about fucking
Bill O'reilly going on the view?

735
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,050
Um, I gotta I gotta tell
you something right now.

736
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,680
I don't like that guy's politics.
I don't like his face.

737
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,290
He has, he has that
racist face. You know his,

738
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,800
when he gets mad, his
fucking, his face gets pointy.

739
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,600
He just looks evil.

740
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,220
He's just not a pleasant
human being whatsoever.

741
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,020
But I gotta tell you,

742
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,970
he fucking destroyed on the view,

743
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,010
you know,
and I,

744
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,120
somewhere in there was a victory for men
because he took on for fucking women.

745
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:20,270
They were all yelling

746
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,920
and he got two of them to walk
off their own fucking show.

747
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,650
How do you do that?
I as a comedian,

748
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:33,900
I was embarrassed to, to stand
up. Comic comics just quit,

749
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,180
which is why I'm nominating Joy Bay Har
and Whoopi Goldberg is Douche bags of

750
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:42,900
the week. What, what did you think was
going to, do you think he was going to go?

751
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,270
No, wait, don't leave.

752
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,260
That's exactly what the
fuck he wanted you to do.

753
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:54,030
I was actually hoping at that point that
the other two women were going to leave

754
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,810
and then he could just start hosting
the O'Reilly factor on the view.

755
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:58,644
That would have been,

756
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,520
he just totally 100%
dominated at the very least,

757
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:07,350
that segment, because I don't,
I don't watch that fucking show,

758
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,520
but just, he just came on. First of all,

759
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,300
he sits down and he's got
on that shiny fucking, uh,

760
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,550
Joe Pesci shoot Joe Pesci Peshy suit.

761
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,880
It's difficult to say Joe Peshy suit and
he's got his fucking leg spread like a

762
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,320
with his ball bag, hang his shiny ball
bag. He locally, if you ever see like, uh,

763
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,820
when Kennedy debated Nixon, how,
if you listen to it on the radio,

764
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:35,700
how everybody said Nixon won.
But if you watched it on TV,

765
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:38,370
Nixon was all tanned up.
He had his legs crossed,

766
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:43,730
he looked like a winter and Nixon sat
there with his fucking legs splayed and

767
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:46,920
cross like underneath the chair.
He looked like a fucking moron.

768
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,940
That's what bill O'Reilly looked like.
And he, he just, he still dominated.

769
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,920
I love when he turned to joy and was
just whatever I, I'm paraphrasing here,

770
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,920
but he was just like,
be quiet and learned

771
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,180
that she had nothing,
a fucking standup comic.

772
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,620
She had nothing.

773
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,050
The whole segment was fucking
hilarious. And when he goes, uh,

774
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,590
another gem of a moment was when he goes,
you know,

775
00:46:16,591 --> 00:46:17,910
a lot of people don't realize this,

776
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:22,911
but 70% of Americans don't
want a mosque at ground zero.

777
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,050
And joy goes. She goes,
well, I'd like to see that,

778
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,400
that poll or something like,

779
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:34,380
and as she sang that the crowd is
applauding what bill O'Reilly just said.

780
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,080
So you really don't need to see
the pole at that point. And,

781
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,140
and getting beyond that,

782
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:44,970
what he really should have said was 70%
of Americans don't realize that they're

783
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,820
not building a mosque
at ground zero still,

784
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,630
that they're actually making a rec room
with a ping pong table and an area to

785
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:58,170
pray kind of like they have an area to
pray it every fucking airport, you know,

786
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:58,711
three,

787
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:03,210
four blocks up the street at a God damn
coat factory is where it's actually

788
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:03,751
being built.

789
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:08,520
But the fact that he said that they're
still building a mosque and that he got

790
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:09,570
an applause break,

791
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,250
joy is so wrapped up into her own fucking
opinion that she doesn't even hear her

792
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:18,030
own studio audience backup the
guy that she's trying to shit on.

793
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:23,250
And the fact that this fucking guy is
still putting out inaccurate information,

794
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,930
that people are still back in Abbott.

795
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,830
It just was fucking awesome
on all of those levels.

796
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,920
And a, I liked how Barbara
Walters was old school. Cool.

797
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,360
And she didn't walk off.

798
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,650
She gave those two Douche bags of the
week shit for walking off their own show.

799
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,710
And then she got him with a nice
little classy Zinger. He said,

800
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:47,940
Bill O'reilly's on here this week. Uh,
when we come back we're going to talk, um,

801
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,080
or he's on the show today. We're
going to, when we come back,

802
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,310
he's going to talk about his new
book called pinheads and Patriots.

803
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,520
And then she looked at bill and
she goes, at this point I, uh,

804
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,900
I'm not sure what you are or something
like that. It was a great little zinger,

805
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,320
but she wasn't like judging
the guy. I Dunno. The,

806
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,220
the whole thing was funny and
just how bill O'Reilly is, is,

807
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,650
is viewed as this intolerant person.

808
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,320
And then he comes on the show of a,

809
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:20,321
I guess mostly liberals and then they
show absolutely no tolerance for him and

810
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:25,140
then throw a fucking temper tantrum and
walk off their own God damn show. I mean,

811
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:25,801
you can't tell me.

812
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:30,801
Everybody over at at Fox News wasn't
literally jerking off to that moment.

813
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,680
I, Bill O'reilly Bomas became a fucking
rock star in that moment. That was,

814
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:39,070
that was like a standup comic
moment that he did to two comedians,

815
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,570
which blew my mind.

816
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,250
Okay.

817
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,870
You know, and I know I'm always
trashing the brides on this show,

818
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,820
but that really was a chick way of
handling, losing an argument. Like,

819
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:53,920
I'm just going to get off up in store,
Ma.

820
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:59,030
He is so used to people paying for your
drinks and holding the Goddamn door for

821
00:48:59,051 --> 00:48:59,410
you.

822
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:04,210
You actually thought that as an adult
that you were just going to walk off the

823
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:07,900
shell and this was going to be this big
moment and he was going to be like, oh,

824
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:09,490
wait a minute,
let me stop.

825
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:12,643
Okay.

826
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,320
I loved it. He was like, go ahead and
leave. I don't give a fuck. I'll continue.

827
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,370
I'll take over your fucking show.
Um, so anyways, there you go.

828
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,580
Douche bags of the week.

829
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:29,581
Joe Bay Harbor and Whoopi Goldberg for
walking off your own fucking show when

830
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,180
his shiny suit fucking I,

831
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:38,050
I can't say he's a moron
because he, he does. No,

832
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,150
I mean, I look, he, he, he's very red up

833
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,550
on that. Yeah. I don't know. I am
too stupid. This is why I would,

834
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,331
this is right here.

835
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:52,920
Why I would never engage as much
as I disagree with his opinions.

836
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,170
I don't fucking pay attention
to politics at all. I don't,

837
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,120
I find it frustrating.
I find it to be it just a rig fucking gay.

838
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:07,350
I don't give a fuck, you know,
and I, so I would never try to,

839
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,750
as much as I disagree with Bill O'reilly,

840
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:13,440
I would never go on his show and try
to fucking one up the guy and think I'm

841
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:17,730
going to, uh, beat the guy in an
argument about politics. It's like he,

842
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:22,731
he's paying attention to these politicians
the way I give a fuck about football.

843
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,260
I'm not gonna, I'm not going
to win that argument. I mean,

844
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,280
why don't I bring fucking Roy Jones Jr
and start debating him in about boxing.

845
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:31,940
Okay.

846
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,530
I know. It's just, it was, uh,

847
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,850
it was fucking hilarious at
the whole thing was just,

848
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,770
it was hilarious and a big,

849
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:46,490
big fucking victory for that fucking,
I dunno.

850
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,050
I Dunno. As a stand up comic, you fucking,

851
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:57,450
you just tap out. That
was embarrassing. Anyway,

852
00:50:57,451 --> 00:51:00,280
so let's get on with the God
damn podcast for this week. Um,

853
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,100
I kind of liked that you
guys liked that format.

854
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,960
Just getting the Douche bag
of the week out of the way

855
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:06,940
right off the fucking bat.

856
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:18,250
[inaudible]

857
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:42,970
