1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,150
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,540
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,030
Fuck in my day.
Uh,

4
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:14,440
September 23rd, 2030. What's going on?

5
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:18,370
What's going on dog? What's up?
See The fucking patch. You know,

6
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:21,190
you didn't think they were that good.
You're fucking three and oh now,

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,040
now what do you think?
So mmm,

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,630
more on that later. I am a back
in the continental United States.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,580
I just did a two wonderful
shows up in Toronto, Ontario.

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,260
It's the first time I've been up to
Canada in a while. Had a great time.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,310
And uh, right before that I was in
Pittsburgh. Had a lovely time there.

12
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,140
Thanks to all the guys that uh,
DVE Randy Bauman,

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,530
uh, Bill Crawford, opening it
up, killing, killing, killing it,

14
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:59,920
the kick the Hines hall. And then
before that I was down there. But uh,

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,630
in West Virginia,

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,520
another beautiful state did
everybody shits all over.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,250
I'm telling you I'm going to retire
and one of those fucking states,

18
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:11,270
that is my game plan.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,550
The game plan is I'm going to somehow
get these fucking banker counts off of me

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,510
going to pay off this God
damn house and then, you know,

21
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:24,140
when I'm too fucking old hill,

22
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,090
my hair's all white or yellow,
whatever it happens to fucking red hair.

23
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:33,380
And on top I got those freckles
old age spots and my bald head,

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,930
I'm just gonna fuck.
Oh yeah.

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,760
And I'm going to sell this
place and I will move to like,

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,050
I dunno, West Virginia.
Uh, I'd moved to Iowa,

27
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:53,040
but like what the fuck? No, no,
that was good. That was great.

28
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,020
I really understand that topography now
of Iowa with that vivid description.

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,300
Thank you. I'm over
here in Wales, England.

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,810
Now I understand exactly what Iowa
looks like. I'm sorry. I maybe will the,

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,790
the Dakotas something along those lines.

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,643
Um,

33
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,810
I just going to move to the middle of
fucking nowhere and by then maybe I'll

34
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:22,881
have a pilot's license and I can go out
like John Denver and I had just picked

35
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:26,250
it. That would be a, a
B, a w a lovely life.

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,610
It would be a lovely life. Um,
no, I have actually, you know,

37
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:35,210
just been driving around seeing all the
different parts of the country here. Man.

38
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,020
I, I'm getting back into drive and
does stuff. In fact, by the way,

39
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,050
last week I got a brutal email from
somebody telling me what a piece of shit I

40
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:49,961
am and all this type of stuff cause I
had to cancel my Gig and El Paso and it's

41
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,560
like I didn't cancel the fucking thing.
It rained.

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,310
And that's not my fault that you guys
don't have a sewer system or whatever the

43
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:02,230
fuck it is out there in El Paso.

44
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:04,990
And I told you that I would
rescore I fucking flew out there.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,880
I was sitting there, I had my show
shirt, all iron. I was ready to go.

46
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,940
But as promised I said we will reschedule
the El Paso date as soon as possible.

47
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,330
And I am a man of my fucking word.
The El Paso date,

48
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,680
the new date is

49
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,250
October 2nd. All right. And
instead of dude, I call it Versie.

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,260
Uh, I'm actually bringing Rosebowl
legend tailgate legend, Mr. Joe Barton.

51
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,490
Nick, everybody. Okay.

52
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,660
A man who honed his skills in the
San Francisco San Francisco scene,

53
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,830
man. And uh, that's, that's a
Wednesday. That's a great run.

54
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,880
Wednesday is a,
is El Paso.

55
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,840
Thursday the third is a San Jose.

56
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,150
Friday the fourth to Seattle.
And then the 5th of October is a,

57
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:04,570
I'm back down in Phoenix.
And uh, so anyways,

58
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,600
so if you,
if you bought tickets already for El Paso,

59
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:12,100
those things are totally honored.
If you can't make October 2nd, your,

60
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:16,670
your money will be refunded
any more than that. I,

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,160
there's nothing else I can, I can't
control the fucking weather. So, um,

62
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,440
anyways, I've been getting a
have against slammed lately.

63
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,990
There was some people in Seattle did not
take kindly to my fucking by song that

64
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:36,550
I sang Lexi. I get called like a faggot
like 58 times on Twitter this week.

65
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,500
Um, yeah, people did not
appreciate that song,

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,970
although they did not refute it.

67
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,310
No one ever said they didn't go out of
their way to architecturally in awake,

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,870
architecturally designed. How
else would you do with bill? Huh?

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,180
I also need to do it.
I'm trying to think of another big word,

70
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:02,710
but I don't have what I know I was gonna
say geometrically what you probably

71
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,760
need geometry and geometry for that
shit. That's not a good one. Uh,

72
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,360
peanut butter and Jelly Ectera
t way and a fucking, anyways,

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,790
you know what I love about then a couple,

74
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,860
I guess a couple of people just wrote
some of the blurb that I wrote to piss off

75
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,690
all the Seahawk fans. Um, and uh,

76
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,110
they left out the whole part where I
set all the complimentary stuff and how

77
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:28,030
they got a great team and how when I
watched the Patriots play and then I see,

78
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:32,050
you know, Seattle of Frisco Colts
or whatever, watch those games.

79
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,650
How it just looks like football on a
whole other level and how Seattle has a

80
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,070
great chance at winning the Superbowl and
how I don't blame fucking Pete Carroll

81
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,370
for what the fuck he did at USC because
everybody does it yet all of that shit

82
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:43,900
gets left out.

83
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,340
Only thing that they had in
there was we was me going, we

84
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,030
someday people of Seattle fans of the
Seattle Seahawks as mad as you are,

85
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,300
that you have to use those homophobic
slurs in your advanced city man.

86
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
MMM.

87
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,260
You'll, you'll, you'll, you'll
understand it one of these days,

88
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,590
one of these days when you actually
have something shiny and Yep.

89
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,580
Cupboard until now, you're just
screaming. That's all you're doing.

90
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,510
And you know,

91
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,940
that's another reason why you guys are
so loud because of how empty your trophy

92
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,230
cases,
it causes an x

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,833
go.

94
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,880
You guys came into the League in 1977
along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

95
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,440
And even those sad conch figured out a
fucking way to win one by now. All right?

96
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,010
So even if you have finally when one
this year, I got two words for you.

97
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,580
It's about fucking time. All right? And
if you can't do the math on that, yeah,

98
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,010
I'm just fucking around. All
right. You Shit. Birds Relax.

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,310
I'll be up there on the fourth. Do
whatever the fuck you want. Boomi.

100
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:02,030
I don't give a shit. They give
me the check already. All right.

101
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,200
It's actually not true, but I'm
gonna act like it is. So anyways,

102
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,210
plowing ahead here. Um,
yeah, I was up in Toronto.

103
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:15,211
One of the great things about going up
to Canada aside from the fact that hockey

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,500
is the first story,
you know when it comes to sports,

105
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,860
that's the big thing that's going on.
I watched like hockey night in Canada.

106
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,800
I came home and I watched the replay,
the shown preseason hockey up there.

107
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,770
Like it's fucking march.
Okay.

108
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,720
And they're trying to figure out
who's going to make the playoffs.

109
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,450
Playoffs and a somebody actually uh,

110
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:38,790
I watched a little bit of
the Toronto Buffalo Games.
Some of the a replay. No, no,

111
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,000
I watched Edmonton. Vancouver.
That's what I was watching.

112
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:45,960
Somebody just sent me a link.
Did this great broth.

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,760
Um, I'll, I'll give you
guys a video of it and,

114
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,700
and all you guys who don't like hockey,

115
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:56,290
just spare me your stupid great
sport. What are they? Let him fight.

116
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,820
This is a sport. This, I gotta be honest
with you guys. That's music to my ears.

117
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:05,290
I liked the people don't understand
hockey that you can't see the puck for

118
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,930
whatever fucking reason. I
love it. I love it. Keep,

119
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,050
keep pilot on and watching football and
go down to your sports bar with your man

120
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:17,380
tits and you're fucking football
jersey. I'm all about it. By all means.

121
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,980
I'll sit over in the quiet part
of the bar watching a hockey game.

122
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Same without you and your fucking Cheetos
breath invading my shoulder area near

123
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:31,250
my notes. You know, you shoulders, knee.
And that was right. I was thinking,

124
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:34,310
looking over my shoulder out, whatever.
I don't need to explain my body parts.

125
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:39,020
Do you people? All right. Um, so anyways,

126
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,730
whatever. Two guys on the, one
guy on Toronto, one Guy Buffalo,

127
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,980
they get into a fight and the guy at
Buffalo, his helmet comes off and uh,

128
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,210
he fucking ended up whacking
his head on the ice.

129
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:54,800
And I guess buffalo took an exception
to that. So this fucking big goof,

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,070
Scott is big goof.
That could beat the living shit out of me,

131
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,510
but I'm safe here in the podcast.

132
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,880
So I'll call him a goof
knowing nothing about him.

133
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,520
I'm sure he's a wonderful
well spoken human being,

134
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,880
but he looked like a big goof cause
he's standing next to Phil Kessel.

135
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,690
Phil Kessel comes up to like, I dunno,
maybe his hockey pants is a little short.

136
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:16,160
Shorts is little sat in booty shorts,
cities wherein Edd,

137
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,320
I decided to take it out on him.
He takes a swing at little folk castle.

138
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,060
Little felt ever heard anybody
just trying to score a goal.

139
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,240
Some assess doesn't even go on the corner.

140
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,240
He's not hurting anybody and I don't. I
did. Phil Kessel lost his fucking Shit.

141
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,390
I have a whole new found
respect for that guy.

142
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,060
This big dude punched him.

143
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,690
So one of the other fucking maple
leaf guys immediately grabbed Scott.

144
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,330
If Phil castled takes a two hander,

145
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,420
not once but twice to the back of
Scott's like nine old lot of you guys go,

146
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:54,450
well what the fuck? He's
tied up with somebody else.
That's a cheap shot. Fuck you.

147
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,800
All right.
When you're two feet taller than a guy,

148
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,700
when you have to punch down at the
top of somebody's head at that point,

149
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,880
you might want to pick a different
dance partner. Right. But he didn't,

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,080
so he fucking whacks him twice and then
squares off with another guy in the

151
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,430
sabers and actually wins the fight.
Bloodies the guy up.

152
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,450
They stop and then kessels he's
going to skate off the ice.

153
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,230
That big dude Scott is still tied up
with somebody went over and he fucking

154
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:26,100
spirit of trying to take out the guy's
spleen. I was like, good for him.

155
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,270
There you go. That's, that's good. Phil.
You don't take no shit off. Nobody.

156
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,460
He went all spider on. Why don't you
go fuck yourself Tommy. It was great.

157
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,030
It was great to see. And um,
I think the leafs, hopefully,

158
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,600
I think they're going to be good
this year. I like the leafs.

159
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,450
I've always liked him. Um,
and speaking of that, oh yeah,

160
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,860
we're going to talk hockey
here in September. And somebody
sent me an, an article,

161
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,580
uh, that said, um, you
know, the, you know,

162
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,240
you always got to have some sort of
controversial title just to get people to

163
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:01,470
read it. It says Montreal Canadians, the
most overrated franchise in Nhl history.

164
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,470
And they basically touched on some
shit that I had brought it up,

165
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,110
brightened that I had brought up, um,
you know, through, of course not reading,

166
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,450
just overhearing shit that saying that,
you know,

167
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:17,451
the Canadians dominated as 16 league and
that they had first pick at all French

168
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,250
born Canadian players, Yada,
Yada, Yada. All of that.

169
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,350
This is a really cool article because
it actually explains that more

170
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,800
and it makes me understand,
but it makes me understand Montreal,

171
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,430
Toronto better. Um, so this is the
points the guy's making. I don't,

172
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:39,620
I don't agree with all of this stuff,
but it says the original six teams, uh,

173
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,720
carries an aura with them. Uh, the
Montreal Canadian Baba, you know,

174
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,110
the 60s all did battle each other.
Um,

175
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:50,580
so basically you had a 16.6,
7% chance of winning.

176
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,490
So of course everybody's gonna
argue. Well, so did the Bruins.

177
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,650
So did the Black Hawks or the Redwings.
So did everybody else. But here,

178
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,550
here's the thing that's
really interesting about this,

179
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,730
unless you're not into a hockey then I,

180
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:07,450
I don't know what to tell you is um,
ah Christ,

181
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:12,380
I don't even have it here with a fuck. Is
it basically this, this is how it work.

182
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,980
Work Do, you couldn't like
sign anybody back in the day.

183
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:20,330
So the Canadians did not have first chance
at all French born Canadian players.

184
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:22,820
What they had back there was
something I guess called the c form,

185
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,710
which if you went out, you scouted people
they had to sign if they signed it,

186
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:30,350
that was an Iou that they were
going to go and play for you.

187
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,740
So Montreal was smart enough
to go all over Canada.

188
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,940
I try and sign these people like right
before they turned 18 or right as they

189
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:38,774
turned 18.

190
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,780
But the big thing was was you had first
chance at all players within basically a

191
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:50,690
50 mile radius of your city. This is
really interesting. I never knew this.

192
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,000
You had first chance at that. So, um,

193
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,300
okay.

194
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Basically why that kind of tipped the
scales was Montreal and Toronto had first

195
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:08,490
chance at everybody and basically,
you know,

196
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:13,330
Quebec and Ontario where everybody's
hockey crazy and comes out of the womb

197
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,164
skating.

198
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,780
And then you look at like the Bruins and
we had first chance at trying to find a

199
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:22,710
rocket Rashard in like New
Hampshire or the, as they say here,

200
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:26,220
the rangers trying to find the next
best goalie in Newark, new or Hoboken,

201
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:27,054
New Jersey.

202
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,200
And it's really interesting because what
he fails to bring up in this article

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,240
was that Montreal didn't
dominate a 16 league,

204
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,340
um,
both Montreal and Toronto up until 1967.

205
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:43,560
The year of expansion.
At that point,

206
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,390
Montreal had 14 cups and uh,
and,

207
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:53,070
and the, the, uh, the maple
leafs had 13. So the two of them,

208
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,780
just by being up in Canada,

209
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:58,230
I'm being around all of that talent and
the fact that you only get to 16 fucking

210
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:02,600
league, they bill, they were
able to go on a run. But, um,

211
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,470
you know, and I wonder if that
helped Detroit too because Detroit,

212
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:11,471
they're 50 mile radius would actually get
them into a Ontario a little bit where

213
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,280
people gave a shit and love talky.

214
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,520
But it was a really interesting article
and I'm not sure here to shit on the

215
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,110
Canadians,
God knows I do that enough.

216
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,111
But that very clarified misinformation
that I was putting out there that that,

217
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,240
I mean I was, I was looking at it like
everything east of Montreal, they owned,

218
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,310
you had to go play for the
Canadians that I was like,

219
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:36,020
what the fuck that be like if he had a
whole all of new England or whatever to

220
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:39,380
draft for a particular sport or
something like that. So my apologies,

221
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,080
you won't hear this often to the
Montreal Canadiens franchise.

222
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,670
I was wrong about that.

223
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:47,330
And now I now understand
why Montreal and Toronto,

224
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:50,480
what kind of going tit for tat with
that 50 mile radius thing was really

225
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,220
interesting.
At the end of the day though,

226
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,140
that thing that Montreal was going
around trying to find all of this town,

227
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,460
they did do the work.

228
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,040
So you kinda got to give it up from
on a on that level. So there you go.

229
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,100
Look at that apologizing to the Canadians.

230
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:09,230
But I'll have a link to
that if you want to read it.

231
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,500
If you're a sports nerd like me.
Um,

232
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
it's a great article all the way through.

233
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:19,680
I wouldn't say that Montreal is overrated,
but I was disappointed that the uh,

234
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,790
that the writer of the article did not
bring up the Toronto Maple leafs in why

235
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,130
they were able to kind of go,
you know,

236
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,930
strive for strive there with the Canadians
up till 67 it was basically in the

237
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,410
70s I think. Right.
That's when the Canadians,

238
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:37,411
they one six and they also want what
they want and 68 and 69 I can't remember

239
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:43,390
now. Yeah, I think they want 68 69
then broadens one's 70 than Montreal.

240
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:47,860
[inaudible] 71 [inaudible] 72
then Montreal flyers, flyers,

241
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:50,230
and then Montreal for the rest of the
decade. That's how it went. All right.

242
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Jesus Christ is there one woman left
listening to this podcast and with that,

243
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:59,530
let's do some advertising.
Great timing bill. Great timing.

244
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:02,530
I get the fucking calendar out
of the way here. Um, either way,

245
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,670
hockey's coming back. I'm really
excited about it. Oh, you know,

246
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:09,690
when I was in Pittsburgh,
um,

247
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,310
what the fuck was I just going to tell
you? I was hanging out with uh, uh,

248
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,370
Randy from DV and a bill
Crawford and you know,

249
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:24,220
they know Paula Steigerwald to help him
saying his name right. Stagger walls.

250
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:28,000
I always fuck up the pronunciations of
anybody's last name if it has more than

251
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:32,770
two syllables, but it was just so
insane. They brought him along and uh,

252
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,580
we kind of, you know,
talked right after the,

253
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,590
after the show and I've watched so much
center rice just to hear his voice was

254
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:46,720
insane. It just kept saying
that till going like, dude,

255
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,910
like this.
It was be hilarious.

256
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:53,230
He would start talking to me
just talking about regular stuff.

257
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,920
Paul Wood and I,

258
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,200
everything I did could do to not start
looking around for the hockey game on TV.

259
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,380
Cause I felt like I was listening to
like, Oh shit, there's a hockey game on.

260
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,760
I've just, I've, I basically,

261
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:06,780
I've watched a ton of penguins games
is what I'm trying to say. So, uh,

262
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,640
that was a big thrill getting to
hang out with him. But, um, anyway,

263
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:13,330
so let's get to the, uh,
let's get to the Goddamn, uh,

264
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,430
where is it here? Let's get
to the advertising for this
week. All right, everybody.

265
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,850
Dollar Shave Club, dollar
shave club, everyone.

266
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,390
There is so many things in
this world that irritate me.

267
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,010
Having to go to Canada to
smoke a Cuban cigar, you know,

268
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,760
that really irritates me. Is that the
only thing that irritates me? This, oh,

269
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,510
this fucking letter somebody
wrote me that'll read later,

270
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:40,270
that also irritate whatever. You know,
there's a lot of things that irritate me.

271
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,280
Um, when so many things can irritate
you. Why add razors to this list?

272
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,280
It's time to stop milking
your razor blades.

273
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,550
Everybody I know with brand name razors,

274
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:54,420
you used to paying outrageous prices
and exhausting those razors until they

275
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:58,350
start to look like a rusty soda can.
And it's time to move on.

276
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:02,580
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing
quality blades to your door for just a few

277
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,220
bucks a month, month.
Never think about it again.

278
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,570
They send a pack every month so you
can change your blades every week.

279
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,300
I love these guys and your
face will love them too. Yeah.

280
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,970
I don't know why nobody ever came
up with this before. These guys,

281
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:19,530
I'm telling you in their commercials

awesome. It's entertaining. You need it.

317
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,340
So this past week, everybody, um,

318
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,130
I actually rented a motorcycle

319
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,540
and live to tell about it.
Um,

320
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,800
I rented during a
weekday, right? And I, uh,

321
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,400
I just went to a party where I knew
there was going to be no cars or anything

322
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,830
like that and it was all these twists
and turns in that type of thing.

323
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:58,780
And it was, you know, it's just like
was fun, man. It was a lot of fun,

324
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:01,420
scraped the pegs a couple of times,
scared the shit out of me.

325
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,770
I didn't realize that they give,
you know, so you won't fall down.

326
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,640
That was definitely sent
a jolt through my head.

327
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,550
But um, it was awesome, man.

328
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,510
I gotta tell you, I really,
uh, I really enjoyed it. I
don't know. It's like I said,

329
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,850
it's still nothing compared to buy
a motorcycle or anything like that.

330
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,950
I just wanted to remember what I
learned in the, in the, in the class.

331
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,700
So I ride with a buddy of mine who's
been riding forever and everything went

332
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,200
great the entire fucking time.

333
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,910
I said I did a great job for the amount
of time that I've been riding. You know,

334
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:39,240
I drove stick shifts my whole life. So
it's the same concept of hardest things.

335
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:44,010
You have to switch it, you know, with
rather than shifting with your hand,

336
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,520
you know,

337
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,310
you're doing it with the afoot and
rather moving the clutch with your foot,

338
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:49,050
you do it with your hand.
It's all that type of shit.

339
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:52,530
But that motorcycle safety class
that I took, I highly, highly,

340
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:56,160
highly recommend taking
one of those because um,

341
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,910
they really, they help you
with turns. And I mean, like,

342
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,510
I like the shit you have to do on a
motorcycle. When you go into a turn.

343
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:07,860
It's not like a car, you know, you don't
have to worry about a car tipping over

344
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,210
and you being launched out of it.
Like what you have to do when a car,

345
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,660
you'd have to be basically gone,
I would think over 35 miles an hour,

346
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,100
40 miles an hour,

347
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:22,630
and then just cut the wheel as hard as
you could to the point you were skidding

348
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:26,080
sideways, even just to go it on its
side. But even then you're strapped in,

349
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,830
you got metal all around you and airbags.
Um,

350
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,650
so anyways, we wrote, I, I made
him go down and pick up the bike.

351
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:38,080
I did it as safely as
I could possibly do it,

352
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,200
and I had the time of my fucking life.
So,

353
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,110
and I got the confidence that I actually
rode the bike back to my house, uh,

354
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,310
before I went to bring it back.
And I lived, I live on a, uh,

355
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,510
I live on a hill that's on a turn.

356
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,310
So I came down and I was just like, oh
wait, well how the fuck do I do this?

357
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,590
And I went down and I brought
it up and I'm thinking like,

358
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,790
what do I do with the kickstand?

359
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,610
And then I kinda had it at the
wrong angle and I swear to God,

360
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:06,460
I tip the bike over at zero miles an hour.

361
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,820
Fucking

362
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,820
ass all do what I was writing for three
hours around turns a whole fucking thing

363
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:19,050
all the way up to fourth gear down
shift and looking through the turns,

364
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:23,310
the whole fucking thing did everything
right and then it's zero miles an hour.

365
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,530
I just was at the wrong angle
where if I put the kickstand down,

366
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,730
it was still going to tip over.

367
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:33,840
And then I tried to overcompensate and
the thing just tipped to the point of no

368
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:38,070
return and you don't really feel the
weight of the bike until it gets to that

369
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:41,670
tipping point. I mean, I didn't slam it
then I just basically dropped it down.

370
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:45,360
It was so fucking embarrassing.

371
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,270
And I bent the, uh, I bent the, uh,

372
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,380
the front brake and I put some
scratches on the fucking thing.

373
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,230
So it ended up being an expensive day

374
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,810
fucking asshole. I was so
embarrassed. It was a Harley too,

375
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,030
so I brought it back down to the place
and they're all, you know, they like, Nah,

376
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,890
it happens, it happens or whatever.
But I just, you know, I could not,

377
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:14,060
if I should have just gone down there a
little skirt with what's left of my hair

378
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:18,470
in pigtails, they'd be like, Oh God, I
tried to do is put the kickstand down.

379
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,150
I was really,

380
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,160
it's been a while since I've been that
fucking embarrassed. Like I was, uh,

381
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,380
I felt shame, but other than
that, it was a great time.

382
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,490
I was Billy bad ass for about a,
I don't know,

383
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,530
for a couple of hours
and then, uh, I dunno,

384
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,670
whatever the biggest pussy word you
can come up with. The begins with B

385
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,790
Billy blueberries and a fucking dumb.
Anyways, white blueberries are bad.

386
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,570
And if you stick them in a pie, I had
the urge to make a pumpkin pie this week.

387
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,960
I want to practice before the holidays.
Um,

388
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,760
and I want to smoke a fucking Turkey
this year. I'm throwing fucking down.

389
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,970
You know, that's one of the things
when the holidays come around,

390
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:04,970
you've got to have something
that you make, you know,

391
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,310
you gotta have your
staple and if you don't,

392
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,940
you got to have some sort of hooch that
you get from somewhere in the middle of

393
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:13,430
fucking nowhere that you got
to have something special.

394
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,840
You just can't hit be another client
that puts on some ugly sweater and just

395
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,020
shows up and stands there,
eat and everybody else's shit,

396
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,020
drinking all their fucking booze.
You know,

397
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,230
you got to bring something with you.
I think you know what they should,

398
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:28,064
you should do.

399
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:33,250
You should have like basically you should
have a pre Thanksgiving party in the

400
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:34,910
beginning of October,

401
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,910
like a preseason game and then you invite
like 30 people over knowing only 22

402
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,330
are going to make the fucking
roster on thanksgiving.

403
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,550
But don't tell anybody. No, that's
not fair for people. Trial for a team.

404
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,890
They know they're trying out for
a team to do that. There you go.

405
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,190
Then you fucking where one those bill
Bellacheck cutoff hoodies and you see what

406
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:02,900
people show up with. Just
a suggestion. No big deal.

407
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,950
Um, all right, let's
continue with the sports. Um,

408
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,730
people have been firing off
letters to me lately and uh,

409
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,370
I never sent letters to people.
I never do.

410
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,540
I never like I'll read something
and somebody annoys me.

411
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,770
And I guess the reason why I don't do
it is because I have the outlet of the

412
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:26,540
podcast or doing standup. So I
never really feel the need. Like,

413
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,710
you know, I gotta I dunno, send this
person like a fucking letter or something,

414
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:34,220
but I actually sent a letter,
an email,

415
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,330
and I'm not going to name the name cause
I don't, I don't want you guys to like,

416
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,130
I know most of you won't,

417
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:44,880
but some of you will find out who it is
and then go you stupid cunt age and you

418
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:48,870
know, the stupid, you know,

419
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:50,520
write something racist that hour,
whatever.

420
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,320
I just don't want to be a part of that.

421
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:57,321
But basically this person was writing
an article about this female goaltender,

422
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,600
uh, Briana Scurrey. I hope I said
her last name right. And, um,

423
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,200
yeah, it was really just
awful story. You know,

424
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,230
like she was top of her game playing
for the u s ladies soccer team,

425
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:16,310
the late nineties. And uh, she went
down to get to, to stop a routine,

426
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,120
a routine save one of those ones.

427
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:21,210
I think it's from the way it was described
as like kind of rolling fast along

428
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,800
the ground.
She dove down to get it,

429
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,400
scooped it up and had it and uh,

430
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,670
someone on the other team
went to basically try to
kick it out of her hand real

431
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,020
quick and then try to put it in the goal.

432
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,780
But as they will run an over to do that,

433
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,230
the other player's knee struck this woman
Brianna right on the side of her head.

434
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,090
And uh,
you know,

435
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,810
so she kind of gave herself a standing
eight count basically and stood up and

436
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:50,550
continued on like all athletes do.
She pushed through the pain. So,

437
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:54,270
unfortunately after a few minutes,
the back of our own player's jerseys,

438
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,910
when she was looking at the numbers
and the names started getting blurry,

439
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:57,960
started getting fuzzy,

440
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:01,380
then she started seeing more than one
soccer ball out there and the team could

441
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,720
tell that she was struggling.
And at,

442
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:06,870
and at the half they took a ride of
the game, sound like a familiar story.

443
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,670
She had, she had a brutal concussion
and ended her career. And now, you know,

444
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:16,290
she has to stay in like, you
know, a dark apartment. And um,

445
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,690
I don't know if she gets to bed,
spins are getting nauseous,

446
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:21,400
but the usual type of stuff. So I'm
reading this thing and I was like, Oh God,

447
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,210
another concussion stories.
It's just, I didn't, you know,

448
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,650
I haven't heard a lot of soccer players
having this happened to him, you know,

449
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:33,000
male or female. Um, so it was
really an interesting article.

450
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:36,720
And then all of a sudden, I don't know
where this person writes. You know,

451
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:41,721
it's one of the myths of the mainstream
sports media that concussions belong

452
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,630
only to men.
Most of them football players like,

453
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,040
okay,

454
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,940
I don't even, I can't even wrap my
head around that statement. It's like,

455
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,870
I want to just, let me just
continue reading this. In fact,

456
00:28:55,871 --> 00:29:00,460
studies show that women and girls are
more likely than men and boys to suffer

457
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:04,540
concussions in sports.
They both play such as soccer,

458
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,380
basketball and baseball, slash, softball.

459
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,800
And in those cases they are also more
likely to suffer and private of far cry

460
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:18,010
from the attention NFL players command.

461
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,670
Can you fucking believe that that was
one of the most uninformed paragraphs I

462
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:29,800
think I've ever read on.
Like after I read that I was like,

463
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,790
I don't think this paper USA
Today, I don't think that
they have a sports editor.

464
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,720
I don't even know where to
begin with that. First of all,

465
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:40,930
to make concussions like a gender issue.

466
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,170
Like I'm not the smartest guy,

467
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:48,430
but don't we both just have
brains that sit in fluid

468
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,580
in your head.
A blow to the head is a blow to the head.

469
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,870
So I don't know what she's
trying to claim. And I, my,

470
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:03,871
one of my favorite statements of all time
studies show no footnote to the study

471
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,670
studies show researchers have said,
um,

472
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,300
oh my God. So I actually, I, I,

473
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm not going to bore
you and maybe I will,

474
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,210
you want me to read the
letter that I sent her? I,

475
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,930
I wrote no disrespect because
I wanted her to read, you know,

476
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:25,150
get something to call their attention.

477
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:28,600
I basically said to suggest that female
athletes are more likely to suffer in

478
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,434
private,

479
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,760
a far cry from the attention NFL players
command when it comes to suffering.

480
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,680
Concussions is astoundingly uninformed.
The attention that NFL players command,

481
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:42,710
I kept putting that in quotes. She made
him sound like they would divas. Um,

482
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,060
the attention NFL players command has
everything to do with generations of

483
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:50,440
former NFL players suffering and private
after their careers were over in the

484
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:51,670
last five years alone.

485
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,190
Three NFL players have committed suicide
by single gunshot to the chest in order

486
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,270
to preserve their brains.

487
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:01,750
The scientists can figure out more about
the aftermath of playing professional

488
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:02,500
football.

489
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,790
The attention players command today
was the result of over two decades of

490
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,430
fighting tooth and nail with NFL owners.
In the end,

491
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:13,300
the only reason the owners gave in was
the irrefutable evidence gained through

492
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:18,120
examination of brains donated by dead NFL
players that's suffered in private and

493
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:22,630
then it brought up the class action
suit, but blah, blah blah, blah blah. Um,

494
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,040
Brian Scurry was taken out of that
ramp. Ryan, Briana Scurrey, sorry,

495
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,610
was taken out of the second half of
that soccer game because of all the

496
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:34,300
suffering and private than NFL players
have endured because of the knowledge

497
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:37,870
gained by all of those concussed football
players that were told to shake it off

498
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,150
and get back in the game.
This is a major issue in sport.

499
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,720
To see it glossed over and actually turned
into some gender issue is incredibly

500
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,030
irresponsible.
I'm not saying you're a bad person,

501
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,080
but to take such a serious subject and
not make it inclusive of all human beings

502
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:53,050
and then suggest that one side has it
worse than the other side and more like

503
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:56,500
fodder for the newlywed game rather than
a series metal. Does medical discussion.

504
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,120
See that? I can be eloquent. I
don't have to trash people. Well,

505
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:04,360
I can trash them, but I don't have
to write a all the curse words.

506
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,050
You see that at a very tuxedo
kind of vibe there, didn't I?

507
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,560
Unlike this person who wrote
to me. Oh, what a segue.

508
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,530
Ginger scumbag

509
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,840
bill. I've been a fan of
yours for 15 years. Okay,

510
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:27,670
so you guys got that. This guy has
been a fan of mine for 15 years,

511
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,120
so for 15 years this guy has been falling
me enjoying things that I'm doing.

512
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,600
All right?
This guy's locked in for 15 years.

513
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,170
The people that work hard every day
and spend their hard earned cash.

514
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,980
That's kind of redundant, sir. If you
work hard, then you have harder and cash.

515
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,630
All right? If you've got
an easy job, you know,

516
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:51,590
and then you'd be spending your
fucking teddy money right built.

517
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:55,310
Just read the fucking email. All
right? Just having fun. Bill,

518
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:56,750
I've been a fan of yours for 15 years.

519
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,860
The people that work hard every day and
spend their hard earned cash to see you

520
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,120
have been really disappointed.
This is one of the classic things.

521
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:07,970
When people complain rather than
just complaining for themselves,

522
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,960
they act like they're standing in front
of like a zillion people and they go

523
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:14,600
relax,
attention everyone.

524
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,150
I will send the email and we'll
convey all of your feelings.

525
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,010
Get on with your day.
Relax. I will handle it.

526
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,290
So evidently he has like, you know, all
of these people are disappointed in me.

527
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,920
He said, the people that follow
you and made you who you are,

528
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,270
they made me people.
I didn't work hard on stand up.

529
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,670
I was just standing there
and they all said, hey yo,

530
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,240
we have decided to make you and
who you are so sad it be said,

531
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,710
so set it be done.
He said,

532
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:52,220
you have made dates all around the
country and then cancelled them when

533
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,340
Hollywood calls you to do a part.
That's exactly what happened.

534
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,100
I picked up the phone, I said hello.
They said, this is Hollywood here.

535
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,890
We're calling you to do a part. Say, uh,

536
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,530
the people that go to
your shows and made you,

537
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,000
that made you aren't making a
10th of the money that you make,

538
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,030
but they paid to see you. Hey, ginger boy.

539
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,070
Without these fans, you're illiterate. Ass
would be working at Mcdonald's at best.

540
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,610
Now, I take offense to that, sir. Okay?

541
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,710
Without my fan base, I would not be
working at Mcdonald's. You son of a bitch,

542
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:32,330
I would be unloading trucks in
a warehouse. Get it straight.

543
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,440
He goes, you're a scumbag. Ba Gee,

544
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,880
you're a scum Baije and I hope every fan
realizes what you are and stops going

545
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,190
to your shows.

546
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,230
I will never listen to your shows or
podcasts again and we'll tell everyone to

547
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:49,064
do the same.

548
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,390
You are the typical sellout to
Hollywood fucking disappointment.

549
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,590
I know you won't have the balls to
read this on your podcast. Instead,

550
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:01,140
you will read a letter from a 20 year
old guy confused about his girlfriend's

551
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,420
sex and sexuality.

552
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,600
This is the best part here.
You're a real cunt.

553
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,300
Fuck you and everything you do

554
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,820
as one of the greatest Sendik's, one of
the greatest enemies to any email ever.

555
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:24,290
Gut. You're a real cunt in the real deal.
If you, if you tip over your country,

556
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:29,210
you see the stamp of approval from the
current factory and then it's just not

557
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,480
fuck you.
It's fuck you and everything you do.

558
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,810
Even when I go to the grocery
store. Yeah. That too.

559
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,010
Fuck you when you're out apples.

560
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,893
MMM.

561
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,470
Jesus Christ. Sir, you made me,

562
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,210
did I have anything to do?
Did I do anything? Did I work?

563
00:35:50,211 --> 00:35:53,450
Did I not fucking go onstage and eat
my balls? Learning how to do this?

564
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,340
I guess you did I listen,

565
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,910
I just want to thank you for making me
without your hard work of going through.

566
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:04,850
I mean, I can't imagine
how many, uh, I mean,

567
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,020
how many people live in this country?

568
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:09,320
I just can't imagine when you're just
going through the macbook trying to figure

569
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:13,940
out who you've decided will become a
professional comedian. That just is.

570
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,200
And the fact that you also have a day
job during the time where I guess you're

571
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:21,780
grossly underpaid. I mean, that's
just incredible to me, sir.

572
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,830
What the fuck do you want from me?
Let me ask you this,

573
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,640
okay? If Hollywood called you
and asked you to be in a movie,

574
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,820
you're going to say no.
You're going to say no.

575
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,610
All right. And like, like you told
your mom, hey listen Ma, don't worry.

576
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:45,420
I'll come over and I'll clean up
your yard this Saturday. All right?

577
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,540
And then all of a sudden Hollywood
comes to Collins says, Hey,

578
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,270
do you want to pretend you're a lot
tougher than you are and getting to a

579
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,770
gunfight and get shot by, I don't
know, whoever your favorite actor is,

580
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,310
you're going to say, no, I have
to go. Uh, I got a stick. What?

581
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:03,570
You've never broken a fucking,
you know what? Fuck that.

582
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,670
Even like a playoff game comes along.

583
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:10,140
You've never fucking had to change a
schedule, sir. I had to cancel some dates.

584
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,460
I didn't cancel them. I rescheduled
the fuck. Do you want from me?

585
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:21,170
You want me to stay in the strip malls
for my entire career telling jokes I did

586
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:25,740
that. I'm trying to fucking,
you know, and all, all,

587
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:28,650
all these movies to do is make
more people know who I am.

588
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:31,980
So more people come out to my shows so
I can keep writing more hours and having

589
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:36,450
a good time. All right. I don't
even know why I'm talking to you.

590
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,660
You said you're never going to
listen to my shit again, right?

591
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:43,110
Are you a man of your word after you're
saying, I'm not a man of my word.

592
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,160
If you're actually listened to this, then
you're a fucking hypocrite. All right.

593
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,083
What's a matter?

594
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,533
Huh?

595
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,400
Jesus Christ.

596
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,470
You fucking pissed on your sweat pants
this week or I don't know what the fuck

597
00:37:56,471 --> 00:37:59,080
that was all about.
You didn't even say what it was.

598
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,130
You may dates all around the
country and then cancelled them.

599
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,890
The fuck are you talking about?
I had one tour.

600
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:08,440
I had to move around and I
fucking did the first two dates.

601
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,470
Then I've made up a one to 3 cents then
and add an another one that wasn't even

602
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:19,960
on that original tour, so
go fuck yourself. All right.

603
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,670
All the tickets are honored and if he
can't make that date, you get it refunded

604
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,560
Jesus Christ. You know that that
tour that I was going to do,

605
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,220
I was just going to land in Boise,
you know,

606
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,230
jump on a bus and knock them all out
in 10 days now because that whole thing

607
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:41,800
blew up. Now I've got to get on it. You
know, it's like an extra 10 airplane ride.

608
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:46,030
You don't hear me bitching
though. Yeah, you fucking cunt.

609
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,600
You're a real cunt. Fuck you. And
everything to do that was worth it.

610
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,080
That was worth them getting mad. That's
fucking tremendous, sir. You know what?

611
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,320
As much as you do, you disappointed
me. You're a real disappointment.

612
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,290
You fucking jerk off.
You've liked me for 15 years.

613
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,330
One cancel fucking Gig and now you,

614
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,290
now you're saying fuck me and everything
I do. I make that Pumpkin pie this week.

615
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,190
You save fuck the pie too. That's a
part of it. You're saying fuck America.

616
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,200
If you're saying fuck punk,
punk a pie.

617
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,383
Okay,

618
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,920
but I got here I am a real cunt.
I, you know, I can't argue that.

619
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,133
Okay,

620
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,270
uh, hit us up to somebody.
Please put that on a tee shirt.

621
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,840
You're a real cunt.
Fuck you and everything you do.

622
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,080
Just to have that just
out there just written.

623
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,470
That's really tremendous. Oh, by the way,

624
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,690
if you guys want to read an unbelievable
book, I told you I was reading that,

625
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:45,524
uh,

626
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,650
that book data Al Jourgensen from
Ministry wrote, I just finished it, man.

627
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,740
I'm telling you some of the most insane
fucking stories you ever going to read.

628
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,400
I'll give you one line,

629
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,910
one descriptive line from one of the
stories was basically he was talking about

630
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:14,180
like these basically talking about three
of the craziest people he's ever met.

631
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,850
And he was talking about this one,

632
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,480
a tick guy who met this
lunar chick chick groupie.

633
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,020
And the line was he,

634
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,520
he brought her into the bathroom but
fucked her and then flushed your closed

635
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:29,354
down the toilet.

636
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,270
It was fucking insane thing
I've ever heard in my life.

637
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,220
So then she comes walking out of
the bathroom, she's like, oh my God.

638
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,920
Like what's with your friend?
What am I supposed to wear?

639
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,240
So they took a tablecloth of the table
and they cut a hole in it and they made a

640
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,250
dress out of it and then tied it off
around the middle and then she was just

641
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:57,230
went on tour with them, happy
as a clam. Um, all right,

642
00:40:57,231 --> 00:41:01,100
that's me butchering that story.
Just imagine 200 and what was it,

643
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:03,830
273 pages of that phenomenal,

644
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,230
phenomenal fucking read.

645
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,820
And it also exposed me to all this
amazing music in the 80s that I completely

646
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,260
missed on because,
you know,

647
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,030
I was 12 in 1980 so right around,
you know,

648
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,163
I don't know,
you know,

649
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,850
you don't listen to good music when you're
in your teenage years unless you have

650
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:27,050
really well informed older siblings.

651
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,860
Like the youngest kid in the family
usually knows what to listen to.

652
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,370
You know, if he has older brothers
who were like eight, nine,

653
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,770
10 or sisters that are old,
like eight years old.

654
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,470
There was something that could usually
hip his friends to, hey, you know,

655
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,090
just some of the, the music
that ministry was making. Right.

656
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,640
And to think that I was arguing
with people about whether, uh,

657
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,080
you know, Motley Crue was better than
poison, not shitting on those bands,

658
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:58,640
but I'm just saying, cause I like
both those beds for what they are.

659
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,350
I like them, you know, I love Motley
Crue and poison. It took me a while.

660
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,280
I mean they came out with makeup and
all the chicks liked him and you know,

661
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,900
so it's, you, they were easily hateable
so it was bon Jovi and all that aluminum.

662
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,020
Oh my God, he's so dreamy. You know
who's going to consumed. Right.

663
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,140
They just stuck to you when that shit,
but if you just look at him,

664
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,440
what the fuck they were doing, you know,
it's all right. Right. But anyways,

665
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:26,030
I had no idea. I had no fucking idea.
And I still don't, if you guys actually,

666
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:26,331
you know,

667
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:29,900
you know a lot about that type of music
or you've got some punk bands because I

668
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:33,260
missed out on all of that shit.
And um,

669
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,970
I'd really like to go back and listen
and work my way through that. Um,

670
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,470
the road less traveled of eighties
music because I didn't know any better.

671
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,410
All right. Okay. Continuing on.

672
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,660
What the fuck is this?
Oh,

673
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,620
this is from last week and of course I
just reduced the damn thing and rather

674
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:58,820
than a, is that the right word? Reduced
it. And you're cooking here bill.

675
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,850
Um, oh by the way, all
things comedy has a,

676
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,490
was starting to do a
monthly show down at Largo,

677
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,680
Largo on La Cienega and we have a show,
um,

678
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,370
this Tuesday night. All things comedy.
Um, the podcast is all the network.

679
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,730
Me and Al Madrigal, we're going to be
down there and knocking out another show.

680
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,190
We had a great time.
Um,

681
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,790
last month show was one of the best
standup shows I've been on in a long time.

682
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:27,440
Just as far as not only the level of
comedy, standup comedy, just the diverse,

683
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,050
um, the d the, I don't know, just,

684
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,060
it was a really great mix of
comics that were on that one.

685
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:38,840
So we're hoping we can do it again.
And, uh, it's also a great, you know,

686
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:42,470
if you see our diversity comedians are,
so are the podcasts on all things comedy.

687
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,440
And I really appreciate everybody that's
already bought tickets to come on down.

688
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:49,910
It's going to be eight o'clock on Tuesday
night. Ra plowing ahead, plowing ahead.

689
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,520
What else do we got here? Oh, you
don't have to fucking bugs me.

690
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,990
I went to Toronto again, which is such a
great city. They're all Montreal, Toronto,

691
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:57,824
Vancouver.

692
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,420
I just have a great time when I'm up there
and I can't wait to run through that,

693
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,030
that country up there. And, uh,

694
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,450
March of next year is when
we were shooting to a tour
of that country. But, uh,

695
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,850
every time I go to Toronto,
I always go,

696
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:16,280
I gotta go to the El Mocambo cause
that's where Stevie Ray Vaughn, uh,

697
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,690
he recorded that,
uh,

698
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,710
I guess live at the El Mocambo
and I fucking still didn't
get to do at this time,

699
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,680
just didn't have enough God damn
times and knowing. So anyways,

700
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,110
let's plow ahead here. A Mother Teresa
is what? This next one is called. Bill,

701
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:33,540
you mentioned in your
youtube tour of Boston,

702
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:38,310
something to the effect of that someday
someone is going to write a tell all

703
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:42,510
about Mother Teresa. Yeah, I was just
joking around. He said someone did.

704
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,710
Here's the link.
Um,

705
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,230
here's the link to the documentary
based on the book. Quick summary.

706
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,080
She was a cunt,
had come on

707
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,870
a 100%.
She wasn't a,

708
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:02,370
she wasn't helped some people out.
Jesus Christ. Oh Way. You know what,

709
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,190
if Mother Teresa can be called at current,

710
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:07,770
I guess I should take the fact that
I'm a real cunt. You're a real,

711
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,890
can't you realize that? Um,
all right. College stadium.

712
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,350
Oh Hey. By the way, anybody,
uh, anybody ever been to Italy?

713
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,330
Um,

714
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,650
I'm going to go there to get acclimated
to the time before I do the European

715
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:24,960
tour. I'm just going to, I just
said fuck it. You know, why?

716
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:29,700
Just go over there and bang out a bunch
of shows. I never get to see anything. Um,

717
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,810
other than the backs of comedy clubs.
I want to go see some shit.

718
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,910
So I've decided that I'm going to
go over, you know, a couple, two,

719
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:38,760
three days over in Italy in a,

720
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:43,470
I'm leaning towards going in
Naples. Anybody, anybody at all,

721
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:45,960
if you've ever been there,
can you give me some places to go?

722
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,620
I want to go see a fucking opera
over there. Get all dressed up,

723
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,080
bring a little handkerchief, cry
like a little girl, you know,

724
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,430
take the whole fucking thing in.
You have some sketti and then I'm off.

725
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,360
I'm off on my run.

726
00:45:57,361 --> 00:46:00,930
So if you guys have any suggestions
I would really appreciate it. Um,

727
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,710
Oh and speaking of which is really just
a lot of announcements this week, uh,

728
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,790
had a lot of shit happened.
Thank you to whoever brought me the uh,

729
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,040
Ken Burns the war on DVD.

730
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:14,520
That was ridiculously generous of you
did not have to do that and believe me,

731
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,580
I will be watching that once again.

732
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,870
The second I get through all of Ken
Burns is the rest of them because I've

733
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:23,050
already seen that one.
But I've done,

734
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,760
I definitely want to watch it again cause
it's like such a history lesson just

735
00:46:26,761 --> 00:46:30,060
as far as you can just see. Oh first
we went here, then we went here.

736
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:31,140
This is where this island is.

737
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:34,320
This is where the battle of the
bulge was really fucking fascinating.

738
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,850
So thank you for that. Um, all
right. College Stadium Bill. I am

739
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,750
a group of my buddies and I,
uh,

740
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:46,350
want to take a trip somewhere random
and catch a good college football game.

741
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,010
Not necessarily just the game with a team,
but also a great stadium.

742
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,740
We're all in our mid
twenties and live in Florida.

743
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,440
Ben To plenty of gators and
seminals games. I was going to say,

744
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:58,400
Jesus Christ where you don't have to
travel. You've got it right there. Uh,

745
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:03,030
which colleagues called stadium would
you suggest we make our trip to somewhere

746
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:06,830
that serves beer during the game would
be a plus, but not a requirement. Um,

747
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:11,150
I don't know about, I don't
know that the NCAA, any of the,

748
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,100
the college stadium serve beer.
Um,

749
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,500
I never noticed that they didn't at the
rose bowl because I was so fucking shit

750
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:23,240
faced that I didn't need any more alcohol.
So I never tell,

751
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,790
I'm usually trying to buy something to
absorb all the booze that I've adjusted.

752
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,670
Um, but uh, I don't think that you can,

753
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,010
that's what my friends
had been telling me.

754
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,490
We were just in college station and um,

755
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,080
they didn't sell it there. They didn't
sell it at the Lsu game. So anyways,

756
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,040
in other words,

757
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,310
what's the Best College stadium atmosphere
that you've been to that you would

758
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:50,230
recommend visiting? Uh, love the podcast,
blah, blah, blah. Go Fuck Yourself. Okay.

759
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,520
Um, yeah, I liked it.

760
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:55,540
You phrased it that way cause I'm
only going by what I've done. Um,

761
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,340
I got to tell you,
Lsu,

762
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:01,600
Alabama in Baton Rouge was,

763
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,170
uh, even if you, you're
not a fan of the sport,

764
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:08,470
you realize that you're at
something legendary and special.

765
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,140
Just SCC football in general,

766
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:14,890
like the level that's being played at
there in another golden age of that

767
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,150
conference.
And I,

768
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:21,151
and I'm blown away by how well
behaved and polite the fans are.

769
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:23,440
Because you know, the stereotype of
southerners, you know, walk around.

770
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:28,370
Hello, what are you doing over here? Yeah.
We don't walk your cat around here. No,

771
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,350
it's nothing like that.
It's not the,

772
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,190
most of that shit is just from watching
Mississippi burning and Hollywood's

773
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:38,400
version. I'm not saying
that those guys don't exist.

774
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,410
All right.
It's kind of like a,

775
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,030
that Ray Donovan character,

776
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,430
like that character is
supposed to represent like
everybody on the east coast,

777
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,070
basically the northeast, that that's
how people are, you know, he come,

778
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,550
he come Numa family again
and I'll fucking kill you.

779
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,180
You know that bullshit all the time.
And like,

780
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,670
like everybody down south is
fucking playing a washboard.

781
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,620
It's not like that all at all. I
thought the two were raw, you know,

782
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,430
they throw down the level in
college station. They were amazing.

783
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:19,620
Um, this is what I would do. I would pick,

784
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,540
if you're a fan of any other team,

785
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,380
go into a home game against one of
their big rivals is awesome. It's, it's,

786
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,230
it's fun to go to a game where you
actually give a shit about the team. Um,

787
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,690
so you kind of have a dog in the
fight or if you're going to go, uh,

788
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,640
go see someone really special,
you know,

789
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,440
like some once in a generation kind of
play like Johnny football comes around

790
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:40,801
like,
you know,

791
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:43,800
like that guy is going to be a legend
regardless of what he does in the football

792
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,980
NFL,
whether he makes it a nod,

793
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:50,070
it's to be able to see and like I saw
that guy in his sophomore year play

794
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:54,960
against Alabama and a and a 49,
42 game. That's pretty cool.

795
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:59,040
So if I was you just to look in,

796
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,770
it's saving money and that type of shit,
you really don't need to go anywhere.

797
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:05,700
You're down there in SCC country anyways,
I would go see Alabama.

798
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:09,780
I go to the Alabama Auburn game even
though Auburn's non not as good as they

799
00:50:09,781 --> 00:50:13,590
were. Uh, with Cam Newton,
I go to one of those ones.

800
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,480
For some reason the Florida Georgia game
in Jacksonville does not interest me

801
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,470
because that it's an away
game for everybody because
they were worried about the

802
00:50:22,471 --> 00:50:25,110
behavior of people.
I want to see their behavior.

803
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,450
I like when does one
team going into a hostel,

804
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:34,100
a hostile environment.
So you know,

805
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,300
like I saw Texas,

806
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:39,050
Oklahoma at the cotton bowl and
that was awesome and it was great,

807
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:42,920
legendary steam to go to, but there
was definitely something missing.

808
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:47,120
There was no, you know, you're in
our house now. Vibe was not there.

809
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,070
Um, so I dunno, Jesus, am I fucking
meandering this week or what?

810
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,780
So I, if I was you, I would either go
to Tuscaloosa, I go to Baton Rouge,

811
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,520
um,

812
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,660
Tennessee for some reason it
looks fucking insane to me.

813
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,780
Tennessee I think would be insane just
because that's in Knoxville is just the

814
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:12,300
middle of fucking nowhere and
there's nothing else to do.

815
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,810
But to go absolutely ape shit at a
Tennessee volunteers game and just watched

816
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:17,551
them throwing down.

817
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:21,210
I'm telling you half the fucking show is
being outside the stadium and watching

818
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,440
how hardcore these people party,
um,

819
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,940
or and cook and all that. I mean, they
don't get drunk and belligerent like a,

820
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,090
at least I haven't seen that yet.

821
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:34,670
And it's probably a lot of people rolling
their fucking ice. But uh, you know,

822
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,830
it seems like the violent fans
are on the coasts. I Dunno.

823
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,890
Like if we're going to get stomped
or fucking stabbed or shot,

824
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,480
especially out here in
California, um, I don't know when,

825
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,700
if you Mosey on up to somebody smoker,
all you do,

826
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:50,620
throw them a couple of compliments.
Next thing you know,

827
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:54,220
you've got something smoked sitting on
a plate, they'll fucking hook you up.

828
00:51:54,221 --> 00:51:54,971
That they're great,

829
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:59,500
they're great people south get the south
gets such a bad fucking reputation.

830
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:02,140
And I know there's the racism and
there's all that fucking shit,

831
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:07,120
but unfortunately, that
racism is everywhere, at least
as far as my travels. So,

832
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:08,560
uh,
the end of the day,

833
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:11,680
those fuckers cook better than they
do in the up north at a football game.

834
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:16,540
Anyways, so there you go. There's
my long winded fucking answer.

835
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,830
Alright. Hey, Billy bets.

836
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,660
Couple of weeks ago you said you don't
want to see the coliseum because it's too

837
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:26,320
touristy. I implore you to
change your mind. Oh, here it is.

838
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:30,250
Uh, you yourself, you
owe, you owe yourself.

839
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:33,070
You left out the o what? You, you, you,

840
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:36,220
yourself love to go to different
arenas and stadiums in America.

841
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:37,360
If I remember correctly,

842
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,250
you said you wanted to go to every
major sporting arena in the u u s yeah.

843
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,880
You know this argument.
I know what you mean.

844
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,720
As well as major college stadiums to
call a Siem is one of the oldest stadiums

845
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:50,650
in the world and the most famous in
history in the history of the world,

846
00:52:50,651 --> 00:52:55,240
50,000 people could sit in it.
It had a retractable roof,

847
00:52:55,270 --> 00:53:00,270
giant pieces of fabric that were
controlled by men to block the sun out.

848
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,640
Jesus correre and I'm sold.
I'm going.

849
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,120
And some historical texts claim that
it was even filled with water in naval

850
00:53:09,941 --> 00:53:14,320
battles were reenacted for the public.
Jesus Christ.

851
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:17,770
You know what was,
was that the greatest empire of all time?

852
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,430
Wow. They put the gluttony
even in it even, you know,

853
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,650
I can only speak my country,

854
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:29,160
but even like the level of big
gulps and how fat people are now,

855
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,780
even with that, we don't have puking
rooms here. Like they had rooms.

856
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,900
The Romans had rooms just for like
after you've gorged yourself will,

857
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:40,310
you just went in and yakked you know,

858
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,450
and can you imagine the poor conquered
people that had to clean that fucking

859
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,620
thing out every couple of hours.

860
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,720
Okay.

861
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,720
And An air condition. Puke Room. Wow.

862
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,910
Jesus Christ. I'd fight a line in a
second not to fucking have to do this,

863
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:02,740
just get it over with. And he said yes,
it is very a very touristy place to go,

864
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:05,650
but it is the most famous arena
and the history of the world.

865
00:54:05,651 --> 00:54:09,490
It was built nearly 2000 years
ago and still stands today.

866
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:14,110
I guarantee you that I saw in Dallas
won't be standing in 2000 years.

867
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:17,620
Ps, my girlfriend watched your episode of
new girl and said it was the first time

868
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,030
she ever saw you not yelling,

869
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,530
Jesus, I'm getting pounded this week,
but I can't. I can't argue any of it.

870
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,260
I am a real cut and I do scream a lot.
Um, all right, well maybe, maybe I, I'll,

871
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:34,710
I'll do that. Like, look, I
have, I have plans of, uh,

872
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,660
for the rest of my standup career of,

873
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,150
of continuing to expand
my tours through your,

874
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,770
through Europe and uh, wherever
else they'll have me, Australia and,

875
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:50,230
and I want to see it, man. I'm only
here once. I want to see it. And, uh,

876
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,580
Italy, I don't plan on just going to one
time, like there's all these different,

877
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,730
so all these years of watching a Mario
Batali who gets my vote is the coolest

878
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,960
fucking redhead on TV.
All right. Um, we just,

879
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:08,580
his knowledge and passion for a,

880
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,250
that country in their food and
all the different places to go.

881
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,720
Um, he's made me want to go to
so many different parts of Italy,

882
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:21,510
so I'm just starting with this one.
I guess I should start with Rome,

883
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:26,230
but it just seemed hacky to
go there. So, uh, I dunno,

884
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:30,460
I mean the game plan always was to tor
and make a little bit of money and Europe

885
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:33,910
and then blow all of it
in some awesome country.

886
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,980
So that's basically,

887
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:40,180
and it probably won't be making that
much money in Europe because people don't

888
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:43,790
really know me at, uh, but you
know how much this spaghetti costs.

889
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,500
Yeah. All right. How about
a little advertising here?
All right. He voice everyone.

890
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,650
If you're an entrepreneur
and a customer calls,

891
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,500
do you want it to seem like
you're in a high rise window view?

892
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:00,210
Fancy pants office.
Oh,

893
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,060
do you want them to know that you just
sitting there and your underwear and a

894
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:06,900
one bedroom apartment, you
know, all sweaty on a Futon,

895
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,830
that's not good for business. What do
you do if you can't afford the high rise?

896
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,660
Go to he voice with the voice.

897
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:16,590
You can create the appearance of an
entire building, sales, customer support,

898
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:18,930
tech support, you name it. It's
going to seem like you got it.

899
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,510

treatment with the voice.

calls to your home, mobile,

902
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:32,330
we'll find you don't have time to take
a call. No biggie. It's routed as, uh,

903
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,360
is relative to your voicemail.

904
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,560
And you can read it at your convenience
as an email he voiced not only gives you

905
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,030
an edge over your competition,

906
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:43,150
it will take away the edge of the big
companies have over you right now.

with starting your dream business.

911
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:02,260
Doesn't it?
Heart swells up a little tear in your eye.

912
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,320
You push it back down because you're
a man, you're not allowed to cry.

913
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,950
And if you're a woman, you feel like
you're competing against men, right?

914
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,400
So you got to push it down or maybe
you don't. I don't know. But anyways,

915
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,960

933
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,680
Bill, here's the dilemma. You're hanging
out at your house wanting a snack.

934
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,790
Your lady says she's going to bake
you some cookies. What a sweetheart.

935
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:34,140
Absolutely. What a champ. Uh,

936
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:39,180
she brings the cookies out. And to your
surprise, they are dick shaped cookies.

937
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:45,000
Think Bachelorette party complete
with sprinkles for pubes, et Cetera.

938
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,660
You're hungry and the
cookies are sure to be tasty,

939
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:53,880
but they are shaped like dicks. Do
you eat all the cookies? Thanks.

940
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:57,660
And Go fuck yourself. Uh, you
know what we have here, sir?

941
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,710
That right there is a classic
example of some Code Lotion.

942
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:07,500
That right there is some fucking
cold lotion. You said you're hungry,

943
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:11,070
you want a snack, and your woman goes,
oh, go make you some cookies. You're like,

944
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:15,020
Holy Shit. I've finally found
a woman that's still cooks.

945
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,540
It doesn't feel like you're
taken away her right to vote.

946
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,580
If she goes out and does that for you,
phenomenal. She brings the cookies in.

947
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:27,540
You're all excited and you look down
and you've got a bowl of Cox. Um,

948
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,380
do you eat the cookies? Um, well,

949
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:37,240
do you plan to run for
office? They sir, if you do,

950
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:38,800
while I probably wouldn't work,

951
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:42,670
I would say you should take a picture of
yourself eating the bowl of dicks that

952
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:45,430
way no one could ever say
that you're homophobic,

953
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:50,470
but somebody could run a smear campaign
and say that your marriage was a sham

954
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,550
and just have you get out and they picked
the worst picture you with your eyes

955
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:58,030
half closed and the most enjoyable
ecstasy. Look on your face.

956
00:59:58,031 --> 01:00:01,400
Sugar rush as you stick in a dick in your
mouth. I know that could go either way.

957
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,670
Do you eat the cookies?
Um,

958
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,620
a listen man. A fucking cookie is a
cookie. I need them if they tasted good.

959
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,880
Um, hey, when those things get stale,

960
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,070
does that mean they're kinda that
he'd get like a wrecked? Sorry,

961
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,560
that was a stupid Dick Jokes.
Um,

962
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,480
do you eat the cookies? I don't
know about, you know what?

963
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:29,470
I'd have to know what your,
if your girlfriend did that
to be fucking hilarious.

964
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:31,810
Like, hey, you want some cookies?
And that comes out with a bullet.

965
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:36,580
Dicks Dick Cookies. That's
fucking hilarious. At which
point I'd eat all of them.

966
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,190
Okay.

967
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,920
But, uh, yeah, there's no way she wasn't
trying to be funny. You know what?

968
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:43,530
You should laugh when you should eat.
And with a big glass of milk,

969
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,470
which a metaphorically is just color.

970
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,460
If you get like the 0% fat, you
should just go all out with it. Ah,

971
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:57,090
that's fucking gross. I never liked sex
jokes with food. Isn't that disgusting?

972
01:00:57,091 --> 01:01:01,050
That I grocery on? I apologize.
I apologize to you on this
wonderful Monday. Hey,

973
01:01:01,051 --> 01:01:05,220
by the way, everybody, I bet you sitting
there going like, you know, fuck my life.

974
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,870
I want to know what bill's
doing this weekend. I know
you're not, but let's just,

975
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,250
just appease my ego.

976
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,140
Appease the ego of a real cunt here.
Um, I'm going to be at the Chicago,

two shows. Who am I bringing along?

979
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,340
None other than master chef.

980
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,200
Slash Rosebowl tailgate
lesson legend Jason Law head.

981
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:36,080

you haven't heard in a long time,

984
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:46,290
which is probably a happy
Cleveland browns fan. Um,

985
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,320
I am a closet Cleveland browns fan
cause I think they have one of the best

986
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:53,180
fucking uniforms in the league.
And uh,

987
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,690
and they were great when I was a kid
and the 80s, I love those browns teams,

988
01:01:57,691 --> 01:01:59,460
that fucking municipal stadium,

989
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:03,060
just that it just was on NFL films,

990
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:08,010
municipal stadium when it was overcast
and it was cold and it may be snowed a

991
01:02:08,011 --> 01:02:11,010
little bit now. The field was
muddy. They had just with,

992
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,000
it was one of the last great
football stadiums out there.

993
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:17,820
Even though I know it was built for
baseball was probably a terrible place to

994
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:20,430
see a game and a lot of ways.
Um,

995
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,880
I was a fan of Brian Sipe and the
cardiac kids and all of that shit.

996
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:28,440
So I always root for those
fuckers. Um, so anyways, yeah,

997
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:31,190
I'll be at the uh, the Chicago
theater unfortunately, um,

998
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,440
coming in and coming right back out,
flying in the day of and then leaving.

999
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:38,490
I wanted to try and maybe take it
and I think Northwestern's at home,

1000
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,550
I know Notre Dame is at home.
He's going to try to drive over there,

1001
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:45,390
but I think it's too long a
fucking drive. But uh, anyways,

1002
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:47,670
if you guys have any suggestions
on a great place to eat,

1003
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:52,570
I don't want to get deep dish pizza.
I don't want to do that.

1004
01:02:52,571 --> 01:02:55,540
How about more like a steak place?
That deep dish pizza man.

1005
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:59,590
Like you always order one. You
like, I got this, I got this.

1006
01:02:59,591 --> 01:03:04,060
And then it becomes like a man
versus food moment. Um, it is,

1007
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,370
it is delicious. Do
you know what? Fuck it.

1008
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,800
How about a steak place in a good
place to get a deep dish? Pizza.

1009
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:09,670
You know what you guys should do?

1010
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,120
You guys should try to see how fucking
fat you could make me just subtly,

1011
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,800
just all get together.

1012
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:17,710
Like that guy suggested like you're
all in communication with each other,

1013
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,990
you know,
and now that I've canceled those dates,

1014
01:03:19,991 --> 01:03:23,470
why don't you guys try to get together
and try to make me a fet? Freckled fuck.

1015
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:29,470
Alright, hater. Alright Billy tit. Rag.

1016
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,890
I don't even know what it, what is
it? Tit Rec. Is that a worn out bra?

1017
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:42,870
Um, I, I need some advice on a
hater. Alright, I'm 20 years old.

1018
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,760
Hey, that guy called it check. That
guy who called me a ginger scumbag,

1019
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:48,241
he called it.

1020
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,150
That's at least he called
the age at somebody 20 years
old was going to write it.

1021
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:56,100
I'm 20 years old and I've been pretty
shy and self conscious for my entire life

1022
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,590
until recently. That's
understandable. Surf.

1023
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:04,100
I was a well within the tortoise
shell until I was 23. Um,

1024
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,240
he says,
I've started to just say fuck it.

1025
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,170
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
That's a great thing. Good for you.

1026
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,730
You said it, it feels great, but
it's hard though. Uh, I'm no expert.

1027
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,200
I got a lot.

1028
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:21,260
I've got a lot more confidence and now
I ha I now have one of my first haters.

1029
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,130
Well, that's good. You
know what most people hate?

1030
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:30,120
Most people hate watching somebody
enjoy themselves or be successful.

1031
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:35,630
So he must either he knew you or she
knew you before when you were shy and now

1032
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,350
is seeing you start to come out,
come into your own,

1033
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,580
and it's making that person
feel left behind or, uh,

1034
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,990
they're just straight across the board.

1035
01:04:46,991 --> 01:04:50,230
Anybody having a good time and enjoying
themselves, they try to knock them down.

1036
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:54,520
Um, anyways, he says this kid
goes to my college of 600 people.

1037
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,730
We go out as a big group most
nights and he's always there.

1038
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,380
Once in a while he'll throw a comment
my way and I just ignore it. Uh,

1039
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:06,580
last night I was talking to a girl and
he comes up behind and puts my hood over

1040
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:07,150
my head.

1041
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,840
I turned around and stared at him for
10 seconds and he just looked away.

1042
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,190
This kid's pathetic.

1043
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,150
I've just been ignoring him and trying
not to give a fuck that doesn't work with

1044
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:19,180
bullying, surf that doesn't. Um, he says,

1045
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:22,630
I definitely don't want to fight
the kid and ruined my reputation,

1046
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,580
but I also don't want to
look like a little bitch.

1047
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,470
I figured you might know what to say,

1048
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:31,330
seeing that you deal with hecklers all
the time. Thanks. Um, first of all, hey,

1049
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:32,700
you don't have to hang out with this kid.

1050
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,540
MMM.

1051
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,690
You know this,
unfortunately,

1052
01:05:36,691 --> 01:05:39,900
this is not the first one of these kinds
of people that's going to be in your

1053
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:41,010
life.
You have to,

1054
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,393
mmm.

1055
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,280
You got to pay attention,
especially when you're younger,

1056
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,330
because you kind of wide open
because you just, you know,

1057
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:54,150
you just started your parents' house,
you starting to learn shit on your own.

1058
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:57,120
And a lot of times if you came
from a dysfunctional home,

1059
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,310
you'll actually surround yourself with
the same, kind of, can't see exact cut.

1060
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:01,800
Sweet.
When you yelled at your parents

1061
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,820
and you walk out, you actually end up
rebuilding that exact same structure.

1062
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,030
Now that's not my, that's obviously
I've heard that, you know,

1063
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:16,320
from people who are intelligent and
I actually went out and did that.

1064
01:06:16,321 --> 01:06:19,320
So what you have to do, you've got
to cut the cancer out. All right?

1065
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,510
You don't need to be around this guy.
You having a good time.

1066
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:25,080
He coming into your own. You're talking
to the ladies, you having a good time.

1067
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,400
So, uh, no. If he does something like
that to you again, yeah. You got to,

1068
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:33,180
you have to, at some point you've got to
step to the kid and just be like, dude,

1069
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:34,500
is there some sort of a problem here?

1070
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,633
You know?

1071
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,820
And considering you just stared
at him and he looked away, I,

1072
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:44,150
I pretty much think he's going
to back down. But, uh, you know,

1073
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:45,920
if you've got to do what you gotta do,
if you've got to have a fight,

1074
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:47,640
you got to have a fight. It's
not a bad thing, you know,

1075
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:53,060
it's just nowadays with lawsuits and
all these youtube videos and shit,

1076
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:57,740
kids used to settle shit
amongst themselves, so, uh,

1077
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:59,870
you might have to do that.
I hope you don't.

1078
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,533
MMM.

1079
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:08,620
But yeah, I, I would not ignore
him. I would not ignore him.

1080
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,110
I would, uh, you know, if you don't
want to go to the physical route,

1081
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:15,880
I would just pick out something, um,
that looks bad on him physically.

1082
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,680
And I would bring that up. I would go,
I would go right for the fucking juggler

1083
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,013
with that kid.

1084
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,860
This is zillion different ways to do it
and I'm afraid to tell you which way to

1085
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:28,090
do it because if it goes wrong,

1086
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,980
then you know the way
everybody gets sued nowadays,

1087
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,650
just know I'm a fucking moron. But, um,

1088
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,240
I do know that if you're going to keep
running into the same person and they're,

1089
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,700
they're,
they're overstepping a boundary with you,

1090
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:43,150
ignoring them does not make them go away.
You know,

1091
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:45,130
like that shit they say if
you run into a black bear,

1092
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:50,050
just stand still and ignore it. It'll go
away. They don't, okay. So you have to,

1093
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:53,080
uh, you got to address
it. He could say anything,

1094
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,840
anything to whatever's
name is, hey, what's up?

1095
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:57,460
You going to be in a country
mood again this night?

1096
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:59,463
You know,

1097
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,670
can you do me a favor and maybe rub one
out before you come over here with your

1098
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,130
frustrated fucking energy?
Something like that. I don't know,

1099
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:10,360
except don't start it. When you
say energy a energy. Um, I dunno.

1100
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:12,790
I Dunno if you know how to fight. If
you know how to fight, uh, you know,

1101
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,380
I'm not saying to do it,
but uh,

1102
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,210
there is a reason God allowed
you to ball up your fist.

1103
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,550
Hey, if God didn't want us
to punch anybody in the face,

1104
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,160
what did he have blessed us with fish.
He's going amazing thing about your hand.

1105
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:36,890
Now we can correct somebody or fucking
choke him to death.

1106
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,440
Just the options. That's why I don't
think he's, he's going to judge it.

1107
01:08:41,441 --> 01:08:44,810
You could fucking really do
whatever you want. You know,

1108
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,670
you're going to fucking just
give people that. The, the, the,

1109
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,500
I've been doing a bit about this,

1110
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:54,980
how you going to give people freedom
of choice and then you're going to get

1111
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,810
upset when they make the wrong choices.

1112
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,630
You're going to make them flawed
and then you're going to get mad.

1113
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,220
I don't understand that. I
really don't. All right. Anyways,

1114
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,130
that's the podcast for this week,
everybody. I hope you had a good time. Ah,

1115
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,680
just to let you know this week,
once again,

1116
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:13,700
I'm going to be in Chicago theater and
then I have a after that and I could,

1117
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,740
I can tell you one guy
who's not going to be there,

1118
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:20,000
that guy from earlier this
week, I lost one. Everybody.

1119
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:26,130
He's not even listening to this right
now. Um, anyways, you know what?

1120
01:09:26,131 --> 01:09:27,750
I should get the email.
The guy from the past week,

1121
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,580
you've got all pissed off
about the El Paso one.

1122
01:09:29,581 --> 01:09:33,990
I've got to get that from my guy,
uh, helps me with all his shit.

1123
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,050
I should let them know
that it's been rescheduled,

1124
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:38,190
that he'd get his money back and all that.

1125
01:09:38,191 --> 01:09:39,900
I still feel bad that he drove four hours.

1126
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:44,550
I knew that was going to fucking
happen. Anyways, here we go.

1127
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:49,740
Um, October 3rd, I'm
going to be October 2nd.

1128
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,630
The reschedule show in El Paso
is going down. It's going down.

1129
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,493
All right.

1130
01:09:56,250 --> 01:10:00,210
And I will try to do something extra
special to make up for the fact that all

1131
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:02,400
these people drove out there
and then it fucking rained,

1132
01:10:02,401 --> 01:10:06,000
which was beyond my control. And,
uh, you know, it's fucked up.

1133
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:09,630
I had such a good time driving from El
Paso to San Antonio that I think I'm

1134
01:10:09,631 --> 01:10:13,500
actually going to drive from La
to El Paso. It's a 12 hour drive,

1135
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:17,100
which is a, that's nothing,
that's nothing to, uh,

1136
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,540
I've been doing the road for a long time.

1137
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:22,610
I already know how I'm going to break
it up, break it up, say break it up. Uh,

1138
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,450
all right.
October 3rd,

1139
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,750
I'll be at the San Jose Center
for the performing arts.

1140
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,200
October 4th paramount theater in Seattle,
Washington.

1141
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:34,220
We are not allowed is um,

1142
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,850
October 5th, I'll be at the celebrity
theater in Phoenix, Arizona.

1143
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,430
That is in the round. All of
those are going to be, uh,

1144
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:47,040
just amazing venues and just
really going to be fun shows.

1145
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:49,260
I got all this new shit that
I, I, I've been working on.

1146
01:10:49,261 --> 01:10:52,140
A bunch of stuff is coming together.
I'm excited to be doing my act,

1147
01:10:52,141 --> 01:10:55,110
so I'm thrilled that you
guys are coming out. Um,

1148
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,900
despite the fact that I'm a real
cunt. All right, there you go.
