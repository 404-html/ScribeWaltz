1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,310
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:05,470
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:10,040
March 7th, 2006 stay. What's going on?

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:14,810
How are you? How's your weekend?
Do you listen to the weekend?

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,990
I can't feel my face when I with you.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,813
Boom.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,120
Oh,
what are you doing man?

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,040
You're fucking some chicken blow. You
didn't do blow when you were with her now.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,320
Now you're with her. Now
you're doing blow the boy.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,300
I can't believe that shit came back.
You know, I thought coke was just done.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,230
You know, after all the people did
what they did from my generation,

12
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:46,370
you would think that the next generations
would be like, you know what? Yeah,

13
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm going to stay away from that shit.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,113
Right.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,570
It's not our works. One generation
does it. Like my generation,

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,110
we were like, wow man, let's
stay away from hey man,

17
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:01,800
like let's stay away from LSD and heroin.
Cause that's like a bad trip man.

18
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,510
And then we fucked with like coke and
crack crank, all of that Shit, right?

19
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:08,100
That ruined dollar about fucking lives.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,840
And then the next generation was just
like, yeah, man, fuck all that stuff.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,610
Let's fuck with crystal meth. Right?
So now this next way was like,

22
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:22,080
fuck crystal meth. You know, let's kick
it old school. Let's go back to the coke.

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,183
Right?

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,800
You have an entire generation of people
that not only can't feel it faces,

25
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,390
but I evidently they like it.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,070
Oh God. What do you go from there?
Sorry, I'm trying to update my, uh,

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,120
my musical tastes.

28
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:44,121
I've decided that after fucking 40 years
of listening to the same fucking 10

29
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,820
bands, you know, not 40, like 30.

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,230
I mean, Jesus Christ, how many
fucking times can you listen to it?

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,640
I always like those. You have those
people are walking in the circle,

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,670
the circle in the jail
at midnight express.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,140
Remember that when they were walking
counterclockwise and then the dude who's

34
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,950
going to escape and you had the drugs,

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,430
you know whose girlfriend put
it tidies up against the glass.

36
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:12,030
He started walking around the
other way. Remember that? Yeah.

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,240
That's what I'm doing right now. I'm
walking around the other way and every,

38
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,230
my generation is just going, what are
you listening to this shit for Sec.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
I don't know how many times the Hay,

40
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,230
I haven't listened to
that for fucking 30 years.

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,430
Okay.

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,650
I gotta get,
I gotta pull my cell phone.

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,173
MMM.

44
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,980
No, I just, yeah, I would like to
listen to something new. So, uh,

45
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,140
the lovely Nia was watching the,

46
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,270
all the performances from
the grammys last night.

47
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,940
So I just started downloading
everything that I was seeing,

48
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:49,290
whether I liked it or not. I'm like, I'm
just gonna listen to this shit. You know?

49
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,260
It's kind of like when I try to put a new
hour of stand up together and I'm just

50
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,810
like, Eh, you know, if this
doesn't, this isn't a good idea,

51
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,350
but I'm gonna say it anyways cause I
can't say the other shit cause that's

52
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:02,060
coming out. So I just start
throwing shit against the wall.

53
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,580
So this morning I was listening to,

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,010
I listened to a little bit of the weekend,
Dude. Sounds just like Michael Jackson,

55
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:14,900
right? I think it does. And
uh, who else did I download?

56
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,050
That girl looks like [inaudible],
uh, MC search, right?

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,573
The fuck's her name.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,630
I don't know if she was singing about a
relationship and she was over it and she

59
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,730
just looked like she had
this high top fade, you know,

60
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,230
but also knew what I like
to make a fucking rocket.

61
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,550
She looked really smart, you know, yet
like you wouldn't want to fuck with the,

62
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:47,270
I don't know. She kind of had it all
going on. It's like, is this a nerd?

63
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,800
Is this a bully?

64
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,940
Is this a wrapper or is she a witch?

65
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,440
But the band is fucking great.
And so she, I don't, you know,

66
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,550
after all of that shit,

67
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:00,910
I'm probably not going to say who the
fuck it is even if I figure it out.

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,280
Cause I don't want to shit
on people like that. Um,

69
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,860
anyways, he had a killer SG though.
The fucking three pickups, you know,

70
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,970
that's surfing green. They went
out, they crushed it. Right.

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,700
I actually saw what's his face?
They're the fucking,

72
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,130
the dude who's getting
the worst tattoos ever.

73
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,420
He's got the Lamborghini and fucking,
uh,

74
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,140
didn't like l and l Keyshawn Johnson
chased him up his front door.

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,010
The fuck is his name, Justin Bieber. I
actually watched that. That guy can sing.

76
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:34,670
He's fucking talented. I just don't,
you should just, just do that.

77
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,441
Just do that.

78
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,780
Stop filming yourself playing
basketball and whatever else is doing.

79
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,830
Mean mugging you.
Fucking Gopro.

80
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,670
Just sing your song and fucking go home.
Why wouldn't you do that?

81
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,410
It's actually a talented kid.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,100
Although I didn't like when he threw
the acoustic guitar down in the end,

83
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,540
you know, what are you fucking
Pete Townsend? You're not okay.

84
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,440
You got the inner ear fucking monitor.
So you protecting your hearing. Okay.

85
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,590
You're not, you know, uh,

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
nobody's blowing up a drum set and part
of the fucking drum set goes right into

87
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:09,200
your fucking ear. Okay? Nobody's getting
crushed at your fucking concerts.

88
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:13,590
They've worked all of that
out. You know? Sorry. See,

89
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,530
and then I go right back to
the grumpy old man. I'm just,

90
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,940
I'm trying to give the kid a copies.
Fucking really talented.

91
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:24,320
He can actually really
sick. Um, so anyways,

92
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,710
and then I was listening the other
dude, what the fuck's his name? Uh, I,

93
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,011
for the life of me,

94
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,760
I don't understand why I can't just
download shit and then just find it.

95
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,880
And every fucking time it goes back
to the album thing. I, I could,

96
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,410
when they just list the songs,

97
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,950
I don't need to see the
picture of the album.

98
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,160
Every time this happens, I forget how to
do it. Oh, okay. Artists' songs. They are,

99
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,180
we go, um, oh. And speaking of which on,

100
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,470
um, everybody was, uh,

101
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,930
sending a bunch of each week when I do
the Thursday, uh, Thursday afternoon,

102
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,690
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. You know,

103
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:10,060
when we go into the greatest
hits of the Monday morning,

104
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:13,600
podcast is always a little musical
interlude. I do not pick that music.

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,890
That's Andrew Feminists.

106
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,840
And then he posts on the Twitter
site what the name of the music is.

107
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,960
So last week it was snarky puppy.
Okay.

108
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,910
That's who the fuck it was the posted
every week. Just fucking look it up.

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,900
All right. At the Mlm podcast
or some shit. I forget what the,

110
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:35,170
I don't know what the Twitter account is.
What am I going to fall on myself?

111
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,500
Um, anyways, plowing ahead.

112
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,470
So Friday night, oh, freckles.

113
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,730
I took a night off from
stand up. All right. Friday,

114
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,740
that's a big night to take a night off.
That's like not showing up thanksgiving,

115
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,870
you know, if you'd like to eat, you know.

116
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,871
So I went down to the Wiltern theater
and a with Andrew and I saw mute math and

117
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:03,340
they will fucking, unbelievable
cannot. I tweeted, I couldn't,

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,190
I cannot overstate how great
a fucking show that was.

119
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,310
And I wish I remember the name of the
opening band too. They were all so great,

120
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,930
but we're just killed me was,
I had never been to a show like that,

121
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,610
like whatever that style of music is,

122
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,290
I don't even know what
the style of music is,

123
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,820
but I'm just going from,
you know,

124
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,220
the Shit I've been listening
to for 30 years straight.

125
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,180
All right.
Wow.

126
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,270
Can Bajas Bhavin in cars.
Right.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,440
I listened to say I listened to this same
90 songs for 30 fucking years in a row.

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,580
MMM. Never wanted to be that guy. So
just go into those, seeing those bands,

129
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,630
just how they use guitar,
where it's more used full,

130
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:51,790
like mood where,
but when I was growing up,

131
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,360
like the guitar was like the Dick
that got thrown on the table, right.

132
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,330
Just slaps you right in the face with it.
There was always the lead singer,

133
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:59,860
and then you had the guitar,
God,

134
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,300
and then the fucking dude playing rhythm
guitar who was not appreciated until at

135
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:07,450
least 25 years into that band's career.
You know,

136
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,170
like Malcolm young really
didn't get his props until,

137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,160
until like the mid nineties I feel
Brad Whitford, same fucking thing.

138
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,540
You know, Ronnie Wood, all of these
guys just playing rhythm guitar,

139
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,550
holding the whole fucking thing together.
Right?

140
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:25,350
And they don't get shit for
the longest fucking time. Um,

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,890
Jesus Christ, Butte, math live man,
they're fucking unreal. So by the way,

142
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,800
they're playing Portland,
Oregon tonight. That's Monday,

143
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,380
depending on when you listen to
this Tuesday, they're in Seattle,

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,530
then they're off for a week, and then they
start back up again in Richmond. If a,

145
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,390
you get a chance to see them.
Um,

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,550
you will not be disappointed and
if you're an old fuck like me,

147
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:49,720
they were a great band to go see to
try to bring you into the modern era.

148
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,390
You know, if you're
listening to this, come on.

149
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,490
You can't tell me somebody is
a little bit younger than me.

150
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:59,740
You haven't been listening to that
fucking Pearl Jam record 10. You know,

151
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,470
whether all giving each other the
high five, the big Bro Picture.

152
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,300
We're all in this together.
All right.

153
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,200
Um, if you can't tell me that
you haven't been listened to it,

154
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:13,990
how many times are you going
to Dreher about her age?

155
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,400
Yay.

156
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,940
Oh,
fucking 25 years later.

157
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm not saying don't have a
listen to it again, right? Look,

158
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,030
you can do whatever the fuck you want,

159
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:31,340
but I never wanted to be that guy
going [inaudible] it's him. You check.

160
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,500
Right then going into my house.
Babba dup, bup, bup, bup.

161
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,160
Betty [inaudible] bull ride going in
there and doing the fucking jitter bug.

162
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,240
That makes said that Jeff Beck is playing
the Hollywood bowl and I have to see

163
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,590
that guy.
He's like 70.

164
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,460
He's buddy guy is opening up and there's
no fucking way I'm going to miss that.

165
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,230
Um, you know, guys, one of
the greatest, he is the guy,

166
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,070
you know, I think from that whole
fucking error other than Jimi Hendrix,

167
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,491
I thought,
yeah,

168
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:03,430
I think you've got to give it to
Jeff back right now out of my mind.

169
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,370
I'm sure there's some black guy out
there that I'm forgetting. You know,

170
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,380
who got stolen from budgets as far as
white dudes who listened to black dudes

171
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,270
and then reshaped it. Right. I think
you've got to give it to that guy.

172
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,940
No. Well, you know, it's just my opinion.
You don't got to get fucking upset by it.

173
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,460
So anyways, what I'm obsessed with right
now as far as like the drummer, Darren k,

174
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,240
the guy's fucking insane.
And it was funny cause um,

175
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,910
you know,
Andrew got to know those guys,

176
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:38,590
so I got to go backstage and meet
him briefly. And uh, you know,

177
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:41,740
after the show they were going, hey, did
you learn anything watching our drummer?

178
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,660
And I was just like,
no.

179
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,030
And I heard that Darren goes,
ahhh. Like, I didn't mean it.

180
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
I hope I didn't come off in an
insulting way. It's like, dude,

181
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,030
Ikea too fucking far beyond anything
that I'm doing watching him.

182
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,620
It was like watching like Keith,

183
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:01,180
it was like Keith Moon playing drum and
base and then they have this sick ass

184
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:05,800
fucking light show going on. And I was
just sitting there squinting watching,

185
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:08,390
just going like, wow, what is he doing?

186
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,580
I ain't no fucking clue.
Um,

187
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,110
I did take one video while that
while they were playing, cause I,

188
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,590
I th this coolest,
you know,

189
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:23,290
the iPhone is and how great
the video is and everything.

190
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,050
I just fucking hate like being,

191
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,180
it's something and then just
sitting there filming it,

192
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:30,910
like I'm working for CBS
nightly news or some shit.

193
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,520
It's like I want to stand here
and I want to take this in.

194
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,840
There's enough other concierge
like filming this shit.

195
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,950
I can watch this. It'll be on the
internet forever. Right. So anyways,

196
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,670
there's this song clipping
that they play and

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,430
I had no idea what he was doing. And
Andrew's going to watch what he does here.

198
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:56,431
And then he literally has like two sticks
and a two drumsticks in his right hand

199
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,050
and he's playing,
this is going to be some drum geek shit.

200
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:03,170
So you might want to pass through this.
He's put bait as far as I can tell,

201
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:07,150
he's basically playing 68th
note, triplets, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah. Two to two,

202
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,960
two to the three to four,
right. But he's only,

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,430
he's playing like he's doing
it with two sticks in one hand.

204
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,100
So the one on top sit in
the top of the high hat.

205
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,820
The one underneath is hitting the
bottom of the high end. So up top. What?

206
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,850
He's really just, he's playing like every
other note of the tripled. Like dot, dot,

207
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:28,020
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
That uh, but he gets to, as
he's bringing that stick up,

208
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:32,250
the one underneath hits it. So that's
how he gets the full 16th note. Right?

209
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,330
Sorry. I know this is really nerdy
shit. And then with his left hand,

210
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,080
he's basically ghosting the offbeat and,

211
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,250
and then play in the backbeat on
two and four. And then dragon,

212
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,000
I believe on the final note of a,

213
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,940
the triplet into one.
That's what he's doing now.

214
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,690
I know. Let's drum nerd shit,
but I'll, I'll post the video.

215
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,040
It's fucking insane. Um, so of
course I went to the, you know,

216
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,740
went down to the studio the next
day and I tried to do it, you know,

217
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,750
for like 10 minutes, you know, a,
in whatever you learned something,

218
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,310
you know,

219
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,740
the first thing you do is you immediately
try to play it at the same tempo is

220
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,320
the drum God that you saw a play in it.
So it was really fucking frustrating.

221
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,280
I think I said, what the fuck, like
10 times. And then I just, you know,

222
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,880
just scroll through my Ipod,
iPad, whatever, my five
phone and I just, hey ma'am.

223
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:33,030
And just playing in the same shit of
him playing two for 30 fucking years.

224
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,390
I don't know what my deal is.
I can't get out of it.

225
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,640
Thank God I buy new clothes.
You know, if you should be like,

226
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:47,200
you should be forced to wear the clothes.
If you don't move ahead artistically,

227
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,460
your wardrobe shouldn't either. You
should be forced to fucking wear the same.

228
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,110
I should be wearing an acid wash jeans
with a fucking half shirt driving down

229
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:59,080
the street, my rusted out 83 Ford
Ranger. And they'd be like, listen,

230
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:03,610
if you're not going to progress with
the art of music, Yo, or whatever,

231
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,800
if you can watch the same
10 fucking films. Um, yeah,

232
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:13,360
I had no idea how far
behind I was. Um, so,

233
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,890
and I'm looking at mute math,

234
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,870
like they haven't been fucking
crushing it for 10 years.

235
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:18,680
I actually went on the Internet and
I looked them up and they liked,

236
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,570
did let them in 2005. There you go, Bill.

237
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,880
Wait to be on the cutting edge.

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,310
So whenever I feel like I
took a major step forward,

239
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:34,240
but I want to thank everyone
in the band for uh, you know,

240
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,720
letting us come back and say hello real
quick. Uh, Darrin, Paul, Roy and Todd,

241
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,880
you guys were fucking,
you crushed it.

242
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,600
And thank you to Andrew for
taking me down there and, uh,

243
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,020
pointing out what the fuck was
going on so I could, you know,

244
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,020
so the old man could
figure it out. But, uh,

245
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:54,280
I will definitely see those whenever I'm
in a city that they're in and I'm able

246
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:56,290
to do what it was that good of
a fucking show. And like I said,

247
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,820
they're in Portland then Seattle,

248
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,510
and they got a week off than
they were now Richmond. So, uh,

249
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,330
definitely check it out.
Anyways, plowing ahead here.

250
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,520
Um, so that was my Friday.
All right. So as a comedian,

251
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:11,530
there's no way you take a Friday,

252
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:16,530
Saturday off unless the UFC has a
fucking paper view and it's caught on.

253
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,880
And a Holly Holm at fighting, right.
So I'm like, all right, I got to watch.

254
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,140
I thought they were both title fights.

255
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:25,600
I didn't realize that Connor's
fight was not a title fight.

256
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:29,200
I think most people didn't realize that
most people like me got drawn into a

257
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,710
sport when there's someone like his,
you know, I go in and out of the UFC,

258
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,380
you know, like most shit.
I go in and out of cooking,

259
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,280
I go in and out of being a good comedian.
I've just, I'm in an APP, right?

260
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,020
I'm a fucking gem. And I, I'm into it.
I'm into it. Go Fuck Yourself. Hey,

261
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:47,590
remember that shit? And then I come
back. Right. Except with my music,

262
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:51,640
I just held onto it for just the
little, the little teeth, you know,

263
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,510
you can't always get what you well,
um,

264
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,820
what am I talking about? Anyways?
So we have a bunch of people over,

265
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,160
right? We go out, I go to the grocery
store, I get a bunch of, I get some booze.

266
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,810
I get, yeah, get some Gaba. Woo.
I guess some fucking Aig by war.

267
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,560
I get some fucking cheese and
all of that shit. I, I go on,

268
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:18,100
I get a bunch of ice cream sandwiches
after everybody's all fucking salt it up

269
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,910
with the Doritos and we sit
down to watch the shit. And, um,

270
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,220
what a fucking paper view,
man.

271
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,970
Yeah.

272
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,150
You know, spoiler alert, you know, if
you haven't heard yet, I'm going to say,

273
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:33,290
who won? I mean, you should
take beat Holly Holm,

274
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,440
you know,
and Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor.

275
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:40,480
It was fucking unreal. My, I'm in.

276
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:43,610
Anybody else hosts a UFC fight party.

277
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,450
How fucking satisfied
did you feel was unreal?

278
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:51,590
I had like 10 people screaming,
Oh my God. Over and over again.

279
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,270
Like twice in one night,
flipping the fuck out.

280
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,620
More screaming and yelling during that
pay per view that I've heard in any super

281
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:05,510
bowl. You know, I dunno. Superbowl
party that had been to in a while.

282
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,020
Um,
it was unbelievable.

283
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:12,110
But Jesus Christ once again,

284
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,990
why always hate when like when a comedian
is getting ready for a special or a

285
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,760
late night spot and they say that
they trade like a fighter at the,

286
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,420
it's so disrespectful to what the men
and women do who fight for a fucking

287
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,760
living. It is, it is the most bad ass.

288
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,470
I'm trying to think of like a more Badass
job than that, other than, you know,

289
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,200
you're one of the grunts
on the front line in a war,

290
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,280
then your fucking job is you just train
your trading to beat the fuck out of

291
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,500
somebody who's training to
beat the fuck out of you.

292
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,050
And you both are professionals.
You do it for a living.

293
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,470
A whole crowd of people shows up.
You've ever fight after school.

294
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:57,120
And like 10 people showed up was fucking
nerve wracking. Fight, fight, fight.

295
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,130
You guys walk into a
fucking arena shortlist,

296
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:04,740
just walking down there and they got
to stare down some fucking maniac.

297
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,190
I live in there, own the,
on the ground. Right?

298
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,180
And that just taken fucking elbows and
they had the presence of mind to look

299
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:15,710
over at the clock.
Like how much more of this shit I,

300
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:20,711
another minute 38 of forearms
to my fucking forehead.

301
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,410
I don't know how they take it. So, um,

302
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,060
okay.

303
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,880
Unbelievable fight. I didn't realize
that, uh, had gone up in two way classes.

304
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,390
Like I said, I'm a very like,
novice fan of this stuff. Um,

305
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,520
okay.

306
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,720
But Jesus Christ,

307
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,850
fucking Nate Diaz sitting there and his
whole face is all bloody. And he says,

308
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,330
you know, I got this, I've taken your
worst shot. She can't knock me out.

309
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,000
It's just scar tissue.
I've bled before.

310
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,950
Okay.

311
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,480
I, I dunno, I dunno how to fuck you
do that. He was bleeding so much.

312
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,630
It looked like both of them were
bleeding to death because he,

313
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:02,220
once he got up against Mcgregor, whether
it was all over both of them, um,

314
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,060
I dunno,

315
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,300
I really don't have anything to say other
than I was blown away by both fucking

316
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,640
fights and um,

317
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,390
okay.

318
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,430
You know, it was hard as it is to
what I was was to watch Conor lose.

319
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,260
Cause I mean the guy's
a fucking superstar.

320
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,110
I'm talking shit and then backing it up.
Um,

321
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,420
okay.

322
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,440
It was still, you know, watching Nate
do his choking and fucking I was,

323
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:25,670
I was fucking unreal.
I don't know.

324
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,830
I don't know enough about the sport
to talk about it intelligently,

325
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:28,940
but I will say this,

326
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:33,260
I hate when someone like Connor
loses and then everybody, yeah,

327
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,960
you fucking pussy sale that
shit on the Internet. You know,

328
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:39,230
go on Twitter and start trashing the guy.
You know,

329
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,560
I want to talk to people right now.
If you're one of those people that do to,

330
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,860
how do you,
how do you like,

331
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,100
how do you do something like that and
like look yourself in the mirror when you

332
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,350
go to brush your teeth at night,
you know no one,

333
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,720
you haven't had a fight
since like the seventh grade.

334
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,030
You know the fuck is wrong with you.
If you all talked all the fucking shit.

335
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,630
That's what it made it
great sell in the fight.

336
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,903
I Dunno.

337
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,450
How great was that fucking lies
you just knocked out. Caught him.

338
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:11,880
I would choke dot Conor McGregor. How
does it feel? He grabs the mic goes,

339
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,710
I'm not surprised motherfuckers,

340
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,313
Chris,

341
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,561
I don't know about you guys,

342
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:21,760
but it's one of the fucking coolest things
I've ever seen. The fucking choke out.

343
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:22,451
Somebody as good as,

344
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:26,800
but Gregor that stand up all fucking
bloody and just walk around. Flex it.

345
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,720
Not even wiping the blood off, not
concerned about how fucked up your faces.

346
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,480
You don't give a fuck, right? Whatever.

347
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,080
Jesus Christ. The second, I got a little
scratch, I would have just, Oh my God,

348
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:41,914
am I?

349
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,850
MMM, that was great to see me.
She, uh, Misha went to, but I, I,

350
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,890
I as, as a fellow fair skinned person,
I felt bad for Holly Holm, you know,

351
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,000
just a second. We start
getting beat on just the, the,

352
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,910
our face just gets so fucking red and
then our yellow eyebrows stand out.

353
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:06,330
I just thought there was a lot
of mean Shit said about her. Uh,

354
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,570
when it came to that, I just come
really related to it. By the way.

355
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:10,920
What the fuck happened in Nate's,

356
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:14,670
the side of his face and his neck.

357
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:15,830
Okay.

358
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,050
Those scratches.
How did that happen?

359
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,620
Like somebody took like a
fucking, okay, you've got 10.

360
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,960
We took a knife down the side
of his face and his neck.

361
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,400
He's just sitting there
pawn at it. I, that's,

362
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,410
I've gotten scratched like that
every time somebody like exhale,

363
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:35,700
just the wind of that made me
go into the fetal position. Um,

364
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,860
but anyways, you know, as great
as that UFC pay per view was,

365
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:44,430
it's what just makes me so fucking
sad about what has happened to boxing.

366
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,100
If they could somehow,
if all the pieces,

367
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,120
shit promoters in boxing could just unify
and become one piece of shit promoter,

368
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,480
you know,
promotional entity like the UFC is right.

369
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,530
Cause you know, you know, you know, have
to deal, I don't know if you, if you're,

370
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,860
if you're, if you're in any
level of show business, you know,

371
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:11,400
the promoters of fucking over the ax,
you know, they are in an, in, in UFC,

372
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,920
it's the fighters, you know, I know on
some, I don't know anything about it,

373
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:14,711
but I don't want someone it,

374
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:18,300
they are getting fucked and because
they're a complete monopoly,

375
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm sure they're fucking with their money.

376
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm sure there's a pressure to make
people fight and that type of shit,

377
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:26,760
which is why they try to break
up monopolies. Having said that,

378
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,800
it's fucking great for the fence because
can the fact that the fighters have no

379
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:36,030
other options, it's just
the best fight the best. Um,

380
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,280
okay.

381
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,980
And like last night, like I haven't
had that kind of excitement,

382
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:42,890
like watching like a boxing pay per view,

383
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,150
like consistently the way the UFC is
consistently exciting like that since I

384
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:50,390
would say the middleweight division.
Um,

385
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,440
okay.

386
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,210
In the early eighties when you
had Roberto Duran, Tommy Hearns,

387
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Marvelous Marvin Hagler and sugar
ray Leonard all fighting each other,

388
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,600
they all fought each other. They fought
each other numerous fucking times.

389
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,670
It was incredible.
Um,

390
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,810
I guess when Mike Tyson came along,

391
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:13,540
but that was just more the spectacle
of how quick was he going to just knock

392
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,400
these people out.

393
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,010
Um,
I dunno.

394
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,090
Just seeing a pay per view like that
and then seeing that it took fucking 10

395
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:26,920
years for the Mayweather Pacquiao fight
and then one of them shows up and he's

396
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,410
fucking hurt.
It doesn't say anything.

397
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,550
He doesn't say anything and you still
out 60 bucks is just fucking brutal.

398
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:35,920
So anyways,
um,

399
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,890
hats off to that fucking paper view.

400
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:41,260
Jesus Christ actually watched
some Mcgregor fight again.

401
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,053
MMM.

402
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,670
Unfucking believable.

403
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,610
I was just looking at the blood.
I'm going,

404
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:52,480
he's just going to keep fucking punching
him right in that I just keep punching

405
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:53,650
them right in that fucking,
I like,

406
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:55,870
who did that to that guy
with the fucking yellow hair.

407
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,270
Bleached hair was at fucking,

408
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,090
what the fuck was his name? GSP. I
can't even know their fucking names.

409
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:08,300
He just kept punching the dude in
the eye over and over and over.

410
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:10,170
And then it was always, I thought that
that's what my Greg was going to do.

411
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:12,750
Just keep punching native
and that fucking, I,

412
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,890
I just don't know how you doing? How's
fuck you sit there with him? I'm done.

413
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,130
Fucking done. You scratch
me. I am done. Keep fighting.

414
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,270
All right. I just keep saying
the same thing over again.

415
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:31,220
I was blown away by it and a respect to
everybody who fought there. Um, anyways,

416
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,650
uh, you know, it's weird to is
McGregor is still the champion.

417
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay.

418
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,980
I didn't know that. I thought
it, I thought, I just assumed
to feel lost. That's it,

419
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,510
right? You're not a champ
anymore. We don't have the
belt. You're always a champ.

420
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:47,140
Right. I don't want to get out of this.
I don't know anything about the sport.

421
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,230
All right, let me, uh, let me get to the
advertising that, that always saves me.

422
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,130
Where the fuck is it?

423
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,563
Yeah.

424
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, for God sakes. There it is. There.
Oh, here we go. About about Bobby Ids. Me,

425
00:24:58,601 --> 00:24:59,770
Andy's drying up.

426
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:04,510
You fucking Twat Badu to do Mondays
beyond A's is dry. Don't say that.

427
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:07,860
It's not okay. Um, Mondays,

428
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,630
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

429
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:14,230
you spend almost 24 hours
a day in your hand away.

430
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:15,850
Okay.

431
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,520
But instead of making a statement like
Superman's tights under his everyday

432
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,270
clothes, you wash your
underwear is probably boring.

433
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,860
[inaudible] is here to change
that. They're going to give
you exciting underwear.

434
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,740
Introducing male panties.
Um,

435
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,390
please include the following.
It's pronounced modal.

436
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,683
No,

437
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,370
I don't know how many times they have to
miss this before I get some decent copy.

438
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,110
All right. It's all written in
lowercase m o h Dash D. A. L.

439
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,500
It doesn't tell me which
one does to fucking stress.

440
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,240
Okay.

441
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,200
It's either modal.

442
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,220
Okay.

443
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,200
Or Madonna

444
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,693
model.

445
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,470
I was like,
no accent is that good.

446
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,670
Every pair of meundies is made from
sustainable sourced modal Madell a fabric

447
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,630
that's twice as soft as cotton.

448
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,570
Yeah.

449
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,450
Nothing can describe the fit
and feel of me undies. Oh,

450
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,220
when they get up against your balls,

451
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,030
a smile just comes across your
face like the Grinch on Christmas.

452
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,740
But once you try them on,

453
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:22,610
you're going to understand while they're
called why they are called the world's

454
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:26,900
most comfortable underwear.
Who calls him that? Why me?

455
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:31,260
UNDIES does.
Then I called the world.

456
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:34,020
They're called by you. You came up with
that and the fucking advertising, right?

457
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,990
I say when Michael Jackson just
called himself the King of Pop,

458
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm the King of Pop. No,
are you twinkle toes?

459
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,560
What else are you you a little pot

pair of me undies, they're free.

UNDIES has dozens of styles and limited
edition prints to help you make a

463

464

503

Jesus Christ, we've got three more or
we got to get over the hump here, right?

504
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:35,150
MVMT watches movement watches
was started by Michael Victor.

505
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:40,560
Michael Tango. You know what that reminds
me? Is that that new Tina Fey movie,

506
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,300
whiskey, Tango Foxtrot. Is that,

507
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,930
is that not the worst advertise
movie you've ever fucking seen?

508
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,060
It just says whiskey, tango, Foxtrot. She
stayed in there, squinting into the sun,

509
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,910
holding a note pad and there's
something on fire behind her.

510
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,980
That's it. That's all I get. You know,

511
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,190
you can't hook her up with the little
fucking descriptive description.

512
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,060
I don't know. Maybe I'm old.
Maybe that, maybe that's,

513
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,280
that's the way the kids like it. They
don't want it. They don't want it.

514
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,860
What it says, it wasn't called
out as a slug line or some shit.

515
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,870
Okay.

516
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,290
I don't know.

517
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,080
Obviously it's right next to another
fucking billboard and there's like a,

518
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,370
like three Japanese looking dudes
holding shogun warriors swords.

519
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,280
And I know what that's about.
I know roughly where it takes place.

520
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,930
You can't just squinting into the sun
holding the notepad. You know, it's like,

521
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:36,820
is she an Arizona? Is there are
V on fire in the Grand Canyon?

522
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,830
Is she in Iraq?

523
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,910
I don't know.
Maybe that's what they're supposed to do.

524
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,520
Like I'm supposed to Pique my interest
and I'm supposed to go on the Internet.

525
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:49,160
But if you're someone like me who doesn't
know how to look up Shit, you know,

526
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,420
or starts to look something up and sees
a picture of something else and then

527
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:56,180
clicks on that and then two hours
later he goes, wait a minute,

528
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:58,760
wasn't I going to look something up? And
you can't fucking remember what it was.

529
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:03,150
I'm just saying, I think she's earned
a PR. I think she earned a, you know,

530
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,480
a little more respect than that.
Right.

531
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,550
Okay.

532
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,610
Dog. She hasn't made fucking
millions in box office.

533
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:14,540
Can you fucking help her out with
maybe half a sentence? Alright.

534
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,550
MVMT watches everybody movement watches
was started by two college dropouts with

535
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:22,220
the idea to make quality watches
that don't break the bank.

536
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,820
Starting at just 95 Joe Wallace,

537

They cut off all the
bullshit retail markup.

538

Supposedly movements sent some watches
over here. Question Mark. Yeah,

send some over here? Yeah, they did.

572
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,890
his jags on or whatever the kids were
wearing nowadays. And uh, I don't know. I,

573
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:34,460
the only time I snort
is when I fucking booze.

574
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,480
So I wasn't going to do
that to the lovely Nia.

575
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,070
So I crashed upstairs and um,

576
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,710
it started thundering
and lightening at night.

577
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,770
And what's fucking hilarious about living
out here slash terrifying is it never

578
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:51,590
rains.
So when you hear thunder,

579
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,540
you automatically think it's a fucking
earthquake, but you bed isn't moving.

580
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,730
So you kind of like,
well, wait a minute, am I,

581
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,250
I've never heard an earthquake
that I couldn't feel.

582
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,070
And you've got to like do the math
when you're half asleep going like,

583
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,700
is that like an earthquake?
And you know,

584
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,980
in the valley and I can't fucking hear
it. I can hear it, but I can't feel it.

585
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,370
That that doesn't make any sense.
And then you find figure, oh my God,

586
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:18,230
that's thunder. Holy Shit. It's
fucking raining out. Right.

587
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,000
What does that in French, you split,
you'll player. I can't fucking remember.

588
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,710
I suck at that shit in edge.
It is snowing.

589
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,600
Um, anyway, so starts
fucking rating and uh,

590
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,620
it's tremendous. It's rained a bunch. It's
an El Nino year. Thank Christ. And, uh,

591
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,520
but what I was always in the depressing
thing in the back of my head is as green

592
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:46,540
and is lushes the hills.
Look right now. Um,

593
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,970
this is like basically the only rain
we're going to get for the next fucking

594
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,804
three years.

595
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,480
And I know every cunt out here has taken
long showers now going hey to folk and

596
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:00,220
droughts over, you know, I just hope, uh,

597
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,570
I dunno.
I hope it fucking rained.

598
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,760
Keeps raining as much as it possibly
fucking cans or we can't or there's a

599
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:12,260
massive God damn play gout here. One of
the other, something's got to give. Right.

600
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,350
That's depressing isn't all right,
let's get into um, oh no, wait,

601
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,390
I was gonna tell you another thing.
So yesterday I was just driving around,

602
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:23,360
hanging out with my wife and a,
they get a bunch of open houses out here,

603
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:26,000
so I can't fuck it. Let's go
look at some houses, you know,

604
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,320
get some ideas for our old ass kitchen.
See what a real kitchen looks like. Right.

605
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,840
And,
um,

606
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,200
I got to tell you haven't bought this
house and gone through all this shit that

607
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:39,180
I've gone through.
I look at houses entirely different.

608
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm immediately looking at the windows.

609
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,300
Do they have the old ass original windows?
Um,

610
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,080
and I immediately want to go downstairs
if there's a crawl space, anything,

611
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,470
I want to go down there
and I'm smelling for water.

612
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,670
And you can't really do that a lot
out here because a, they don't,

613
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:59,100
it doesn't rain enough. But I immediately
look underneath the fucking house.

614
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:02,400
I look right up it's fucking
skirt. Like the home pervert. I am.

615
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,270
And I'm immediately looking
for, all right, let's see. What,

616
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:09,960
what does the electrical work look look
like? You know, is it galvanized pipe?

617
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:14,580
What kind of Shit Hole, you know,
looking at how stuff is put together.

618
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:18,370
Does this look like it had
a permit or not? And um,

619
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,750
you know,
all the sexy shit goes away.

620
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,750
Like we have a pool and I'm
just looking at it going like,

621
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,650
and it's okay and it looks like a piece
of shit to me that looks like you need

622
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:30,720
to Redo the whole floor
of that fucking thing.

623
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,730
And so you've got to dump out all the
fucking water and evidently you can't fill

624
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:39,480
your pool up with water anymore out here.
You have to fly the fucking water in.

625
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:44,250
So fuck that pool. I haven't got it in
the house yet. You know there's a classic,

626
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,830
they're saying it's a two car garage,
but it is if you dry,

627
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:50,610
if you drive to model t Fords,
but if you have any sort of modern car,

628
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,500
you're not going to be able to get
the all, you can get two in there,

629
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,880
but nobody can get out of the cars.

630
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,220
So I was just a negative
Nelly and actually realized
that my house isn't as bad

631
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,030
as I thought it was.

632
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,850
Now that I fucking dumped every
fucking dime that I have into it. Um,

633
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,430
not made me feel good. I was just
walking in the kitchen. I'm like,

634
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,100
there's no prep space here.
All this disco shit.

635
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,530
I don't see any place where I could
fucking slice an English muffin.

636
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,440
You know what? Fuck this
kitchen. Fuck the pool.

637
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,330
Fuck the kitchen and fuck this
galvanized pipe. Oh look at this. Oh Wow.

638
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,150
Rugs, rugs in every room. Yeah. Take
your shoes off. Why is that? Yeah,

639
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:28,200
cause the floors haven't been refinished
and fucking 80 years. Fuck these floors.

640
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,520
Let's go upstairs. Oh Great. I see
this used to be an addict. Oh yeah.

641
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:34,950
You call him that an office. Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,930
I like how you're showing
it during the winter time.

643
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:40,740
Cause I know what happens in
the summertime. It fucking
heats up up here. Right.

644
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,240
It could grow a fucking goddamn bullshit
Bushel of fucking marijuana up here if

645
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:48,870
he fucking three hours.
Fuck this office. Right.

646
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,590
You want to sign up on
our mailing list now?

647
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,710
I don't because you're selling
piece of shit houses. And then that,

648
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,870
that said I walked and I was done.

649
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,030
And of course I upset my wife
cause all I did was just, sorry,

650
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,550
I actually only just shut off
the fucking recorder. I actually,

651
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:08,790
I upset my wife because, you know,
she's like, I like, you know,

652
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,860
I thought we could just have fun.

653
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:15,240
I don't understand why you have to go
in the house and be rude to the real

654
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:19,480
estate people say I don't
like those people. You know,

655
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,530
cause they don't encourage you
to sell your house, you know,

656
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,930
air quote for a fucking profit.

657
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:29,220
So then you can buy back into the same
market and then everything you just made

658
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,180
on your house,
you've got to buy it.

659
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:32,820
You got to spend again just
to get the same fucking house.

660
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,000
I actually said that to the guy. I think
that's, that's made my wife met and I go,

661
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:39,280
yeah, the only people making money
out of here are you in the banks.

662
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,150
And the guy's like, whoa. Well that's
not necessarily true. Yeah. Do the math.

663
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,680
Tell me how that works.
Can we get you to the mailing list?

664
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,470
Um, all right, let's let
some fucking questions here.

665
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,350
Questions here for the Goddamn Week.
Casco,

666
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,750
Casco say mall something, right? What is,

667
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,240
what does,
I don't fucking know.

668
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,483
Guess could tell.

669
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,480
I'm just never going to get it.
You know what? I don't, I just,

670
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,570
there's no reason for me to speak it.
All right, let's, let's plow ahead here.

671
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:17,710
All right. Um, the March 3rd podcast,

672
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,060
fucking brilliant podcast yesterday,
March, March 3rd, 2016. Thank you.

673
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,970
One of the very best,
and I've heard hundreds of your podcast.

674
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,510
Nobody drowns in their own vomit
anymore. Great Brain, dude.

675
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,310
Thank you Greg and hamburger. Let me
know if you're coming over here. Well,

676
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:34,600
that's not a fucking question.

677
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,513
Yeah,

678
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,700
it's just a con. Yeah. We don't compliment
this questions. That's it. Well,

679
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:45,090
thank you. I'm going to be doing Germany
hopefully towards the end of the year.

680
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,970
I'm definitely getting over
there. All right. Um, okay.

681
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,500
Guy who invented the invented email

682
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,013
died.

683
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,530
He said Uncle Freddy died.
Uncle Freddy. Hey Bill,

684
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:03,190
I'm sending you an email about the
guy who invented email dying today.

685
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,200
This is my way of honoring what he did.

686
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,230
I imagine he'll get very little
press because Nancy just say,

687
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,520
no.
Reagan died this weekend too.

688
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,350
Here's an article from an here's an
excerpt from an article, uh, about him.

689
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,920
Internet Hall of Famer raid.
Tom Wilson has died.

690
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,270
Tom Olson was the man who basically
invented email as we know it today,

691
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,510
including making the choice to use
the at sign in an email address.

692
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,320
He was 74 years old. Tomlinson,
I think I said his name wrong,

693
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:35,801
the first time.

694
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:40,690
Tomlinson invented email assistant
where a user on one network could send a

695
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:45,691
message to someone on the another network
in 1971 oh they left some of it out of

696
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:49,600
there. Thomason invented
a network. I mean,

697
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,130
I'm going to read it the way I see
it. Tomlinson or Tom Wilson, however,

698
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:57,160
I feel like reading
Tomlinson invented email,

699
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:01,810
a system where it user on one network
could send a message to someone on another

700
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:03,820
network while the government,

701
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,740
advertisers and hackers could all
read your private information.

702
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,610
This was invented in 1971 had Tomlinson
had any idea what people were going to

703
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:18,160
do with his invention.
What do you have made it?

704
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,050
What do you have invented it and the
answer is of course he would of how else

705
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:27,640
was he going to get some pussy?
All right. This was his slug like,

706
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,750
Hey, can you meet my fucking
friend Tomlinson over here?

707
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,260
I don't want to beat him that
he invented email. Oh my God.

708
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,170
Hey you
can I touch your peepee?

709
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,150
Um,
that's actually really interesting.

710
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,910
There's Internet Hall of famers.
Now I have to look that up.

711
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:54,410
Who's in the Internet Hall of fame?
Jesus Christ. I want to see images too.

712
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,300
I want to see what the fuck these
people look like. Internet Hall of fame.

know this. This is fucking awesome.

716
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,010
Internet Hall of fame.

717
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,720
Paul vixy internet piracy will

718
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,040
All right, here we go. Here's
a list. Here's a list of who.

719
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,400
Who is it? All right.
Here's some of the pioneers,

720
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:34,120
so look at these fucking
eggheads. Jesus Christ. Wow.

721
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,570
Wow.
Oh my God.

722
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,550
If I could do a fucking
screenshot of this, I got to
put the link up here. My God.

723
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,940
What is it about being
super smart and just,

724
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,060
I guess everybody gets one gift. I'll
tell these people. This is a rough one.

725
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:59,140
You know there's a lot of fucking lonely
prom nights on this page. All right,

726
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,780
Douglas Engelbart and he's as good
looking as that fucking name. Oh,

727
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,200
he looks like a sweet old man.

728
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:09,340
Let's see what this
guy doggy Jesus Christ,

729
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:14,341
he's got the old man face in 1963 Dr.
Angle bars founded the augmentation

730
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,190
research center lab at SRS.
Yeah.

731
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,620
So how do you tell a woman that that's
your dream and she's not going to glaze

732
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:26,540
over. Try doing that while that. Fuck it.

733
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,840
I can't feel my face when I'm with you.

734
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,610
I said I want to start the
augmentation research center lab.

735
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,540
Where are you going?
Um,

736
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,080
where he pioneered a system for augmenting
human intellect in which workers

737
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:49,841
sitting at display workstations could
collaborate on solutions to humanity's

738
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:53,840
problems through a vast
online information space.

739
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,040
Okay.

740
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,220
Did, did it matter that no
one ever fucking uses it?

741
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,340
Look at this guy. He fucking
the, see this is what all these,

742
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,710
these guys are off and
all these men and women,

743
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,360
their heart's in the right fucking place.

744
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:12,390
And then these fucking lunatics in these
corporations see sociopath's get their

745
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:16,510
fucking manicured fingers on these things.

746
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,940
All right, Susan Astrada you could tell
she was a looker back in the day. Got It.

747
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:23,870
Been all these guys fucking
jerked off to her, Huh?

748
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,370
When she came around the
fucking augmentation lab,

749
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,400
Susan area. Um, this
is probably why she's,

750
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,170
this is probably the woman,
why they're there. She was,

751
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,630
this woman here was probably the
inspiration for the fucking, uh,

752
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,160
virtual reality sex suit that
they're trying to work on.

753
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:45,060
A strata founded c e r f Surf Net,

754
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,810
one of the original regional IP networks
in 1988 surf net serves the academic

755
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:53,640
and commercial communities in California.

756
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,150
I still don't even know what
it is as an executive director,

757
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:01,170
she took the initial national science
foundation funding two point $8 million

758
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:04,470
and grew the network from 25
sites to hundreds of sites.

759
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,270
I don't know what it does.

760
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,760
Okay.

761
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,240
All right. Let's, let's
look at this. Look,

762
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:14,241
Dennis Jennings Sky looks like a fucking
NFL ref from 1958 as the first program

763
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:21,060
director for networking at the
u s National Science Foundation.

764
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:26,061
Dr. Jennings was responsible for the
design and the development of NSF net

765
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,293
program.

766
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,610
Yeah.

767
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:34,140
No way he did that. I have no idea what
in these fucking people did. Come on, man.

768
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,340
It's trying to find somebody. Looks for,
okay, this guy's not a bad looking guy.

769
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,940
Oh yes he is. He is. And
he's got a full head of hair,

770
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:45,520
but you can just see he's a spazz.
You know,

771
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:48,970
he's one of those guys seemed sorta cool
until he starts laughing. I like, yeah,

772
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:50,651
I'm all right.

773
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:55,651
Eric Beano Beano cocreated with fellow
Internet Hall of Famer Marc Andreessen,

774
00:45:56,231 --> 00:46:01,231
the first version of the mosaic web
browser in 1993 I think I've kind of know

775
00:46:01,631 --> 00:46:05,320
what that is. Alright. You know what?
And with that, and I'm fucking bored.

776
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:09,360
Just like the chicks walking away
from these people at the blah. Um,

777
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:10,930
yeah.

778
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,010
Internet Hall of Famer. Well, you know
what moment of silence for Ray Tomlinson.

779
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,000
Okay.

780
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
His heart was in the right place.

781
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,890
Who knew that pedophiles
would use his invention

782
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,350
to send pictures and shit. All right.
From Scotland, dear Billy, big dicks.

783
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,530
I've had been,

784
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:34,530
I've been working flat out and work back
in Scotland and now taking a three week

785
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:42,150
vacation in the u s I'm 27 years old
and have never been across the pond.

786
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,010
So this is a big deal for me.
Well, welcome a chance to see you

787
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,260
nutcases up close and personal.
I'm Planning Vegas,

788
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:57,210
Death Valley and Grand Canyon to see some
outdoor epicness then onto Chicago to

789
00:46:57,211 --> 00:47:00,950
see the black hawks wiped the floor
with the flyers. Wow, man. That's,

790
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,670
that sounds like a great trip.
Then Paddy's Day. Oh boy. Um,

791
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:10,080
then New York City to
pop my weed. Sherry. Um,

792
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:14,040
to a first timer in the u s what
would be your top three things to do?

793
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,860
I would really appreciate
the advice. Alaska. Fuck
yourself. You're big Nancy boy.

794
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,930
Okay. The three things I would do. Well,

795
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:29,340
I mean you're kind of doing, you're
doing some amazing shit. Alright.

796
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,090
Defi if I was coming to America,
what would I do?

797
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,100
Okay,

798
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,790
dude, I live here. I don't know what
the fuck to do. That's like, you know,

799
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,920
you never know what the touristy
shit is to do when you're,

800
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,230
you're telling you to your own place.
You take it for granted.

801
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,660
Like when I lived in New York,
I never went to this.

802
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:47,500
I went to the Statue of Liberty once
I went, when my grandmother visited,

803
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,810
you know, I didn't do any of that shit.
I was just trying to get to work. Um,

804
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,900
all right. If I had to pick three
cities, I would do a shit. Only three.

805
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:00,960
Okay.

806
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,320
All right. You got to go to
New York. I would say Chicago,

807
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,570
but you get enough New York with Chicago.

808
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,560
I would see San Francisco and then
you'd have to do something down south.

809
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,830
Um, you know, just to get, I don't know,

810
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,860
you'd get both coasts and then you get
down south there and all of those are

811
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:22,830
their own fucking worlds.
What would I do? I don't know.

812
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,180
Going on a black hawks
game is fucking great. Um,

813
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,160
yeah,

814
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,640
dude. You know what? You stumped
me. I don't know what I would do.

815
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:35,180
I would go to New York like you're going
to do and I would fucking do as much

816
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:39,020
shit as I can. You can't miss
there. That was a nice vague answer.

817
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,550
Um,
the fuck would you do?

818
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,590
I don't know.
I live here.

819
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:52,010
I don't know what the fuck would I
do if I went to Scotland. Go ahead.

820
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:55,640
Gimme gimme your mushy p ideas.
I guess I would, I would go to,

821
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,780
I go to a rugby game. I think you know
something. If you're going somewhere,

822
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:02,060
you have way more ideas and
the person who's living there,

823
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,420
I can't believe I can't think of
anything to do. I, you know what?

824
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:09,970
I go to a fucking steak house.
You know what?

825
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:12,820
I would definitely indulge in the
fucking cuisine over here. There we go.

826
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:16,340
I'm getting my foot in here. All
right. You go into a hockey game.

827
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:20,050
I'd go to a sporting event or
any sort of fucking basketball,

828
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:24,490
anything you could see if he can go
see the fucking golden state warriors.

829
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,880
They one of the Becka regular
season records of all time.

830
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,890
If you can take in a fucking show,
go see mute mass for fuck sakes. Um,

831
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,330
I dunno what I would do, dude,
I'd go down south, right?

832
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:44,650
I go to a fucking gun range. Do
something like that. You want,

833
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,930
this is what you want to do.
You want to do some metropolitan shit,

834
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,410
you want to do some sports shit and
then you got to do some backward,

835
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,500
backward shit. That's
what I would do. You know,

836
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:58,690
go find somebody drinking some moonshine
out of a fucking jar, a mason jar,

837
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:59,141
and then,
you know,

838
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:02,620
have him fucking smoke a God damn pork
shoulder and go out and shoot his guns.

839
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,950
They go ride some four wheelers,
you know,

840
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,780
do something like that. I Dunno, you know,
a lot of people sleep on like Wyoming,

841
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:15,100
Montana, the Dakotas. Those
can all be fun to go see.

842
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:18,700
And I can send you guys live in
that little ass country, you know,

843
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,973
I dunno dude.

844
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,730
I'd ran a fucking classic American car
and we now went from fucking New York to

845
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,490
Chicago. I would drive that and
I wouldn't take the highways.

846
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,420
I try to find some old route and I'd stop
off the greasy spoons. Sammy, you go.

847
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,870
There we go. Jesus. I, there's a
couple of ideas. I'm sorry dude.

848
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,440
I really fucked you over on that.
Went butter.

849
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,183
I don't know.

850
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,270
That's like when somebody,

851
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,210
you remember back in the day when
you actually shopped, you know,

852
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:47,670
you bought CD's and stuff.

853
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,460
I used to have all these CD's I'd want
to buy and then when I would walk into

854
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:53,850
virgin, I can never remember what
the fuck I wanted. I'm sorry man.

855
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:56,840
I really dropped the ball on that one.
All right. To a first timer in the EU.

856
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,780
That's not it. Uh, podcast got me
in trouble with fiance's family.

857
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:06,620
Uh, hey there. Billary Berm Clinton. Um,

858
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,840
I fucked up man. And she can
probably guess from the subject line.

859
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,310
Okay.

860
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:15,570
Cue The old Jj.
Um,

861
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,990
as a little background, I'm getting
married next month to my fiance,

862
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:21,390
who is wonderful love
of my life and all that.

863
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,690
We were visiting her family last
night and playing board games,

864
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:29,280
which we often do. Oh, Jesus. Oh,
what happened? Were you drinking?

865
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,660
Did you get competitive? Huh?
Gee accuse her mom of cheating.

866
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,120
Uh, he goes, I'll spare you the details,

867
00:51:36,121 --> 00:51:38,880
but we were playing a card game
with a bunch of characters.

868
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,920
Everyone gets the same people,

869
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,390
but when you use them is
really the key to the game.

870
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,490
There was a particularly powerful card I
had held onto until the very last stage

871
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:54,720
of the game.
The character's name was granny water.

872
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,263
MMM.

873
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,280
Pronounce Gary Water.

874
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:03,630
I gave you the pronunciation and accent
so you wouldn't fuck it up. Well,

875
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:07,610
it is spelled w a t a granny.
Why?

876
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,830
It's the last round of the
game and everyone's going
around revealing their card.

877
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,620
I was last and my plan
had worked perfectly.

878
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,740
As I went to reveal it,

879
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:24,330
my inner bill bird took over and I really
got excited. I flipped it over. Oh,

880
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:28,890
you did it? He goes, oh
no. Oh No. He goes, I said,

881
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,330
it's granny.

882
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,813
Yeah,

883
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,510
Dude. You drop the F bomb. Oh my God,

884
00:52:39,511 --> 00:52:44,070
I wish I had podcast tee
shirts. I'd send one to you. No,

885
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:48,150
you did. He goes, silence followed
as it echoed through the house.

886
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,630
My fiance's family were stunned.

887
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,690
They're not super uptight people,

888
00:52:54,691 --> 00:52:58,650
but people just don't just don't throw
fucks around during a board game.

889
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:03,600
You know, from there it only got worse.
My fiance is listened to your podcast,

890
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:05,730
so she knows I was imitating you.

891
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,070
She tried to stammer out an explanation
or no, she had to explain a way,

892
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:12,000
your behavior.

893
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,560
Ah Dude.

894
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:21,240
He goes, but it didn't really do anything.
I also tried to apologize sheepishly.

895
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,990
Then on top of that,
that move gave me enough points,

896
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,470
win the game over everyone.

897
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,490
So I had to awkwardly mark my score,
which made me the winner.

898
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,573
Wow,
dude.

899
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,210
Oh,
when you're getting married next month,

900
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:41,170
so the fucking taste of this is still
going to be in their mouth. He goes,

901
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:45,610
we left almost immediately after and of
course I got yelled at all the way home.

902
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,610
I knew I deserved it,
so I didn't even put up much of a fight.

903
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:53,050
That's your first good move in
this story. Oh Wow. He goes,

904
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:58,000
my question is do I try and go out of
my way to remedy this situation or do I

905
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,670
just hope everyone forgets
about it and moves on?

906
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,620
We're getting married in six weeks,

907
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:05,600
so it's not like I can avoid
them for very long, um,

908
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,740
perse because I fucking
crush the impression too.

909
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,760
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.

910
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:17,170
Sorry for the Hillary Clinton referencing
the opener. I think she's a cunt to, uh,

911
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,630
I don't think she's a contract.
Just don't think she's an honest person.

912
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,380
And I don't think just because of
the fact that we've never had a woman

913
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:28,770
president that that's reason enough to
elect someone is dishonest and as phony

914
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:34,060
as her. Um, anyways, though,
you know what, I would,

915
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,180
I would actually, uh, without your wife.

916
00:54:37,181 --> 00:54:40,270
I would just drive over there and
just say, listen, I got to apologize.

917
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,560
I listened to this podcast.
I'm a big fan of the guy. Um,

918
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,950
I was making a joke and in the moment
I didn't realize that you guys didn't

919
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:52,000
listen to the podcast if you want
and just kept queue up a clip. Well,

920
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:54,750
you have it, which might be
a bad thing to do, but like,

921
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,860
just have me like saying something else,
doctor cabbies,

922
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:02,980
easy shave butter. But then you might
be fuck, cause I don't say fuck.

923
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,853
MMM.

924
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:09,170
Just say, just tell him you're
really embarrassed or whatever.

925
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:11,780
I think if you went over there
by yourself, I think, uh,

926
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,240
especially her dad,
cause I think that's the big one there.

927
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,530
I think there's, there's something
extra when it's, you know,

928
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:27,730
it's always extra, you know, when,
when you're getting married like a,

929
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:28,930
okay.

930
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,710
You know, if you're a guy, you know the,

931
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,330
the dad's going to be looking at you
twice as hard and the mom, she'll be like,

932
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:39,640
oh, he's no, it's relax. You know? And
then the other way around is if, you know,

933
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:41,830
they have a son and he
brings it a woman around,

934
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,770
like the mother's going to be fucking
looking at her to see if she's a fucking,

935
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,460
you know, an evil little whore. You know,

936
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,000
the dad's going to be looking at you like,

937
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:53,440
cause this guy going to be overbearing
and slap my fucking daughter. Right.

938
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,340
Or whatever. You know what I mean? See a
piece of shit. Right. Um, oh my God, dude.

939
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:03,360
Wow. You said it's granny. Fuck.

940
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:10,420
Oh God, dude, if you film that, oh my God.

941
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,490
Yeah.

942
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:17,380
Jesus Christ. Dude, I got to
give it. I got it. My tip of
the cap for you there, man,

943
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:19,120
for doing that.
Holy Shit.

944
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,730
I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking
about that. Well, can I, I'll apologize.

945
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:29,731
Can I apologize to your fiance
for being a bad fucking a bad,

946
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:33,850
um, influence. Hey, you know what? Play
this to a play this tea a year, a year.

947
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:38,530
Future inlaws dear future in
laws. Hello. I'm bill burr.

948
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:40,060
I'm the one who says granny.

949
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,780
I say this type of stuff. I've been
the bad influence. Don't be mad at him.

950
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:50,920
I'm sure he's a wonderful human being.
I'm sorry. Messed up. He messed up.

951
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:54,760
You're a little kid game there. Um, yeah,

952
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,340
he's going to make a great son in law.
You know why? Cause he uses Dr cabbies.

953
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,850
Easy. Shame. Don't play that to them.

954
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:06,340
That's not going to get you into anything
that's going to say he listens to

955
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:10,390
morons. He must be a moron. Are they
going to have half a moron kid? All right.

956
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,740
Not eating birthday cake.

957
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:17,530
Huge fan of the podcast is a 27 year
old who works in a stereotypical white

958
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:20,080
collar suburban office.
I thoroughly enjoy,

959
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:24,240
listen to you by your biweekly
rants at my desk. Wonderful man. Uh,

960
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,203
speaking of which,

961
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:29,560
I work in the corporate offices of a
sales and distribution company that has

962
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:31,000
about 50 employees,

963
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,290
but only about 15 people work
in my specific office location,

964
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,940
which means that about once every
motherfucking month we gather in the big

965
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:44,650
conference room and do the cliche
awkward office Happy Birthday Song.

966
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:49,090
Oh No. With candles and cake
routine and all of that.

967
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,650
What I am by, no me. Okay. Well
I am by no means a health nut.

968
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:57,670
I also try very hard to take care of
my body during the workday by eating

969
00:57:57,671 --> 00:57:59,740
properly and drinking lots of water.

970
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:04,000
I've also gotten really into
bike racing over the past years,

971
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,620
which has taught me a lot about the
importance of nutrition, etc. Uh,

972
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:11,950
so the thought of eating a giant piece
of chocolate cake at two 30 in the

973
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:15,700
afternoon when my eyes are pre practically
bleeding from staring at a computer

974
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:16,534
screen all day,

975
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:21,190
we do nothing but make me
feel like absolute shit and
I really have no interest.

976
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,340
Very smart. Uh, this is why
for the past couple of years,

977
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:28,240
I politely turned down every piece of
birthday cake that has been offered to me

978
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:31,240
at these after mentioned ceremonies.
Unfortunately,

979
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:32,890
I am the only one at my coworkers,

980
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:37,300
most of whom are women who has
adopted this no cake philosophy.

981
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:38,740
So every single time I stick,

982
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,790
I stick out like a sore thumb after I
declined the piece that is passed to me,

983
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,260
at which point I have to deal with this
wave of passive aggression from these

984
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:52,261
ladies regarding my decision to
abstain from the sacred ritual.

985
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,570
I also share a birthday
with one of my coworkers.

986
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:58,810
So I am spared some of the awkwardness
that goes along with from fusing cake on

987
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:02,560
my own birthday, but still made
out to be some kind of monster.

988
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,680
Okay, Jesus going on and on here. Well,

989
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:09,370
I have no intention of succumbing to
the peer pressure brought forth by my

990
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:09,911
colleagues.

991
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:13,360
This might be the best written fucking
letter I've ever had on the podcast.

992
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:17,350
Is it possible that I'm being rude
by not sharing in the celebration?

993
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,650
What's more is that even if I found out
people did that I was being douchey by

994
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:26,130
not eating cake, I still wouldn't
give a shit what they think.

995
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,520
Does this make me a
sociopath? No, it doesn't.

996
00:59:29,521 --> 00:59:33,060
It makes you somebody who knows what he
wants and everybody else's do you know,

997
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:35,640
you just, you just get, you know what you,

998
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:39,360
you need to just get a little space here.
A couple of little verbal,

999
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,020
you know,
you know,

1000
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,460
you know the great ones create space
and all, you know, football, hockey,

1001
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,710
basketball. You don't have to do that
baseball. But you know what I mean?

1002
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:52,740
The great ones create space.
Okay?

1003
00:59:52,741 --> 00:59:55,980
So what you have to do is you have to
tap into your greatness and you have to

1004
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,790
create space. Okay? And
just say, look, people,

1005
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,640
it's not that I'm not happy
that it's your birthday.

1006
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:08,100
I just don't want to become a lard
ass. I mean, I'm not being a dick here,

1007
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:11,700
but you know a lot of you,
I'm not gonna say who over the years,

1008
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,600
your slacks just keep getting bigger
because you keep eating all this fucking

1009
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,400
cake.
All right?

1010
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,380
You blowing out your bodies and I'm not
going to be a part of it and a part of

1011
01:00:22,381 --> 01:00:24,540
me dies every time I watch
you guys eat in this shit.

1012
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,240
But if that's what you want to do,
by all means go ahead and do it.

1013
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:31,800
But I'm not going to become a fucking
cow like most of you guys are.

1014
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:36,200
You know what I mean? Half of you should
have bells around you fucking next.

1015
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,250
Alright, there you go. You
just know, right? They'll
never ask you for cake again.

1016
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,740
You probably want to get invited,
you know,

1017
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,900
that's what fucking a, this was
Sydney Crosby would do. Right.

1018
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:49,860
Okay.

1019
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:54,540
Mario Lemieux the great ones
to create space. No, dude,

1020
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:57,330
you're not a sociopath, right? You're
doing the right thing, you know,

1021
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,200
I dunno. I Dunno why women like
sweet so much. You know, I actually,

1022
01:01:04,201 --> 01:01:07,880
I like sweets. I'm just
a big fruit basket. Um,

1023
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,910
I actually like sweets,
but when I stay away from him for awhile,

1024
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,240
if you really abstained from
fucking desserts and everything,

1025
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:18,090
if you walk into a place that
has a bunch of crazy desserts,

1026
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:22,140
it doesn't even look like,
like edible for human consumption.

1027
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,830
You know what I mean? It looks, I
always said it looks like clown food.

1028
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,880
You know what I mean?
Like a clown sneezed.

1029
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:33,780
Especially if it's really like a lot of
like fruits and fucking whip cream and

1030
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:37,830
all of that shit. Just like this. It looks
ridiculous. It's always crazy colors,

1031
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,640
Greens and purples, right? You
don't want the right thing.

1032
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,890
There's all I'm saying you're
doing the right thing, you know,

1033
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,200
is in the bike race and
you're working out, you know,

1034
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,390
this is the deal that you've
actually got a chance of bagging,

1035
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,600
banging one of those fucking
cake eat and broads at in,

1036
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,770
in your section because they,

1037
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,920
they're going to see like a half of
them are probably just testing you.

1038
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:02,300
The other half are fucking probably
codependent fucking cake eaters and they

1039
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:05,580
feel guilty, you know, and they
know that after they eat that,

1040
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:08,520
then that sugar is going to be in their
veins and then they're going to go back

1041
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:11,160
to their desk and they're going to start
eating a handful of fucking cheddar

1042
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:14,160
flavored goldfish to shoving them down.
You know?

1043
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,880
I bet if you walked around your little
section and you have the cubicles and you

1044
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:21,690
looked at their keyboards,
I bet keyboards or greasy a bit.

1045
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,520
There's crumbs in them. I don't
know. You know what? I think you,

1046
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,600
I think you have to go to work
there when you think about that.

1047
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,280
That's what I got out of that
fucking letter. All right.

1048
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,650

you have to watch her doing the song
cause she's so beautiful. You like,

1111
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,520
all right, I can deal with this,
but I want, it's just their voice.

1112
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:12,330
Like he'd break up with her over
the phone. What? Rianna yeah,

1113
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:17,850
she called me up and be like,

01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,280
blah blah. Sorry. Okay. All right.

1115
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,910
Shut up. Don't judge me. I'm an hour
in. I'm out of jokes. That's why.

1116
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:28,860
So this guy works at this
fucking office and uh,

1117
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,850
he's got into cycling and working out
in nutrition and that type of thing.

1118
01:06:31,851 --> 01:06:35,030
So there's like 15 people in his
little area of the office. So he goes,

1119
01:06:35,031 --> 01:06:37,190
that means about at least once a month,

1120
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,750
he has to go down to the fucking cafeteria
and sing happy birthday to somebody

1121
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:43,590
and then they're passing
around birthday cake.

1122
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:47,390
So he always says he doesn't want the
birthday cake. And then they're like,

1123
01:06:47,391 --> 01:06:50,690
uh oh you would for a girl you can kick,

1124
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:53,900
you gotta eat it too or will feel guilty.
And he's like,

1125
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:56,180
am I some sociopath that
I don't give a shit?

1126
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,400
Should I stick to my guns
or should I just have cake?

1127
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,820
Oh stick.

1128
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,850
You got to stick to your guns and you
should tell people that you're on a diet.

1129
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:05,580
Cause people are like, oh
that's great. Yeah. You know,

1130
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:08,580
cause I had been really trying to lose
weight too. I mean obviously not today.

1131
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,480
And you know,

1132
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,670
say that as they're about
ready to eat a piece of cake.

1133
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:15,540
What do you mean you can't go into a crack
house and tell everybody that you got

1134
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:18,180
sober and the crack heads are
going to be like, oh that's great.

1135
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,740
Hey, well I mean you can
still, you're right. But you
can still say no. None for me.

1136
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:24,420
I'm,
I'm trying to watch my weight.

1137
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,600
That's when they come back now just
to have one piece. Then you go, hey,

1138
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,000
fatty. Yeah. Said no it does.
I know I'm really can't.

1139
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:35,630
I've been doing really well this
last month and I'm really, you know,

1140
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,040
I really feel good and I'm just, you
know, just no fucking peer pressure.

1141
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:44,120
Office offices are the worst for that
type of shit. When I worked in the office,

1142
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:46,820
yeah, it was always someone's
birthday. Someone's always like,

1143
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:49,850
I made brownies over the weekend and I
just like can't have them in my house

1144
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:52,940
anymore. You guys ate them and it's, it's,

1145
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,800
it's hard because everyone's just eating.

1146
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:57,860
You're sitting in a fucking cubicle
all day. You're bored is shit.

1147
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:59,930
It's probably the vending machine.

1148
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,611
Nice.
Your question,

1149
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:05,380
is it true that that bid bitches be
eaten when they're at the office?

1150
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,430
Why? Why, why all

1151
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,660
bitches be eating the male and the female
bitches all be eating white, white,

1152
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:15,160
white bitches be, why bitches
be he and I don't know. Bb

1153
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,150
Office environments are so hard to
be on a diet with cause it's, yeah,

1154
01:08:22,151 --> 01:08:26,890
it's like food constantly because it's
so fucking boring to sit there all day.

1155
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:31,690
You just eat, eat, eat, eat.
So no say no to the cake.

1156
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,600
All right, one last quick one. All right.
Cause I got into speaking of that, this,

1157
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:40,030
this fatty kicks me to take her ass
to the gym. So it looked good to me.

1158
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,680
Thank you.
But it starting today,

1159
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,640
since I'm going to my
reunion and starting today,

1160
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:50,320
why can't you get in shape
for me? Um, I mean I'm,

1161
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,870
yeah,
why are you first of all,

1162
01:08:52,871 --> 01:08:57,640
don't try to hijack my health goals.
It's not about you.

1163
01:08:57,641 --> 01:09:01,390
Okay. It's about me. I do a head spin in
there for a second. All right. Kelly did.

1164
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,480
How do I help this guy helped this guy.
All right,

1165
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:06,880
so we sort of backtracking
here on the podcast. All right,

1166
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:10,030
I'm just going to paraphrase this.
Ah, the podcast got me in trouble.

1167
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,420
This dude's getting married in six weeks.
He's over his don't read it.

1168
01:09:13,421 --> 01:09:15,940
Just listen to me. I know. I
heard you talking about it. Oh,

1169
01:09:15,941 --> 01:09:19,450
did he say really loudly heat. So
they're playing a card game. Yeah,

1170
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:24,160
he has the co the Trump card. That's gonna
fucking beat everybody. Right. And um,

1171
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:27,940
the name of it is his
granny water w a d eight.

1172
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:29,920
So when he plays it epes the Alaska,

1173
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:32,650
he slammed it down and nobody
listens to the police. Parents,

1174
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,350
his future in laws do not
listen to the podcast.

1175
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,400
And he just slammed it down and he goes,
I gotta I gotta read it.

1176
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,190
He goes,
it's granny.

1177
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,073
Yeah.

1178
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,600
And it was just silence followed
as it echoed through the house.

1179
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:54,610
My fiance and family were stunned.
This not super uptight people,

1180
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:58,200
but people just don't throw fucks around
during a board game, you know? Yeah.

1181
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:01,750
It only got worse is his fiance to Oh,

1182
01:10:01,751 --> 01:10:05,560
he listens to the podcast and it just,
yeah. And she yelled at him the hallway,

1183
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,400
see what you're doing to people, getting
them in trouble with her future in laws.

1184
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:13,240
I think you owe that young man an apology.
I did apologize and I apologize.

1185
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:16,870
I made them a little fucking audio thing
that he can play. The two is, uh, in loss.

1186
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:20,850
Oh, is it filled with you saying fuck
over and over again? Why? I had the,

1187
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:21,970
I don't know if that was going to help,

1188
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:27,220
but I had to do it in a way
that they like, you know,
saw what a bad influence on.

1189
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,460
Oh, it's just a silly awkward moment.
It's fine. Everyone will get over it.

1190
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:34,270
That's okay. It's funny
story though. All right,

1191
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,890
so what are you doing at the gym today?

Always be doing the legs. Okay, I'm done.

1193

1194
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,550

1197
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:58,940
You're always leaving glasses of water
on the floor and this is what happens.

1198
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,180
How many times a week do you knock over
a glass of water because you put it on

1199
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,530
the floor?
How many times

1201
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:10,400
Can you say sorry for
spilling the water in here?

1202
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:14,930
I'm sorry for spilling your water,
but also there's no bugs.
