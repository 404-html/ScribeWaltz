1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:02,761
Hey,

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:07,110
what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,970
December 25th,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,050
2017 Oh, it's Christmas morning. Ah,

5
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,510
merry Christmas to you.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,540
Merry Christmas to you and
happy birthday to Geez,

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,290
a merry Christmas or
happy birthday to you.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,350
Ooh.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,460
Oh the lovely Nia.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,120
My lovely daughter both
wearing Christmas pajamas.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,290
This is my first question.
What in God's name are you doing?

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,540
Listening to a podcast on Christmas.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,670
My class is already mad enough
at me for doing one. Hey,

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:51,460
gorgeous. How are you doing this?
How? I woke up in the morning,

15
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:55,600
I was laying in bed and I felt high.
I felt these little hands,

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,650
it's a little hand squeezing my finger.
So I thought she was just sleeping,

17
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,540
just sorta like squeezing
my hand or whatever.

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,310
So I took the pillow off my giant head
and I looked over and she was sitting up

19
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:11,110
and I looked at it and she just waved
at me. I loved the way she waves.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,090
We were joking. My daughter waves
at you from like six inches away.

21
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:19,420
She waves like she's on a luxury
liner like cruise boat. And Yo,

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,910
you're a hundred yards away in the
dark. It's just giant wave. Like,

23
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:28,120
Hey man,
I'm right here.

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,270
You got blueberry all over
your face. Um, anyways,

25
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:38,770
merry Christmas to
everybody. Uh, you know,

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,770
I was going to tease everybody, but what
are you doing? You know, it's funny,

27
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,590
this is a tough time of year
to be allowed. Gee, Bill,

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,860
you really went in deep into your brain
to figure that one out, not only alone.

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,110
Then they got all these,
damn,

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,310
they got all these damn songs that just
make you feel worse about yourself.

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,970
You know, if your life stinks and
you're sitting there going, I'll go,

32
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:02,290
what have I done with my life? I
pushed everybody away. I'm all alone.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,350
And as you're thinking that,
oh,

34
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,170
you hear in the background as you're
walking through the liquor stores,

35
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,880
just say it's the most
wonderful time of the year.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,620
They got to update that. Right?
Unless you're a divorced dad,

37
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:22,510
you can't see your kids because
your wife is a cod ex wife. Sorry,

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,770
it's a boast one de full time.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,060
Um, I do actually, you know,
I am envious. This is when,

40
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:37,210
you know, if you don't even care that
you're alone today, you are a true loner.

41
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,800
You Ready? First Ballot Hall of Famer.
What do all the, all the cliches,

42
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,330
you know, Mount Rushmore.
I remember one time I,

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,030
I spent a Thanksgiving alone and uh,

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,910
this is how, this is how deep and dark
my life was. I thought it was hilarious.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,490
I was not, I wasn't sad for any moment
during the day. Thought it was hilarious.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,960
I didn't have any Turkey, any, any
of the fixings, any of that stuff.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,660
And I actually,
uh,

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,730
I called up this other comic,
I think it was Ryan Dalton,

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,200
one of my friends from Cleveland

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,020
and I believe he just came over to my
drab New York apartment and we just sat

51
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,060
there getting shit faced.

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,740
You know, I just, I was
in a point in my life,

53
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,480
I was just so excited that I wasn't in
a relationship. So there was no like,

54
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,760
cause at that point I didn't
even know how to be in one.

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,330
So the fact that I wasn't a one
and he obviously wasn't either,

56
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,670
we both would have had somewhere to go.
I just remembered,

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,910
I think that's why I was so happy because
so many years I was in a relationship

58
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,840
that I just, I dunno, I just
wasn't ready to be in one.

59
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:56,370
And then I was sitting there going,
Oh God,

60
00:03:56,371 --> 00:04:00,350
I'm meeting their family and what am I
della I got to get out of anything rather

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,930
than just relaxing and
enjoying the moment.

62
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:08,610
So I was actually in my comfort
zone being all alone. Aw,

63
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:11,870
what happened? Bill? I'll
put, gives a shit. Um,

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,090
so Billy Bean town,
his back in Boston.

65
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,510
And you haven't seen any beans up here,
by the way.

66
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,270
So funny how that nickname just stuck.

67
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:25,500
I guess at some point they used to
fucking make baked beans, you know,

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,740
kind of how they used to go wailing
and, you know, I don't know what else.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,910
Uh, I don't know. What else,
what else did you make?

70
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:36,850
Buckles for hats for the
pilgrims, but for some reason, uh,

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,060
making beans has stuck here.
Now. I don't know if you've,

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,270
if you've never been to Boston,
I just, I don't, spoiler alert.

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,700
You're not gonna find a lot of beans here.
All right.

74
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:50,870
I went to the big apple. New York City.
Never saw really any more apples there.

75
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:55,590
Why did they call it to this different
reason for that? Isn't there New York,

76
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,810
why do they call it? Yeah,
right. It is right there.

77
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,230
Why do they call it the big apple?

78
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,320
All these fucking chicks with the
big ass down there. Apple bottoms.

79
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:12,154
Is that what it is?

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,410
My big apple is a nickname for New York
City was first popularized in the 1920s

81
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:21,220
by Jay Fitzgerald.
What?

82
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,950
John Jay Fitzgerald. Okay. A sports
writer for New York when it's popular.

83
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,300
Since what the fuck?
Why is it called the Big Apple?

84
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,720
I don't give a fuck about John.
Jay Fitzgerald.

85
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,540
Yeah.

86
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,380
Origin of the name. Oh, somebody is
calling me. I'm not answering that.

87
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,160
Okay. Although the history of the
big apple was once thought a mystery,

88
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,700
a clearer picture of the
term history has emerged.

89
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,680
Do you do the work of amateur
etymologist Barry Popkin.

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,190
Okay.

91
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,450
And Gerald Cohen, who gives a fuck
about them? A number of false theories.

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,640
I don't care about those. Oh,
and clue. Okay. Why? Actually,

93
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:01,474
I like this one

94
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,550
theory previously existed including the
claim that the term derived from a woman

95
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,650
named Eve who ran a brothel in the city.

96
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,160
This was subsequently exposed as a hoax.

97
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,160
I love how they figure out that it's
a host. How do you figure that out?

98
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,920
Like where would you start?
You know, so she was,

99
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:23,510
they've been calling it that or that
was the lie for all these years.

100
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,030
How do you go back and fact check it?

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
New evidence suggests the earliest known
usage of the big apple in a book in the

102
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,760
book, the, the wayfarer in New York.

103
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,450
I mean in order to Wayfair is sounds
like a fat person that eats crackers.

104
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,260
Okay,

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,760
well it's wafers. Cookies. Wait, what is,

106
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,570
it is a literally a
whole fucking page here

107
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,710
in which ended another,
Duh.

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,730
Yeah.

109
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,470
William, if he considered in this
coinage, but where is he answer

110
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,630
Kansas is apt to see in New York City,

111
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,650
a gritty city.

112
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,040
It's inclined to think that the big apple
gets a disproportionate share of the

113
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,940
national SAP. Oh, so
that line from the book,

114
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,490
Kansas is apt to see in New York City,

115
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Indian in New York are greedy city in
it inclines to think that the big apple

116
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:36,420
gets a disproportionate
share of the national Sapp.

117
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,950
I, I, you know, I, you know,

118
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,800
I don't feel like I'm any closer to
understanding why it's called that.

119
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,490
What the fuck does that mean?
So the way that's worded,

120
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:52,750
it seems like they were already
calling it the big apple or you know,

121
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,720
cause if you read like Tom Sawyer and
everything, they're like, hey, you know,

122
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,200
if you, if you're whitewashed my fence,
I'll give you an apple. And they're like,

123
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:03,370
boy, oh boy. You know, cause they
didn't have any snickers bars.

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,390
So an apple was like a tree.
It was a treat back then.

125
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,570
So maybe that was their big dessert.
I get the fuck out of people making pies.

126
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,040
Okay.

127
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,740
That's all women did back then. They
weren't allowed to vote. Right. You know,

128
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:25,080
if they just sat around making pies,
you know,

129
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,840
bitching that they weren't out in the
fields behind a fucking team. Oxygen.

130
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,470
Why do you get to go out there
and smell that og shit? Hey Lady,

131
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,630
you want to do this?
It's all yours

132
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,930
fucking sitting here kneading dough.

133
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,360
I'd rather do that to be outside
in the elements, but you know,

134
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:48,290
if that's what you want to
do, by all means. All right.

135
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,660
Speaking of apples, you
guys friend, you guys, uh,

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,590
are you guys fans I should say
of the, uh, the band primus?

137
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,530
Well, their drummer, uh, Tim Alexandra
has a cider called Herb Sida.

138
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,350
If you'd like to get boozed up,
go to ww dot herb cider.com.

139
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:11,910
Yeah,

140
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,400
and check that stuff out. I
actually had a little, oh,

141
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,030
I can't actually have a glassy pool of it.
He sent me something,

142
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:20,040
but I can't have a glass he pool
of it until I come off the wagon,

143
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,210
which is probably going to be
happen on the day of the Rose Bowl.

144
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,720
It's my 10th rose bowl in a row.
Me and Bart Nick are going to be there.

145
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,490
Maybe we'll have a little bit of
herb site or whatever. Check it out.

146
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,720
If you're into cider, if you like to get
hammered and also be like, yeah, but doc,

147
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:40,530
I'm also having an apples herb
site or resisting for you.

148
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:41,790
I'm gonna check out his website here.

149
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Okay,

150
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,730
go to the page. Yes. That's what I want
to do, please. For the love of God,

151
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,780
for the love of God,
slowly opening,

152
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,560
I shouldn't have hotel internet.
I always pay for the extra amount.

153
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,140
Oh, it's got a great label.
I'll tell you right now,

154
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,670
if it's as good as that God damn label,

155
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,470
I'm going to be drinking
some of this stuff.

156
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,710
I love all these musicians now can like
branch out and actually have like other

157
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,750
businesses and stuff before.
It's like they had,

158
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:16,720
they hit songs and then some greedy
bastard would steal from them and now they

159
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:19,950
got like clothing label of clothing
lines and all of this shit.

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,040
This guy's making cider,
you know?

161
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,770
Do you know the smothers
brothers have their own vineyard?

162
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,040
That was like unheard of back in the day.

163
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,390
Maybe John Elway would have a couple of
car dealerships or something like that,

164
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,470
but usually the performance, when we
were done per forma, we were screwed.

165
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,470
You know, if we weren't out there
tap dance and we were fucked,

166
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:44,960
what can I come up with?
What should I make?

167
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,130
Okay.

168
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,580
Bill Burrs, big book of content and
like all the different ways to say it.

169
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,950
And I'll go around the world, you know,
find out, I'll find out the origins of it.

170
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,510
Back to j f Scott Fitzgerald,
you know,

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,550
people in Tupelo, Mississippi think
that the big con gets more of its share.

172
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,140
Okay.

173
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,830
Of just sat there. I'm sorry. Um,

174
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,920
um, anyways, I don't
know what to talk about.

175
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,280
I didn't know why the
fuck I'm doing this today.

176
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,750
You shouldn't even be listening to you.
You to be ashamed of yourself. Dammit.

177
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,060
Shit. My wife's going to give me, she
was saying he doing the podcast today.

178
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,480
Who I do the podcast. I go,
cause it's fucking hilarious.

179
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,150
Okay.

180
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,180
Then I'm podcasting, or Christmas morning.
Is there something funny about that?

181
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,650
Right.
We already had Christmas breakfast.

182
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,380
We're going to go out of my
parents' house for Christmas dinner.

183
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:39,230
I got a window here.
Snow one outside.

184
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,690
All the weather outside is frightful,

185
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,170
but your smile is so delightful.

186
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,050
That's really something that's serial
killer would be singing, right?

187
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:52,410
Just you're tied up in his cabin.
Oh,

188
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,370
the weather outside is frightful,

189
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,930
but your smile is so the legs
you sit in there all gag on,

190
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,080
sorry, I don't know what it
is about Christmas music,

191
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,540
but I always just think creepy shit.
There's something about it.

192
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,900
I think when I was growing up,
just watching it, you know,

193
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,650
passed a search in certain age and you
start to figure out adults a little more

194
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:15,730
and you just like, you know what? Nobody's
really that happy. This is all bullshit.

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,350
This is all part of the lie,
Huh? Full Christopher. Cringle

196
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,360
how about those patriots?
Huh? How bout those patriots?

197
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:26,770
How about those buffalo bills?

198
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,310
That's one of the best teams
I've seen them have both games,

199
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,710
even though we kind of kicked her ass
the first time. But I mean they're, uh,

200
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,350
when they were eight and
six when they came in,

201
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,250
they're looking at their ninth one.
They might be nine and seven this year.

202
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,230
You know when I say I say good for them,
good for them.

203
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,410
I don't know who the hell they are.

204
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,710
Safety wasn't that quarterback
who jumped out route,

205
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,450
timed it perfectly and got
a very rare interception.

206
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,400
Picked six off a Tom Brady.
But you knew we were going to win.

207
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,910
Anytime Tom Brady throws a pick six
weeks, that's when he's, he gets pissed.

208
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,410
All you did was pissed him off.

209
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,190
He's going to come back and just
blow the game wide open. Uh,

210
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,960
nobody knows that better than people
down in Atlanta. Merry Christmas.

211
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:14,110
Atlanta Falcon fence.
I love you guys so much.

212
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,100
I brought up the biggest show could
Superbowl history once again, I apologize.

213
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,360
Okay. And Happy Hanukkah too. If
you're a Jewish fan, happy Kwanzaa.

214
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,240
If you're an African American fan and uh,

215
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,670
I don't know what the transgendered
people celebrate these days,

216
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:28,540
but whatever that thing is,

217
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,490
I'm going to allow me to make
sure I know what that is.

218
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,360
So I don't cause a big
dust up on social media.

219
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,530
Um,
I'll watch the Bruins when,

220
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,790
and I went to the Celtics and
they want against the bulls.

221
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,290
We've got a great young team and a
buddy of mine has tickets right behind,

222
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,360
uh,
my Garmin and Tommy Heinsohn.

223
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,950
So for one quarter I got
to sit down there and, uh,

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
you know, heights since like six,
seven see sitting behind him,

225
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,120
he can barely see the damn game,

226
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,240
Lisa transition game when
they're bringing it up the court.

227
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,900
But I have to tell you, it was,
um, back in the day, I always,

228
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,650
I kind of wanted to be a sports
broadcaster. So actually watching them,

229
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,200
they both had a guy on
either side. Like, you know,

230
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,270
when they sit there and be like,
he's got 16 points, it's like,

231
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:17,260
how the hell did they know that?
It's like as they were scoring points,

232
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,590
whoever's scores,
their whole line of stats,

233
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:25,150
the player would light up and the points
is all the way to the right, I believe.

234
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,980
And um, I was just kind of watching
how they, they were able to do that.

235
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,980
I mean just there's so much stuff.

236
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,800
You got to know what's going on and
then understand like the importance of

237
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:40,750
what's going on. Like when you watch a
game at home, you know what's going on.

238
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,260
You're into the flow of the game and
then you're talking about the next day at

239
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:47,920
work and so much of that is because of
what the announcers are telling you.

240
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,920
This is a big play here.
They got to convert this dirt
down and then they don't.

241
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,910
Oh,
that was devastating.

242
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,320
You got to work like, no, it
was a big important cable.

243
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,780
Need you to protect her down
and you don't even know.

244
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
I realize you just, you just saying
what the fuck they already said.

245
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:05,220
What's when you go to the game by
yourself, you know, there's so much,

246
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,320
there's just so much crap going on.

247
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,470
Yeah,

248
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,190
good Lord. Every time there's a
stoppage of play, they had this, this,

249
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:15,670
this group of kids, little funk.
They always have these kids dancing.

250
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,060
Yeah,

251
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,710
I have a fun.
I hate it.

252
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,370
I hate seeing kids in show business that
young and it's like you should be up

253
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,100
building a god snowman going out
doing this whole dance routine.

254
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:32,720
How long did your work on that?
Just picture some mean fucking teacher.

255
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,721
We're not leaving till we get it
right from the top five tech seven.

256
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,900
Eight right?

257
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:40,990
Yeah,

258
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,230
they have that.
They got fucking Santa Claus coming up,

259
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:49,231
break dancing and spinning it on his head
and it really kills like feeling like

260
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,310
you're at the game.

261
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,290
Like I was heckling the bull's coach
Guy's name was Fred something or other,

262
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,040
you know we was sitting down low so he
kept standing up and those damn coaches,

263
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,190
they like block your view.
So I'm going,

264
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:07,900
hey Friday grabs him far.
Drag some pilot Frederick.

265
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:09,750
Okay.

266
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,880
Hey Freddy,
you know you could coach sitting down.

267
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,110
Okay.

268
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,050
Hey what? What his hands on
your hip beads. No defense.

269
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:18,820
Okay.

270
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,930
Friday just doing that shit. And everybody
was like looking around, you know,

271
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:26,470
my father in law was getting
embarrassed. I'm like, Mike, dude,

272
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:30,760
this is what people used to do. This
is what you say. This was big. But,

273
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,260
so there was also people laughing.

274
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,970
That's what used to happen when
there was a stoppage of play.

275
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,200
Okay.

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Fans would yell out what they thought
should have been going on. Know,

277
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,920
hey Dee, why don't you let him
get to the fucking elbow again?

278
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,890
How many times he got hit dead shot
on you. And everybody would laugh.

279
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,610
Now the second that damn thinks up.

280
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,200
Are you Renee?

281
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,310
Gay, Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay,
gay, gay. All these fucking
kids run out on the court.

282
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,250
I'm trying to get drunk
and yell at people that,

283
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:09,930
I don't know why you
bringing kids into this. Um,

284
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,490
but I was stone sober.
Um, anyways, so we won't.

285
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,460
But either way that the
game was great and um,

286
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,360
okay.

287
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,990
Just seeing the Celtics live, how
young they are. Even I benches.

288
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,500
Great. I've keep forgetting
the name. What's the name
of our, our sort of center,

289
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:29,340
the big white guy.

290
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,720
He looks like a yoga instructor
that moonlights as a lumberjack.

291
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,810
You know, he's got the man
bun go and see, you know,

292
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:40,020
we spiritual these progressive
and then he's got the giant beard.

293
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:43,980
So he can't tell. Is this guy like a
hipster? Is He from the Pacific northwest?

294
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,650
Any in his grandfather used to get on
either end of an accident. Oh Wow. Oh Wow.

295
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:54,460
Right. You take a fucking tree down,
whatever the hell they did out there. Um,

296
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,100
what's his face?

297
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,190
Rosier had this month's to fucking dunked
towards the end of the game. Explosive.

298
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,840
Something you never used
to see on the Celtics.

299
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,960
We used to be a bunch of slow white guys.
Even our black guys was slow.

300
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,750
Just hanging out with the white
guys sitting and have to try it.

301
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,220
Try as hard and practice and then they,
they sort of became like a, you know,

302
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,980
almost not black anymore.
They were like mixed.

303
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,910
They had a little bit too much
white on them. Next thing you know,

304
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,950
they had developed an outside shot.
This is all true.

305
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,980
This is why we had a tough time
keeping up with the showtime Lakers.

306
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,560
Too many whities all right.
I'm just making up shit.

307
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,660
I don't have any reads this week,
you know?

308
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,720
Okay.

309
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,600
I Dunno. I guess when you, when
you piss off Sherry's berries,

310
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,950
then the dominoes just fall.
No,

311
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,370
I think people just like no
one's going to be listening,

312
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:41,890
nor is anybody can be podcasting
on fucking Christmas, you know?

313
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:45,410
And everybody thought that. And here you
are listening and you know else knew it.

314
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,610
Tim Alexander from Primus.
So that's my only read of this week.

315
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:53,320
Why don't you just sit down and ignore
your family and drink at nice jug of herb

316
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:55,220
cider.
If you'd like to drink some,

317
00:18:55,221 --> 00:19:00,221
go to www dot [inaudible]
dot com her bs cider.com.

318
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Um, all right, my wife's going
to kill me that I'm part.

319
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:09,080
There's going to be a shorter
podcast. Unusual. All right,

320
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,070
let's give me an a bridge person. Kids
want to open their gifts here. All right,

321
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,320
let's get to the reeds here.
Comedy bubble. Hey Billy.

322
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,320
Hey Billy burrata toes. I like
that one. I'm speaking of burrata.

323
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:26,510
I went to the north end and have a lovely,
lovely Italian meal.

324
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,470
I had a little burrata
and the appetizer there.

325
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:33,680
It was unbelievable that I went down
to a cigar bar. The bunch of relatives.

326
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,520
We smoked a couple.
This is fucking asshole.

327
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,220
I always go to that cigar
bar in the north end

328
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,980
and I always forget the name of it.
It's an Italian name.

329
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,750
The fuck is the name of it's Segarra is,
is the last thing,

330
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:51,963
let's see,

331
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,770
it's a garb are north and Boston.

332
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,260
What does it stands at?
Delsa Gary.

333
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,230
Oh, DC Gari. Um,

334
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,930
what'd they were having
a great frigging time.

335
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,320
And for some reason they have this bell.
They're like,

336
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:17,580
you would ring between rounds and
this fucking jerk off Boston guy.

337
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:22,581
He's got this hammer and he keeps hitting
the bell and I'm watching this dude in

338
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:24,990
this bowl and shard coming over,
you know,

339
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,420
with the Boston angry face with
his eyebrows up going, hey buddy,

340
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,300
knock it off. Stop
ringing the bell. Right.

341
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,170
And the kid keeps ringing
the bell and like, like, what
the fuck is with this kid?

342
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:40,050
And then I peeked over and I saw you had
like the earring in his ear. I'm like,

343
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,840
oh, that guy. Oh, that guy,

344
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,090
he's going to be that guy.

345
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:49,480
And the guy just would not stop ringing
in the fucking belt by appreciated the

346
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,630
fact that the fucking, the one dude
was trying to get them to stop.

347
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,960
But then the other dude,
they,

348
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,030
with the man bun in the fucking beard
kept laughing, thinking it was funny.

349
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,970
And I was like, right
there. There you go. That's,

350
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:05,950
there's the generation gap right there.
The millennial kid thinks it's funny.

351
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,370
The other dude, it was also kind of
young, but probably had an angry dad.

352
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:13,120
Did not think it was funny. So I
was rooting for him, but either way,

353
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,740
I had a great time and
I want to thank them.

354
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:19,300
They always treat me great when I go in
there. Um, cigars wasn't were amazing. Um,

355
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,330
that's sort of a tradition.
I always end up there at least one night,

356
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,520
if not seven. All right. Comedy
bubble. Hey Billy Baratos,

357
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,500
huge fan from Pakistan.

358
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,580
Saw you at the Atlanta punchline a
few months ago and it was amazing.

359
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:34,301
Thank you very much.

360
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:39,301
Recently I've noticed some as established
comedians on social media shitting on

361
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,750
open micros and newer comedians
for trying their luck at comedy.

362
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,340
Okay.

363
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,040
Yeah, that's not nobody
funny. He was doing that.

364
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,230
I get that there are a lot of comedians
around now and comedy in general is very

365
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:57,190
trendy, especially with Netflix
releasing a special every week this year.

366
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,940
But is it fair to say there
is a comedy bubble now?

367
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Is it even worth it for an aspiring or
up and coming comic to try their hand at

368
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:09,460
it? Wanted to get your
take on this uh, love you.

369
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:14,440
Stand up the podcast and episode
family. Thanks and go love yourself. Um,

370
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,790
I'll at that for the holidays.
Great. Great. Great question.

371
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,040
Alright.
Um,

372
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,160
standup comedy is always
going through some sort of a

373
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,590
up or down as, as any business. Do
you know what I mean? Look at the NBA.

374
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:37,560
The NBA was through the roof,
popular, right to the Jordan
era. Then it made a dip,

375
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,900
but now it's starting to come back
and then Lebron and all those guys,

376
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,490
it brings it back up and
down, up and down. NFLS on a
little dip here. Tom Brady,

377
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,660
towards the end of his career, Peyton
Manning's gone. Andrew loves, heard Aaron.

378
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,090
Roger gets hard parity and all that.
They got to figure it out.

379
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:53,200
There's always ups and downs,

380
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,120
but that doesn't mean you
shouldn't go after your dream.

381
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,670
I started comedy March 2nd,
1992 after the big eighties,

382
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,770
bubbles burst and there was
a bunch of, uh, not a bunch,

383
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:04,630
but there was a number of older comics.

384
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,080
Okay.

385
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,610
Um,
when I started out,

386
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:12,611
that tried to discourage me from starting
none of the funny ones and they go

387
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,970
look at it so that it's crass.
It's plays like half full. Yeah.

388
00:23:14,971 --> 00:23:18,320
It's like a two years ago there'd
be a line around the block.

389
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,260
He's lying around in the mud,
you know,

390
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,010
and they used to get me all
depressed in that type of stuff. Um,

391
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,680
any established comedians that shits on
an open miker and tries to discourage

392
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:33,400
them is not even worth your time.
But how pathetic is that?

393
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,290
What else are you going to do?

394
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,570
You're going to make fun of a
toddler learning how to walk.

395
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,910
Do you just give her a bath? Oh, um,

396
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,201
all right.

397
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:47,930
I need to get off this
because she's getting more
annoyed by the second that I'm

398
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:52,460
out here. What it was my Christmas
too. I enjoy podcasting. Um, yeah.

399
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,200
Okay.

400
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,180
Those people are not even worth your time.

401
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,350
And is there a comedy bubble
right now? Uh, yeah, absolutely.

402
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,900
You put out 50 to one network,
put out 52 hour long specials in a year.

403
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:10,670
You can't, you can't do that. It stops
being special. It becomes like all like a,

404
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,700
like a fucking logjam and you know,

405
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,250
you need to have space. It has
to breathe. It's like a song.

406
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,790
You can't have everybody doing
a tap on solo at the same time.

407
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,720
It just becomes noise. Um, but yeah,

408
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:29,060
know this is the,
uh,

409
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,010
I think it's gone up twice since I've
been doing it. You know, it, it dip, dip,

410
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:36,850
dip, dip, dip a bit, bit, bit peppy,
peppy, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

411
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,290
All in the beginning of my
first eight years of my career.

412
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,700
And then after nine 11, it went
up, it went up, it went up,

413
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:47,720
it went up and then it started to
come back down again. And then,

414
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,010
uh,

415
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,000
okay.

416
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,930
The ability for Comedians to shoot
their own specials and sell them,

417
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:58,820
made it go up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
up, up. And I would think that the,

418
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,910
the peak of this, it's like a
housing bubble was standup specials.

419
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:05,130
That one network has 52 of them.

420
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:08,310
But the thing about Netflix
is it's also global,

421
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,670
so it's not like,

422
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,703
mmm,

423
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,250
they're just doing it for
the United States, you know,

424
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,370
which would be insane if you
just did that for one country.

425
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:23,750
It's for everybody around the world.
So maybe that levels it out. I mean,

426
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:24,920
from what I've heard from Netflix,

427
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:29,921
they gonna try to have more
of an international flavor
next year when they do

428
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:35,130
it. I have no idea. I have no
idea. But I don't see that's,

429
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,620
it's beyond my control.
I'm not the one who decides,

430
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,160
nor should I be how much so many
specials get put out there or whatever.

431
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:48,560
But it's not going to discourage me
from trying to write my best hour.

432
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,620
MMM.

433
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,050
But it's definitely making me think about
how to release and when to release my

434
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:57,894
next one.

435
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,853
MMM.

436
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,300
Yeah. I hope I answered your question,
but dude, if you want to do stand up,

437
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,690
you got to do it. It's the
greatest fucking job ever.
If you're good at it. If not,

438
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:11,570
it's uh, you know, I'll tell you
it's a rough one. Okay. But yeah,

439
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,090
don't ever listen to any fucking ass.
Don't listen. Anybody in general,

440
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,150
whatever business you're in,
somebody's discourages you.

441
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,700
What kind of an asshole does that?
Hey, I want to do this. Ah, yeah,

442
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,640
I dunno why he want to do
that. Bad. I mean, lets you
talking about trying heroin,

443
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,890
you know,
other than that,

444
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,150
I think I want to start my own
business book be going to go under.

445
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,960
It's actually,
I will tell you,

446
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,000
it's actually good that
somebody is doing that to you,

447
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:42,410
that you're getting that this early in
this business because the key to success

448
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:43,980
is tuning those people out.

449
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,000
Okay.

450
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,271
And,

451
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:51,271
and being around positive people that say
things that make you feel better about

452
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,930
what you're going after.
Now,

453
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,310
I'm not saying that at some point
you won't have an idea that is,

454
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,080
you know, you need to think about again.
You know what I mean? So somebody be like,

455
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,840
hey man, you might want to watch out
because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

456
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,110
I'm not saying that a negative response.

457
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,120
It's not even negative
constructive criticism.

458
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,760
There's always gotta be a place for that.

459
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:16,870
But you can't have people who are just
being negative just because you're going

460
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:20,710
out and doing something and you'll be able
to tell the difference. All right, Nia,

461
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:25,500
I'm almost done. No response. All right.

462
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,730
Rush, reaction video. Hey
there, Billy. Five, four time.

463
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,020
Love you. Love Nia. Love your freaking
podcast. And I thought you'd love this.

464
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:38,580
These guys review albums and apparently
listeners ask them to do a video on

465
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,880
Russia's Yyz.
They do a lot of rap albums,

466
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:44,010
but have reviewed metal bands.

467
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:48,000
Like I can't say that's Sepultura.

468
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,680
It's really fun listening to them. React
to the drumming and the guitar changes.

469
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:55,800
Merry Christmas. You beautiful
bastard. I actually, uh,

470
00:27:55,801 --> 00:28:00,570
I didn't get to see this video until you,
uh, till right before I started this.

471
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:04,440
And as you can see, tensions are
building with my Christmas here. Um,

472
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,080
I watched a little bit of a,
um,

473
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,930
I'm definitely gonna Watch the whole
thing was cool to see that they liked it.

474
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:12,090
I knew that they're going to be like,
what the fuck is this? In the beginning,

475
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,500
as I mentioned before,
that's why y z is the, uh,

476
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,850
the call letters for Toronto
International Airport and,

477
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,140
and Yyz as the Morse code,

478
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,660
uh,
uh,

479
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,970
[inaudible] that, that,
that, uh, that, that,

480
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:34,680
that they're playing the Morse code of
y, Y, z. It's one of their, one of them.

481
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:38,250
And the band was flying a plane and they
heard it and they thought it sounded

482
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:42,990
cool, so they put it to music. Um,
there you go. That's what that is.

483
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,290
Anyways. So it's funny watching them,
listening to this shift going, yeah,

484
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,790
they haven't dropped into the groove yet,

485
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,420
which basically means it's not in yet.
Essentially for a lot of people,

486
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,470
if that's all you listen to. All
right, original six and nonsense.

487
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,110
Hi Bill. I want to know what your
thoughts are on the original six.

488
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,080
I call it the original,
who gives a fuck. Ah,

489
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,720
this sounds like somebody doesn't
have an original six team.

490
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,540
No other sports hold clubs
up on a pedestal above the
rest of the teams in the

491
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,374
league.

492
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,580
It's like all the other clubs in the NHL
are less than because they weren't from

493
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,750
the beginning. As it ducks fan now, Jesus,

494
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,250
you're not a ducks fan.
You're a mighty ducks. We,

495
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:32,440
you're named after a
Disney movie. I get it. No,

496
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,410
you can't win enough cups to try and get
some sort of fucking manly vibe on your

497
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:41,950
team. Um, as a ducks fan. I know you
hate them. I don't hate, I don't.

498
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,390
Uh,

499
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,390
I went out and supported them with
those gay uniforms and gay name.

500
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,890
It was always humiliating playing
the wings or Boston in those

501
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,310
eggplant fucked up green colors with
the cartoon duck on their jersey. Well,

502
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,820
it made sense. It was named
after a kids movie. Uh,

503
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:07,510
I think we've earned some respect for
going through the shit. You're dead.

504
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,440
You're dead.
You're dead.

505
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,790
TEEMU Salani and had all those
guys then angry bastard from uh,

506
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,650
what is, what is it from a Vancouver you
have down there, the hell's his name,

507
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:21,130
Ryan or some shit. Um,
cartoon duck and the Jersey.

508
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:25,000
I think we've earned some respect for
going through the, that shit. I was like,

509
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,290
it was like wearing a dress
to a biker bar. Every game.

510
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,530
I can't stand every time we
play the leafs or Montreal,

511
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,590
they always mentioned the
original six bullshit. Anyways,

512
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:39,520
I wanted to know what your take
is on the original six. Um,

513
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,320
well I love sports history,
so I like it.

514
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,830
And even if I didn't have a team
that was in the original six,

515
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:48,670
I like the expansion six.
Uh,

516
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,310
let's see if I can still name them.
That's the fly is

517
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,390
the penguins.
Oh boy.

518
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,140
The California Golden
Seals to St Louis Blues.

519
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,610
Nice to be able to rattle this off.

520
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Every team has the Minnesota North Stars
and the Los Angeles kings oof by the

521
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:15,230
skin of my teeth. I did that. And
then for those who don't know,

522
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:19,400
the California Golden Seals move to
Cleveland became the Cleveland Barons.

523
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,300
And that went under and I believe
merged or something with Minnesota.

524
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,730
I can't remember. I don't remember
any. I used to know all that shit. Um,

525
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,410
I liked the original six. I wish that, uh,

526
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,670
more leagues would talk
about that type of stuff.

527
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,603
MMM.

528
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,990
You know, like the NFL and that
type of stuff. I just think,

529
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:43,480
I think it's interesting,
personally,

530
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,510
I wish the NFL actually acknowledged
NFL titles the way baseball,

531
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:53,080
basketball and hockey all count.

532
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,820
They all count titles to the
beginning of their leak. I mean,

533
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,470
the Montreal Canadians, they like,
they won Stanley cups against, uh,

534
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,400
the Montreal maroons in the Stanley Cup.
It was like the size of a shot glass.

535
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:11,950
I mean, it is the history. It probably
played the final game on a fucking pond.

536
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,890
But I mean,
that is the history of the league.

537
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,300
What I don't understand what the NFL
is,

538
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:24,301
how the Green Bay packers are
not the Yankees or the NFL there.

539
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:26,350
He's talking about the Pittsburgh
Steelers because they've,

540
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,850
they've won six Superbowls,

541
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,020
but the Pittsburgh Steelers were around
back in the early days of the NFL and

542
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:35,680
had an opportunity every year to
win an NFL title and they didn't.

543
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,800
And Green Bay did. And for
some reasons Bay's like, oh,

544
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:44,640
what are they going to green bay, you got
four titles. So it is four or five, four

545
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,280
for some reason they just
go, oh, they got for their,

546
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:54,281
the two behind the Steelers and they
have like 11 NFL titles plus four

547
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,650
Superbowl. So my world, they're
up around 1415 whatever it is.

548
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,890
And then you got the fucking
Lakers who count a Ba,

549
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,960
they went some league,
the Ba or something like that.

550
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,230
Okay.

551
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,380
And they want a title there.
They count that as an NBA title.

552
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,840
I mean that's one of the biggest
bullshit stats in fucking sports.

553
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,430
How the hell you win an NBA
title before there's an NBA,

554
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,170
the NFL, like look,
the Nhl, like you know,

555
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,850
when the WHL went down or the Ahl,

556
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:33,070
Dave absorb teams as did the NBA.
Right.

557
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,450
But it was still the NBA. Right. When
were they absorbed? Like the Aba?

558
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,780
Yeah.

559
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,860
You know,
those Aba teams went into the NBA.

560
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,160
The difference with the Lakers
is the NBA didn't even exist.

561
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,360
There was no NBA. It was like
wrestling before it got unified.

562
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,100
There was a little bullshit league here,

563
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,040
a little bullshit league there
and another bullshit league.

564
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,200
And the Lakers were in one
of those bullshit leagues.

565
00:33:56,201 --> 00:34:00,730
And for some reason they get to count
that bullshit league title as an NBA title

566
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,360
because eventually all the
leagues combined the two
leaks or something combined

567
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:07,720
and it became a stronger league.
And that was an NBA title,

568
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,600
not your Bullshit League one.
You know,

569
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:12,910
that's like counting like
when they had the AFL,

570
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,060
like the San Diego chargers claiming that
they won like a fucking Superbowl Isam

571
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,020
Shit because they want to an AFL
title one year. Um, but whatever,

572
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,820
that's what it is. It's very la
to pad your fucking resume. So,

573
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:33,250
um, for some reason nobody
calls him on it. Um, so I
love, I love the original six.

574
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,930
Um, I think it's cool.
And it's also, you know,

575
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,020
there were more teams
then the depression hit.

576
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:45,950
And then they went down to six teams. That
was the deal. According to Bart, nick,

577
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,810
the Pittsburgh Penguins were around some
team from Pittsburgh and they had black

578
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:53,860
and gold. Cause the Bruins always said
the penguins took their colors. Um,

579
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,310
and he goes, no, we had that in the
20s. I the penguin steady. So no,

580
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:58,690
it was a different team.
It's like, all right,

581
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,340
well then you went belly up and at which
point you forfeit the colors and then

582
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:06,580
the Bruins gonna back. You don't
get to come back and be like, oh,

583
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:09,940
we can't do forever.
You don't.

584
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,100
They were already taken your best. It's
a great organization though. All right.

585
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:19,510
My daughter's boyfriend is
a loser. Oh boy. Dear Billy,

586
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:23,860
the kid first I want to say that I loved
the first two episodes of emphasis for

587
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:26,680
family and I can't wait. Oh,
the first two seasons, sorry.

588
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:28,360
And I can't wait for season three.
Thank you.

589
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,310
I don't like my daughter's boyfriend.

590
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,910
I like how this guy gets right to it
and I want to make or break up with him.

591
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,530
Let me tell you about my girl.
She's 28 years old. She has a job.

592
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:39,150
She's living in an
apartment with this guy.

593
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,170
The problem is is that she pays for
everything because he's air quote between

594
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,610
jobs and also sometimes she calls me to
fix some stuff for her and when I get

595
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:51,300
there I find this ass just playing
video games or watching a movie.

596
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,920
Oh my God.

597
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,450
He doesn't even put on a show for when
is the father of his girlfriend shows up.

598
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,670
Yeah, this guy's a bum.
He doesn't do shit.

599
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,040
I really don't understand
why she's still with them.

600
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:05,130
My greatest fear is if she marries,
she marries that guy.

601
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,040
Can you please give me your opinion
as a father? Oh my God, dude,

602
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,910
I'm brand new to this. You're like
a grizzled vet with a 28 year old.

603
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,280
I got an 11 month old.
I'm going to give you advice.

604
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,450
Can you please give me your opinion as a
father on how to deal with this problem?

605
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,630
Should I tell her to break up with them
or should I just keep my mouth shut?

606
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,500
And I would also love to hear what the
lovely Nia has to say about that switch,

607
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,500
about my situation. Thank
you. Keep up the good work.

608
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,930
Well unfortunately she's a little
pissed at me right now. So, uh,

609
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,360
I only got one more question here.
Um,

610
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,840
I think I probably would have given
him shit when I went over there.

611
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,953
Okay.

612
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,340
I would have just been like,
really?

613
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:48,400
You're just going to sit there playing
video games while the father of your

614
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:52,900
girlfriend comes over to this apartment
where she's paying for everything and

615
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:55,990
you don't even have a job. You just
going to sit there and play video games.

616
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,010
Who raised you?

617
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,110
Okay.

618
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,510
I probably, you know, Nah,

619
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:05,440
I'm not the smartest guy and I
also fly off the handle a lot.

620
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,540
I would have said something along those
lines and then if he mentioned it to

621
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:13,830
her, I just say, listen,

622
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,340
I probably shouldn't have said that. I
love you. I want the best for you. And

623
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,873
okay.

624
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,000
You know,
it,

625
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,200
it just as your dad had bothers me
that you're paying for everything.

626
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,180
And then I came over to the
fixed stuff in this guy.

627
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,450
Couldn't even start playing video
games. Um, you know something.

628
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:33,220
Don't say anything because then
you look like the asshole does.

629
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,270
That was bad advice. All right.
Swing and a miss strike one.

630
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,930
I would say that to her, just say, listen,

631
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,970
I'm going to just going to
say this and just say this.

632
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:43,620
I'm just going to say this one time.

633
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,420
I have to get this off my chest as your
dad because I love you and I want the

634
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,190
best for.
Okay.

635
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,230
I understand that the person you're with
right now is between jobs and really

636
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,064
tried to

637
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,400
fight the urge to do the giant air
quotes between jobs and just say,

638
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:06,700
listen, okay, I understand that you know,

639
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,580
people have ups and downs in life,
but

640
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,280
it was just kind of a red flag to me
that I went over to your apartment when

641
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:18,270
you're paying everything where
there's a man there. All right?

642
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,360
And he sees the father of the woman
that he's dating come walking in to fix

643
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:26,670
something that he's not fixing.
He didn't even help me.

644
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:31,350
He continued to play video games. I'm
just saying, I'm a little concerned

645
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,880
about the overall drive of the
man in your life and as men,

646
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:44,020
we can't give you children. All
right. What we do is provide.

647
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,710
Okay. So, uh,

648
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,243
okay.

649
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,020
He just looked like a giant 12 year
old to me. Don't say that last part,

650
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:59,850
but just say, I'm just a little concerned.
Are you, do you share those concerns?

651
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,070
And if she says no, just say fair
enough. Maybe I caught him on a bad day,

652
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,430
but just as your father,
I felt like I had to say something.

653
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,200
If you're okay with them, then I'm okay
with them. And then you, then you go,

654
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:14,430
cause now you put it out there.

655
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,173
All right.

656
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,290
But if he come at her and you just
say, listen, you need to dump this guy,

657
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,330
this guy's a Bombay guys,
I judge Joe,

658
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,060
then she's going to get a
backup and be are, you know,

659
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,570
and it'll become actually more
romantic to her that she's, you know,

660
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:32,830
it's us against the world, baby. Did you
hear what I said? The kids can be like,

661
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:37,330
Whoa, oh, sorry. Showing to
get to level seven. Uh, that's
the way I would handle it.

662
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,900
And then after that you just got to
wash if, oh God, that's difficult.

663
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:43,780
You got to wash your hands of it.
Um,

664
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,120
I dunno if I could do that.
I,

665
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,210
I mean I would just start, uh, at
some point if she stayed with them,

666
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:54,800
I would just start openly teasing of

667
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,683
cool.

668
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,850
Hey, what do you say? They're
there? They're couch face, huh?

669
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,700
Yeah,

670
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,350
whatever his name is.
Mike. Hey Mike. What's,

671
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,320
what's your favorite couch to sit on
when you're not looking for a job,

672
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,860
you know? Hey Mike, what you, what's your
favorite? What's your favorite movie? No,

673
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:20,270
let me guess.
Peter Pan,

674
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,000
right when you get to be 12 years old
for the rest of your fucking life.

675
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,833
MMM.

676
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,390
That's what I would just, I
would roast him. I would rose.

677
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,490
You sell progressive, you know. Hey
Mike, what do you want 41 for? Uh,

678
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,970
what do you want for Christmas? You
want an apron? Oh, that's right.

679
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:39,804
You don't even cook.

680
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,220
How about one of those inflatable donut
thinks that truckers where when they sit

681
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:47,470
on their ass all day getting hemorrhoids,
uh,

682
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,370
you want to stand up desks
to play your video games on?

683
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,370
I would just, I, yeah, maybe do that. I
would just start roasting him. Alright.

684
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,330
Bulletproof glass. Dear
Billy. Bullet head, uh,

685
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,450
writing to you from the great city
of Philadelphia. A brief background.

686
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,770
I am Korean. Oh Dude. I was just watching
a great movie last night on Netflix,

687
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:13,290
a home of 50 to standup specials
this year, including one from me, um,

688
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,910
called, uh, I think it was
called Big Bang. It was called.

689
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,660
It was about the guy just taste movie
starts. His wife's just like, yeah,

690
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,700
I'm fucking out of here.
And he's a really nice guy.

691
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:27,570
And he never breaks the rules
and he just sort of snaps, uh,

692
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,770
was watching the beginning of it.
A really good acting shot really well.

693
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,703
MMM.

694
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,850
I'm going to start what I'm trying to
fuck with my, uh, my main page here.

695
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,721
You know,

696
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:44,310
I'd like more shit on music and I
would like a wider variety of music of,

697
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:44,970
of uh,

698
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:49,970
movies rather than just the American
bullshit that I already know is out there.

699
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:54,310
And it probably already
saw what is killing me is

700
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,650
that Ryan Gosling movie and
the dude from fucking, um,

701
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,280
the gladiator,
20 odd foot of grunt lead singer there.

702
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,280
What the fuck's his name? The guy threw
the phone at the person downstairs,

703
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:10,770
which is one of my favorite stories ever.
He shouldn't have done it,

704
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:14,580
but I just can't imagine the satisfaction.
You're not helping me with the phone.

705
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:16,770
I'm not going to bring the device.
You're not helping me with it.

706
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:20,310
I'm going to throw it at the person that
didn't help me. It's all wrong, but like,

707
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:24,690
it's so right on so many
levels. Um, Russell Crowe,

708
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,270
the Nice guys too. One of my favorite
fucking comedies of the last few years.

709
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,610
A sort of a modern day midnight run.
I love it, but it's not on Netflix.

710
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:38,310
Some hoping it's going to get on
this soon. All right, dear Billy,

711
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,870
bullet head writing to you from the
great city of Philadelphia. Philly.

712
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,890
A brief background. I am Korean and
my father owns two convenience stores.

713
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:47,940
Both started by,

714
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,240
okay.

715
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,810
Grandfather and grandmother in the
mid Seventies. God am I that old,

716
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,240
but your grandparents started businesses
in the 70s and I was alive and wow.

717
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,210
Already watching football
and collecting cards. Okay.

718
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,610
They worked their asses off to provide for
their family. That's right. Old School.

719
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:09,180
I love it. And make sure my dad
and brothers had a good life. Uh,

720
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,740
one of the stores is in a very bad part
of town and in the mid eighties while

721
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:15,800
working, my grandfather was
shot at and robbed. Oh No.

722
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,130
The Bolo went over his head
and missed his head by inches.

723
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,110
This wasn't the first time
he'd been robbed at gunpoint,

724
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,220
but the first time you've been shot at
this obviously scared the shit out of my

725
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:27,980
grandmother. And eventually they
installed a bulletproof window.

726
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,180
Since installing it,

727
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:32,300
they've had zero robberies and my
grandmother's sleeps a bit better.

728
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,460
My grandfather is 78 looks 55 and still
works four days a week. I love this guy.

729
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,650
Uh, just this week a law passed saying
that bulletproof glass is illegal.

730
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,710
The reason a city council woman said
that it made customers feel uncomfortable

731
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,370
and pass legislation to make them illegal.

732
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,440
What is going on in this country

733
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,730
that has got to be that what fucking
neighborhood does this privileged asshole

734
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:07,510
live in?
For starters,

735
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:12,511
it's insanity that they can
dictate something big based
on feelings and emotions

736
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,510
that will have physical
repercussions on the store owners.

737
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,830
Not to mention that if we are taking off,

738
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:22,030
we're talking about these barriers.

739
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,080
Not to mention that if we're talking
about how these berries affect emotions,

740
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,020
they certainly keep my
family's emotions in check,

741
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:33,030
worrying about other working in the store,

742
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,780
the woman who passed the law
as a huge content, a grade.

743
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm not a social justice warrior at all,
but this woman's legislation is racist.

744
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,930
Yeah, it sounds just like I live
in a safe white neighborhood.

745
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,500
I don't like going in being reminded
that people who don't look like me are

746
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:54,060
being shot. I mean it just, you know,
I just had a love today. It's also,

747
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,790
it don't,
it's only going to affect the pop,

748
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,400
the mom and Pop Asian and other emergent
grant owned stores and it won't have

749
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:07,790
any effect on the corporate change who
don't have any family working the counter

750
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:12,680
and won't feel the financial repercussions
of a robbery. None. The problem is, uh,

751
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:16,700
she's black and no one has the
balls to call her racist. Oh,

752
00:45:16,701 --> 00:45:20,840
I assumed she was white so I
guess I'm racist. She is though.

753
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,450
She is though.
My question is,

754
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:27,350
I don't know how she's racist to you
is should I stand outside city hall,

755
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,280
City Hall?

756
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,260
I said silly hall with a sign stating
she's a racist or just a Twat.

757
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,870
Um,
no,

758
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,770
what I would do is I would try to contact
the local news people cause that's a

759
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,880
great story and if you still have the
bullet hole and all that stuff will get

760
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:45,140
dad on this guy grandfather
almost got killed.

761
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,423
MMM.

762
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,480
Is this Oprah? I mean, who said
this? This is crazy. Uh, she, uh,

763
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:57,150
Huxtable um,

764
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,980
is that racist for me to assume
that just because she's black,

765
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:05,670
that she had some point? Must have
lived in a tough neighborhood. Right?

766
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,210
Is that racist on my end or are there
not enough Huxtable black people.

767
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,930
Rapid. So my idea of, of what the
neighborhood's ally. I mean, who knows?

768
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:19,470
I mean this, this opens a giant can of
worms, but at the end of the fucking day,

769
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,950
I think that, uh, you should be able to,

770
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:26,130
I think that that should
be not the decision.

771
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,640
Okay.

772
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,270
Of the government. That should be the
decision of the person who got shot at,

773
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,100
are you comfortable with rolling the
dice that the next one also won't hit you

774
00:46:36,101 --> 00:46:36,934
in the head?

775
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,663
MMM.

776
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,490
This is what I would do. I would not
take it down. I wouldn't take it down.

777
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,830
And if they force you to take
it down, I would, that's,

778
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,080
I would make a giant stink about it
is what I would do. And I wouldn't,

779
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:57,730
don't say she's racist. Don't say
she's a Twat. Don't do any of that.

780
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,000
Just what you want to do is you want
to keep the story about how the,

781
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,080
the bullet missed your grandfather by
inches and I'm much more comfortable,

782
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:08,980
your grandmother is now with the
bulletproof glass and just say,

783
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,180
and just you killed the, the, you
kill the other person with kindness.

784
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,510
I respect her opinion and blah,
blah blah. But we work here.

785
00:47:16,511 --> 00:47:20,320
She does not work in these stores. Um, you
know, I'm sure she does wonderful work.

786
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,070
He just keep doing that.
And um,

787
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,270
and then,
uh,

788
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:33,690
I would to think that someone in the
State Department or whatever they are is

789
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:36,130
going to be looking at this story going,
okay,

790
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,530
now if we take down the bulletproof glass
and God forbid somebody in there and

791
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:45,820
get shot and killed,
what is the state's going to get sued?

792
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,183
MMM.

793
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,470
I would mention that. Just say, listen,
I'm not trying to cause a problem here,

794
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:56,680
but like if something happens
to anybody working in my store,

795
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,160
because you know, the bulletproof glass
is taken down, then I am going to hold,

796
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,730
you know,
whatever the,

797
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:08,440
the state of Pennsylvania or the
city of Philadelphia and that woman's

798
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:11,910
specifically,
I'm going to hold them responsible.

799
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,310
That has got to be the dumbest
thing I've ever heard of

800
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,330
who installs bulletproof glass.
Who does that?

801
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,840
Places where people
get robbed at gunpoint.

802
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,220
Okay.

803
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,970
Okay. And they still have the balls to
stand there the next day and you know,

804
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:31,550
so I can walk in to buy a
paper and fucking Kit Kat.

805
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,940
Don't they have the right
to feel comfortable.

806
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,623
Okay.

807
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,890
I mean, yeah, that's, that's,

808
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,050
that's fucked up.
I got to tell you as a white person,

809
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:48,700
I'm actually psyched that that was finally
not somebody white doing that. Hey,

810
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,380
finally it wasn't us. Um, so that's
the way I would go about that.

811
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:56,950
I'd kill them with kindness and a,
and then just sort of, you know,

812
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,100
vaguely put it out there. Maybe have a
lawyer down there. Just go on. Like I,

813
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:02,130
I can't see how this,

814
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,980
the city of Philadelphia would not be
held accountable if something like this

815
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:08,980
happens. I mean you, you need to
have some sort of stricter gun laws.

816
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,870
We need to solve a whole
bunch of other problems.

817
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,450
But before you have the hardworking,

818
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,320
honest citizens of this great city being
put into this level of peril because it

819
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,490
upsets one person in their mood that
they're reminded that there are bad people

820
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:27,860
in the world. Okay. Cause would you
have to remember everybody is you,

821
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:28,940
there's two things you,

822
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,770
this does the way you wish the world is
in the way it really is and you have to

823
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:37,510
act accordingly. All right. And that's
it. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year.

824
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:42,511
I'll check in on you on Thursday and a
hope you guys all have a great Christmas

825
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:44,890
hung out, but I don't know it was,
Hanukkah is still going. Yeah.

826
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,800
How many days are in Hanukkah?
I Dunno. I have no idea.

827
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:50,840
So now on the ninth day of Hanukkah,

828
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:55,370
my true love gave to me a kwanza.
Whenever that is,

829
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,250
I don't pretend to know. I don't
pretend to be informed. Okay.

830
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:02,640
But I hope all of you enjoy
your day. All right. That's it.

831
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,060
Okay. And if he got a gun,
leave it at home. Just going
to buy a fucking candy bar.

832
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:07,950
You content. All right, I'll,
I'll see you on Thursday.
