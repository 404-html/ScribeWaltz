1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,740
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:06,741
It's bill burr and it's time for a another
special edition of the Monday morning

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,900
podcast. If you new to my podcast, you
probably say, Hey, what's his special,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,980
what's a special one? Usually I'm here
by myself laying in my fucking underwear,

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:18,510
running my yap, but every once in a while
I have a special guest and uh, this,

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,920
this person will not let you down.

7
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:23,760
This is one of my great friends in this
business is one of the funniest bastards

8
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:24,660
I haven't met in my life.

9
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:29,661
He has a new special coming out on
Netflix called mouthful of shame on a,

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:35,310
that's already funny on March 14th
please welcome the legendary Jim Norton.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,210
Thank you bill.
That's a nice intro.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,060
I don't know how to handle nice
things being said about me. I know.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,230
Does it make you
uncomfortable with people?

14
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:44,560
I was going as big as I could
go through when you score me.

15
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:48,510
One of my great friends, one of the
best comics I ever saw. Just listen,

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,290
just watching you squirm over there. I
can handle personal things are a Gar away.

17
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,850
We are from one another.
It is odd.

18
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,610
My manager's kind of saying they're
uncomfortable with this fucking giant cock

19
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:00,850
bulge in the middle.
It looks like a retired figure skater.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,540
Sorry. All right. Anyways,
I can handle personal like,
because we are great friends,

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,290
but any type of compliments of
work, I can't. It makes me so like,

22
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,050
do you like watching clips of yourself?
I'm going to torture you for this.

23
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,640
Drives me nuts, dude. I watched he,

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,360
we get to watch a clip of yourself when
they bring you back and then the people

25
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:22,740
in the room like, ah, Yay. That was
good. It's so fucking [inaudible].

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,890
If you ever do a talk show
and then they're light and
they play either something

27
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:31,300
you've already done or whatever you're
promoting, I literally will, uh, you know,

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,350
if they cut to it and I actually look to
monitor to see if the crowd's watching

29
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,390
it at home and then I just literally,

30
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:41,320
I'll put my fingers in my ears if I have
to. I'll start humming now. Humiliating.

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,330
It's horrific.
Do it man.

32
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,960
I can't watch because then they
feel like they're fake laughing.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,340
Like they don't really like it.
They're just playing along to me polite.

34
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,400
I feel like they're just kind of
being nice to little Jimmy Norton.

35
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,400
They just being polite to me.
The only way I can watch

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,840
myself as if I filmed myself at
a club and I'm just watching it.

37
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:58,920
But the second that I would,

38
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,880
if I knew it was going to be uploaded or
broadcasted and I know that everybody's

39
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:06,690
going to see it immediately, I'm like, oh
my God, why did I do that with my hand?

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,960
What did this fucking sell?
Everything immediately. It's horrific.

41
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,880
But having said that,
I uh,

42
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,790
I actually made sure my last
special that I sat through it.

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,120
I sat through a couple of times to make
sure that at least I had like the look

44
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,950
of it,
the look of it right now.

45
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,950
Did you do that with your new special
mouthful of shame that comes out in March?

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,230
I'm going to hype the shit out of this.
It's funny. Yeah, I did it obsessive.

47
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,900
I probably seen it about 60 times,
but just in editing,

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
like I don't mind watching it to edit.
Like I go point by point over both shows.

49
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,890
I want, I know exactly what I want from
the late show Polish from the early show.

50
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,240
I'm really anal about it. That's
good. That's good to have. Yeah.

51
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,110
Cause I don't trust that
like anyone else it,

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,620
Netflix is easier cause
there's no commercials you
have to worry about and they

53
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:50,250
don't give a shit if it's 56 minutes for
promos it can be an hour and two hour

54
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:53,100
and three. So I was very comfortable
doing that. But like you said,

55
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,840
as soon as somebody else in the room,

56
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,180
I want to hang myself but
I can do it alone all day.

57
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,830
Cause I know I'm doing it as part of,
it's still part of the work.

58
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,290
But once it's done I'm like
I can never watch it again.

59
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,690
Oh I walk out of the room second
other people in to watch it.

60
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,850
Oh Hey can I see a thing here?
And absolutely.

61
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,220
And then they sit down and I
closed the door and walk out.

62
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,650
Could you watch it with Nia? Could
you watch it with someone you really,

63
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:14,330
really close to if like it's not like
somebody you need to impress her.

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,070
I just don't have to be standing up and
would be standing up with my fucking

65
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,450
hands on top of my head like that.
Like, Eh, is it good? Is it suck?

66
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,600
I'd be doing that the whole time.
And she literally gets mad going shut.

67
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,360
She knows that this point, Nia
knows to be like, you know,

68
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,910
she'll just come up and say, Hey, I
watched your special, it was good.

69
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,410
Or I watched this, it was good and blah
blah. And I go, okay, good. You know,

70
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,410
like if some, if a parts coming
up that you don't like legal, I,

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,010
and I hated the way I did this
thing like right before it happens.

72
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,431
Cause you like,

73
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,170
you don't want them to watch
it and pretend to like it
when you know it's not it,

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,670
it's fucking psycho. Have that thought
buttons. It comes out like this. I just,

75
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,150
I just go, ah, it's just a noise.

76
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:53,170
I just yell over over and it just,
it will bother her.

77
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,740
But I've also learned
that, uh, yeah, it just,

78
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,830
that you're going to think it's way,
way worse than it fucking is.

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,320
But don't you find the comedians who are
so comfortable watching themselves saw

80
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,500
something wrong with that? Man, I can't,

81
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:09,220
I keep your eye back could literally
watch a fucking marathon of their entire

82
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:13,210
career and be oh yeah, I love that
sport coat. I loved when I wore that.

83
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,330
The way I roll those sleeves up.
I absolutely love this one.

84
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,930
It was a dog and cat thing.
Oh you're gonna love this.
You know I've been a loop.

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,420
I've, I'm not a loop a tear watching
Robert Klein videos cause I,

86
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,690
we are having him coming in and I,

87
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:28,720
and he's one of my idols and I'm watching
like Robert Klein from the tonight

88
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:32,440
show in 81 82 83 watch them on
74 on soul train or whatever.

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,540
He was fucking great man.

90
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,230
Robert Klein is a guy that most people
don't mention like no one talks about

91
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,460
Robert Klein anymore.
As much as I mentioned prior and Carl and,

92
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:44,630
and Robert Client is the most
underrated guy I think to ever.

93
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,580
Seinfeld always gives him a bunch of
props and was talking like how he, he was,

94
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,410
I think that was one of his guys.
He liked Cosby and Robert Klein I believe.

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,150
And um, I forget how he put it,
but he was like sort of their age,

96
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,860
like when he was still in those things
in the 70s and he was going to colleges,

97
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,260
like he was like that age part of that
generation. So he was kind of there.

98
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,140
Thank keep like Carlin
was more of a sixties guy,

99
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,130
even though he blew up
in the 70s. I think, um,

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,500
people from that generation
remembered them, but it's,
it's weird how some people,

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,000
despite their contributions will kind
of slip through the cracks like that.

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,410
It's, I find with most people
that when that are like,

103
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,370
that they're not into self promotion.
So if you're not spoon feeding it,

104
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,360
like the amount of fucking journalists out
there, if you just tell them, you know,

105
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,470
like, uh, I'm one of the edgiest
guys on the set, like, oh,

106
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,880
well what not that's tuned to stripe.
But if you're, you're like the, um, uh,

107
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,580
I would always like to, I dunno, I would,

108
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,990
I would equate it to Detroit
that calls itself hockey town.

109
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,800
Like they gave themselves a fucking
nickname. Like why are you a hockey town?

110
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,890
Wouldn't it at least be Montreal,
Montreal Canadians.

111
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,200
They have the most fucking uh,
you know,

112
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,160
championships they've got the fans will
literally drive out of town. I mean,

113
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,270
why, because you're that, well no
one Michael Jackson the king of Pop,

114
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,051
not saying he wasn't good,

115
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,290
but he kind of gave himself
that like right that nickname.

116
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,320
But like have a lot of hacks do that and
nobody thinks that somebody will be a

117
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,700
big enough asshole to give
themselves a nickname.

118
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:12,890
So people just kind of go with it.

119
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,040
Like people must have called him the
king of pop cause nobody can be that

120
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,070
fucking narcissistic to give himself
the nickname, the king of pop.

121
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:19,731
But he probably did.

122
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,470
And the press loves them because
they write the story for them.

123
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,170
That's why they'll love a Rex Ryan.

124
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:27,230
But hate bill Belicheck like Bella
check is smart enough to be like,

125
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,500
you constantly going to take any little
thing that I say and turn it into bolts

126
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:33,290
and board material. That's why he
stands that gun, you know they're good.

127
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,170
And I think next week's going to
be a tough game and just taking a,

128
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,830
why don't we get time and then they
want a guy like Rex Ryan go look,

129
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,180
oh gonna win the Super Bowl.
Then they love him.

130
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,000
I didn't come here to kiss the ring.
The I'm going to go in there,

131
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,440
we're going to shove it right up
their ass. And they're just like,

132
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,720
like before he's done talking,
their article is written. Yeah.

133
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,440
Milania go foreign 12 yeah.
I Love Rex Ryan.

134
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,020
I love what a priority is. I live
with that. He loves his wife's feet.

135
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,330
He's the best one. He
loves his wife too. Yeah,

136
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,030
he does know his wife keeps him
on the rails. I swear to God,

137
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,890
if he didn't have that guy
would ate himself to death.

138
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,560
I see it like all that
shit talk and he does.

139
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,170
You see like that's why I love that guy.
When I watch him,

140
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,880
like he's his flaws. I'm
like, Oh my God, this guy,

141
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,890
he's a shit show.
This guy is a shit show.

142
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:17,960
And he loves his wife to
death because she saved them.

143
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,310
You totally see the whole thing. Yeah.
He's a disaster. He's a disaster.

144
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,230
I was trying to say it in a
nice way. Yeah, but he is.

145
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,060
But there's something endearing
about that and not, you know,

146
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,940
I just started watching football again.
I can't care about it. Uh, I'm like, wow,

147
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,510
you're the biggest one. We
would come up. You were huge.

148
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,960
Campbell's always fan and then you were
huge Yankee Fan. I just, I stopped,

149
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,940
I started going on the road more and more.

150
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,560
I just stopped caring
as much and I'm like,

151
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,620
I'm putting in so much effort to these
guys and I meet them and they don't give

152
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,770
a shit that I'm alive. I had a couple
of bad experiences with athletes on,

153
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:49,250
I remember done. Yeah, I was wrong
about the Jeter thing. I was a baby.

154
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:52,100
I really act like a little douchebag.
I was fucking rat.

155
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,300
He was a deck to nighttime,
but I way overreacted on the air.

156
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,260
I'm embarrassed by that.
Well, if you, if you,

157
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,840
if you go to the psychology
of the way you overreacted,

158
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,400
it wasn't really just your love
for the guys and the team. Yes.

159
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,950
You are a jilted lovers.
Patrice used to always say absolute lover.

160
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,180
That's exactly what it is. I
mean, you know, uh, the, the,

161
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:12,160
the husband that becomes a stalker is
the guy that was obsessed with his white,

162
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,510
like, you know, that's what I
was, I was obsessed with them.

163
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:17,360
And then they didn't love me more than
my biggest meltdowns was gene Simmons

164
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
because he hurt my feelings.

165
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,970
He blew me off and I wanted a photo and
he was kind of a dick about it and it

166
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,450
just ruined me and I fucking
killed him on the radio about it.

167
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,000
And I kind of felt bad because he was
nice to me. The next time I saw him,

168
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,180
I met him one time. He was teasing
me about losing my hair and shit.

169
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,320
I just so wanted to be like,
dude,

170
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:37,040
do you think of anybody's buying that
fucking Darth Vader helmet wearing a walk

171
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,850
in your fucking head?

172
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,460
That's terrible that he
as Chewbacca his hairline

173
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,570
dude. It is like shoe Polish, black.

174
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:50,480
I mean you can you talk to the guy
and your kids kid not even look at.

175
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:53,930
But what I love about him is he would
sit here and laugh right along with you

176
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,720
and not give a fuck and then just scribble
down Chewbacca with hair and the next

177
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,960
day they'd be a picture of him dressed
as Chewbacca with some his shit written

178
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:05,370
on it and he would make $1 million on
unreal unapologetically go make $1 million

179
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,190
off of it. He really doesn't care. You
don't. One thing I like about Gina,

180
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,300
and this is one thing that Dee Dee,

181
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,350
Dan rather interviewed him and he
talked about his, he's a patriotic guy.

182
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,100
Like nobody loves America more than
Gene Simmons because his mother was in a

183
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,340
concentration camp and she came here and
when he was a kid and he remembers he

184
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,980
did. I think he was Iranian are the
biggest kiss fan. Yeah. Yeah. No,

185
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:30,450
you're way off. This is about
as far off. Yeah, he was.

186
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,860
He's a Brazilian. I thought he
was Irish. Yeah, he's a, he's a,

187
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,380
he was born in his name.
His real name is hime whites I think.

188
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:41,460
And he was born in Israel and he said his
mother's Zig high old when she came to

189
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,151
Ellis Island.

190
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:46,200
And he tells that story to Dan Rather
about how moving it was to have them tell

191
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,210
her to put her arm to it.
So you watch that and it's like,

192
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,970
that's the gene he should be showing
people. Wait, what did she do that,

193
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:52,320
cause she was,
she didn't know any better.

194
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,750
She came to America and she had to
pledge allegiance to America to get in.

195
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,330
That's what you did. So she's [inaudible]
and the guy put his, put her arm down.

196
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,310
It's like, no, you don't have to do that.

197
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,640
So if that made gene
come incredible patriot,

198
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,840
those people were so lucky back then
that there was no youtube that would have

199
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,020
ruined her life. She'll never run for
office. Never even opened a bakery.

200
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,580
You know the seek high,

201
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,840
a little girl is now coming of age
to make some pastries. Fuck you.

202
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:22,450
You Hitler love and pitch all of that
picture of her with the statue behind her.

203
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,470
Say Hi. Yeah, you're right.
There's no live in a town now.

204
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,660
Do you have any clips about you? I think
there's so many things on me that I,

205
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,440
that could ruin my life that I,
I think that it's almost,

206
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:34,770
there's so many that they can't at this
point. Things I've said or you know,

207
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:38,100
things I've admitted. Is it the things
in your life that you're like, fuck,

208
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,080
I wish I didn't talk about that way back.
Weddings.

209
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:44,670
I didn't realize that it could me
on me or do you not care? Yeah,

210
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,430
I mean I just,
I mean it's going happen.

211
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:49,110
It's inevitably going to happen to
everybody. They're going to go like, oh,

212
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:53,370
you said this in 2006 and be
like, oh, did I? All right,

213
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,700
well why don't you get into your
time machine and have me apologize.

214
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,860
The 2006 version of me.
You know what a lot of it is,

215
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:04,560
is I would equate it to the the Eddie
Murphy thing where Eddie Murphy delirious

216
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,731
and he did all that,

217
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,450
that material about gay people and
everybody laughed and nobody said, Shit,

218
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,090
I'm sort of gay. People
didn't, but mainstream did not.

219
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,750
And then when mainstream catches
up and starts to learn that, oh,

220
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:19,690
that's really hurtful and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
to gape, then all of a sudden,

221
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:23,040
and he's just like, you know, they talk
about, oh my God, they look the other way.

222
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,210
Bob, you know when you, when they talk
about that part of the special, they act,

223
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,930
it's like,
well where were you during that year?

224
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
I know you saw it and you sat there and
laughed at the same way I did. I did.

225
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,400
I didn't know that. I didn't know
what the Sh that it was to that level.

226
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:38,700
So I think you could do that
with anybody. Well, I think what?

227
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,900
Let's any off the hook, especially with
that type of material is the whole,

228
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,870
you know, I was giving her a ride. Excuse
me for that special young lady boy,

229
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,490
if that didn't make me
love Eddie, nothing. Well,

230
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,870
but like you have to that you're like,
Eh, all right, we get it. We get it.

231
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,040
Who knows he could for him. Who
knows? I get involved in people's

232
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,580
personal lives. I don't give a, I don't
either. And not in a judgmental way.

233
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,110
I love the fact when when things about
let's say any celebrity come out,

234
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,710
they could or could not be true.
It makes me like the more like,

235
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:09,340
it makes me understand like, yeah,
this, this is a public persona.

236
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,110
Like I feel bad for,

237
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,380
there's one major actor in particular
who miss male massage therapists said he

238
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,980
was doing stuff and I feel so bad
for this guy. I'm like, he said,

239
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,320
what did torture it is to live your life.

240
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:23,700
Being afraid you're going to get caught
or being for being who you are. Yes.

241
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,960
Oh God.
That's gotta be fun.

242
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:29,060
It's going to affect how much money you
make because of the, yeah, that's all.

243
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:29,894
It's all, you know, some,

244
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,070
a lot of that personal life shit that
kind of drove me away from ESPN because it

245
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,710
used to just be the games and they'd
show highlights and just seemed like a

246
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:42,430
bunch of people, you know,
broadcasting, it just loves sports.

247
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,730
But when they started to just keep like
delving into these people's lives and

248
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:50,710
trying to like do like the
controversy shit, I just, um, I dunno,

249
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,690
I just Kinda,
I got away from it after a while.

250
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,660
That's why I love the sports packages
and I just taped the games that I want to

251
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,100
watch.
I S I blow through the pregame and I,

252
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,450
and I never watched any
postgame analysis or anything.

253
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:04,150
I just watched the fucking
game and that's it. You know,

254
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:08,380
the Knicks recently handled
Hannibal Burress retreated
this thing where they did

255
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:09,770
the first half with,
uh,

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,730
you went to the game and there wasn't a
bunch of people running around shooting

257
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,010
tee shirts at you every time
there was a stoppage of play,

258
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,570
not a bunch of music playing.

259
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,090
And all I would have loved to
have gone to that game. Yeah,

260
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,530
it is distracting and they think we need
constant stimulation and constant noise.

261
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,440
Like no, we're at the game. I'm
okay just watching the game.

262
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,110
I'm okay if it's the
third inning and it's a,

263
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:31,880
you know it two in one and
this one I don't need I

264
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,610
fucking manic stop it.
Basketball's the worst.

265
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,720
Basketball is the worst just because they
run out into the court and it could be

266
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:44,910
like a really critical part of the game.
One Oh three one oh three timeout did.

267
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,160
It's like time for like one more shot
and these fucking assholes guy comes out

268
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,550
in a gorilla suit, tee shirts at
you and shit and it's just kind of,

269
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,470
it becomes like a Chucky cheese.

270
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,840
You supposed to be teaching
your kid the game here,

271
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,620
like this is really important and there's
all these people at that extra excited

272
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:03,220
look on their faces. They're
holding the tee shirt. I always,

273
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,190
I sit through all of that hoping
that I'm going to, you know,

274
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,990
nobody ever sits with me,
but I have this,

275
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,140
this is my little fucking dream is that
I'll sit and everyone else would just

276
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,230
stare at fucking daggers at them
and they won't do it anymore.

277
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,760
I don't give a fuck about a bunch of
con smiling, jumping off trampolines,

278
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:21,400
dunking the ball. It's actually
embarrassing. The white people like,

279
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:24,640
look how little we can jump.
It's humility. We need this here.

280
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,470
I saw that at a suns game. I had a great
time at the game, but that bullshit.

281
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,590
They're like, yeah, that calm look
crazy trampoline fucking guys.

282
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:36,940
And it's like fucking nine
white guys coming out there.
We don't need gymnastics.

283
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,990
Yeah. There's nobody blocking them
either. And there's Matt Paul.

284
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,080
It's like a nerf hoop,
like taken to the next level.

285
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,760
I'm sure someone's going to tweet me.
Oh,

286
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:50,680
actually it's really hard combining
those sports. But um, I hate mascots.

287
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,340
I think they're unnecessary

288
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,530
and they're stupid and they, they, they,
they child up the game. Like the, I,

289
00:14:57,531 --> 00:15:02,210
we interviewed the Philly fanatic in 2001.
There's one I like to Philly fanatic.

290
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,170
Oh he's smells. Those
uniforms stink. I too.

291
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,430
I remember about being next to the
affiliate for night. The stench.

292
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,350
I'm sure they all smell like that,

293
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,010
but they all smell guess man than you
know you're out there wearing some for

294
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,530
fucking outfit. It's
horrendous. And to me they just,

295
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,630
they do nothing to make me enjoy the game.

296
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,950
That's what I kind of always liked about
like I hated the mets cause fucking Mr

297
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,570
met and that big store.

298
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,810
I love the lack of
imagination of that one.

299
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,870
It's just a guy with
a baseball for a head.

300
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,430
Yeah, Mister. And then they named them
after the team. I literally is stupid.

301
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,200
Really comes off as the first idea. What
are you going to, how about Mister Matt?

302
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,640
Go ahead. He's got a
baseball head. He's a guy.

303
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,220
Call him mister. We played
during Valentine's Day. Maybe
we going to miss his men.

304
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I actually love a mascot standing on a
street corner holding up a tax tax thing

305
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,020
and doing a stupid dance.
When I'm sitting at a red light.

306
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,510
It makes me laugh my fucking ass off.
I don't know what it is.

307
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,700
I think they should have them.

308
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,690
Just mascot should be like in
traffic like every 200 yards.

309
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:03,430
It's just somebody doing a stupid
dance just to entertain you.

310
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,960
That's what I need.
Entertainment,

311
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,840
not when I'm fucking attic
at an entertainment thing.

312
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't need entertainment during the,

313
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,040
in between the moments of entertainment,

314
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,530
you don't need extra entertainment
and it's not even entertaining.

315
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,590
Mascot should not entertaining.
I never watched a mascot and like,

316
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:20,980
oh that was kind of funny or cute.
It's insulting and it's related.

317
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,290
I would say the Philly freak,
the San Diego chicken,

318
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,460
there's a couple of classic ones
where they were actually funny. Um,

319
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,840
that's about it. I always feel
bad for the truck when they slide,

320
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,590
when they run in to take the big slide,
go ah, the little guy couldn't do it. No,

321
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:40,250
I like when like the Philly frequent walk
up and fuck with the umpires and mess

322
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:43,210
with people on the other other team and
stuff like that. It's, it's, I dunno,

323
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,170
like that's one of the classic ones,

324
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:50,171
but I forget the red sox they
tried to have on a long time ago,

325
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:53,990
it was called the Fenway freak
and he lasted like seven games.

326
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,310
People would just pelting
him with shit ain't,

327
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,450
you know what was like the 70s this is
when you could actually go there and be a

328
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,910
fucking alcoholic scare and children.

329
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,830
And then they brought this guy
out in a fucking, you know,

330
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,190
muppet outfit and he just got the
Philly freak. But now they have a,

331
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:13,490
Oh this is just the green monster one.
Yeah. And it's called Wally Wally, right?

332
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,750
Oh, it's like a pun. It's
a mascot with a pond name,

333
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,410
Pun for what the park is known
for. And then, then, yeah.

334
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:24,380
And then they swing sweet Caroline
during these seven things stretch.

335
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,640
Just when I thought your YMC horseshit
at the Yankees game, trust me, it's bad.

336
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,580
But at least the, you know, was the
grounds crew that kind of looked like,

337
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,414
all right,

338
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,690
like they took this boring thing and
made it entertaining a little bit.

339
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Like that was kind of interesting to
watch people still spell out why MCA was

340
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,310
just, yeah, that, that's, that
was always tough to watch.

341
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,180
I don't need to wash the grounds crew
was singing what was probably the gay

342
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,130
anthem for 19,
for the 70s.

343
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,900
I don't need to see them fucking
saying that every seventh inning. Yeah.

344
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,120
That might've been the, uh, like,

345
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,330
like they were so gay than the
shift that they were doing,

346
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,400
I think would actually be
offensive to gay people.

347
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm a construction worker and I have
the big mustache and I'm a leather guy.

348
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:06,210
We like, dude, like literally now
gay groups would be like, you know,

349
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,100
you're perpetuating stereotypes.

350
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,090
We go to work in gray suits just
like you do or whatever. But um,

351
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,150
that's fucking hilarious. Do you
remember Victor Willis the lead say,

352
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,010
did you know they were, I didn't know
they were gay. I was a big village.

353
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,570
My father took me in to
see them when I was a kid.

354
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,280
It was them in sister sledge was the
opening band and I didn't know legendary,

355
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,170
you know, disco show are absolutely,
that was like for the mighty.

356
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,850
If it was either them or kiss was the
first one and I didn't know they were gay,

357
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,210
but I found out like I didn't know what
the village was. Greenwich village thing.

358
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,240
I had no idea what any of that meant. I
didn't either. I thought it was cool to,

359
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,080
oh that's the construction worker
got YZ construction worker. Yeah.

360
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:41,310
I didn't know where musicians,

361
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,170
why is he just a bass player or the Indian
Phillippi rose. He's still, he's still,

362
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:48,210
he's still my favorite. I thought he
was awesome. I loved this head dress.

363
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,300
I really did. I actually liked
the one who looked like a,

364
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,250
somebody who hit on Al Pachino and crews
and Glenn Glenn was the one I liked.

365
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:00,300
I thought he was bad ass like that's
why I never saw a rob Halford from a

366
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,130
million miles away because I'm part
of that last generation of way.

367
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:04,440
If you wore a bunch of
leather and had a mustache,

368
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:07,530
you would like some bad ass bad ass cycle.
I didn't understand that.

369
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:09,750
There was a whole other side to that.
I had no idea.

370
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,760
But now you look back
on old Helford video.

371
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:14,270
I'll go back on Youtube and watch
old Judas priest from like a,

372
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,730
from that domain was that contract.
They didn't like 83 and Philly.

373
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,410
There was that. That was the, that
just live aid or whatever it was.

374
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:23,280
Do you watch priest from that and
you're like, oh, how did we not know?

375
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,840
It was so obvious and I love the fact
that he came out and nobody gives a fuck.

376
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:31,350
It's just how offered, you know, he's
like a big power top, you know, he just,

377
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,600
he's fucking ramrod. I, I've just
loved the guy. Nobody gives a shit. Oh.

378
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,630
I think he grew into that role.
He looked like a bottom early on.

379
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,380
I think as he got older, you know, he got
a little more comfortable with himself.

380
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,540
There's a story that he has a big Dick
and he puts some guy in the hospital,

381
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,090
Florence, he told me his story,
anything, if you put a guy in Ohio,

382
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,020
he didn't put any person in the hospital
with your Dick. You're a legend.

383
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,400
And I heard that there was some,

384
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,990
some hairdresser who for years one and
half or to find finding it's consensual.

385
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,110
Let's put that out there before that
clip gets you in and they're over 18.

386
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,210
I mean, I'm talking, you know,

387
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,550
the asterisk is that it's an adult in
a consensual relationship or consensual

388
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,670
encounter and you willingly allow him
to put your Dick and you line up in the

389
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:10,260
hospital.
That guy's a legend.

390
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,410
I'm just picturing the
interview afterwards with
the fucking another person.

391
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:17,900
At what moment did you realize you were
in over your head? When I was, when I,

392
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,030
when I told him he has to pull it out
and I realized it was still four more

393
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:21,840
interesting.
Yeah.

394
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,270
There was some moment where he
realized this was a bad decision,

395
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,300
but I heard he was bugging Alford to
fuck him and he was a hairdresser or

396
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:31,260
whatever he was. It was odd. The
whoever the guy is that how for oh,

397
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,980
fucked intend to the hospital and a
health word finally did it. And uh, he,

398
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,890
the Guy Wound, oh, you hate
fucked them. All right, fine.

399
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:41,100
I'll give you the rock star Dick. Yeah,
I hear he's packing like an animal.

400
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,980
So there's nothing but good, good thing
you think you did it right before a show.

401
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:46,710
So he's wearing all that
fucking awful studied shit.

402
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,610
It's just the sound of your screaming
in his fucking milky thighs rubbing

403
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:55,930
together leather pants. I'm sorry
everybody. Sorry. Just paint that visual.

404
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,720
He smells good too.
I interviewed him before a show one time.

405
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,910
Me and this guy Troy from
the show went to the,

406
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:05,140
I guess it was a garden or wherever they
were were the metal and he smells so

407
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,450
fucking good.
So I bought the same Cologne.

408
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,510
A lot of times I'll smell Cologne that
British rock stars have on and I'll buy

409
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:13,420
it. And it's very specific. It
never, because they smell gay.

410
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,690
British rock stars are just British
rock stars. No Ozzy's not gay.

411
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,490
Ozzie's Ozzie's the best
smelling guy in music.

412
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:22,100
Ozzie smells better than anybody
a rob Halford smells great.

413
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,080
You would never guess that with Aussie
ass. Not saying that. You know, just,

414
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,640
you wouldn't think that he smelled.
You wouldn't,

415
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,030
you wouldn't associate him with like
a really rich guy smell. But Ozzy,

416
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,820
you can smell from down the hall and he,
he has it,

417
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:37,390
I think in his hair or whatever.
It's this British Cologne and he fucking,

418
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,650
he smells fucking amazing.
He smells amazing.

419
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,230
How food also smelled good,
but it never smells good on me.

420
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,830
I buy it and I just smell like garbage.
How do you know I can,

421
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:49,900
I smell it on myself and I'm like,
it stinks.

422
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,450
I thought you can't really smell
yourself. Oh yeah, the Cologne. You can,

423
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:56,580
I put it on and it's great
for a minute. And I put like,
sure. I'm like, oh, suck it.

424
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,250
I said, yeah, but that's self
hatred. No, but I, I don't,

425
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,750
I never get compliments on it. And no
one's ever said, hey, you smell great.

426
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,880
And that like, you know, when Ozzie
walks you, people like you fucking smell.

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,110
That's the first thing I noticed about,

428
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,840
first time I met him was with Jim
Florentine in [inaudible] 97 and the first

429
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:12,760
thing that struck me is this guy smells
amazing. They're not getting enough ass.

430
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,040
You know what I mean?
They've got a shell like Jesus Christ.

431
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,620
That's where you got to fucking send
your wife into the next room. Yeah,

432
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:18,454
go get some.

433
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,960
You host that shit off of you police
so I can still be married at the end of

434
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,930
this. How funny is it
that he just, you know,

435
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,610
he had the whole thing with shower where
you get caught having the affair and

436
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:31,420
he's not, I loved the damage control.
Ozzie does it in an interview. He's like,

437
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:35,020
well, I'm a fucking, I'm in a fucking
band. Or No, like that's his reasoning.

438
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,240
Like what do you expect now
that that was the greatest?

439
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,610
That's something you say
to your friends though.

440
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,800
You don't say that in an
interview after you play.

441
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,710
My fucking said that I am too for if it
doesn't get them divorced, I'm happy.

442
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,520
He said, look, I fucking,

443
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,590
do you mind if fucking people that aren't
in his position that can easily sit

444
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:53,620
back, you know you'll fucking
life is, you're not in a band.

445
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,680
You don't have all these women fucking
throwing themselves at you. You're like,

446
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,900
what the fuck is he supposed to do?
I know. I know. But you how to use,

447
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,420
you're like a grounded guy. Like I
really mean that. Like I look at you,

448
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,140
you're married,
you have a baby and like you,

449
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:11,141
you're a fucking booze gym that's in
the green room until everybody leaves.

450
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,920
And I boost theory.
Really? Yeah, I admire,

451
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,990
I sit there and I just
tell stories with people.

452
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,960
They bring a bottle in and I'm
with like four or five of them.

453
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:23,050
I did it the last night. I was
just in a, what the fuck was,

454
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:26,800
I stand up live in Phoenix and they
brought it to have this bottle for us and

455
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:29,170
for three days we just would,
you know, taking a third,

456
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,810
a third and a third and by last night,
you know, we'd just sitting in there,

457
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,470
I go to cigar bars. I just
basically go. But dude,

458
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:37,720
I always used to look like
fucking Ralph mouth too.

459
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,640
So it was never really a problem.
You know what I mean?

460
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:42,880
That wasn't like a fucking
like Geraldo rest his soul.

461
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,880
I mean that guy was like a fucking great
in those, those guys, if you're funny.

462
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:49,740
And he had a, he had like a, I also
always had like a really, you know,

463
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,140
angry fucking energy.

464
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:56,141
So like most women who had even remotely
had a decent father or maybe an uncle

465
00:23:56,541 --> 00:24:00,080
that they spoke to had a nice conversation
once would be running for the hills.

466
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,000
And I would get these absolute fucking
lunatics that would come up to me.

467
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,500
And um, you know, so it kind of took
care of itself to be honest with you.

468
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,820
It is scary when you meet women and like
to girls you dated first or for awhile

469
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,030
when you realize I represent something
to her. Like I'm an average looking God.

470
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:19,670
And there's some girls
I've dated who are better,

471
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,230
lot better looking than I deserved.

472
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,450
And I knew that there were
mental things and I'm like,

473
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,040
I represent something weird to her.
It's a father, a mouthful of shame.

474
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,680
I would say that, you know, it's a
monster rain. I mean the names of your,

475
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,060
it's very, uh, I think you've carved out
quite a niche for you. Yeah. You know,

476
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:35,720
I got,
I figured,

477
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,230
I gotta be honest because I once
other girl tried to blackmail me,

478
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,410
I had to go and try to blackmail me
one time. She had no idea who I was.

479
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:45,530
And we had hooked up a few times. Yeah.
It was a money thing, not a big expense.

480
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:48,710
We had texts, a lot of dirty fantasies,
and then she wanted me to send her money.

481
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:50,900
She's tried to blackmail me and I'm like,
well,

482
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,360
I'll send you money to help you with this,
but I'm not doing it that.

483
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,111
And she goes,
well,

484
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:59,111
maybe all your friends would want to see
your fantasies played out on Facebook.

485
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,080
And I'm like, you really don't know who
you're talking to. And I, and I, I texted,

486
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,850
I said, I don't give a fuck. Everybody who
I know knows what I'm liking what I do.

487
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,410
Uh, at that moment I was grateful
to be me. Yeah. You gotta be what,

488
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,870
when you put it all out there and
you know, they can't catch it.

489
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,270
It's nothing funny.
You're one of the fun,

490
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,080
I wish that was a scene in a movie
watching somebody's thinking that they can

491
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:24,350
blackmail somebody and they just
completely don't give a shit. Do that.

492
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,540
How am I going to say the guy's name?
But that happened to a hockey player.

493
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,650
He was like in his forties
and he, um, Oh yes. Yeah.

494
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:34,820
He hooked up with some like 1,989 it was
legal at everything and she's just like,

495
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,180
I'm going to tweet this out,
you know, if you don't, blah,
blah, blah. He goes, what?

496
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:41,150
Then I slept with a smoking hot chick.
Half my age. He goes, God and do it.

497
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:44,390
I don't give a fuck. And she
did. Sometimes they will.

498
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,490
They will at times do it. She said she was
gonna. He said he didn't care. She did.

499
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:53,000
And he didn't give a fuck and
nobody else did. Oh my God,

500
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,880
this guy did something illegal. Yeah. She
really didn't have like a leg to stand.

501
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,810
He did what we'd all love to do.
Shame on him. Good for him. But,

502
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,720
but if you're married, if
you got killed, you know,

503
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:04,010
there's so many guys that they like,

504
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:08,420
I heard a lot of rappers get like
girls will, you know a special ladies,

505
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,920
a lot of rappers you know are,
are,

506
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:13,070
are a little on the DL as they
say about certain things and uh,

507
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,310
they get blackmailed a lot.
Like I've heard a lot.

508
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,940
A lot of times the girls will go,
yeah,

509
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:20,210
I want a $30,000 I'm going to start
fucking screaming in the lobby.

510
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,270
And there's been times of that stuff
has worked. It's a shame Jesus.

511
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,750
He can't just go, go ahead, go screaming
the lobby's stupid. Well you know what,

512
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,360
if everyone was like me,
you could and you like I wouldn't,

513
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,600
I wouldn't give a shit. I was like
that's what kills me. Like whenever a,

514
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,360
a controversy like that comes out,

515
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,270
like I like you were talking about that
guy with the massage therapist and all

516
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:38,631
that stuff.

517
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:42,650
I always just think like I cannot fucking
wait to go to his next movie just to

518
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,160
make type of shit go away

519
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,840
cause right to support it.
Yeah.

520
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,580
Cause even the worst case scenario is
they did something where they just fucked

521
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,700
up. They fucked up. What am I saying? The
guy goes on the road, he banks, you know,

522
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,850
fucks around and his wife
every that's between them.

523
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Does that mean I don't
like that song any better?

524
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,840
I those fucking people who do that shit.
Well they just go like, Oh fuck that guy.

525
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm done with this movie.
Rarely get done with those movies.

526
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,780
I'm done with this movie's when
his movies suck. You know, if he's,

527
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,790
if he's not out there,
you know, they'll say,

528
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,430
fucking people will still going to
mass every Sunday. The Catholic church,

529
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,300
it wasn't everybody. It's like, is
that really what you're thinking?

530
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:22,200
That's just your fear of dying and not
knowing where you go when you die and you

531
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,990
don't want to piss off the
invisible guy. Right. My buddy,

532
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,410
my brother said it the best. He goes,
it's talking about the Catholic Church.

533
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:30,810
He goes, dude, if that was any other
fucking business, they would be shut down.

534
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,490
Fucking shut down. I'm, I, I'm
still on, and I think of this a lot,

535
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,420
but the fact that you don't believe in
name calling, I've thought that a lot,

536
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:42,560
like how negative it is and bad it is.
And it's something,

537
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,300
and not that I've had cause to,
cause I'm single at this point,

538
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,800
but can an interrelationship
with the woman.

539
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,460
I've never done the Europe
fucking bitch and blah,

540
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,480
and I would never have thought. And,
but hearing you say that it's the, yeah,

541
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:57,690
I guess it really is a
damaging thing to just do it.

542
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,970
I can't kick because it builds up,

543
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,490
it builds up resentment because
people don't forget, like, uh,

544
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,740
I got this weird thing. If my wife goes,
you know, you're a fucking asshole.

545
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,710
I don't care. I know other guys
that would be like, you know,

546
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:14,310
you like that would actually, it would
hurt him in a way that they will as a man.

547
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:19,110
They wouldn't want to admit I don't
give a shit. Um, but like I, I,

548
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,800
I saw enough guys growing up doing that
you fucking bitch thing and everything

549
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,730
like that. And I just, I
just, I saw what that did. Uh,

550
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,670
I was a little kid and just saw it. I
just saw it. It just, it didn't look,

551
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:34,520
you know, this big deep voice yelling at,
you know, it just was not, it just, I,

552
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,410
I dunno. So I just made a vow is
just one of those things. I was like,

553
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,430
you know what,
I'm not doing that.

554
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:42,450
But then there was other stupid behavior
that I guess I didn't recognize them

555
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:46,440
then I repeated that, but that was the one
that, that I, I didn't do. So what we do,

556
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,283
she calls you an asshole.

557
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,790
You just tell me about what she's
doing is if I go real mature,

558
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,100
I wish I had the presence
of mind ice. I, uh, what,

559
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,370
what do I do? I, you know, I definitely
say the f word a lot, but I don't, um,

560
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,790
you know what, now that I have a daughter,
so I really, I just, I don't do that.

561
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,520
I'm not gonna fucking sit there
and screaming. You can't. Yeah.

562
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,980
When there's a baby in the room,
change that we can stay on.

563
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:14,340
My radio partner just had a baby and it's,
see everybody I know is having kids,

564
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,580
it gets, it changes the way
you do shit. Right? Yeah.

565
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,040
Because then there's that whole,
uh,

566
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,800
I think for the first time in your life,

567
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:27,390
you're actually aware of your behavior
affecting other people. Right.

568
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,230
With, you know, with your girlfriend or
your wife. It's an adult to adult thing.

569
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:36,030
So you really don't, you're like, oh, this
person is an adult. They can drive a car.

570
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,730
You know, I can say this stuff, this
isn't going to affect them, you know,

571
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,720
but it's when you have the kid
and, and it's just like, you know,

572
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,940
that this could actually affect
who they marry, right? Oh yeah.

573
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,550
This guy that literally, you
know, if I do what I'm, you know,

574
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,450
if I flip out right now
and I consistently do this,

575
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:59,470
this could literally drive my daughter to
a trailer park someday. Right. You know,

576
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,820
and,
and be one thing,

577
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:04,510
if I was just completely oblivious
that I could just sit at a bar, Go,

578
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,960
now she's a fucking loser. Get Out. She
grew up in a house. Now she said a thing,

579
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,290
but I am kind of aware of the effect
of it now and then I would have to sit

580
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:15,910
there and take on that kind of guilt. So,
um, plus, I don't know. I, I don't, um,

581
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,440
uh, just growing up there was a
lot of just the era when I grew up,

582
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:25,441
like every authority authority person
was just so not approachable as I said

583
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:29,230
this and this is what it is and you
shut the fuck up. And it was that just,

584
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:34,240
you know, that's kind of what
stoke the whole fire in me,
I think. So I try to, uh,

585
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,130
you know,
I think you go one of two ways.

586
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:38,770
You either repeated or you just
remember that. So like, um,

587
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,020
I actually got a really good comment
from somebody one time. It's like,

588
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:43,690
you know what? He goes, Mike, you should
got to come by. Come by my house. He goes,

589
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,860
my kids love you. And I was like,
really? He goes, yeah. He goes, they,

590
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,680
you talk to them like they're adults.
I wasn't even aware I was doing it.

591
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,910
Like I would be talking to like
is a 10 year old, right. Do you,

592
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:56,400
what grade are you in? Are you
getting homework now? Ah, that sucked.

593
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:57,041
The hated that.

594
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,800
Like I wasn't thinking that I was and
they kind of liked it that they were

595
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,060
talking to adult like,
oh this is,

596
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:05,140
this is somebody older who they think
knows everything he's saying how he hated

597
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:08,920
it. Kinda gave him making it. It made
it okay to be like, oh this sucks man.

598
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,730
I hope that did make them not do their
fucking homework but I would just,

599
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:15,940
you know, I would address it rather than
being like, no, you need to sit down,

600
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,740
you need to learn it. This is what life
is. It's sitting there doing shit get,

601
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:23,170
don't want to do like that's so much
that you learn that, that you like,

602
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,680
you don't think that you can actually
go out and achieve shit and like life

603
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:30,150
becomes like fuck,
when is this over just staring at an

604
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,430
cock and people saying that,
I think hepatitis don't even mean it.

605
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,910
They just think it should. An adult
as supposed to stay, like to say like,

606
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:39,170
you know what I mean? Can you sit out,
you buckled down your throat, you lie.

607
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,830
If I said that to anybody,
I would entirely be on shut up.

608
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,460
You don't fucking believe that I cannot
wait to tell my daughter. I don't know.

609
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,110
I cannot wait to tell it. Why is this
blah blah blah. And I'll just, I dunno.

610
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,780
I Dunno. Why be like, well you
know, cause I don't read. Why?

611
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,990
I don't know cause it makes me sleepy.
I'm just going to fuck brutal honesty.

612
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,900
I'm just gonna own up to it.
There's a lot of stuff.

613
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,250
Your dad isn't good at sweetheart.
Do you want some ice cream? Yeah.

614
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,570
Cause you want [inaudible] I'm
in the middle. Like I, you know,

615
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:08,170
I'm in a point where I'm 48 no wife,
no girlfriend. Like I, you know,

616
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,540
I don't know if I'm,
if I'm the best boyfriend candidate by,

617
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm tired of being single. Like
I'm, I'm kind of, oh, there you go.

618
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,540
That's where I think of it.
You got it

619
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,920
sick of it, right? Yeah. I got a no,
you know what I did was I finally,

620
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:22,610
I just looked at like what I was doing
and then, you know, we have to like,

621
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,170
I used to joke about that on stage.

622
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:29,030
I feel like the 90th fucking person
that doesn't go well and there's only so

623
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,150
long you been doing these chicks are
fucking psychos after a while. It's like,

624
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,770
what am I doing?
Okay

625
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,600
dude,
I chase him away in tech.

626
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:40,370
I've had some updated literally
for I lose in text message.

627
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,180
Oh, I'm so, I'm so like I want
to either talk dirty or I just,

628
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:47,310
I just want to keep pushing the envelope
and the next thing you know, um,

629
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,850
they stopped talking to me so I
know I'm doing something wrong.

630
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,680
It's not that then him not talk it over.

631
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,080
I'm just creeping them out on some level.
I don't know why.

632
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:57,340
That just reminded me this
last night I was watching, uh,

633
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,820
what does that fucking show
with Andy Cohen when he does
the wrap ups of the, uh,

634
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:06,500
the real housewives. Oh, I'm not a his
talk shows. Look what happens live. Yes.

635
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,560
That show that one.
So my wife always watches that show.

636
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,930
That's one of those crossovers
shows I have to watch what they're,

637
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,960
so we don't battle over the TV.
Right, right, right. So I'm watching,

638
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:19,820
it was Jennifer Lopez and I'm, oh Jesus
Christ, and just went blank on his, uh,

639
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,180
Ray Liotta Dude,
ray Liotta was fucking hilarious.

640
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,980
He just answers eight doesn't give a shit.

641
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,730
He just answered everything straight
up, straight up. They were like, what?

642
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,580
So for cocaine, like in
Goodfellas, like what did they use?

643
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:36,200
And it was like cocaine just to say that.
And they would be like, who's the most,

644
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,010
they played this thing, you can plead
the fifth. And He, oh yeah, he never,

645
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,390
he never pleaded. The fifth would
ask him. They asked him like, uh,

646
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,670
Oh, who's the worst kisser of, of anybody?
Easy you've been with this person.

647
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,470
But I suppose first and you know,
Andy's doing all the things.

648
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:56,120
So who was the worst kisser? Like this was
going to be the thing. He goes, uh, well,

649
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:59,780
I don't think I kissed any of them. And
he goes, well then who would you guess?

650
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:04,510
And he goes, oh, Sigourney weaver. Just
setting. They go, who's the worst actor,

651
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,840
most overrated actor or the 90s? And
he goes, most overrated. He goes bad.

652
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:12,620
I'd probably say Clint Eastwood. And then
somebody mumbled, blah, blah, blah, blah,

653
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:14,940
blah. But he's shown, he turns around,
he goes, I don't know, give a shit.

654
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:20,640
It's just like
he is kind of untouchable at this point.

655
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:25,380
He Israeli Yoda, he gets no, but it was
real. It wasn't found to be dangerous.

656
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:29,840
He literally goes, I don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit.

657
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,500
I'm fucking, I'm Ray Liotta.
And by the way, I, I am,

658
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,850
I don't give a shit what
a brilliant game that is.

659
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,910
Plead the fifth on one of these
three questions. Then what it'll do,

660
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,940
it was then it would then pass it over
to you and then you got to, you know,

661
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:44,810
and it's all this, this, uh, you know,

662
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:48,020
he does all the squirming questions. He
was asking like Jennifer Lopez. Okay.

663
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:51,430
When you, you know, how many, you've
been proposed to five times, did you?

664
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,030
Who did you say no to? And she's a
nice person. Doesn't want to say it.

665
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,910
And Ray Liotta was just sitting there
going, just plead the fifth on this.

666
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,150
I'll answer something like
he just completely didn't
give a shit or two of them

667
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:06,170
together. Yeah. Cause they're on that cop
show together. Oh, you know, it's fine.

668
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,990
I auditioned for that.
Uh, I did. Yeah, I did.

669
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:11,420
Doug Davidoff got the part and he lazy.
He,

670
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,270
I think he's better for that than I
am anyway. Not just acting ability,

671
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:15,990
but you know,
he looked more of the part of uh,

672
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,030
a kind of a slick like internal
affairs guy if that's what you got.

673
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,710
I didn't know Doug was on that shit.
Hey. Yeah, he's got a good party part.

674
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,740
Radioed into the comedy cellar
one night. Um, but you know,

675
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,190
if I'm not going to get it,
I'd rather see somebody I like yet.

676
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,320
That's great. Seen a glimpse of
what your life would have been cool.

677
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:39,000
Hanging on Ray Liotta that would have been
fun. How it had been kind of Nice. Jim,

678
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:42,670
you're are next. What should they say
about you? Yeah. You know, she'd going up,

679
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,650
sorry, was my bad STM. Like, like
she announces you before you go on,

680
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,880
but I understood what you're saying. Oh
look, as bad as that joke was everybody,

681
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,430
uh,

682
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,510
Chuck Norris and special is going to be
the opposite of that mouthful of shame.

683
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,810
I, it's so stupid. I keep going back to
this. When people listen to a podcast,

684
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:00,810
it's not like they can, there's no right,
there's no commercials coming in front,

685
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:04,320
but I just feel like I have to keep going
back to March 14th in case you forget,

686
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,260
because then they got to rewind
and try to remember where and when.

687
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,740
Of course we'll probably tweet it out.
And I did love Netflix too.

688
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:11,880
I've never done anything with them before.

689
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:15,030
I know you've done a bunch of stuff with
them, but they're so easy. They're like,

690
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:18,870
all right, just put it together. I mean,
Robbie had a couple of minor suggestions.

691
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:23,820
They don't overly manage you. It was like
fucking great. It was so nice to do it.

692
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,000
And I'm actually happy with it. Like, you
know, you shoot something, you this one,

693
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:30,780
I actually feel it's dirtier than I kind
of intended and wait to next time you

694
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:34,020
go to Australia, now that it's on
Netflix, like you'll sell tickets.

695
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,150
You can help someone.
I'm going to a you.

696
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:38,340
I told you you inspire
me completely to to do,

697
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm only doing this stuff because you
got in my head and I hear bill burn my

698
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,150
fucking head all the time. God, what
are you waiting for it? And I'm like,

699
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:48,750
I got to do it. I really do. It's
like, but you are right now. Watch.

700
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:50,970
I'll stop selling tickets
and then I'll be like,

701
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:54,360
you're watching David off coming into a
place. I'll be watching you sell it out.

702
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,810
The fucking, what does that thing in
Sydney, the Opera House and I'll be like,

703
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:02,100
I used to do that. I, I, you know
it's funny, I did one show there.

704
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,610
It was a TV taping. No, was, it
was a TV taping and something else.

705
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,580
And I enjoyed city. Melbourne was good,
but Sydney was really good and I'm like,

706
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:11,670
like Melbourne and a little
bit better. You did? Yeah,

707
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,540
I got that park was fun cause I landed
there and was Australia day and everybody

708
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,830
was just fucking getting hammered
and shit. So I was like, hey this,

709
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:20,400
this country is, I didn't
go to Perth. I didn't go.

710
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,180
What was your first time through is
great in Perth is the Bon Scott. Oh,

711
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:27,290
buried there. They got the stats. Show
you pictures of that. Yeah, we did it.

712
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,070
We went to the Bond
Scott Wall and Melbourne.

713
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,590
It was like in one of the things someone
painted a tribute while in the bond.

714
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:34,590
Scott, you know it's Bon
Scott because it says ac DC.

715
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,250
But if it didn't you'd be like, you
know, or say say acadeca down there.

716
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,890
I don't know why. Oh, do they
really? Yeah. And then what does,

717
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,360
what does burger can call down there?

718
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,190
I don't remember a fucking
cheese. Yeah. No, it's something.

719
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,150
No,

720
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,390
cause somebody down there actually had
already had a burger king and he sued the

721
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
corporation and the, what the fuck is
it? You're looking it up, Jonathan.

722
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,210
Um, did you sell tickets when you
first went through the first time?

723
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,170
No. No, I think I did. Uh, the
first time I went out there,

724
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:09,171
it was like an old four and
I did something for comedy
central and we flew in

725
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,980
from New York,

726
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:15,510
so it was like six hours to five and a
half to la and then lay over and then 14

727
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:20,160
hours and uh, you land, they let you
sleep a little bit and then it's like,

728
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,910
it's already the next day and then
we taped it and then the next day you

729
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,940
supposed to go back was so fucking nuts.
So I was just like, well fuck that.

730
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:30,870
I'm going to stay here for a few days.
Hungry, Hungry Jacks. That's right.

731
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,380
Hungry Jacks. Okay. That means
nothing to anybody listening to this.

732
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,830
But I thought it was cool.
Um,

733
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,520
and I just hung out there and I bought
all these ACDC albums on CD that,

734
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:43,300
you know, the original like, like was t
and t. I used to know the names of the,

735
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,930
like t and t was the original album
that then became high voltage,

736
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,130
but their version had like dirty deeds
on it, which later became its own album,

737
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,300
became an EAP over here. So we went, you
know, I bought like all these, you know,

738
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:58,420
cause I got a big family so I just
bought them for my brothers and sisters.

739
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,730
Oh that's cool. Yeah. And uh,

740
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,610
drove around and saw the apostles and
just driving on the other side of the road

741
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,430
was really fucked up.
And anytime I went to take a turn,

742
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,700
like the joke was I would just pretend
that I wanted to kill myself and then I

743
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,220
would actually make the right decision.
Cause everything else,

744
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,680
it doesn't even make sense. You like,
what the fuck? This makes no sense.

745
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,060
Especially when you're,
um,

746
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,490
when you make a right turn and
you're sitting, you're sitting on,

747
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,060
on the passenger's side and
you got to go wide. You like,

748
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,670
what the fuck can you
just picture like a semi.

749
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,960
But late at night when I came out,
I didn't know where the fuck I was at.

750
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,550
I was with this other comic,
one of those comics,

751
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,200
I was from like Scotland or some shit,

752
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:38,070
an ex patriot and I just met him
and I never saw him again. But uh,

753
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,180
we got on the road with no street
lights and drove probably maybe eight,

754
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,430
900 feet and the same time we both went
like, oh shit. Oh Shit. And got over it.

755
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,470
But there was nobody coming. Right. We
definitely was starting to go up a hill.

756
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,710
So yeah, I'm sure people get car service
when you're out there. And Jimmy,

757
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:56,190
that's what I'm trying ubered when
I was there and the openers there,

758
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:56,920
it was great.

759
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,970
But I'm also going to Norway and I think
I'm doing something to Scandinavian and

760
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,290
I've never been to any of these places.
I'm doing all of them.

761
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,740
That whole run through,
uh, Oslow Helsinki,

762
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,540
Stockholm dude the best. But they said
those are just places that, you know,

763
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,710
as an American to actually go there.
I mean I think he got to be like,

764
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:18,580
either you're either in the Illuminati
or you'll like a downhill skier or some

765
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:22,220
shit. Cause other than that, you're
not going to go there as far as,

766
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,590
it's just not on our radar to go there.
Beautiful countries and the people are,

767
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,424
the people are great.

768
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,400
Do you fly in and out the [inaudible]
can I have sleep apnea and I fucking,

769
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:34,030
I take Dramamine to fly. Like I came
this morning from Portland, so I'm like,

770
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,870
I'm very loopy and I'm tired and you just
do a show that night and then fly out

771
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:41,950
the next morning. I can't, there
was a, um, I'm panicking about that.

772
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,570
What I do is I turn it into
like a paid vacation. So, um,

773
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,660
what I do is I fly over there and I
either do the tour and then I meet my wife

774
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,960
afterwards or other times I've done it
like just because of our schedules that

775
00:40:56,961 --> 00:41:01,000
work out. Like, all right,
let's do the vacation first. Um,

776
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,680
and then not only will I be
rested, I'll be, you know,

777
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,930
talking about to acclimate at
that time and that type of thing.

778
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:12,450
So I've done both. But uh, you know,
there's all, you know, I build a window,

779
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,860
it build a of shit around
sporting events and stuff. Like,

780
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:16,270
you know what I wanted to go to this year.
I,

781
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,030
I don't think it's going to work out
though, but I was going to go to that.

782
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,370
There's this motorcycle
race on the Isle of Man,

783
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:25,420
which is an island between Britain
and Ireland home saying that, right?

784
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:27,660
A fucking whales, whatever the
fuck you want to call it. Um,

785
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,880
and it's just this fucking
motorcycle race that's just like,

786
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,320
I mean more people have died than years.
They've had it.

787
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:38,270
It's just they go on like fucking 200
miles an hour down these country roads and

788
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:40,790
shit and they go, go. I
come blazing through town.

789
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,230
I mean it's like if you love the
beginning of the last mad max,

790
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,470
this is like the closest you're going to
see to the real version of it. I mean,

791
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,380
these guys are fucking lunatics.

792
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:55,330
Like they know that going so fast and
it's his little ass country roads and this

793
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:58,190
like stone walls and shit
and trees like you're dead.

794
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,320
And pedestrians are getting
killed once in a while too.

795
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:03,770
I'm actually surprised that so many
people stand so close that my only

796
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,860
nervousness about it as how can I get
high up enough to see a little bit more of

797
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:13,370
it. Right. Because I'm worried that
it's just going to be like, you know,

798
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:15,730
I'm going to stay fly halfway
around the world. Just see

799
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,360
and then stand there for like another
fucking 20 minutes because they go by that

800
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:24,780
fucking fat and that's it.
Yeah.

801
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,450
I went to the Daytona 500 we
were on the infield on like,

802
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,740
like this little building so I could
actually stand and kind of watch them go

803
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:34,250
all the way around. Um,
but like if you just stand,

804
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,440
the first time I went to
the Indy 500 I was just,

805
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:40,130
you're just in a corner and it just
becomes this drinking game and everybody's

806
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:43,460
bed on like four different cars and you
just pray to God there's going to be an

807
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,520
accident or some shit in front of you.
Right. Just something interesting. Yeah.

808
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,830
And it's actually really amazing the first
time you see it and you actually hear

809
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:52,670
this tire skid like a real accident.
You're like, oh yeah, I guess it is a car.

810
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,830
For some reason I never thought
it would sound like that.

811
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,710
But the thing is that going so fast as
they'll hit the wall in front of you and

812
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:01,100
then the debris just they fly down.
We've seen the accident. Yeah,

813
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,220
I saw like I hit a wall in front
of me one time, but it's like it's,

814
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,940
he hits it in front of you and by the
time your brain reacts to what that is is

815
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:10,940
he's already a quarter mile away.
It's not like they hit it and just stop.

816
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,170
Do you watch like boxing and MMA cause
you such as sports care, do you watch uh,

817
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,670
combat sports or no? Yeah, I
keep going in and out of MMA. It,

818
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:21,620
it's like to pencil my road
schedule where it's like, you know,

819
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:26,360
I work a lot on Saturday night and if a
couple months goes by and I keep missing

820
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,700
the fights, I hate it. But it's a
big thing that me and my wife too,

821
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:32,380
like she fucking loves it. The
shit like UFC dude, she's old.

822
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,800
She's almost embarrassing. Like she
gets up and yells at the TV. Oh Great.

823
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,470
She totally gets into it.
When Anderson Silver,

824
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,100
like had the compound fracture of his
leg. I was like, oh my God, look in a way,

825
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:45,350
and she has this weird thing where
maybe she should have gotten the medical

826
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:48,080
field because she was,
it wasn't like she was happy it happened.

827
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:52,340
She was just more fascinated by what it
looked like and was just like, good Lord.

828
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,600
Oh, I was called. That's like the, uh,
when they break that fucking thing,

829
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:56,961
that's like,

830
00:43:56,961 --> 00:44:00,560
you ever see like a little kid put on
like his dad's rain boot straps on the

831
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:03,920
side and just folds up. Like I can't, I
cannot look at it. I was at that fight.

832
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:06,860
That was their second fight. That
was a, nobody knew what happened.

833
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:07,760
Like until the replay,

834
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:11,960
you just saw him fall and then the replay
played the whole place was like, oh,

835
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,220
it was her. That was a horrible, but he's
still kicking. He's still using that leg.

836
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,700
He just thought I heard when you break
the bone or it doesn't come back stronger,

837
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,280
some weird reason, they might
have strengthened it with metal.

838
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,790
I heard it was a pretty clean break.
Here we go. We're going into the best.

839
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,110
We don't have to make it stronger.

840
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,720
How you heard they did metal
[inaudible] we don't know,

841
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,100
but he's able to fight with it,
but it's just give

842
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,020
answers chuck,
why it happened.

843
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,160
I remember over hearing somebody say
that and I never did any background check

844
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:42,420
on them and had gone to one
of the fights. Yes. Yes I did.

845
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,100
What does that, oh, is that the picture
of him going by on the stretcher?

846
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,930
Jesus Christ. Jim, you look like you're in
a fucking band. Dude. I got to tell you,

847
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,190
this guy took this weight off. What? Two,
three years ago? And you've kept it off.

848
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,070
What are you doing? I just just eating
in the gym. Just that. That really is it.

849
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,760
But when did you find that? Because you
were a, you weren't those up and down.

850
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,440
It was awful. It's just that
moment of clarity. I was like, Ugh,

851
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,170
just so much fucking self disgust.

852
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:12,090
What were you eating and
where were you when you,

853
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,820
when you finally were just like,
I can't do this anymore? You know,

854
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:19,350
I really don't remember. I do remember
is going to the gym and going,

855
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,540
I am going to go.
I was fucking,

856
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:25,620
I was just sick of like when you
feel it in your back above your belt,

857
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,430
that little bit of fucking fat.
It's just soft. Like a little lamb.

858
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,570
I started getting the uh, the
effort noises, putting on socks.

859
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,330
I was just like, Oh God. And becoming
that guy. So I just like, uh,

860
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,390
this last trip I just had, I got off the
road two days ago now I've just been,

861
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,531
it's so funny.

862
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:48,531
I literally just two days of not eating
burger king or steak and shake and I

863
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:51,120
never,
I just kind of fell into this.

864
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,770
I think it was just because of the lack
of sleep I've been getting and just

865
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:58,660
going out on the road and then having
to do the shows and the pressure putting

866
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,820
together the new hour.

867
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,990
I just spent under a lot of stress and
I've just been like last second, Oh fuck,

868
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:06,090
I'm hungry. Let's go
here. I don't give a shit.

869
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,230
Just stuff this in me and fill up
the hole. And it just was a, yeah.

870
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,390
So La is dangerous for me because I go,

871
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:17,490
this is what a fucking fruit I'm turning
into Jonathan and I will word it is a

872
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:21,270
great one. Fucking fruit. We eat.
Uh, I like eating Sushi here,

873
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:23,490
but then we go to the
yogurt stop on Santa Monica.

874
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,140
But I didn't go on that for years.
They think we're a complex.

875
00:46:26,141 --> 00:46:29,490
My favorite place in the world is the
fucking yogurt stop on Santa Monica.

876
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:34,340
I love where is that? It's on Santa
Monica by rage West Hollywood. Get get,

877
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,920
get, get a Mike. I know you're
just talking to Jonathan.
Forgot. God. Put it on.

878
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,740
Put It on the fucking head. Can you
just speak into thinner at Brownstein?

879
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:42,590
Everybody. Oh, hello? Yeah, Jonathan.

880
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,480
Well who was very instrumental when we
first started doing the Patrice O'Neal

881
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,530
benefit.
That's right.

882
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
Please help me get in touch with all the
guys and everything like that. And uh,

883
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,370
it's an amazing thing. It's still
going on. It's incredible. Yeah.

884
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,030
Just like she knew how much Nah, no, no.
It was Maureen Taren Morin's flooring.

885
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,900
Taryn deals with all the
infrastructure and uh,

886
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,570
the herd of add that is booking
a bunch of comedians through it.

887
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:07,860
It's like literally,
it's like you got 12 cows just fucking,

888
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,020
I guess what,
what runs cows don't run.

889
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,860
You got 10 you got 10 fucking things
that run there will go in a different

890
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:16,350
direction and things that run all
going in different directions.

891
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,100
But February 21st that normally would
and this right? Yeah we kind of,

892
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,930
we kind of know it's going
to be in February now. Yeah.

893
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:26,280
Now she lets us know in enough advanced
and that's why we do it Tuesday cause

894
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:30,250
sometimes fans go, why the fuck is this
on a Tuesday night? It's cause guys

895
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,850
are working for free. And this is what,
that's the day when comedians are, uh,

896
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,490
are in town. So, uh, next year, uh,

897
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,500
I already know like one of
the guys out here every year,

898
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:41,650
we try to like maybe
fly somebody in and uh,

899
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,040
we got an idea of possibly who are going
to try to use it next year. But, uh,

900
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,380
it's been a great thing because
I just hate like, you know,

901
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:50,920
like when someone passes away,
like with unfortunately we're at that age,

902
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,820
you know, and where you had that one
time benefit and you're like, okay,

903
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:59,470
here's your sack of cash, good luck
for the next 40 years. And it's, um,

904
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,500
you know, he was taking care
of those people. So it's,

905
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,510
it's definitely been a great
thing. So, and the thing
about it, I said, here's the,

906
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:09,400
and I think of there's too this year
is that it's the fifth annual one.

907
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,000
I've officially done this four more
times and Patrice would've done it for me

908
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,330
this year,
I think might've been this shoe.

909
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:23,080
I thought it was the perfect
combination of a great mix of people.

910
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,910
The ball breaking was on a whole
other fucking level. And then, uh,

911
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,780
when Leslie Jones told that portray story,
oh my God,

912
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,160
it was just fucking know dude.

913
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,510
The shit that you said when to Keith
and Keith Robinson, Keith Robinson,

914
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,570
Keith unfortunately, uh,
suffered a mild stroke, uh,

915
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,920
wasn't moment coming up on two years ago,
was it? No, I'll say less than a year.

916
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,350
Yeah, a year and a year ago. And um,

917
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,310
he's of course now he's doing like
someone funniest shit or whatever. So Jim,

918
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:54,070
when he out-tro to me it goes,
keep it going for Keith Robinson.

919
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,350
He should had a stroke 15 years ago.

920
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:01,050
The place fucking dies laughing and
then your other one was like a, well,

921
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:05,480
it's funny is even after a stroke, Keith
is easier to understand than rich vos.

922
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,530
How is it, I don't know how you followed
it with the rest of your jokes, but yeah,

923
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,940
people like the attacks on each other
that, that's always a crowd favorite.

924
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,840
You had one way, you said,
I think Colin came after you
and you said, uh, he's here,

925
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,150
he's a,
has to be back at men's Wearhouse soon.

926
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,540
He was wearing a suit that night and
it was bosses awful hat this year.

927
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,990
And Pete Davidson kept telling him the
truth going to look awful. I'm like, Pete,

928
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:30,010
that's not how this game works.

929
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,180
Tell them it looks good and you wait
till it goes out on stage. Yeah.

930
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:34,510
You don't try to discourage them.

931
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:37,240
You wait until he's on and then you
fucking attack them in front of the entire

932
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,950
theater. Was another, another one.

933
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:41,590
That's the first time we had him and he
came out and he was trashing Voss has

934
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:46,270
had, I think they actually may make
fun of us as the old guys. Um, I,

935
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,500
yeah, I think that, but
then vos leveled him.

936
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,440
Pete Pete Talks about his dad died on
that 11 and voice had the one good thing

937
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:55,820
is that of uh,
uh,

938
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,050
the Pete's dad didn't have to seem in
that blouse and he's saying he would have

939
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:03,920
thrown himself in another
fire. Oh yeah. That, fuck.

940
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,720
Oh my God. They're terrible. Sweater,

941
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,130
head artsy golden girl's sweater
that was going to wear. Yeah,

942
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,610
that was really bad. It was really,
really shitty. I wanted to make fun of it,

943
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,900
but I knew I didn't like it. I'm
like, you're on a TV show. You're,

944
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,510
you're fucking good looking young guy
and if you dress slightly of feminine,

945
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:20,980
it's like you're not getting enough pussy.

946
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:22,690
So I knew that that's what I was
going to come out. And I was like,

947
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:26,940
I can't come at him. You know,
the potential was wrong. I
knew that I was just, uh,

948
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,063
an old man

949
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,310
getting jealous, you know, now I had
to, Rosa just showed up and that then I,

950
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:35,250
I would've, I mean, the sweater on
by itself should have been burned.

951
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,010
It was brutal. It was,
it was bad. But you know,

952
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,590
you knew the reasons for attacking
it would have been more. Yeah.

953
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,020
It's not one of those
fucking guys remember those,

954
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,370
those all those people that Madonna used
to fucking sell Ho in New York City,

955
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,240
those Charlie Bean Beneatha's, those
artists. Yeah. He looked like he fucking,

956
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:54,170
when he dies his artwork, it was going to
be worth something. Yeah. Like a young,

957
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:58,070
uh, I can't, I haven't got bused
yachts. Yeah, the young guy of age.

958
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,280
It's all I'm thinking of.
Yeah.

959
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,970
I don't like any of those guys because
it always makes me feel foolish because

960
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:05,450
everybody looks at this shit like it's
fucking amazing. And like one of the, uh,

961
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,100
I dunno,

962
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,550
like the two ways when I always know
that I'm a dope was when I tried to read

963
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:14,120
out loud bat and when I go to a museum,

964
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,770
because I mean, you want to just talk
about flatlining emotionally and it just,

965
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:20,870
it means not dude. I went,
when I went to Paris,

966
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,730
I went into a little lube.
I could not get out of there fast enough.

967
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,850
I was like literally almost shouting
at people. Like, where is it?

968
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,900
Where is the fucking,

969
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,380
where's the Mona Lisa so I can look
at it and get the fuck out of here.

970
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,390
And you get out of it. And there's
all these people just, you know,

971
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:39,470
just creating like a ledge with their
other hand and then fucking holding their

972
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,350
chin out with the other one.
And I was, I just sort of,

973
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,740
I peered over like it was the presidential
motorcade driving by and I saw that

974
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:51,020
was it.
Did it move you and give a fuck.

975
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,380
The only thing that was cool as it's
been recreated so many times and be like,

976
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:59,300
that's the actual one. And
Dude, I saw the Sistine Chapel,

977
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:02,650
I couldn't be off fucking small. It
was, I think the guy was dogging it.

978
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:07,400
I mean it's saint. It took
them that fucking long walked
in. I literally was like,

979
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:11,420
this is it. And somebody went
shoo, shoo, like shushed me.

980
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,330
I'll tell you what would be on inspiring.

981
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:18,331
And they recently dug up Christ's
tomb and the church and they had to do

982
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:21,050
something that they know where
he's buried. They know where the,

983
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,680
suppose the tomb of Christ. They
do know. Yeah. She just fucking,

984
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,010
Al Capone's vault is shroud of Turin.

985
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:32,840
It probably is bullshit,
but I mean it is in Catholicism.

986
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:35,690
They do kind of Riviera,
it's somewhere in Jerusalem I guess.

987
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,170
But these guys had to go down and they
were doing some kind of maintenance work

988
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:42,710
on it, which they had to be done on
the lid over the tomb. But I'm like,

989
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:46,490
that would probably get me like, Ooh,
this is a pretty important place.

990
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,800
But the art museums do nothing for me.

991
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,370
I did see the Washington crossing the
Delaware painting. It's fucking massive.

992
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,620
It's probably the size of this room and
I always in the Metropolitan Museum of

993
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,510
art, that was kind of always the,
well, I would rather look at that shit.

994
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:01,970
Then something like
abstract. Yeah, me too.

995
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,870
It looked like you rolled a baby and
paint and just fucking threw it. Yeah.

996
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,350
Canvas.
I liked,

997
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,640
I went to the van Gogh one when wherever
were the fuck whatever country that's

998
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:10,940
an,

999
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,880
I went to that and I actually liked that
one and it's not because he's a fellow

1000
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:17,570
fucking red head. It was just, I actually
would like with Netherlands. Yeah.

1001
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,710
How about uh, I like a Norman
Rockwell. You sure it's not in Denmark?

1002
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,040
Copenhagen?
I thought it was Amsterdam,

1003
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,220
but maybe it could be the
whole way. You're addressing
me, lets me know. I know,

1004
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,910
I know that you're right.
Initials on his shirt.

1005
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,360
He gives like the air of authority,

1006
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,430
but half of the times he knows what he's
talking about. Half the times he does.

1007
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,720
Oh, this is that what you have
your initials right there?
Yeah. That's very unique.

1008
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,510
And the Taylor's, is that
near your run, your pancreas?

1009
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,840
Is that why you put it there? I thought
you did it on the cuff link on the cuffs.

1010
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,180
There's two styles. You can do it.
The cuff. You can do it here. You can.

1011
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,650
What is that and what does that style?
I don't know.

1012
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,850
I've always had it here
though, so I dunno. The Taylor
that I got this made yet.

1013
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,370
He did it there. Yeah. This is a
true gentleman. Yeah, the train.

1014
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,050
I can tell how difficult you are as a
client because I know when you're not

1015
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:06,330
around, his shirt is untucked. Yeah.

1016
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,320
He said he's getting a little rock
and roll because I'm in town. He's,

1017
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,130
there's chicks to talk to get
them to the Greek. All right,

1018
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,610
well coming up on an hour
here at Jim, I'm, you know,

1019
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,170
I'm such a fucking huge fan of you
and I always tell you this dude,

1020
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:23,070
I owe so much of the tickets that I sell
to on the road that you were generous

1021
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:25,530
when you got a lot of guys would have
got that opie and Anthony Gig and they

1022
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:29,710
would've kept the fucking door closed
and you let us all run in. So, uh,

1023
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,590
I want to thank you. Well, you know,

1024
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,700
you can see I'm blowing all my money
on footlocker tee shirts here now,

1025
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,660
but you do do it well.

1026
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,390
Deservedly like you're a great comic
and I don't mean it's not like, yeah,

1027
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,940
I just taught my compliment
with a compliment. You,

1028
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,680
it is nice to see like a mouthful
of shame on Netflix March 14th.

1029
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,950
I love you to death Jimmy. Uh, all
the success in the world to you.

1030
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:55,740
I will definitely be tweeting this out.

most Sam Roberts. Uh,

1034
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,760
we are now doing the show
together Monday through Friday,

1035
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,620
eight to 11 on Channel One oh three.

1036
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,410
I have satellite radio now and I've looked
at the list and you guys all the time.

1037
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,240
It's great.
It's really finally get caught up.

1038
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,000
I can't believe how long I did
satellite radio before I got it.

1039
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,850
It's fucking tremendous. You
just got it. I just got it.

1040
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,930
I never had it in my
car and I finally just,

1041
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,690
I finally never bought myself a nice car.

1042
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,680
I'm one of those frugal
fucking Douche bag.

1043
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:31,590
So I finally just said up buying a nice
car. I was just like, whatever. They said,

1044
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:34,950
you want this? I was like, yes. Do
you want that? Yes. Treating yourself.

1045
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,520
Climate control. Yes. I
just said yes to everything.

1046
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:41,370
That's why it gets shitty gas miles. Just
so fucking heavy with all the options.

1047
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,180
Thanks for having me, man. I'm sorry I
was late to Oh, you weren't late. Jimmy.

1048
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,110
Appreciate we're building
anticipation and I'll see you guys.
