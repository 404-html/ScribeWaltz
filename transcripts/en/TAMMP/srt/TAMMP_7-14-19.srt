1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,560
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,710
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,650
Monday morning podcast and
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,020
What's going on? How I
yeah. Um, I'm fucking,

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,580
ah, I didn't want to get into
it. We're up to episode 10.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,440
I have no life.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,100
I'm trying to fuck and I'm trying to get
in a quick workout before I go to work

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:26,731
because I am,

9
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm fucking right back up to where I
was last year when I was like a buck 86.

10
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:34,590
[inaudible] 87 I am. I, you want
kills me. I've been working out.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,520
Why do you work out?
You're still putting, um,

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,290
you know, it is, it's late night. I'm
coming home. I'm eating like a fat chick,

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,800
you know, meet like some sad
fellow doesn't like herself.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,020
I just come home and I'm fucking fried.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,580
I get home at like seven o'clock
at night and I go, ah, fuck it.

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,610
That's what I say. I get all the way to
my street going, I'm going to get a salad.

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,260
I've got to have a protein.

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,570
I'm going to fucking eat the
bag of beans or whatever.

19
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:07,860
And then I just drive into my
driveway and I go, ah, fuck it. Right.

20
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,070
And I order a fucking pizza or a burger,
you know,

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,200
or have a beer or something like that.
And MIH. Yes. That's it. That's it.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,510
I go to my looking at getting on my
fucking second trimester right now. Ah,

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,790
it's just my wife the other
day and went to a fucking mall,

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,710
which is something I never do. Go
into a fucking mall. Right. You know,

25
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,800
people go to a malls, people with
children. I get it. You get him out there.

26
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:36,630
They fucking watched the trolley go by
and you know Santa Claus is there. Right.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,230
Just fucking sit there waiting for
you to put your kid in his lap.

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,240
You fucking Weirdos. Right? Hey,

29
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,530
let's keep the lie going to the point we
put our child in some fucking perverts

30
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:50,690
fucking lap. So they think he comes
down the Goddamn Chimi me. Yeah.

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,130
Is it any wonder? So many people end up
in cars they don't want to be in? Well,

32
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:59,700
that's a, that's how you start off
their life. You know, some fucking dude,

33
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,690
we don't know. You know, don't really
talk to sort of God like, you know,

34
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,660
sort of culty right?
Charlie Manson hair all fucking,

35
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,040
he's fucking coming in and everything's
cool. You go sit in his fucking lap,

36
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,120
but don't talk to strangers,
right? I don't, I don't fucking,

37
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:18,090
I'm just so whenever we go to this
fucking thing and we're walking by the

38
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:22,590
fountain, right? There's a trolley and a
fountain. This is like the fucking gay,

39
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:26,970
his place you can ever go to. And I don't
mean gay in like the homophobic way.

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,890
I mean, the way it used to mean
like the 1890s, the gay nineties,

41
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:35,250
as in, Oh my God, could a
decade get any happier? Right?

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,410
It was everything but fucking
showgirls coming down, you know,

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,250
like the end of the family guy song.
That was the only thing that was missing.

44
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,910
And I just was like, what is all
the excitement? We're fucking,

45
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,940
everybody's here buying pants.
Why are we having a fucking parade?

46
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,800
You know? So I went in there and
I just took her to go see the, uh,

47
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:03,190
the secret lives of pets, which I really
enjoyed because, you know, I'm a dog.

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,210
All right. I love fucking dogs.
And you know what, I was curious,

49
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,900
what does my dog do when I leave ever
dentally? They have quite the adventures.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,820
No, it was a fucking really
good movie. I liked it.

51
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:17,700
And that was a bunch of kids in there
screaming and yelling and that's what I

52
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,260
want it,
you know what I mean?

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,590
And I went to the matinee showing and
just have a bunch of kids screaming and

54
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,140
yeah, I wanted the full effect
of watching that fucking movie.

55
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,540
You know what I mean?
It's like when you go to a horror movie,

56
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,960
you got to go see it and there's going
to be a bunch of people yelling at the

57
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,270
screen. Right. And either that,

58
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,220
that's part of the fucking experience.
If you want to go see a movie,

59
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:42,810
when everybody shuts the fuck up, you
know, you got to do it in your house.

60
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,850
Maybe slap a few people around before
the movie starts, you know, set the tone.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,320
Daddy ain't putting up with this
shit. All right. So anyways,

62
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,230
long story short and I dressed up a little
bit when I went down there. You know,

63
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,400
I've been working a lot,
so I'm going to take out my lady.

64
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,750
So when we're walking out we'll
go and buy the fountain, you know,

65
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,600
and there's like all, you know, like
the plane, like fucking Tony Bennett.

66
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:12,601
If I ruled the world every day would
be like the first day of spring.

67
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,030
Every douche would have such a wonderful
song to sing. If I ruled the world,

68
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:21,160
what a wonderful world it would be.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,290
And everybody's just
sitting there mesmerized,

70
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,280
eaten this fucking ice cream
and shit. Yeah, abide pants.

71
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,730
It was fucking weird, man. It
was like, when you go to this,

72
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,760
you go to some of these fucking balls.
It's like you're in a Christmas special.

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm telling you, I wouldn't be surprised
if they got a fucking mess. Right?

74
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,210
And they're putting some sort of like,

75
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,900
like little little dopamine in the air
and you get like this fucking high.

76
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,130
And all of a sudden you're like,
you know what,

77
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,760
I already have fucking nine
pairs of pants. I one more.

78
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm in the double digits, seven days
in the week. I want the overlap.

79
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,810
I'm going to go over the bar line, right?
Like Vinny, call Uta in a pants white.

80
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,270
Um, so anyways, so I go,
all right, I'm, I'm gonna,

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,780
I dunno what had came over
and me, we walked by the
fountain. I said, I need you,

82
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:13,530
let's get a picture. She's like,
she couldn't fucking believe it.

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,400
I was going to take a picture next to,
in front of a fountain at a moth.

84
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,850
This is not me behavior. Right? Of course
she's all over it. Women love that time,

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,120
right? It just makes you
want to start crying. Let go.
What happened to me. Right?

86
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,990
So all I want to do is take a fucking
selfie. Right, right. You know,

87
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,730
get up fucking heads in it.

88
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:39,480
My head taken up three quarters of it
cause it's so fucking big. And some do,

89
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:42,630
she has to come along and be like, oh,
you all little took a picture for you.

90
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,640
And I'm thinking, no, I want you to,
I don't want to prolong this moment.

91
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:51,120
You fucking asshole. Where's your guy
called? Of course my wife goes, oh my God,

92
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:55,290
that would be great. Right? So why
does he do? He fucking takes one. Oh,

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,330
let's get one more for right.
Takes another one.

94
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,120
Oh my God. And know I look at this
picture in the fucking horror that I see.

95
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,890
Okay.

96
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,850
Fucking stomach pushing out the
bottom of my button down shirt.

97
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,580
And then when you really just
know you're just getting fat,

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,420
is that fucking button right?
A right on your breast plate?

99
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,340
It looks like it's doing the iron cross.

100
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,880
Just trying to hold both parts
of the shirt together. And uh,

101
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,430
I looked so fucking bad.
I almost got mad at my wife.

102
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,950
Like you letting me walk
around looking like that.

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,150
It's like I get that you love me,
but you know,

104
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:34,850
how about a little bit of tough love,
you know, how about a little, hey,

105
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,810
fatty cakes, you know, you're really
going to have waffles again this morning.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,420
Exhibit a right. And, you know, bust
out a fucking photo you took of me.

107
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,010
Nothing will make you lose weight like
a bad fucking photo. Huh? Jesus Christ.

108
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,270
You know, it's bad enough when they
catch you in your own backyard, you know?

109
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,000
But I'll tell you,
you take a photo in public,

110
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:01,440
in front of a fucking fountain at a mall
that as a trolley while Tony Bennett's

111
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:05,370
playing. I mean, I'm glad I didn't
look at it until I got home.

112
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:09,810
I would have fucking jumped
in 10 a sailor's dive right
into the bottom of that

113
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:13,990
fountain.
Now I'm too vain to kill myself.

114
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,870
I'll just hang around and make everybody
else miserable. That's what you do.

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,610
That's what you do. Um, oh, by the way,

116
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:25,480
I w I finally, I watched the, uh, the
record of the, uh, the British Grand Prix,

117
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,190
um, fascinating fucking race
with all the rain there.

118
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:33,190
Who's going to go in and change the tires?
Who's going to keep going?

119
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:37,720
And by fucking lap seven, everybody
changed their fucking tires, right?

120
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,480
It kind of seems,
if you get pole position,

121
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,280
you're basically going to win the race.

122
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,920
These guys are so good and the
cars are so equal. You can't,

123
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,420
I've never seen nobody does this stroke
a race thing where your way in the back

124
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:53,290
and all of a sudden you know you pass
three people and you do the little Zz top

125
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,340
fucking Olay move. You know?
Remember the fucking movie.

126
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:00,640
He's key goes by three cars that are
all fucking it align draft in each other

127
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:05,380
and I've watched enough NASCAR with the
skull bone Harry Harrogate car, right?

128
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:07,030
Darrell Waltrip,
Cale Yarborough.

129
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,430
I watched enough of that shit that know
of two people that draft and they're

130
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,010
going to slingshot around you.
I'll tell you what,

131
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,590
not when Burt Reynolds is there,
I don't know what he did.

132
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,320
Did he take off his two panes,

133
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,420
stick his head out the window and make
himself a little more fucking aerodynamic?

134
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:24,130
Is that how he went by three cars? I
don't know. Fastest chicken in the south.

135
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,590
That shit does not happen in Formula One.

136
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,490
If you're not one of the top three
fucking drivers of the Illuminati,

137
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,830
you're basically,
as far as I can tell,

138
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,580
the five races I've ever watched
from star stat to finish,

139
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:41,760
you're not going to win the Goddamn race,
you know,

140
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,880
unless the two guys up front don't like
each other and they smashed into each

141
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,350
other.
Jesus Christ,

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg
right at the end of the fucking race.

143
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,850
Lewis Hamilton.
When's it right guys from fucking England?

144
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:58,260
Every bile a man or everybody's
going fucking nuts. And uh,

145
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,480
as I mentioned before,
those two don't like each other though.

146
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:01,650
He smashed into each other.

147
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,910
So in the end they always show the green
room afterwards, after somebody one.

148
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,750
And um,
it was just like,

149
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:14,600
they didn't say one word to each other.
Fucking meow fellows.

150
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,780
They didn't say one fight.
I think the fucking Todo Guy,

151
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,710
all I want to do when I wake up in the
morning is feel your ass. When he fought,

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,650
he fucking set the two of them down.
He goes, listen, you can't, all right.

153
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,620
I know you went out there
and you watch stroker ace.

154
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,910
I know you'll watch said Kenny Rogers
movie where he adopts the six kids,

155
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,940
but never really legally, and nobody
had a fucking problem with that.

156
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:42,660
I know you're watched days of
thunder. All right? This ain't that.

157
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,960
This cost real fucking money. Stop
smashing into each other. All right?

158
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,020
And I'll take you back to Germany and
I'll reopen. Why I can't go that far.

159
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,870
Uh,
Oh,

160
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,160
the Germans, you know,
I'm telling you right now,

161
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:03,840
if you take out about 10 years of day
history, they're great people. Um,

162
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,430
and you pick one wrong guy.
That's what so scary about this fucking

163
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,250
okay.

164
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,150
This election,

165
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,020
I think that they should make Trump
and Hillary both put on a Hitler mask.

166
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,510
Matt and the mask put on
a Hitler fucking mustache.

167
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,630
And whoever looks the closest,
you vote for the other person.

168
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,033
Okay?

169
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,370
You know what? The results may surprise
you. Somebody make a clickbait. Fucking,

170
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:32,290
I'm a clickbait. Fucking whatever the
hell you call the meme or the, the,

171
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,140
the, the fucking vine. You know,

172
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,550
we put both the presidential
candidates in a Hitler Mass,

173
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,730
a Hitler mustache. Why can't I talk
this morning? And Hitler Mustache,

174
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,870
the results may surprise you and
just, you know, whoever you're for,

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,090
you just make the other person, I guess.
And I don't, I don't know how you've,

176
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,190
I don't know how you bring that one
home. You know all you kids today. Oh,

177
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,610
you fucking internet superstars.
You know,

178
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,210
I went into a place the other day to get
some lunch of fucking salad with some

179
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:04,710
chicken, right? Desperately trying to
fucking bring down the belly, you know,

180
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,510
fucking mobit day. That's what it looked
like right now. You know, shaved head,

181
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,590
fucking ghost, white body. You know,
there's a lot of blubber on me right now.

182
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,120
You know, if I was to swim in the ocean,
my biggest fear would not be sharks.

183
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,073
You know,

184
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,050
it'd be some hipsters out there fucking
whale hunting because they thought,

185
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,780
you know, they would take it back, right?

186
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,480
Get fucking happy wound there.
Um, the fuck was I talking about?

187
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,080
Oh yeah.

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,900
So I went in to go get this fucking salad
and I'm standing there and there's a

189
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:38,580
guy in line wearing a fucking Versace
robe, a gold Versace robe. And slippers.

190
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,490
So I texted my wife going, there's
a dude in here, you know? Yeah.

191
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,610
Do you want me to take a picture?
You've got to see this guy, right?

192
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,610
So I fucking take a picture of
the guy and she's like, oh my God,

193
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:51,030
my friend knows that person.
He makes these vines, right?

194
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,940
So then I clicked on his youtube and
the guys, not whatever Twitter page,

195
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:59,020
the guy's fucking hilarious
and I'm just sitting.

196
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,430
They go is this fucking guy?

197
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,930
He doesn't need to be in a writer's room
while he's has his own fucking show.

198
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:08,200
And he gets to walk around in his bathrobe
and slippers all day making cooking

199
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:13,030
videos. God bless him. I don't know
what the point of all his, his,

200
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,910
I think the point of all this is I need
to get back on elliptical soon so I

201
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,570
don't have a fucking heart
attack before I go to a,

202
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm going to say the Middle East
before I go to the fucking, um,

203
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,810
go over to England. Uh, anyways, so yeah,

204
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,850
I got to fucking knock this shit.

205
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:32,220
I gotta knock off this
podcast and then I have a

206
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,050
okay,

207
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,200
actually have some people coming over
here because our kitchen's all fucked up.

208
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,380
Do you know what's wrong bill?
What's wrong with the kitchen?

209
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,410
Oh I don't know whether you put on
the hot water or the cold water.

210
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:47,550
The hot water still comes out, you know,
problem. I fixed fucking nine times.

211
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,240
You got to shut off the fucking hot water.
The handle comes off.

212
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,140
Cupboards are all falling apart,
you know,

213
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,950
everything else in the
house is pretty much nice.

214
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:59,820
I probably shouldn't even say
that shit. So, um, I got this,

215
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,940
like the final fucking thing I have to do.
You know what I mean?

216
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,890
Cause I fixed up the rest of the house.

217
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:07,260
I'm hoping it's the final
fucking thing I have to do.

218
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,560
But if for the most part I fixed up the
rest of the house and so now like the

219
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,070
kitchen is bitch to become like
this. I sh I saw, you know,

220
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,960
it'd be like if you bought a brand new
suit and he had these old shitty shoes,

221
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,600
you know, and people look down and
they would just like, you know what,

222
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,950
I was going to get in
business with this guy,

223
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,470
but what the fuck is with those shoes?
You,

224
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,890
what are you fucking Willy Loman there?
You're fucking Willy Loman.

225
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,260
Um, so that nightmare project
is about ready to start.

226
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,760
People coming over today with their ideas.
I have an idea.

227
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:43,500
Like what if we just took
everything out and put new stuff in,

228
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:46,560
in the exact same place
except for a couple of things.

229
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,900
And it costs you fucking three
zillion dollars. How about that?

230
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,220
I could be rustic yet
modern yet postmodern,

231
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,310
but kind of art deco ish,

232
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,350
but doesn't compromise the
integrity of the structure.

233
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,123
Okay.

234
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,370
I'm signing up for that shit
again. Um, but you know what,

235
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,850
don't you know, I think it probably
put it into six weeks. In other words,

236
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:18,420
in about nine months, I think it Oughta
be done breathing in a bunch of dust.

237
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,790
I'll have fucking, um, coal
miner's daughter, lung,
whatever the fuck they call it.

238
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,410
I have no idea. Um, we
don't have any Goddamn, um,

239
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,340
I don't have any questions on this one.
And I also don't have any advertising.

240
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,630
You know, I will do some
advertising here Tuesday night.

241
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:41,631
I went back to the troubadour and
I saw Wheeler Walker Jr right?

242
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,320
You say it's over.
Pack up your stuff.

243
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,720
Something,
something.

244
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,120
You've had a nurse that fuck you bitch.

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,390
You broke my heart.
Fuck you France.

246
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,500
Tearing us apart.
Fuck your dog.

247
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,830
Hope he never comes home. I
saw that guy fucking live, man.

248
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:08,330
It was I what a fun fucking show is great.
And the band killer,

249
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,210
the Bass player actually plays in
one of my favorite fucking bans,

250
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,700
truth and salvage company.
He's on the road with them,

251
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:17,910
had a killer band and the dope comes out.
Wheeler Walker Jr he fucking murdered.

252
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,860
Absolutely fucking murdered it.
Um,

253
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,210
I didn't know what to expect
when I went down the, you know,

254
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,560
when somebody goes down there, they're
doing funny songs. You're like, oh,

255
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:27,920
I don't know what's going to happen here.

256
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,570
Is this going to be like a one joke
song and then you fucking like still

257
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:35,600
standing there for another 45
minutes. It was, it was great.

258
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,710
And he was fucking hilarious in between
songs, his band or what the crowd,

259
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,950
what I'm saying is if you get a chance
to see wheeler walker jr he's coming to a

260
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,110
fucking club near you
theater near you arena,

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,610
fucking a amphitheater.

262
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,690
Hey a car port.
I don't know,

263
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm trying to think of every
structure I can think of.

264
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:02,480
Definitely go out and see him. He's, he's,
he's absolutely worth the money and uh,

265
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,640
in the band.
Sounds great.

266
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:09,050
And he had a s on another
band open up in front of them.

267
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,190
Two ladies with guitars. They were
great. Just the fucking killer show.

268
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,430
And I ran into a bunch of
comics when I was there,

269
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,500
ran into Doug Benson and all these other
guys. Look at me dropping names here,

270
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,240
drop and fucking names.

271
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,380
And I sat there in the back of the club
and I just drank water all night cause

272
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,710
I'm fucking fat. Right? I'm not gonna
lie to you. I had one whiskey, you know,

273
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,700
you've got to have one. You know,
even John Wayne would have won,

274
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,320
you know, before he ate half a
fucking cow that he barely cooked.

275
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,030
Isn't that what happened to him?

276
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,573
Yeah.

277
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,930
You know, that's what, you know what
happened? All those guys back in the day,

278
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:47,040
they just kept eating red
meat because back then it was
all about, well, you know,

279
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,600
why would I eat hamburger when
I got steak at home? Right?

280
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,130
Isn't that what they said?
Weren't they literally talking about food?

281
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:57,900
Considering what most of them died off?
I know that was about the ladies. Um,

282
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,450
but anyways, uh, back then, right,

283
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,130
if you will like a guy's guy, you were
eating steak. If you were fucking,

284
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,690
if you're successful,
it was considered the highest cut,

285
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,680
a fucking meat and all that.

286
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:15,070
You didn't realize it was tearing
apart your fucking guts and back then,

287
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,540
there's no way you let another man
fucking look in your ass to make sure you

288
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,030
weren't going to die of ass cancer.
Right?

289
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,040
There's no fucking way you could do that.

290
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,180
And then get on a horse and call
yourself a cowboy. That's not what it,

291
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,670
what it was about. All
right. He kept eating steak.

292
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,470
Then you, when you, and you would,
your wife was done making the steak.

293
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:40,060
You're fucking fucking wrapped it with
the frying pan. I said clean it up. Right?

294
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,730
Then you went over and you put butter
on the steak and then that was it.

295
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,360
And I think it was better for
the environment back then.

296
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,020
You know what I mean?
Women were being beaten,

297
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,610
so they were drinking themselves to death.

298
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:57,660
So they died earlier and guys fucking
eight themselves to death. And you know,

299
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,100
people got out of the way and there
was only like fucking a couple billion

300
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:05,570
people on the planet. Now look at
everybody. Everybody's doing yoga.

301
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,720
Nobody's beating their wives, right?
Everybody's having a fucking salad.

302
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,020
And now this seven and a half
billion people on the fucking planet.

303
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,250
Yeah.

304
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,450
You know, and I think it's high time
that we go back to the way it was,

305
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,130
you know, oh, what happened? What
led Hillary becomes president,

306
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,290
and at the end of her 48 year run,

307
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,740
then it goes back to
the fucking dark ages.

308
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,570
We go back to a feudal system,
the real one. You know,

309
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,630
where you're actually aware of what was
happening rather than now where it's

310
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:41,230
just bankers fucking silently sucking
the life out of the fucking middle. Oh,

311
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,130
Jesus. Pill. You're going to get on a
fucking, you know, fucking kills me.

312
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,240
Bernie Sanders,

313
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,270
arguably the scientists from back to
the future fucking endorses Hillary

314
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,290
Clinton. Guinea. Can
you fucking any of them?

315
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,470
Can any of them just fucking have a
point of view and just stick with it?

316
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,650
They're always like,
this is what I'm above.

317
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,830
You could vote for me because I'm
above this. Right? And then the second,

318
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:07,831
all of a sudden they start taking on
water or this or the thing that's working.

319
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,950
Speaking of water. Do you know
there's more shark attacks than ever.

320
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,860
Okay.

321
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,590
And they're doing fucking stories about
what should we do about this? It's like,

322
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,110
well, you know, you could not
swim in the ocean. You'd dump con.

323
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,420
There's plenty of fucking, it's
plenty of lakes. You know what I mean?

324
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,190
You know, Shit. Fill up your bathtub,
you know, make a day of that, you know,

325
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,540
but a snorkel on and stare at your
balls. I mean, do whatever you gotta do,

326
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,680
but don't go in the fucking water.
Right?

327
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,980
What do you think there's more shark
attacks now? Well, two reasons. One,

328
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,740
there's more fucking people until
we're eating all the fucking fish.

329
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,210
So the menu is becoming more limited.
You know, back in the day shark,

330
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:51,490
it'd be like, oh, look at that
fucking surf. Or Eh, you know,

331
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,650
like the fucking board gets between my
teeth. It's not rented. It's tougher meat.

332
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,290
You know,
he's still in polities and that's quote,

333
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
and they'll look at that school of tuna.

334
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,730
Okay,

335
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,340
Toro, Toro, right? I'm going to go
over there and fucking have some toner.

336
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,830
All those options aren't there anymore.

337
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,740
And these people still go out there
and their boogie boards, right?

338
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,190
If you got on a boogie board,
you're like a slider, like children,

339
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:16,880
children on Boogie boards. That's
like a slider now for a fucking shark.

340
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,940
And then you get to the a, you get
to the bigger people. You know,

341
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,390
I'll tell you right now how fat I am.

342
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,070
There's no fucking way
I would go out there.

343
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,810
They'd think I was a fucking c line and
Albino Sea lion that got shunned by the

344
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,970
rest of the herd.
You know?

345
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,000
Is there anything worse than watching a
fucking animal on one of those animals

346
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:39,070
shows getting shunned by the
rest of the herd. You know,

347
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,090
animals are like super fucking racist.

348
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:43,970
I don't know what it is to second
somebody is a fucking albino.

349
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,580
They show a little bit of weakness.
I mean,

350
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,480
they're really terrible people and
you never hear Peter Bring that up.

351
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,220
Okay?

352
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,210
I mean, sure. They sit there and they
talk about how bad human beings are. Hey,

353
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,480
you know, guilty as charged.
You're looking at it. I'd be,

354
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:01,760
I've gone down to fucking
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

355
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,520
I've eaten their beak list chicken,
you know,

356
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,780
all walking around roid it up like
McGuire and fucking Sosa fallen on their

357
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:12,560
fucking faces because people like
the white meat more. You know,

358
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,710
I've eaten that shit.
Guilty fucking charge.

359
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,070
But what they don't talk about
is how those fucking chickens,

360
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,190
if they were allowed to keep their beaks,
you know,

361
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:24,350
and not have chest so
big that they fell down,

362
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,740
they would be bullying the
fucking week. His hand, you know,

363
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:29,660
you don't deserve to have children,
right?

364
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,760
Just go over and they'd Pecker to death
and they never, you know, they go, oh,

365
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:35,360
you know,
that's just how they are.

366
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,670
Okay.

367
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,031
You know,

368
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,900
it's survival of the fittest and all
that shit and then all of a sudden human

369
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,940
beings start doing it,
right.

370
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,350
Some fucking narc gets thrown into a
locker and all of a sudden it's this

371
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:52,210
national fucking story.
I think when human beings,

372
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,610
is it going to turn it around and was
the day we just admit that we're just a

373
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:59,440
bunch of fucking animals. You know? I
have no idea what I'm talking about.

374
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:01,300
I just,
I have not looked at any news.

375
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,110
I don't know what this fucking Pokemon
thing is about. Everybody's talking about.

376
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:08,260
I finally asked somebody at work.
I know that there's like,

377
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:09,960
okay,

378
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,770
I know it was a movie.
I know kids were intuitive.

379
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,390
I guess just people running
around with their phones,

380
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:17,030
trying to find the Pokemon's to,

381
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,620
to capture them in the
middle of the fucking day. We
were in the writer's Roman.

382
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,590
These kids ran up to this dumpster and it
was like a fucking Wednesday afternoon.

383
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,870
So don't you have to go to work?
Shouldn't you be somewhere right now?

384
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,640
You know what I mean? She'd be out there
blaming your parents for something. Um,

385
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:37,970
yeah,

386
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,330
I dunno. It's really making that pope
Pokemon things really making me feel old.

387
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,230
Everybody is going around,

388
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,870
a lot of people going around doing it
and then there's people watching people

389
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:47,321
doing it.

390
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:50,770
So it's like they're not doing anything
and then you're watching them doing

391
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:51,604
nothing.

392
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,510
Okay.

393
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,140
It's kind of fucking weird, right? It's
like, I saw this thing the other day,

394
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,170
you know, on roller coasters now that
some of the new rollercoasters say, yeah,

395
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,160
having people get on the roller coaster
and then you put on virtual reality

396
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:07,120
glasses, right? And it's like,

397
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,730
it's not enough to be on the rollercoaster
and then you've got to be on the,

398
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,050
put the glasses on and you go up the hill
and then as you go over the top and he

399
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:15,040
had that big drop,

400
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,210
they make it feel as though you're
falling off of a building or something.

401
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,490
It's like, well, you know, you're
kind of doing that in real life.

402
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:26,310
Why don't you take them off and enjoy
it? I don't, you know what it is.

403
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,320
It's all of us just slowly but
surely working our way to robots.

404
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,390
You know, having a robot, mom
and dad and these, fuck ain't no,

405
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:38,640
I ran into some nerd the other day
that was into fucking robotics.

406
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,503
Believe it or not.

407
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,540
Yeah.

408
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,460
Did this benefit for a,

409
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,570
that tragedy there in Orlando,
right?

410
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,770
Do you guys remember that tragedy as it
had been 52 more fucking shooting since

411
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,360
then that people don't even remember it.
Right?

412
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,450
So we did a benefit for that and um,

413
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,920
upstanding out in the alley afterwards
having a fucking cigar. Right?

414
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,530
And this kid comes up,
I call him a kid.

415
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:06,740
That means he was like 26 years old and
he was fucking talking about how he's

416
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:10,850
into robotics and all this type of shit.
And I was just like,

417
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:15,740
why are you doing that? What does
our way, he wasn't into robotics,

418
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:16,850
what the fuck was he into?

419
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,493
Okay.

420
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,390
It was into some shit that would just
basically gather information on the user

421
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:24,970
without the person really knowing
it. And it's just like, why?

422
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,330
Why are you doing that? You
know? And he's got well, but
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

423
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:31,030
And I just kept hammering them with
the questions and hammer them with the

424
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:34,930
questions. And at the end of the day,
the only way he could defend what he,

425
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,580
what he was doing was he basically said
this, well, you know, if I didn't do it,

426
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:43,280
someone else would right there.
That's the devil.

427
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,460
That's the devil song right there.
Hi Ho. Hi Ho. If I didn't do it,

428
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:51,280
someone else would. It doesn't
rhyme. Who gives a fuck?

429
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:56,110
I hope let's go fucking do something
evil as it might've been the worst song

430
00:24:56,111 --> 00:25:00,350
ever. If you have to justify your
fucking job by basically say, you know,

431
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,260
if I didn't do it,
somebody else would.

432
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,530
What jobs are those spying
on people dealing drugs,

433
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,813
right?

434
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:16,660
Fucking, I dunno what
shooting porno dropping bombs.

435
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:20,650
I mean, anytime. The only way to justify
your job is as if I didn't do it.

436
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:24,960
Somebody else would,
uh, you know, I dunno,

437
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,920
but these fucking assholes making these
robots, man, they're making them too good.

438
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,330
I used to do a bit about it.
You know, that basic, you know,

439
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,330
I don't mind if you make the
fucking thing super smart,

440
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:40,480
just don't have it be able to
run like fucking Bo Jackson,

441
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:44,380
which is what they're doing because they
keep trying to improve it and they're

442
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,560
fucking competing with somebody
else. Some other con uh, companies,

443
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:51,610
fucking robot and they're just making
the thing into the $6 million man.

444
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:52,990
It's like, guys, guys,

445
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,080
you already stuck every fucking answer
to any question ever. And it between,

446
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:02,030
it's fucking nonexistent metal fucking
ears. I guess it has metal lyrics.

447
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,850
Nonexisting human years and now you're
going to be able to make it run a fucking

448
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:10,260
four 40 you know like this, this
thing knows the answers to everything,

449
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,873
right.

450
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,720
You know, and it, and it can make the
fucking Seahawks secondary. That's,

451
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,260
that's what the fuck you're building
and you don't think that that's going to

452
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:23,010
come back and bite us in the ass.
It knows the answer to everything.

453
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,610
So it basically knows how to do open heart
surgery and also how to load and fire

454
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:34,260
an AK 47
flying f six stayed.

455
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,060
I mean it's limitless.

456
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,260
Like you remember those fucking
action movies where like the fucking,

457
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,840
this the hero of the movie.
I don't care.

458
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,460
Kind of mode of transportation
of fucking boat, a helicopter,

459
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,830
a motorcycle,
the space shuttle.

460
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,980
This fucking guy knows how to use it.

461
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,120
No pre flight.
You just start the fucking helicopter up.

462
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,680
He yanked the guts out of it.
You know,

463
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:02,250
I took a ride in a fucking a star the
other day and I, there's no firewall.

464
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,320
I wouldn't be able to figure out how to
fucking start that thing up. I got over,

465
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:11,250
I got to got 120 hours
flying a Robinson 22.

466
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:15,060
You stick me in an a star. It's
like, hey kids, little help

467
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,760
these fucking Rambo guys,
these Steven Seagal guys,

468
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:25,590
these muscle from Brussels
guys, Chuck Norris, right?

469
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,970
Eddie D's in all of them.

470
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,971
They just fucking ran up and could just
do it and used to always laugh going,

471
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,730
that's fucking pull anybody. You know,
if you had a boat, you just be like, wow,

472
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,680
I went off. What? They didn't
know where the fucking keys were.

473
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,390
Just jumps right in.

474
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,570
The fucking keys are right there and he
knows exactly where the fucking throttle

475
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:46,500
is. He doesn't have to look around and
get his bearings like, hey, this is this.

476
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,131
That's that.

477
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:52,131
He just fucking jumps in like it's his
boat and it always makes you laugh going,

478
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:55,920
yet that would never happen in real
life. Well guess what? In 2016,

479
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,640
that's going to happen.
These fucking robots.

480
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,260
I don't know why they
would be running away.

481
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,760
They're not going to be
running away from us.

482
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,670
They're going to be running
after us. And, uh, you know,

483
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:08,160
if they get sick of fucking running,
which why would they,

484
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,230
they don't have a respiratory system as
long as they charged up like a fucking

485
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:17,040
Tesla, they're never going to stop.
But it doesn't make a difference.

486
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,070
What mode of transportation,
what weapon is nearby?

487
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,070
That was another thing with those
action heroes, whatever. Fucking they,

488
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
they'd pick up a goddamn garden and how,

489
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:28,170
and all of a sudden this spinning
around like Bruce Lee, it's like Jesus,

490
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:31,080
where you, when you were in band,
you, when you were a major Rhett too,

491
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,490
you went time to fucking
master all the martial arts.

492
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,300
Learn how to use not only
every mode of transportation,

493
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,050
every fucking aberration of that
fucking mode of transportation.

494
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,810
Is that the right word? You know,
every style of fucking boat.

495
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't give a fuck if it's sailing.

496
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,240
If it's a submarine or
a fucking cruise ship,

497
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,680
you know how to get that fucking thing
going and the docket and tie it off all

498
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:59,640
at the same fucking time.
Right? These robots can do that.

499
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,250
But at least Rambo,
at least Rambo bled.

500
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,210
He had to take time to fucking
so himself back up. He's robots,

501
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:10,410
don't we think of bleeds, we can kill
it. The fucking robots don't bleed.

502
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,040
You know what I mean?
And you know these fucking nerds,

503
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,370
you know back in the day he poured a
Dixie Cup of water on down their back,

504
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:20,310
you know, and they didn't do like a
person lift their shoulders up and go,

505
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,870
all right, they don't, they fucking short
circuit out and then they fall down.

506
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,080
So you know what these nerds at doing,
they're like, well we can't have that.

507
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,600
You know the competition's robot.

508
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,520
If you dump a little bit
of water down its back,

509
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,520
it shorts out and they goes fucking a
zillion dollars with the technology,

510
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:38,310
you know that they're making, they're
going to make these full fucking robots.

511
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,070
They're going to make
them be able to swim.

512
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,410
Okay,

513
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,840
bye. Do everything is going to
be just like that fucking movie.

514
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,970
Well that guy had all those fucking lady
robots and he was fucking him and shit,

515
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,960
right? And then the one kid gets locked
in the breezeway and he's screaming like,

516
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:57,410
I thought you loved me. And she
just goes away with the expression,

517
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:59,900
this look on her face. That's what
they're going to do. I guarantee,

518
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,940
I bet you right now as I'm talking,

519
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,390
somebody somewhere is fucking a robot.

520
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:06,940
Okay.

521
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,890
Then Alex got the lab coat on and shit.

522
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,870
So he makes him feel
like he's doing research

523
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,160
and there's a bunch of other scientist
watching him fucking the robot. Right.

524
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And then afterwards he's going to give
the feedback. Oh No. You know what it is?

525
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,230
It's,
it's a fucking,

526
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,440
it's probably just some regular person
who has like Hep c but can't afford that

527
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:33,120
1090 $5 a pill to get rid of it as
somebody's HIV positive. So they go,

528
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,340
hey man,
you want dead fucking pill?

529
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,010
You got to come in here and
fuck this robot on film.

530
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,300
Yeah.

531
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,120
Oh, this last thing I'll tell
you and I got to go to work.
Did you fucking see, uh,

532
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,370
have you seen this? Evidently, I
don't know if this is fucking true,

533
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,800
but ever since finally,
the pharmaceutical lobbyists,

534
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,480
any states where weed is
legal, debt going after, uh,

535
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,320
the legalization of weed because any,
any state where weed is legal,

536
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,070
um, the prescriptions go down.
I don't know if this is true,

537
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:05,280
but somebody told me it was and I
never looked up any information,

538
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:09,900
so I'm going to say it's true and I
owe big apology to all the fucking weed

539
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:14,160
smokers out there. Evidently
you were right. Um, so anyways,

540
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,070
but I'm going to keep drinking 'em too
far down this fucking road. All right.

541
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:17,761
I gotta get Outta here.

542
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:20,850
I gotta go to fucking work and knock out
this last fucking won for Christ sake.

543
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,770
That's the podcast should cons.
I will talk to you on Thursday.

544
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:29,610
I'll check in on you. All right, go fuck
yourselves and I'll see you Thursday.

545
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,413
Three

546
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,533
things.

547
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,253
Okay.

548
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,860
Hey, what's going on? It's bill.

549
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:34,510
This is the Monday morning
podcast for the week of July 10th,

550
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:40,730
2008. Is it July 10th? I have no idea.
I just got off a plane coming back from,

551
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,990
uh, from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. I flew us there.

552
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:49,430
I sat and see 18 a and um,

553
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,250
there were uh, to people
about, Oh, I dunno.

554
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,210
19 rows behind me talking really
loudly. You know, those people,

555
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:59,720
they laugh at everything that they
say and they never say anything funny.

556
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Four hours of that shit for fucking hours
of that. People just go and you know,

557
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,430
how many hours are left on the
flight? I don't know. Four and a half.

558
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,630
He just started laughing.
It was fucking killing me was,

559
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,920
it was torture. Oh, flight. I
ended up, you know, I end up doing,

560
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,130
I got a new battery for my,
uh, made of wood laptop,

561
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,410
so I was able to watch good fellas.

562
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,590
So I was able to drown her out
for how long has good fellas? Huh?

563
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,850
So like two hours long or some shit.
So I had that on,

564
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,800
had Goodfellas on Kranked is
high as I could, you know,

565
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,370
we did, but we won it. We were wise guys.

566
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,430
I had that fucking crank is high as I
could to try to drown out this would

567
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,530
dickless group of people. I don't know.
I, you know what I mean? Maybe it's me,

568
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:57,710
maybe I'm so fucking miserable,
you know?

569
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:01,220
Am I so miserable that I actually need
something to be funny to laugh at?

570
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,520
You know? I mean I was sitting there in
the end of it trying, you don't want to.

571
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,920
And they finally, you know, I actually,

572
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,490
I didn't know watch the end of end
of Goodfellas. I hate when he's,

573
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,390
when he fucking becomes a Druggie, you
know what I mean? He just pisses me off,

574
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,620
you know? And then, then, then he feels
like all, he feels like he's the victim,

575
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,970
you know,
6,000 bucks for a life of work.

576
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,320
He gives me six grand.

577
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,020
You're lucky he didn't fucking
blow your brains out right there.

578
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,820
He told you not to fuck with the drugs,

579
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,570
the exact fucking thing he told you
not to do. You went out, you did it.

580
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,480
And then he ends up going
to jail and dying in jail.

581
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,800
You piece of Shit I fucking hate at
the beginning of that movie is great

582
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,170
right up through the, was that the Lewenza
fucking robbery. That movie is awesome.

583
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:50,030
And then the second, his
second, he gets that coke whore.

584
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:55,031
And that flophouse apartment and then
he's got that retard with the attitude

585
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:59,430
though the girl, they're the fucking
babysitter and I got to get my hack.

586
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,130
I Dunno. I Dunno. So anyway,
that's what I was doing.

587
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I was fucking listening to that
movie on 10 Janice Lassie is Zoho.

588
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,340
I had that fucking blasting in my ears.
One of my heroes is ringing right now.

589
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,630
I already have tinnitus in one ear from
playing drums years ago and fucking it's

590
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:24,200
going to be ringing even more because
of these fucking idiots, man. It's just,

591
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:29,090
I dunno, does anybody, you know, you got
anybody who does that shit. They just,

592
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,970
you know,
come walking up and you'll,

593
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,850
you'll be standing there waiting for
an elevator and they just go, hey,

594
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:37,410
you're doing and you're like,
good. And then I ha ha good

595
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,343
know

596
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,660
if you go to anybody
fucking Lou does it at work.

597
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:50,661
Just discretely leave a book on self
confidence in their little cubicle area.

598
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:55,380
Something, you know what I mean? People
either do that or though they said,

599
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,270
oh they hum songs. I think I already
joked about that about 28 podcasts ago,

600
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,600
but for those of you who are new to
my podcast, I used to work with a guy.

601
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,720
You ever work with someone who uh,
hums a tune that doesn't exist,

602
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,950
you know what I mean?
Used to walk around the office

603
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,590
[inaudible] [inaudible] all fucking
day long. And I used to be like,

604
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,480
what the fuck? That's not a song. Right.

605
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,990
It's not a state that sound like a
song when I hummed it. Yeah, exactly.

606
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:29,790
But that's a dead on rendition of
his fucking, you know, it just,

607
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,910
it went on forever. Like one of
those progressive prog rock bands,

608
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,740
a Dave Matthews, I saw, I'm in
concert of fucking was this terrible.

609
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,680
Somebody hooked me up with
tickets and it was one of those,

610
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,620
those bands that you get after
fucking a song and a half,

611
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,670
and then there's a black guy
playing a fiddle, which is,
which is weird, you know,

612
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,720
I usually like random shit like that, you
know, like seeing a fat Asian, you know,

613
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,900
he's, don't see that too often. You know,
black guy playing a fiddle, you know,

614
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:59,860
she'll be like, she'll
be, you know, isn't that,

615
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,360
but you think that he would, he would
do with the black guy way. You know,

616
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,320
we're all of a sudden he teaches white
people that have fiddle can actually be

617
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:10,320
cool as opposed to some,
you know,

618
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,920
redneck instrument or a,

619
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,640
I guess in classical music it's cool.
But you know what I mean? Let me,

620
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,010
black people made happy birthdays,
make a cool sound, you know, cool song.

621
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,120
Keep thinking. You know, that's what I,

622
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:26,550
that's when I saw black guy with the
fiddle. That's what I thought. Okay.

623
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:28,950
He's gonna, he's gonna.
He's don't break it down.

624
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,670
I thought someone was going to happen
and he just was playing that skip to my

625
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:37,480
Lou spin your partner
round to a ride that,

626
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,460
that style,

627
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,590
I think the black guy who plays the
saxophone and the Dave Matthews band,

628
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,050
I bet he doesn't talk to the
blackout plays the fiddle.

629
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,630
I bet he thinks he's a seller just coming
up. So whenever you show, you know,

630
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,760
motherfucker, it's bad enough you'd
be playing a motherfucking violin.

631
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,580
It'd be doing that shit every night
and for all these mother fucking white

632
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:57,930
people.
How do you think that makes me feel?

633
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,960
That was a worst impression of a black
saxophone player in a band that I don't

634
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:06,370
like, that I'll ever do, but
I don't give a fuck a ride.

635
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:09,480
He's got off a Goddamn plane. Cut me
some slack. I listened to people laugh,

636
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,860
but you know, it's like a nightmare
fucking comedy show. You know what I mean?

637
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,930
We're all of a sudden, it didn't,
it didn't make sense anymore.

638
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:18,420
Like you just said anything
like, Hey, can I get up?

639
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,400
I need to need to go to
the bathroom. Yeah. Okay.

640
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:28,290
All right. Anyway, let's get on
with the podcast here. Ah, um,

641
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,180
what do we got here? I'm, what
am I gonna do with this week?

642
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,220
We'll start with the questions.
Not Fuck that. I want to,

643
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,380
I want to hype the shit first.
First of all,

644
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,490
I just got back from the
Improv in Pittsburgh.

645
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,770
Unbelievable turnout and
99.9% of that has to go to,

646
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:45,760
uh,
the Jim and Randy show on WTV.

647
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:47,320
Those guys totally hooked me up.

648
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,730
They let me come in on a Wednesday on a
Thursday and on a Friday I did like nine

649
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:55,450
hours a fucking radio with those guys
letting everybody know that I was going to

650
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:59,320
be over at the stacks, the
mall over there. And uh,

651
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:04,030
other than the fact that a couple of
people got shot and one was murdered, um,

652
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:07,810
I think it was a good week over there
at the mall. Get an happened one week,

653
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,850
one night we were out drinking and uh,

654
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,660
all of a sudden we couldn't leave
the mall cause somebody got shot.

655
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,340
And this is fucking unbelievable.

656
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,260
Stand within a stone's throw of
a stone stone, no pun intended,

657
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:25,030
a Coldstone creamery. It's not supposed
to happen, isn't it? When you, you know,

658
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,400
when you see a Fuddruckers,
right. I just don't,

659
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,190
I just don't associate that with violence.
But anyways,

660
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,210
I had a great week out there and I want
to thank all the guys over at DV for

661
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:36,940
hooking me up and everybody
who came out to see me,

662
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,090
I'm also once again to remind you,

663
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:43,240
I have a one hour special
coming out on comedy central.

664
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,590
August 23rd all right,
say your Tivo six weeks ahead.

665
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,390
For some reason my fucking CD
comes out before the special,

666
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,920
which makes no sense to me,

667
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,430
but I believe that's in stores on August
5th and then the DVD DVD comes out I

668
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,870
think September 14th.

669
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,680
I know it's bizarre if you guys are
going to be sick of me by mid September.

670
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,900
But anyways, uh, please check it out.

671
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:10,870
I'm really proud of the special
we shot at ourselves. Uh,

672
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,800
it's all your friends to
watch it and a whatever.

673
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,540
Hopefully they become fans of what I do.

674
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:20,710
And then they show up at my shows and
someday I can afford to take a private jet

675
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,960
or at the very least set up in first class
where I can afford those Bose headset

676
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,240
where I can drown out people if they
fucking are laughing about shit that isn't

677
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:34,480
funny. Alright, let's get on
with the podcast questions.

678
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:38,230
If you new to my podcast,
this is what I do every week I babble.

679
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,140
I bitch about people in airports.
I answer questions.

680
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,710
I riff about the Dave Matthews band
and I hide my shit. I'm not, I don't,

681
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,370
I don't riff about the Dave Matthews Fan.

682
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,370
I don't even know any of this
fucking songs. I just know, uh,

683
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,200
I know crash in [inaudible].
Yeah,

684
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,030
they bay. Um, and then I come into you,

685
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,150
he really is like disgusting lyrics
when you really think about it,

686
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,820
but he thinks he thinks in nicely.

687
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,060
I don't like that little James
Brown fucking Jiggy does either.

688
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:11,800
When he's sitting there
with his acoustic guitar,

689
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,790
I never really noticed how much I
didn't like that. Ben, do you know what?

690
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:16,900
I'm gonna have to think about this.

691
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,250
I'm going to get back if you have to get
back to you guys on this one. Listen,

692
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,510
I'm stuttering.
I'm so fucking annoyed from that flight.

693
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,640
Maybe I'm really just pissed at
the people on the plane and uh,

694
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,420
I'm taking it out on the Dave Matthews
band. Misdirected anger. All right,

695
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,950
let's get into the questions here.
People.

696
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,730
I got to make this one a quick one because
I've got a bunch of bull shit I got

697
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:39,230
to do today. Um, and one of them
is the fix my attitude. All right,

698
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:43,700
question number one. Bill, I
have a question for you podcast.

699
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,480
Why don't you just ask it? Okay. It's
like people go, let me tell you something.

700
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,840
He said, he just fucking saying it.
I said, I think I do that. All right.

701
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,200
I have a question for you. Podcasts,
being a comic from New York City,

702
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:57,950
which coast do you think is best
for standup comedy? First of all,

703
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:01,100
I am not a comic from New York City.
I'm a comic from Boston,

704
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,840
Massachusetts who then moved
to New York City. Um, okay.

705
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,020
Uh, I would is, what's the
question? Which coast too,

706
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:12,500
I think is best for standup comedy?
Uh,

707
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,090
Christ, I don't know. I ain't go,

708
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:20,240
how's that for fucking a bad
answer. Um, New York City,

709
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,980
if you just want to become a great comic,

710
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:25,760
there's nothing better than New York City.
It's got like 9 million clubs.

711
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,170
He can do like 10 sets a night. If
you want, not 10, you could do 10.

712
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:34,310
But I think realistically you do seven or
eight. Once you run with all the clubs,

713
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,990
at least she could back in the day.

714
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,930
I just keep digressing
with everything I'm saying.

715
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,720
So I would say New York was great.
And then there's other,

716
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,800
other cities that are good to start
out in, which is a, Boston was great.

717
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,550
Houston's always have a good
scene. Denver, San Francisco,

718
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,990
Seattle's a bunch of funny guys there.
Minnesota has got a great scene.

719
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,270
Um, yeah. You know what I
mean? I worked in Atlanta.

720
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,730
I don't know if you're funny,
just get your shit together,

721
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:06,290
but I guess you're asking me, should you
move to New York City or la? Um, you,

722
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,950
I would visit both places before
you went out there because, uh,

723
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:11,451
I don't know,

724
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:15,200
New York City just felt like home when
I went there and when I went to La,

725
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,830
you know, the weather was
great and everything was
cool, but it was a, you know,

726
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,700
I stood in line for fucking nine hours
to do way yet to sign up for a three

727
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:30,941
minute spot at the laugh factory
and a at a fucking sunburn.

728
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,180
I got there at nine in the morning for
a sign up that was at six at night.

729
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,540
This is no bullshit, right. Sat
right there on sunset avenue.

730
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,890
Did it take you guys down memory lane?
So I'm sitting there and uh,

731
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,880
I just remember there was these
two fat chicks. I'm fucking Utah,

732
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,770
something that had really bad tattoos.

733
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,510
I was third in line by nine in the
morning. That's all I remember. And uh,

734
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,740
yeah. And then I wasn't down
there with anybody else,

735
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:01,580
so I couldn't leave other than
quickly to go take a bathroom break.

736
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:04,610
Like there was literally a whole
system was a fucking nightmare. Right.

737
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,290
Ended up getting a sunburn right
on my huge forehead and uh,

738
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,790
went home after I signed up,
it's six, went back to the kids,

739
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,800
a problem where I was staying,
showered really quickly,

740
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:19,490
came back down and had to
do three minutes of standup,

741
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,880
which is practically impossible.
You know what I mean?

742
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,690
That's like trying to finish a bowl of
cereal in like two scoops, you know?

743
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,660
So I went down there and I
don't know how to fuck I did it,

744
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:34,661
but I went on stage and I absolutely
fucking destroyed for three minutes.

745
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,060
I did a tight three minutes
set that had a beginning,

746
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:42,600
a middle and an end probably cause I
only had like a half hour material.

747
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:46,710
I knew I figured out how to do it. So
I'm sitting there going like, Oh man,

748
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,920
I got off stage. I was like,
that's it. I'm in at this club.

749
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,490
I'm going to get a manager. This is,
you know, everything's going to happen.

750
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,740
And then I went upstairs and uh,

751
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,250
I met the infamous Jamie Masada
who calls everybody body.

752
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,640
So I'm sitting there and he had his
table and I sit down at his table.

753
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,300
I'm thinking, this guy is
just going to kiss my ass.
You know, I'm some young buck.

754
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,140
I went up there fucking destroyed.
I was better than, you know,

755
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:16,140
the two fat chicks from Utah.
This is it. It's over. Right.

756
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,110
So I sit down,
you know,

757
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,930
my ego's through the fucking
roof and he's just like,

758
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,840
I don't mean he sat the
stared at me for a second,

759
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:29,760
he had his hands together like
not in a fist, but sort of like a,

760
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,940
he's doing the church and the steeple
thing except all these things are up.

761
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,450
And he had his index fingers up
on his mouth and he just goes,

762
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,130
you're very funny. And I was like, oh,
thank you very much. I'm like, okay,

763
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:43,830
here comes sit, comes here comes, he's
going to have to manage me. Right.

764
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,790
And he's like, uh, you
know, you, you, you talk,

765
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,680
you talk a lot about Bilal, about
your father, you know? Yeah. Go. Yeah,

766
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,360
yeah.
You can say you should do more.

767
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:59,310
You should do more about do mono bunch
of father. And I'm like, Oh yeah, yeah.

768
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:01,530
You know, I, I've got a
ton of stuff about my dad.

769
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:04,740
I got some more stuff about my mom
and as I'm saying that he holds my,

770
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,990
his hand up to silence me.

771
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,030
At which point I literally shut the
fuck up and he just goes, you'll father,

772
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,210
let me ask you a question.

773
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,200
How does it make you feel
when your father yells?

774
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,820
And then he leaned back in his
chair, right? And it was like,

775
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,840
I felt like he was going to give me the
answer to all my standup questions in

776
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:34,920
the form of a riddle.
And immediately I,

777
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:40,550
I begin grabbing the legs on the back of
the chair because I was going to smash

778
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:45,270
it over his fucking head because I was
so fun. I was so pissed. I was like,

779
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:45,520
you gotta be,

780
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,940
I just fucking kill for three minutes
and now you're going to act like you the

781
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,140
Standup Guru, you Jack Ass.
And that's exactly what he did.

782
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,520
He didn't ask to manage me.

783
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,660
He just gave me a little, how does it
make you feel when your dad yells, Jamie,

784
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:03,180
I hope you'll listen to this cause
I'm playing your club this week.

785
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,960
How do you think it made me feel?
Made me feel like a semi feel sad.

786
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,470
Is that what you wanted to hear?
Jesus Christ.

787
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:14,340
This guy came at me like one of those
guys ever see those interviews when the

788
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:18,210
interview somebody after like a tornado
hit the house and killed their favorite

789
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,230
dog,
you know?

790
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,000
And they're sitting there interviewing
them and they want them to cry and then

791
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:25,420
not crying.
So then they got to,

792
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,680
they got to sit there and
ask them questions to try
and make them fucking cry.

793
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,280
I think that's what he
was trying to do to me.

794
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,450
So I literally was grabbing the back
of the chair, the legs and the back.

795
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:39,280
I distinctly remember doing that and
I was like, fuck this guy. Fuck La.

796
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,520
I'm going to New York.
That's how I ended up in New York.

797
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,380
One three minutes set after
nine hours in a second degree,

798
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:48,640
sunburn on my forehead.

799
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,470
I decided that the east coast
was the place I needed to
be. You know what I mean?

800
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,650
And uh, you know, I worked out well for
me. You know what? You know what's funny?

801
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,110
Somebody who's probably going to fucking
tell Jamie then I actually said that

802
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,160
shit just so they can try to get a
three minute and audition on Tuesday.

803
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:08,080
So this week when I go down there,
Jamie's going to be like, buddy Bobby,

804
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:11,510
what do you, what do, what are you doing
buddy? I actually love Jamie now man.

805
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,720
And I'm not kissing his ass
either cause I don't give a fuck.

806
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:17,830
But he said the funniest shit to me.
Like three weeks ago,

807
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,920
I'm working this club and I'm standing
in the lobby and these two gorgeous

808
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:28,120
girls, you know, La to fucking gorgeous.
So I'm looking at them, you know,

809
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,710
eyes bugging out of my head and Jamie's
like, buddy, buddy, buddy. Well,

810
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:36,040
what are you doing man? What, what,
what do I go? Do you mind? I go,

811
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:40,150
what do you mean what am I doing? Am I go,
I'm looking at the girls. He goes, yeah,

812
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:44,020
buddy. But what? Why? Why are
you looking at the girls? I go,

813
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:48,100
cause they're beautiful. I
go, why wouldn't I be looking
at the girls? And he goes,

814
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:49,360
cause you're a fag.

815
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,960
I think I butchered that. He said it
even better. It was a fucking, he saw,

816
00:48:55,961 --> 00:49:00,430
he totally set me up, son of a
bitch. And if you live in La,

817
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,740
I'm going to be down there Tuesday night,
Thursday night,

818
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,940
Friday night and Saturday night all on
the 10 o'clock show and I'll be having a

819
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:10,780
good time down there. All right. So
there you go. See that? I Trust Jamie.

820
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,550
Then I tell a funny story where he trashes
me and then I hype is club and then

821
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:18,940
it's all good. Huh? Who the fuck's in
show business? I am. I know how to do it.

822
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,320
I know how to escape the fucking lines.
All right, so that's what I would do, son.

823
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:24,461
I would,

824
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,760
I would go to New York and La and
figure out which one you want to be in.

825
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,850
All right. That's it. All
right. Question number three.

826
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,710
Have you ever had any thoughts about
doing a European tour of your show?

827
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,070
Absolutely. I feel that I'm
going to conspiracy theory.

828
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,690
I feel like they're crashing the dollar
and all these corporations that are all

829
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:46,120
going global,
so I'm going global with them.

830
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,800
I'm not going to be caught flat footed
with a pocket full of currency that isn't

831
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,150
worth the Goddamn peso.

832
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,500
So I'm actually setting up a European
tour for the beginning part of next year,

833
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:02,230
or at some point in 2009, I should say.
Uh, I want to get over to England, Sweden.

834
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,890
Uh, I did some shit one
time in the Netherlands.

835
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,460
It's really disappointed when I went
to know Netherlands when I got off the

836
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:13,360
plane and the first thing I saw
was like a fucking Dunkin donuts.

837
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,070
You know what I mean? And like a
Mcdonald's, it just, it just really is.

838
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,350
I understand why people
find America so annoying.

839
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,330
It's because the urban sprawl
of our fucking corporations,
you know what I mean?

840
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,680
I literally think that that I
could go to like fucking Nah,

841
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,720
let me pick up to take a fucking nice
obscure country that I don't even know

842
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:34,640
where it is on a map.
Let me think of something

843
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,630
Bosnia now I know why that's
fucking eastern Europe, Olivia.

844
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,760
And it was one of those,
that law that's in South America,

845
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:45,530
whatever you gotta fucking Bolivia,

846
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,700
you think he can go down there and see
that fucking that guy from the tee shirt

847
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:53,990
that everybody wears,
cig go viral, Gutierrez,

848
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:58,220
whatever his name is, balance
way, that fucking guy.

849
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,920
And he'd go down and he'd get off with
the first thing you see Colonel Sanders

850
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:02,540
on a big bucket of fucking chicken.

851
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,090
I think that's what Hugo Chavez
is big fuck. I love that guy, man.

852
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,230
That guy is the shit. You
know what I mean? Those guys,

853
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:16,850
they remind me like Tony Montana,
that's what Hugo Chavez is.

854
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,360
Too Much Java has taken on the u s
knowing full well that we could fucking

855
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:24,380
Newcomb anytime we wanted to
talk and shit about us at the UN.

856
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:29,480
He's like in his early Tony Montana
use, you know? Um, so for us,

857
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,860
Jesus, his is and annoying. He's
in his early Tony Montana years,

858
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:36,740
like right before he, uh, he gets the, uh,

859
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,070
the Cadillac with the leopard skin.
You know what I mean?

860
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:43,700
When he's still washing dishes with that,
that fucking Robin Williams,

861
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,750
Hawaiian sharp. That's what Hugo
Chavez right now. All right,

862
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,760
question number four. This is very,
a little jet lag here, people. Sorry.

863
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,550
I mean fucking blow through these and
I'll stop wasting your time. All right,

864
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,390
question number four. A Oh God.
This one has a backstory. Yes.

865
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,760
I attempted to renew my Norton Antivirus,

866
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:04,520
all that God wanted me to sing
a song about Microsoft. I can't,

867
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:08,430
I can't remix this song it unless they
have a song. You know what I mean? You,

868
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:10,640
you gotta,
you gotta you gotta pick one.

869
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,040
You got to pick a product that annoys you,

870
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:17,480
that actually has a song and I will do a
fucking puff daddy remix of it that has

871
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,540
the word continent and it'll make you
feel better. All right. All right.

872
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:23,300
Question number five. Hey
Bill, here's a question.

873
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:26,210
Have you ever had people bring
their kids to your shows?

874
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,130
And I'm not talking 18 years old. I
mean like five years old. Absolutely.

875
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,630
I've had people bring babies and I've
been in the middle of talking about

876
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:38,060
something really a, I don't know, evil,

877
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,660
talking about going to a
titty bar and now I hate that,

878
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:44,360
you know regular girls go
to titty bars now, you know,

879
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,810
cause they killed the perverted
vibe of the club. I was doing that.

880
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:52,730
This talking about how strip clubs are
for horizontally and then I can't feel

881
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:56,890
comfortable leering at a stripper when
I'm sitting next to Melissa and don't

882
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,450
doing that joke and all of a
sudden he just hit his baby.

883
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,420
Baby starts crying in the back
and then it's it, you know,

884
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:09,260
something that's even more awkward
when they bring a kid that can speak.

885
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,350
You know,
why don't I just say a five,

886
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:16,970
five years old or over other than having
you guys picture mutes or something.

887
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,250
Yeah. I've actually, I've
had people bring kids.

888
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,410
I'm trying to think and
hasn't happened in a while.

889
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,830
There was actually girl this week in
Pittsburgh. She laughed like a little kid.

890
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,290
So it was weird.
She sounded like a little kid,

891
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,990
so it was freaking all the comics out.

892
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:35,670
And then it turned out
she wasn't a little kid.

893
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,010
She was just an adult with
a really annoying voice.

894
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,900
And then she came up to me afterwards and
she had these huge teddies and she was

895
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:46,680
saying, come on down to plush, which
is some strip club in Pittsburgh.

896
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,580
And she had that classic,
uh, Anna Nichole Smith.

897
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,930
I'm going to overdose in
a hard rock cafe voice.

898
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,130
So if she's listening,
I hope you're still alive.

899
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,870
And he didn't know di did
I ever tell you that story?

900
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:09,080
I played the same hardrock cafe that
fucking Anna Nicole Smith died in.

901
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,420
And I gotta tell you something that's
been there for three fucking days.

902
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:16,020
I get it. I think she killed herself. I
don't think it was an overdose. I think,

903
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,250
you know, an accidental, I think
she did it on purpose because, uh,

904
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,980
that place sucks. All right,
question number seven, Bell.

905
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,300
I recently went to an open Mike and my
local comedy club for the first time just

906
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:30,540
to watch the club,
just to watch Jesus Christ.

907
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,690
Nobody puts capital letters
anymore or punctuation.

908
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:36,570
I just went right to the next sentence.
Bill.

909
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,740
I recently went to open mic night and
my local comedy club for the first time

910
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:45,330
just to watch the club only has
open Mike night once a month,

911
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,320
which is gay,
but I can't do anything about it anyway.

912
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,460
I figure most of the, most of the
commerce that got up would suck and bomb.

913
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,590
Maybe a few would do okay.

914
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:58,980
But there were about 14 and 13 of
them ended up doing really well.

915
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:02,850
This was discouraging to me because I
figured most open micros would suck,

916
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:07,140
which would make me feel better
about myself and my call me comedy.

917
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,150
Is this how open Mike was for you? Please
share your wisdom with me. Alright.

918
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,870
I'll share my stories. Wisdoms
going a little too far.
Yeah, that's what it's like.

919
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,760
You go down there and there's people who
are still doing open mikes but they're,

920
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:24,120
they're better than being an open
Mike Micros at that point. Um,

921
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,480
but they still need to stage time and uh,
you know,

922
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:31,110
sometimes you know features and sometimes
even a headline I might drop it and

923
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:35,760
that's Kinda how it is. And uh, yeah,
your first few open mics, so lonely,

924
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:37,200
but uh,

925
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,920
he just got to see the humor and it just
go up there the first time you do it.

926
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,180
It's not even about doing well
whether Ed don't judge it,

927
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:48,690
whether you did good or bad
the first time you go on stage,

928
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:51,720
it's just all about having the balls to
go up there when they call your name,

929
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,770
you know, and if you have the balls
to go up there, then you know,

930
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,030
you got more balls than 95%
of people in that situation.

931
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:03,420
So just take that as a victory tape.

932
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,610
You said keep it,

933
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,930
lock it away in a safe and then someday
when you're good at it you can take it

934
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:13,530
out and just laugh your ass
off at the shift that you,

935
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,520
that the shit that you attempt it. I
wish I take my first one. I didn't,

936
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,900
I mean just to give you, make you feel
better. I was supposed to do five minutes.

937
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,410
I think I did about three. I walked up
there and the second I saw the microphone,

938
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,210
I forgot everything I was going to say.

939
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:33,400
And I started in the middle of the shit
that I wanted to say and then brought it

940
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:38,380
back around to the front kinda. I've
followed the same pattern of pulp fiction,

941
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,420
you know what I mean?
Well they start with that,

942
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:43,060
oh you mother fuckers get on the ground,
all that bullshit.

943
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,690
And then he goes to the beginning and
then fucking you end up seeing that scene.

944
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,640
I like Goodfellas, same
fucking thing. That's how I,

945
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:53,260
that's how my first stand up set went
except unlike those awesome movies.

946
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,730
Mine was terrible.

947
00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:00,010
So just picture if they
w was that the happening?

948
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,600
If m m night Shambhala Dingdong
made that fucking movie,

949
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:08,610
the way they made pulp fiction that,
you know, that's the way my friend,

950
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,140
I'm trying to tell you, my first
set sucks, so don't worry about it.

951
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,130
Don't worry about,
just go up there and I get it.

952
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,740
You've got to find the humor and bombing.
There's nothing funnier than bombing.

953
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:18,790
It's fucking hilarious.

954
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,530
It's just something undeniably funny
about standing in front of a room full of

955
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:25,960
people and just putting it out there.

956
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Especially if you're high energy and
you and your joke fucking bad at bat and

957
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:33,730
everybody's just fucking staring at you.

958
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,440
There's just no other way to describe
what a fucking tool you feel like.

959
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:46,300
But everybody's been there, you
know, bring some water up there.

960
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:49,360
You're going to get dry mouth. All right.
And just, just do it, man. It's, you know,

961
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:53,500
you'll be fine. You'll be fine.
Fuck it. All right, last question.

962
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,990
All right. Yes. It's actually a story, um,
which I actually find really interesting.

963
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:02,250
Kay. Hey Bill. And on, what
the fuck happened? My email
last week, a blah, blah, blah,

964
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:07,130
blah, blah. All right,
here we go. Oh, okay. Well,

965
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,330
auto damage related.
This is a real fucking long one.

966
00:58:09,331 --> 00:58:13,810
Let me try to get to the
meat of this thing. Um, okay.

967
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:16,450
This is an auto damage related story.
All right.

968
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:21,040
I must preface this story with the fact
that I find it very difficult to contain

969
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,150
my temper already.

970
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:26,140
I liked the story with even I really
difficult to contain my temper with even

971
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:27,430
the most meaningless shit,

972
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,590
such as stubbing my toe are getting
cut off while driving anyways,

973
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,453
uh,

974
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:38,460
when something of actual meaning happens
to me having something of mine stolen,

975
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:41,650
let's say I really lose my shit.
All right.

976
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:45,340
A few months ago I had an expensive set
of knives missing from my kitchen and I

977
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:49,210
flew into a rage through
deductive reasoning.

978
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:52,930
I concluded it must've been
stolen by one of two people.

979
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,710
Now listen to the description so you
can guess where this story's going. Uh,

980
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,230
he was either a,

981
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:04,260
the sketchy Jewish kid who lived upstairs
or be the Mexican repairment who still

982
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:10,570
had a key and a key since I just moved in.

983
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:16,060
While the reasoning part of my
tamper tantrum was taking place,

984
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:21,090
a few racial slurs may have slipped
out and as one made to Deuce,

985
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:27,320
a temper tantrum is often accompanied
by loud screaming, oh, that's great.

986
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:30,950
They're okay. The screaming is
most often followed by regret,

987
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,650
usually concluding with embarrassment.
Anyhow,

988
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:35,510
the following day I went out to my car,

989
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:39,380
which was parked out front to
gather some belongings in the trunk.

990
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:40,760
When I got to my car,

991
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,300
I noticed that some thoughtful neighbor
who obviously heard my screaming the day

992
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:50,990
before notched a large swastika
and the center rear of my car.

993
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,990
After a few moments of
careful contemplation,

994
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:01,700
I laughed and decided to keep
it there for shameful posterity.

995
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,760
The swastika remains is a painful reminder
for me to get a handle on my anger.

996
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,970
The steak knives were never
found. All right. You know what,

997
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:15,410
I find that fucking really
to be an interesting story
because the guy actually,

998
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,520
he seems like, you know, he's trying
to improve himself as a person.

999
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:25,370
You know, he knows he has a temper
and a, he knows what he did was wrong.

1000
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,740
And, uh, I would, this is a
question I have for you guys.

1001
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:31,900
If somebody flies and cause you
know, they always say that, you know,

1002
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,710
I dunno like your,
your real thoughts come out in anger.

1003
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,300
I don't know if I like
100 100% believe that.

1004
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,900
I think when you get
angry sometimes it isn't.

1005
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:48,350
Like you have this deep seated hate.
Sometimes it just,

1006
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,410
it just trying to hurt the other person.
You know?

1007
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:53,810
Like if you get mad at some
you fucking cock sucker.

1008
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,180
I mean do you really think that
they're out there sucking dick?

1009
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,420
You know what I mean?
But then he got the other side

1010
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,780
is all of a sudden when somebody goes
into the, into actually, you know,

1011
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:11,110
racial slurs that's like above
and beyond. I know, I dunno.

1012
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,760
I Dunno about that one. Do the eye.
That's what I'm asking is that,

1013
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:17,000
you know like if somebody, if somebody
gets mad at me, a fucking Dick,

1014
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,310
like I don't think that they
really think I'm a dick.

1015
01:01:19,311 --> 01:01:22,120
I think that they're mad at me and
they called me a dick. Now there's,

1016
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,850
does anybody think that it's possible?
Because this guy seems like good dude.

1017
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:30,850
He left the swastika on it. He realized,
all right, I'm a fucking ass and I gotta,

1018
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,060
you know, keep my temper in
check. Does anybody think,

1019
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:36,170
is it possible?

1020
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:41,230
That's what I want to know to lose your
shit and you start yelling racial slurs

1021
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:47,240
and you still stick it in the same
category of like, I was just mad it see,

1022
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:49,970
just calling. Just call him, you know?

1023
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,840
I Dunno. I don't fucking know. You know
what? Be Thankful you're not famous.

1024
01:01:56,841 --> 01:02:01,760
You know what I mean? You would ended up
like a Kramer. You went out to go on a,

1025
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,850
actually, you wouldn't have
gone on Al Sharpton show.

1026
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:09,851
You wouldn't had to go on Jesus Christ
who is a Jewish guy with a bad perm or a

1027
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:12,800
Mexican guy with a bad perm.

1028
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,280
You know how shocked and would do a lot
more for his credibility if you would

1029
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:18,530
really get rid of that pimp haircut.
You know what I mean?

1030
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,270
I always felt he looked
like boss hog. Like if, if,

1031
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,680
if they ever did like the black boss
Hog, you know what I mean? All that,

1032
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,580
that's like the hacky thing to do in
Hollywood. Like once you rotted ideas,

1033
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,610
you just take, you know, a sitcom.

1034
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:36,880
Like it's Alice but it's
black and then a legit,

1035
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,940
I didn't know what the fuck I'm
talking about this point. Anyways,

1036
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:47,460
I got shit to do here. Okay.
This is a long ass podcast
as always. Uh, once again,

1037
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:49,320
thanks. Everybody came out to
my show in Pittsburgh. Man.

1038
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:50,640
It's fucking unbelievable.
I couldn't,

1039
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:55,330
last time was there was only like 18
people, so I really appreciate it. And um,

1040
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,650
I got the comedy works
coming up in Denver.

1041
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,190
Chuck died July 31st through August 2nd,
I believe.

1042
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,680
I don't have my calendar
in front of me right now.

1043
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:10,100
And also I'm going to be at the Improv
in Miami and in the middle of August.

1044
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,190
And uh, that's, it will be
adding some more dates today. Um,

1045
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,960
I think I got a month straight at dates.
One is in stress factory in New Jersey.

1046
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:23,730
I think I'm doing umass Amhurst
with Charlie Murphy and a,

1047
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,860
I think that's about it.
But anyways, everybody,

1048
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,570
thanks for listening to these podcasts.

1049
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,260
I also got a new video I'm going
to be putting up on youtube. Um,

1050
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:32,670
I add a new video last week.

1051
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:35,880
If you missed last week's podcast is
right underneath the podcast thing.

1052
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,010
It's entitled thank you.

1053
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,640
Cause this is what that lady was yelling
at me after every fucking punchline.

1054
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,550
And, uh, I'll be adding another one.

1055
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:48,330
Just come stop putting random
shit up from shows that I do. Uh,

1056
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,760
people seem to enjoy it and
it's a way to make you laugh,

1057
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:55,200
show you some new standup without
burning any bits. So, uh, so that's it.

1058
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,030
Once again, thanks to everybody, uh,
