1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,041
Hey,

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:05,430
what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:10,320
February 15th, 2016 hello. How are you?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,560
How was your world going on this Monday?

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,690
How was your Valentine's Day? Huh?
Did she get her something special?

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,100
Um, if you're a smart son of a bitch, um,

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,300
you're either not in a relationship or
you're not taking her out until tonight

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:31,800
or tomorrow, whatever. Whenever the
prices go back down again, you know,

9
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,281
and by the way,

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:36,510
if enough people start doing this in the
old fucking restaurants get wise to it

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,270
and they start making their prices higher,

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,330
Valentine's Day prices a few days before,
a few days after,

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:46,230
then fucking wait a week, wait
a month, do it a month earlier.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,993
Um,

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,130
it's the biggest fucking rip
off probably of the year,

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,040
other than probably what's
going on to Bernie Sanders,

17
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,510
but I don't really understand.
I guess she has some Super Dell delegates,

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,830
you know,
oh fuck.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,220
And Hillary Clinton's got the super
and she already has to super delegate.

20
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,090
She already has a hundred. She, he
needs 120, whatever the fuck that is.

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,570
Jesus Christ. It's like,
it's like playing bridge,

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,540
trying to keep up what's going on.
I have no idea.

23
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,900
All I know is I liked that Bernie looks
like an old dog trying to eat a meal

24
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,870
when he's talking. Harvard recovered. I
don't know what the fucking jowls going.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,590
And the weird thing said his fingers do.
I like it.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,960
I could look at that for four
years. Um, and it got to admit,

27
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:34,350
and as much as I don't like all
the racist shit Trump is doing,

28
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,830
I do love some fucking jerk off
yelling at other politicians.

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,400
So that part has been enjoyable.
You're a liar.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,241
There are there,

31
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:48,241
there weren't any mass weapons of mass
destruction and they know it maybe sounds

32
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,220
like he's quoting some podcasts.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,210
Um, I have no idea. At some point
I'm going to start paying attention.

34
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:02,010
There's gotta be some even
keeled so-and-so out there.
I have no fucking clue.

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,851
I have no clue.

36
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:06,210
And last week I said that I hated when
people are in the public eye. Talk about,

37
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:10,260
uh, politics. You know, that's not true.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,730
I hate when they fucking tell me why
I should vote for somebody. Oh Shit.

39
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:18,840
Well you were you the guy from a
interview with the vampire. Oh yeah.

40
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,480
Who should I elect for a
leader of the free world?

41
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,740
It was like with Tom Cruise was talking
about psychology. It's like, Oh yeah,

42
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:32,940
you pretended to be a shogun
warrior in a NASCAR champion.

43
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,380
Let me a while. But by all means, let me
listen to you talk about modern medicine.

44
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,230
Um, as long as you preface it
with like, I'm a fucking moron,

45
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,900
I don't know what I'm talking about.
But uh, here you go. You know,

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,540
but when you really start believing it,
that's when you get in trouble. It may be,

47
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,600
I believe it, and maybe this is the way
I'm just sort of soft pedaling it, Tia,

48
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,730
I'm playing the more on is
I'm fucking feeding your,

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,980
my putting the little a ringworm and
you're fucking ear whatever people say

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,490
there with the fucking ear worm,
right?

51
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,540
Some song you can't stand gets
in your fucking head. You know,

52
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,420
it's kind of a weird ones.

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,690
What a song you like gets in your
head and then you don't mind.

54
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,880
And then you drive everybody
nuts around you. Like, uh, um,

55
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,780
Steve Gorman from Steve Gorman sports
sent me this, this link to this, uh,

56
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,580
this country star that's been, um,
that's been struggling for a long,

57
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,350
long time.
And he finally got a big break.

58
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,930
I believe he's a distant cousin
of worry. Clark, I'm not sure,

59
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,990
but his name is Wheeler Walker Jr and uh,

60
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,590
he sent me a clip that
I'll send you guys a,

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,710
it's a great fucking song for Valentine's
Day if you are not in a relationship

62
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,200
for a man or a woman.
And a,

63
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,700
the hook is just been stuck in my head
and I really want to sing it to you,

64
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:50,050
but it's going to ruin it for you.
So go look up a wheeler Walker Jr.

65
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,460
Uh, well I guess the song kind of
ruins it. It's called fuck you bitch.

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,230
And it's really catchy and it's a,

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,610
I dunno, it's fits rich, kind of
poetic. I really think the, uh,

68
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:11,580
the chorus really sums up what you
feel when somebody breaks your heart.

69
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,750
So, um, you know, country music,
those country music stars,

70
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,460
they can do that to you
every once in a while.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,210
And it's nice to see someone
go to the left, you know,

72
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:24,810
those fucking country singer. So those
poor bastards for all these fucking years,

73
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,510
you know,
they've been abusing drugs and you know,

74
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,380
going to clan meetings and beating
the shit out of their women,

75
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:36,300
but when they get on TV, they got to
do that family values thing, you know?

76
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,660
Yeah. Gosh, well thank Jesus. I'm just,

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,040
I just feel blessed at Y'all taking
me into your heart. TNL Hey yell,

78
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,330
he wants you on some potato salad.
That's stupid,

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,370
phony fucking southern thing where if
you're from up north the first time you

80
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,230
see it,
you know your heart and melts.

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,930
When you hear that Twang and
you just think that the egg,

82
00:04:55,931 --> 00:05:00,610
the nicest fucking person, nobody can
stick the fucking knife in your back

83
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,640
like a fucking southerner. What that
fucking, hey y'all, how'd you hit our,

84
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,050
you spoke and they downplay it.
They play dumb,

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,660
but Blahblahblahblahblah
and next thing you know,

86
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,890
you're laying in a fucking pig trough
about ready to get fucking eaten alive.

87
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,810
That's how it goes down.
All right.

88
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:20,410
And that guy from fucking 50
snatches and 40 smoking barrels,

89
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,130
that's where he got it from.
Okay. Not from that content,

90
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,500
you know, I dunno what the fuck
I'm talking about. Anyways,

91
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,730
I watched a brand new TV
show last night and uh,

92
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,340
I was really fucking disappointed,
you know, I fucking turned it on.

93
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,150
I needed a new show and I thought it
was going to be the one, you know,

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,190
I was like, this is going to be it.
It's Valentine's Day night. Okay.

95
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,980
Me and the lovely Nia,
we're not going out.

96
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:55,700
I had a fucking one of those Tomahawk
steaks frozen in the freezer.

97
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,660
The fucking

98
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,650
right defroster dead bitch all day.

99
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,770
I watch like 30 youtube
videos has had dude sat.

100
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,570
Do you know if you're going to do to them?

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,980
Look to it to do one
more towards don't soon.

102
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,090
I watch like 50 those fucking things.
And I just sort of like,

103
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I took a survey with temperature and
time flippage in all of that stuff,

104
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:21,920
and I went down the middle and,
uh,

105
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,410
I got a little impatient
with the big green egg.

106
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,940
My temperature's a little
higher than I want it.

107
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,220
So came out of the medium
rather than a medium rare,

108
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,840
but it was still fucking delish. And
now there was a new series that, that,

109
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,753
um,

110
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,570
that I tried to get into last
night and I put it on and, uh,

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,460
it looked good. The acting was great,
but the dialogue just wasn't there.

112
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,490
And I tried to fucking fight it out for
the first 20 minutes and then I was just

113
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:53,100
looked over at Nia. Nia
did one of those. Yeah.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,740
You know, big inhale and the fucking
eyes like, yeah, this is a, yeah.

115
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,640
And then I was just like, well, let's
shut it off. She's like, no, you know,

116
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:05,630
we gotta at least watch the pilot episode,
you know,

117
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,790
which is how she ended up marrying me
because I believe 20 minutes into our

118
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,910
relationship, she was like, yeah,

119
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,570
but she fucking stuck it through night.

120
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,770
She kept panning for gold and she found
a little nugget and she stuck with me.

121
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,280
I didn't, I was just like,
fuck this. I'm out. And uh,

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,130
by 40 minutes into it, I was
imitating people in it and, uh,

123
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:34,040
the whole thing just went down
the shitter. So once again,

124
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,550
but you know what it, you
know, I'm finally going to do,

125
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:41,180
I think I'm finally going to start
watching game of Thrones now that they're

126
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,320
fucking five, 10, 15 fucking
seasons into it. I've,

127
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,930
I've been trying to watch
it for the longest time,

128
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,530
but a nia has just not into it.
You know,

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,710
she has want to see a bunch of white
people running around chasing dragons.

130
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:58,700
It's just not what she's into. And,
uh, I'm not really into dragons either,

131
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:02,240
but like, if you're going to cut somebody
fucking head off, like, um, you know,

132
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,390
you got to do a lot to lose me
after that point, you know, I dunno.

133
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,130
Maybe. I Dunno who the
fuck knows. Maybe I,

134
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:13,790
I remember watching the first one and
there was some sort of spooky thing going

135
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,870
on and there was some little kid that
was supposed to watch a beheading and he

136
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,510
looked away and then it is,
I figured out what his dad did,

137
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,260
put them on the rack or
something. I don't remember. Um,

138
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,260
but then I don't, I don't know
what happened and that just kept,

139
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,640
it kept going and you know,
it was like a train that was coming right.

140
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,890
And you coulda ran and caught
it, but I, but you don't,

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,080
you just stand there and
you watch it disappear.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,790
And in that moment when that train
disappears and you realize you're late for

143
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,560
work in that fucking moment,

144
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:45,080
you question everything that
you're doing in your life.

145
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,520
Why didn't I run for that train?
Because I have this job that I don't like.

146
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,280
What am I doing in this relationship?
What happened to me?

147
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,710
What happened the last six
years in my fucking life? Right?

148
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,180
It's a critical moment there where you
have to beat all those thoughts down,

149
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,060
bury them, and go back to be
in the Zombie that you are.

150
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,990
Which brings me to the walking
dead. No, I'm kidding. Um,

151
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,750
anyways,
I want to thank everyone

152
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,190
who came out in Cheyenne,
Wyoming.

153
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,400
I kept doing a southern accent the
entire time I was out there and I was

154
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:21,540
addressing it, but, uh, I don't know what
Wyoming people sound like. I'm Cheyenne,

155
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,370
Wyoming and Denver,
Colorado.

156
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:27,320
I went out with a deed del Rey and uh,

157
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,530
we had the great fucking time played this,
um,

158
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,140
the Cheyenne civic center.
How cool does that sound?

159
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:38,760
Had all this amazing woodwork inside of
it that really looked like one of those

160
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:43,761
log cabins that either an oil man or a
fucking Hollywood starlet goes and buys.

161
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,470
You know,
like when people like it,

162
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,890
a huge amount of success
pretending to be other people.

163
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,230
At some point they have to get out of La.

164
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,180
And then they always end up
in like Wyoming or Montana.
It's fucking hilarious.

165
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,960
And they buy what looks like a log cabin,
sort of.

166
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,580
It looks like a log cabin and like a
fucking resort all at the same time,

167
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,560
you know? And then they go out there
and they buy, they're a designer.

168
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,830
I'm a fucking cattle rancher wardrobe.

169
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,590
And then they do the fucking interview,
right.

170
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,380
With their big stupid
cowboy hat on and older,

171
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:23,100
wiser is so and so steps back to uh,

172
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:28,020
evaluate the last six years of a
whirlwind, whatever the fuck it is. Right.

173
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,280
You know what I mean?

174
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,430
And then they pretend that they can
live this little fucking life out there

175
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,960
before they go nuts after three days and
they call up and chief five to pick him

176
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:39,990
up and take them right back, you know,
and they end up back down to the chateau,

177
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,330
the Chateau Mall, um,
doing blow in a bungalow.

178
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,140
That's what you do. You find it
a little bit of balance. Um, Oh,

179
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,650
speaking of fucking,
before I go back on that shit.

180
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,440
Speaking of fucking sick ass houses,
I was,

181
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,090
I went on this Paul Newman kick, you
know, he's my favorite of all time.

182
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,840
You know, a lot of people go Steve
McQueen. I like Steve Mcqueen,

183
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,280
but Paul Newman's my guy. He's
my fella. I just, I dunno,

184
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:12,510
once I look into those blue eyes, I just,
I melt to Thalia. Anything. I believe it.

185
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,610
Are you a pool shark? Are you
a lawyer? Do you play hockey?

186
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,580
Um, I watched, uh,

187
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,380
well I guess the first thing I watched, I
watched, uh, the man with the golden arm,

188
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,430
which d, which Delray was
telling me to watch, which was a,

189
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,440
a movie about a Frank Sinatra
playing a heroin addict who,

190
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:36,780
uh,
you know,

191
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,780
comes out of jail when it gets cleaned
and he plays the drums and he wants to

192
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:44,130
get a gig playing drums. And uh,
I watched a great fucking movie.

193
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,450
There's some brutal,
brutal overacting. Um,

194
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,070
you gotta I dunno, I would definitely
recommend seeing that. So I finished that.

195
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:54,880
You know,

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,230
it's like the next thing that was coming
up was somebody up there likes me,

197
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,930
which I'd always heard
of when I was growing up.

198
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,030
And then once I saw it was Paul
Newman, I was like, all right,

199
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:04,864
I'm going to watch it.

200
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,100
And it was him playing now rocky
Graziano the rocky Graziano story.

201
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,590
And um, and I literally forget what
I was talking. Oh, that's right.

202
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:18,550
That's right. So then it just got me
on this, this, this Paul Newman thing.

203
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,550
And you know what's funny is, uh, this,

204
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:26,551
this thing actually Steve McQueen is in
that movie for fucking two seconds and

205
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,250
it's right as Graziani was getting
out of some fucking, uh, you know,

206
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,990
juvenile detention home
that he fucking escapes.

207
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,470
So He's going around the
neighborhood, tapping all
these guys, all this tough guy,

208
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,710
friends on the shoulders to be like,
Hey, I'm back in the neighborhood.

209
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:44,050
And all of them turn around like,
who the fuck is this guy? Right?

210
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,490
Cause cause it Tufts street
kids, so fucking, uh,

211
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,950
fucking Steve McQueen is shooting pool.

212
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,940
They rocky taps him on the shoulder and
he fucking turns around with a knife out,

213
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,930
just two seconds. And then he
realizes it's reads like it's rocky.

214
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,850
He's like gay,
rocky.

215
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:07,851
And he does this stupid fucking thing
with his head that I don't know who

216
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,084
fucking,

217
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,980
there's certain things in movies that
the first guy who plays that guy does.

218
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,270
And then it's this weird fucking thing
where every other actor after it starts

219
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:22,840
fucking doing it. And you
know, nobody ever did it.

220
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,970
Who's actually the guy
that they're playing.

221
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,870
But then it's done enough and fucking
movies that the people who were actually a

222
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:32,170
guy, then they start fucking doing it.
And that's when it becomes a circle.

223
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,800
And you don't know who the fuck it is.
It's this fucking thing like a,

224
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,750
it's almost like, say you were
getting a manicure, right?

225
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:42,090
And you want it to dry off your nails
and you do just exactly a rocky and he's

226
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:46,170
doing this stupid fucking
thing with his hand. Um,

227
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,910
I dunno,

228
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,220
I'm going a really long way here to
tell you what I really want to tell you.

229
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:54,840
But like one of my favorite things is
to watch actors during that era playing

230
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:58,770
Tufts street kids. Um, like it's just,

231
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,940
it's fucking cringeworthy dead
fucking movie that Marlon Brando did.

232
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,330
He's on the motorcycle.
What the fuck was that one called?

233
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,350
It's not the wild bunch. That was a
cowboy movie. Rebel without a cart now.

234
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,610
And it's James Dean. I can't
remember, but just the,

235
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,260
the have to sit there and watch that shit.
Um,

236
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,900
how fucking brutal it is.
That west side story,

237
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,490
which I don't think I've ever seen.

238
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:26,820
I'm just going to throw that in
that cause I need three of them. Um,

239
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,390
I dunno. Whatever. So I
started watching that.

240
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,600
So then I finished that one and
then the next one that came on,

241
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,830
I can't even remember the name
of it. Fuck, hang on a second.

242
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:41,410
I got to IMD be fucking Paul Newman.
Um,

243
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,300
he just has the bluest eyes,
Paul Newman.

244
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,830
I am fucking be filmography.

245
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,700
So anyways, um, I think
it was called not Hudson.

246
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,770
The long story was this
next movie comes on, right?

247
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,800
And in the beginning he's driving in
this car and he's clearly in Los Angeles,

248
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:08,120
which was one of my favorite fucking
things ever to just see old footage,

249
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,940
black and white or color of La.

250
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:15,410
And he just get to see like you can
usually tell by the Hollywood hills and

251
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:20,060
sometimes the highways and shit
kind of where they are. And um,

252
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,070
you'll see like train tracks and shit
that they ripped up those fucking cunts or

253
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:29,930
you'll see, um, you know, you just see how
less populated is all right. Here it is.

254
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:32,720
Harper Harper is the movie the
very beginning of the movie.

255
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,420
He goes into a house and uh,

256
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,450
Lauren because in there Lauren Bacall
who married a Humphrey Bogart Bogie and

257
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:45,530
Bacall, one of the great couples
in Hollywood history and uh,

258
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,570
you know,
Humphrey Bogart,

259
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,720
somebody that Frank Sinatra's
stole a lot of his swagger from.

260
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,980
They were also the first rat pack
Humphrey Bogart and all his fucking crew.

261
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,060
And uh,
not only did a Sinatra steel,

262
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,400
a lot of Humphrey Bogart swagger,

263
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,650
he actually ended up fucking Lauren Bacall
later on after Humphrey Bogart died,

264
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:11,240
which is really fucked up. But
anyways, I digress. So at Harper,

265
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:15,410
he pulls into this fucking house
that I could not believe and uh,

266
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,910
I actually looked it up and it's
still exists. Look it up right now.

267
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:24,680
If you're at work, pretend that you're
doing, uh, that you're doing some sort of,

268
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm busy work.
It's,

269
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,010
it's on one zero one
one north Beverly drive,

270
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:34,280
10 11 Beverly drive.
And uh,

271
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,120
this fucking house, I think it's
just called the Beverly House,

272
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,500
it's in Beverly Hills,

273
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,970
probably has one of the sickest fucking
pools I've ever seen in my life.

274
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,770
It's like a three tiered thing.

275
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,950
The first two tiers I believe
are just considered a waterfall.

276
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,440
And first of all, it has like a half mile
driveway that he DKI comes up around.

277
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,140
And what's Hilarious,
which will,

278
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:00,770
it looks like the first year they had
the Porsche, which at this point by 1965,

279
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,620
when they shot,
it was just considered a piece of shit.

280
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,300
Who would know that years later,

281
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,450
some baby boomer would play
like fucking 900 grand for it.

282
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,170
So he's driving up one of, you know, it's
one of the fenders is like that fucking,

283
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,050
you know, what's that dead paint
that they primered and all that shit.

284
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,570
So he pulls up in this fucking house.
You got to see the backyard if it,

285
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,520
so actually I look the fucking thing up.

286
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,630
I found out where it was and the
next time I fly a helicopter,

287
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm gonna fucking fly over the house
and check it out. Um, it's actually, uh,

288
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,550
just a little bit north of
the Beverly Hills Hotel,

289
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,430
but you got to check this
fucking thing out. Um,

290
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,500
one of the great things about living in
Los Angeles, a lot of people, you know,

291
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,180
always shit on living in la,
but one of the main,

292
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,650
I think la arguably has some
of the most amazing homes,

293
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,240
um, in the country, just for the
simple fact that for whatever reason,

294
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:58,260
I don't know if it's the weather out here
or what, they haven't been torn down.

295
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,600
Um, so many of them, um, you know,
other places that I've been to,

296
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:08,430
but they have like craftsman houses out
here and then they have all the Spanish,

297
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:12,690
the Mediterranean style
ones. They have a, they got,

298
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,110
it's just incredible houses.
So you've got to check this one out.

299
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:20,130
This house is actually kind of
ugly, you know, when you pull up,

300
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,950
they shot the godfather, part
two there, but I part one there.

301
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:27,300
This is actually the house
where, uh, the horses head scene,

302
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,480
um,
spoiler alert if he,

303
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,880
if you're one of the two people
I've never seen that fucking movie.

304
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:37,881
They shot that scene in there and JFK and
his wife Jackie had their honeymoon in

305
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,950
this fucking house and I just saw it
recently. The last time it's sold.

306
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:46,950
It's sold for $135 million.

307
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,660
And all I'm doing looking at it after
by in my old ass house that was made in

308
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,680
1923,

309
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:00,681
all I see is fucking 50,000 square foot
of galvanized pipe and cloth wiring that

310
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,500
they're going to have to somehow
fucking redo where we'll sections of it.

311
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,930
You know,
there's a little bit of copper pipe here,

312
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:10,890
a little bit of wiring that
was done correctly. Um,

313
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,331
but anyways,

314
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,930
that's another cool thing about these
fucking houses out there is that they've

315
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,931
been around so long and if they're
in a desirable area in Hollywood,

316
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,040
like the stories of like the people
that live there, like how cool. I mean,

317
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,980
that's $135 million house,
obviously be a fucking amazing house.

318
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,470
But how fucking amazing it would
be to have that house and be like,

319
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,020
you didn't see a movie and you watch him,

320
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:38,550
Paul Newman walking across your fucking
terrorists that you now want to.

321
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:42,780
I don't know. I think that Shit's
cool as hell. But um, you know,

322
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,520
while you're at it,
you can check out a lot of those.

323
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:48,580
And also just look up
famous Hollywood homes. Um,

324
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,960
I told you there's a house about,

325
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,160
not even like,
I dunno,

326
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:01,030
maybe a 15 minute drive away
from me in, in, in Los Angeles.

327
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,350
15 minutes is a big fucking
deal. Sometimes just, you know,

328
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,590
15 blocks,
it can go one way or another.

329
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,550
It can literally go like to,
I'm going to get stabbed to,

330
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,410
how to fuck can you
ever afford to live in?

331
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,780
How many people did you steal
from to get this fucking,

332
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,200
this guy's got a moat around his
house. Lets, lets the way La is,

333
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:21,670
it's like really like patchwork.

334
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,110
So like a 15 minute drive
away from where I live. Um,

335
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,050
my neighbor told me there's a
house that went up for sale.

336
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,110
I think I told this story before and um,

337
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,840
it's an old ass house. It's pre
prohibition and basically, uh,

338
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:42,280
when prohibition came around this,
this house had a pool and then it had a,

339
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,700
a Cabana and in the Cabana at this guy,

340
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,760
he built a bar during prohibition and he
had illegal booze or I don't know if he

341
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,950
was making beer in the bathtub, whatever
the fuck he was doing. But he used to,

342
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,310
he used to have all these famous people
come over there and they would just

343
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:59,740
booze it up. And um, he,

344
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,800
anybody who came over there
and drank that was famous,

345
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,370
he would have them carve their
names into the bar. And, uh,

346
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,420
evidently according to my neighbor
who went and looked at the house,

347
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,850
even though we couldn't afford it,
he just wanted to see the bar.

348
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,150
He went and looked at it. And it's one
of those things, if you buy the house,

349
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,170
it's that bars obviously protected
by the historical society,

350
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,023
some shit.

351
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,230
But you go in there and everyone from
like Louis Armstrong to like fucking

352
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:30,430
Humphrey Bogart have to have carved their
names into that fucking bar. So, um,

353
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,680
whatever, that's some sort of nerdy
Los Angeles. How shit. But um,

354
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,370
yeah, definitely. Uh,
rather than work today,

355
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,540
just go on Google earth and just look
at some of those fucking houses. Um,

356
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,070
or just Google, like famous Hollywood
homes through this homes where like,

357
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,290
you know, when I was watching that, you
know, somebody up there likes me, uh,

358
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,420
or I should really know the
name of the fucking actress,

359
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,960
the one who plays Paul
Newman's love interest,

360
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,650
obviously is an absolute,
uh,

361
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,130
fucking knockout.
And I had never heard of her.

362
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,880
So the fact that I never heard
of her, I'm like, ah, fuck, I,

363
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,160
I've looked up enough of those,
those old movies,

364
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:16,680
like I got this creepy thing that I always
look people up. Like an older person.

365
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,020
Like, all right, that person is definitely
dead. Let's see how long they lived for.

366
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,854
Right.

367
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,500
Or you try to find a cast
where like everybody's dead,

368
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,350
you know, which is a very
difficult thing to, to, so anyways,

369
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,710
so I started looking up, you know, the
people that were, you know, this woman,

370
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,750
I hope I say her name right, it's
p, I. E. R is it Pierre? Pete Pier,

371
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,110
I dunno. And Jelly. I have no idea.

372
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,540
I looked her up and I was
immediately going like,

373
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,520
she probably died a pills
cause back then like, I dunno,

374
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,560
like getting given people pills.

375
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,670
Like it seems back then every guy either
died of a heart attack in his fifties

376
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,090
and sixties or he died of cancer
and like 90% of the women died of an

377
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:05,530
accidental, like barbiturate overdose.
Because back then, like, you know,

378
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,980
if a woman came in and she had
some emotional issues, you know,

379
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:10,420
the doctors are like,
for God's sakes,

380
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,480
get all the ESL and they would just
give her some pills to relax her.

381
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,440
It was like in that movie airplane where
they will just slap on you and giving

382
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,960
you a backhand and shit. So, um,

383
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,810
she was as gorgeous, amazing actress.
And then of course I looked it up and um,

384
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,120
you know, she died accidentally.
Um, some people say suicide,

385
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,210
some people say accidentally
at 39 years of age.

386
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,340
And then I look it up and sure enough,

387
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:39,490
the place where she fucking
overdosed is still there.

388
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,310
That's another one of those things.
It's a really fucking, you know,

389
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:46,070
and see the cool

390
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,650
or creepy, all these fucking
houses that people died in.

391
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,970
There's another actor in there.
This guy's Sal Mineo or whatever.

392
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,230
Um, I swear to God, who's a
dead ringer for Ralph Machio.

393
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,100
He's in it. And uh, he ended up,

394
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:04,910
he got fucking stabbed to death in like
the mid Seventies. It's fucking unreal,

395
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:09,200
man. Like a lot of people, a lot of stars
back in the day they dated and make it,

396
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,060
they didn't fucking write it out.

397
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,700
It seemed like just crazy
shit app and tool and die.

398
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,760
Guess what I'm saying is that a lot of
these houses still exist and if you're

399
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:21,570
sort of, um, I guess I'm becoming
morbid in my older age is I realize,

400
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:25,520
you know, you know what I
mean? Your, your mortality,

401
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:28,760
you start looking how long this parts to
live, how do they live? How did they die?

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,960
Fuck. Is that going to happen to me?
Get all that type of ship. I Dunno.

403
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,240
All right, let's, let's read it.

404
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,250
Let's read a little fucking
advertising here for the week. Oh, Jj,

Their MVMT watches movement
watches this company,

407
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:51,880
Ladies and gentlemen, was started
by two college dropouts, uh,

408
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,460

really expensive watch unless they sell

414
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:16,670
watches or they come over and they touch
it and they realize it's a lot lighter.

right way. Sorry with the fresh shit,

426
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,330
a blade shave.

427
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,310
That's why me and millions of others
have joined the dollar Shave Club have

428
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:14,840
joined dollar shave club.com. You don't
realize about me reading out loud.

429
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,870
My fucking mouth is like I've sentence
and a half with my fucking eyes are slow

430
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:21,561
it down.

431
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:26,561
Bill Dollar Shave Club knows the key
to getting an amazing shave is simple.

432
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,830
One,

433
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,830
use a fresh dollar shave called blade
to use their Dr Covey's easy shea

434
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,103
bye.

435
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,030
That's it.
Dot.

436
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:40,930
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing razors
right to my door for a third of the

437
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:44,460
price of those greedy
mega razor corporations.

438
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,080
That means listeners who switched now
can afford the luxury of shaving with a

439
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:54,081
fresh blade anytime and save hundreds
this year and when you combine the fresh

440
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,990
blade with their doctor cabbies,
easy shave butter.

441
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,640
It just glides.
It's unimaginably smooth and telling you.

442
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,470
If you're not, it's not your average
shave foam. It won't dry out your skin.

443
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,140
The all natural ingredients.
Leave your skin feeling soft,

444
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:14,430
smooth and moisturized after
every shaved shapes. Sorry,

445
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,080
take it from me. I'll take it
from somebody else or whatever.

446
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,030
Don't take it.
Do whatever the fuck you want to do.

447
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,750
Use a fresh dollar shave club blade
with donkey caddies. Easy shape bladder.

448
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,880
If you wanted the most gentle
shave imaginable, dollar
shave club.com/bird today,

449
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,540
that's dollar shave club.com/burr.
Um,

450
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,370
oh by the way, I'm doing my first
solo flight through a bravo airspace.

451
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:45,690
So if you're still on the map,
if you're still on the Google Earth math,

452
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,870
I love looking at this shit,
right? And you go onto a,

453
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,100
you go on to, um, what do you do when
you click it on the fucking globe?

454
00:27:56,101 --> 00:28:00,390
They're all right.
Now go over to the ocean.

455
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,100
Okay, follow Santa Monica
Boulevard over to the ocean.

456
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,570
All right,
right where it says the 10.

457
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,730
Now go down a little bit and you'll see
something that kind of looks like a tree,

458
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,630
but it's made out of water.
That's Marina del Rey. All right?

459
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:22,230
Now if you're flying south,
that's where Bravo airspace begins.

460
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,660
Along the coastline.
And when you're there,

461
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:29,661
you have to be at a 150 feet or
below at or below one 50 and then you

462
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:34,560
transitioned the bravo airspace.
If you go a little bit further south,

463
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,620
you'll see lax.
All right?

464
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,610
And that's to the south of it is two,
five,

465
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:45,870
right into five left and to the
north there's two five, right?

466
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:49,560
Two five left, those two runways. And
those were the big boys are taken off.

467
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,620
So you fly underneath those guys
or ladies and you stay at or below,

468
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,800
um, 150 feet until you get to,
and then you got to zoom in,

469
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,080
uh, the Manhattan Beach Pier and, uh,

470
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,600
which is almost a beam as they say,

471
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,680
the a comedy and magic club
down on her most of beach.

472
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,080
Um, so you want to be, you
want to be right down there,

473
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,670
150 fucking God damn feet.
Um, oh wait a minute.

474
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,260
Wouldn't that be Hermosa?
Yeah. And I'm sorry,

475
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:29,670
Hermosa Beach Pier is where the comedy
clubs that, but the Manhattan Beach Pier,

476
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,500
that's where you want to be. You guys
from, from there to Marina del Ray,

477
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,280
you got to be at or below 150 feet.

478
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:38,430
So if you come out here and
you're on the beach as a tourist,

479
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:42,030
you see these helicopters
flying by really low. Uh,

480
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,940
they're not buzzing the beach looking
at your or whatever they are. Uh,

481
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,740
they are transitioning the bravo airspace.
So I'm going to be doing that.

482
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,010
Um,
I don't know on what day,

483
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:58,890
but that's my big goal this week with the
helicopter thing there. Um, but anyways,

484
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,620
let's get back to the, uh, skip
back to the podcast here. Um,

485
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,960
where is it? What else did I want to talk
about? Oh, how about those Boston Bruins.

486
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:12,130
And I know we lost, I know
we lost to a, the Redwings.

487
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,000
I didn't get to see the, uh, the game
yet. I have a taped, I'm a game behind.

488
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,380
I watched, um, I'm actually
gaming two thirds behind.

489
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,540
I watched the first quarter of a,

490
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,540
of us beating the wild and Brad Marshawn
scored again his 12th goal and 12

491
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,110
games.

492
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,940
And I actually looked up the ticker and
I saw that he scored his 13th fucking

493
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:38,810
goal. And, uh, in 13 games,
the guy's on fire. And, uh,

494
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,300
I saw his goal in the, um,
the Minnesota wild game.

495
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,400
Um, a shorthanded goal, just
a beautiful pass. And, uh,

496
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,270
I don't know. It's fucking awesome.
And he's going to have like guys,

497
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,710
he's on his way. He's gonna have
like 40 goals is fucking year. Um,

498
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,120
and I gotta say just the Bruins and
the Celtics this year. Both of them.

499
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:01,210
I was just going to be like, this is,
you know, after all the moves they made,

500
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,430
you know,

501
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,460
I just kind of felt that neither one was
going to be that competitive and it was

502
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:10,510
going to be tough to watch
him this year. And uh, I am,

503
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,270
I think they're both over achieve
and it's been fun to watch him,

504
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,540
although for some reason my fucking
recorder stopped taping the Celtics Games.

505
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:21,280
I was really getting into it
watching Isaiah Thomas and, um,

506
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,440
Crowder,
a Jae Crowder and uh,

507
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,090
it was the jam band guy and I
finally learned his fucking name.

508
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,430
They're a Kelly Olynyk.
Right.

509
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,380
I was enjoying watching it and our young
coach there who I still don't know his

510
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:38,080
fucking name cause I always take the
games and they talked to them and I just

511
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,930
fast forward through all of that shit.
And then they just show him,

512
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,110
I think his name's Stan. Steven.
Something with an s Sean. I Dunno.

513
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,730
It looks like a baby man.

514
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,550
The guy's like fucking 15 years younger
than me and he's coaching the Celtics.

515
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:55,150
He's doing a great job. And evidently we
got a couple of number one draft picks.

516
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:59,380
We're in a great fucking position.
Um,

517
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:01,150
I missed the all star weekend stuff.

518
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:05,500
I saw some of the dunking
stuff and Kevin Hart,

519
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:09,190
did anybody see Kevin Hardy? I, he
went up against some other NBA guy.

520
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,890
I can tell,
I know watched fucking NBA.

521
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:16,891
He went up against a
professional basketball player
and a three point contest.

522
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,050
Um, should I give you a spoiler
alert or should I do that?

523
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:27,051
The clickbait and the results will
surprise you and it gives a fuck.

524
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,420
He actually beat the guy.
And what I loved about it,

525
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,020
besides being a big fan of his stuff
and everything was when he went to start

526
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:38,860
shooting is three pointers.

527
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,950
They were playing disrespectful music
underneath them. They were playing this,

528
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,700
I'm always in this like,
oh, it's adorable. Or is it,

529
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,970
it's silly that this little man is going
to come out here and try and beat one

530
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:53,240
of our professional athletes and uh,

531
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,170
okay.

532
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,760
They were right through the first two
racks and then he fucking close strong.

533
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,640
And I think he might have beat them
on the last ball. You got to see it.

534
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,070
I mean it's, uh, it's pretty fucking
impressive. If I remember correctly,

535
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:10,580
in long time ago, he was telling me that
before he was a comedian, he went to a,

536
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,400
uh,
you know,

537
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,370
he went to a basketball camp that had
our young unknown Colby Bryant and that

538
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:20,270
type of shit. So, um,
but still math, you know,

539
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,790
it was a long fucking time ago.
Since then,

540
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,800
he's gone all the way to selling out the
eagles football stadium doing standup

541
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,790
comedy. You'd think that his basketball
game would drop off a little bit,

542
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:34,070
that maybe he'd be a
little rusty at the y.

543
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:38,570
Forget about being able to beat a fucking
NBA player and a three point contest.

544
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:42,830
It was pretty, uh, pretty
God. Damn impressive. Um,
so anyways, let me get back.

545
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:44,710
Jesus Christ.
Why Omi?

546
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,060
Cheyenne Wyoming. So I go there and, um,

547
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,810
okay,

548
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,660
you know, this was the last of
the, the 50 that I had to do.

549
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,200
So of course I'm reading all up on
Wyoming and all that type of stuff.

550
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,230
And I see that Yellowstone
park is right in the north

551
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,590
northwest corner of it.
And I'm like, Oh fuck,

552
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:06,530
I got to go up there and go do a gig
in the middle of nowhere at some point.

553
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,610
And uh, maybe I'll do a nice run through
Montana, Idaho and all that shit.

554
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:14,640
The DAKOTAS, um, you know,

555
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,120
I get into all that fucking nerdy
shit, right? So we do the Gig,

556
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,850
we have a great time. It take some
pictures with some people afterwards.

557
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,500
And when I was on stage I was saying,
hey,

558
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:26,340
where should we go tonight if I want
to go out and have a pot? Right.

559
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,190
Okay.

560
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,820
So of course everybody's yelling out
everything at the same time and I can't

561
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:35,050
hear anything. So I'm like
one at a time, one at a time.

562
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:38,920
And then just in the back,
this guy yells out the gray door,

563
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,960
said to go to the green door. And then
the whole crowd just goes, ah, like,

564
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:46,690
you know, don't go there.
And I was like, I was like,

565
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,190
I don't even need you guys to say that.

566
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:51,460
The green door just sounds like some
creepy serial killer place. So I go,

567
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:54,330
I'm not fucking going there.
So then somebody said by,

568
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,100
forget the fuck it was called
the Cadillac lounge or something.

569
00:34:57,101 --> 00:34:59,970
I took a picture of it. So, um,

570
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,720
I,
uh,

571
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,790
I decide, you know, all right,
that's where the fuck we'll go.

572
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,730
We'll go over to this thing. I'm actually
looking at the picture right now on my,

573
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:11,740
uh,
on my phone here.

574
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,440
Okay,

575
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,880
come on. Come on. Where is
it? Where is it? There it is.

576
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,580
The Cadillac Cadillac ranch. Sorry.

577
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,320
So we go in there, you know, there's a
big American flag lit up on the side.

578
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm like, all right, here we go.

579
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:31,890
Let's fucking go in there and
see what this place is about.

580
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,840
And we went in there and I gotta tell you,
man,

581
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:38,841
it was the most diverse group of
people I've ever seen in my life.

582
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,180
And I think for the simple fact,
there was no other place to go.

583
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,620
So there was like a group of bikers,
there was,

584
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,280
there was soldiers,
um,

585
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,900
there was like ranchers,
there was a group of lesbians,

586
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,250
and then there was just filler people
that you couldn't really tell what the

587
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:03,120
fuck they were. They was older, younger,
the whole fucking thing. So we're in,

588
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:07,740
they're like, wow man, this is fucking,
this is nuts. And then it had a real,

589
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,690
like cowboy can of feel to it.

590
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,470
Yet there was like a fucking Dj play
in like modern music. It was this,

591
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,881
it was fucked.

592
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,740
So we're in there and dean for whatever
fucking reason is just pointing at Shit.

593
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:22,600
And people go and look at that fucking
guy, look at this shit, look at it.

594
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,800
It's fucking bar. And I'm sitting there
going, Dean, stop pointing. It's shit.

595
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,370
Stop Pointing Shit. You know, Dean's
been sober for like 20 fucking years,

596
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:33,480
so he's got no excuse. He just
kept but pointed shit. Um,

597
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,090
and then finally, you
know, I had a, you know,

598
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,380
I was talking to a couple of the people
in there talking to this guy that was in

599
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,480
the middle of taking a
two year welding class,

600
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:46,080
which of course was really interesting
to me. I was talking to about that shit.

601
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,920
I was talking to some other people in,
uh, then at one point somebody said, hey,

602
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:54,150
you want to a whiskey? So
like, um, my thing now when
I go on the road and I drink,

603
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,590
I have a beer and uh,

604
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,220
in a whiskey or a scotch
and then that's it.

605
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:02,400
I call it a fucking night and it's
been working out great for me,

606
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:03,930
you know what I mean?
So I have a nice little taste,

607
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,720
but then I don't get hammered and then
I'm fine the next morning and I can work

608
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:11,280
out and shit. Right. So, uh,
this guy offers, you know,
it comes over, hey, you know,

609
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:13,560
I got to buy a drink. I said, well, I'm
just getting a beer. And I said, well,

610
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:15,870
all right, well, you know, I was
going to get a whiskey too. He goes,

611
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,880
what do you want? He goes, we've
got a local fucking Wyoming whiskey.

612
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:25,110
I was like, all right, when is
shy? Let's fucking do it. Right?

613
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,460
So he gets me this fucking shot and
he brings it over and it looked,

614
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,050
it was almost like seethrough.

615
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,370
Now I don't know if if they
did whiskey and water or what,

616
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,130
but I fucking took a sip of it
and it had no bite or anything.

617
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,800
I was just looking, I'm like, dude, what
the fuck is this? He goes, he goes, well,

618
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,040
it hasn't been aged at all.
I've got to tell you, dude,

619
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:47,970
it was the worst whiskey I've ever had
in my apology to the person who bought me

620
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:51,360
the shot. I couldn't finish
it. I looked, I said, Dina,

621
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:53,160
go look at this fucking thing.
And he was just like, yeah, dude,

622
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,860
that looks like piss. So, um,

623
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,440
and then at that point I wasn't looking,

624
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,340
but dean was saying that the biker
people were mean mugging everybody and he

625
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:06,990
goes to, let's get the fuck out of here.
So we get out of there and, uh, oh,

626
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:09,960
as we were driving over there,
I noticed that there was a drive,

627
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,470
there was a liquor store with a
drive through. So I was like, Oh God,

628
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:18,270
I gotta get a picture of that. So I
get pulled over, I get a picture of it.

629
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,370
And then I'm just like,
dude, I got to do it.

630
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,990
I got to go to a drive through liquor
store. So I fucking pull up. We actually,

631
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:29,520
I posted video of this and I just wanted
to get one beer and the guy goes, well,

632
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:33,960
I can give you like the 24 ounce.
So I got like a Budweiser, um,

633
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,680
I'll repost the video, the, uh,
the, the Monday morning podcast,

634
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:41,620
Twitter page. So I went up,
I ordered a fucking beer.

635
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,740
And what was really cool is that had the
old fucking remember the old air hoses

636
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,730
when you would pull up at
the, the, uh, the gas station
and it would ring the bell,

637
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:53,650
like, Dang, Dang, as your, as your car
pulled in. It was so fucking cool. And,

638
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:54,484
um,

639
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,140
we was sitting there and then this dude
just sort of walked into the place or

640
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:03,520
whatever. And as we drive out,
there's an Arby's across the street,

641
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:08,350
which I never fucking eat, you
know, fucking fast food roasts,

642
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:11,170
roast beef. I mean, I like to
think I'm a courageous person,

643
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:14,620
but that's just a little, that's, that
gets a little too shady for me. Right.

644
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,180
I'd rather eat the pink
slime. Um, so anyways, uh,

645
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,670
del Ray's going like came in and it
goes, let's hit the Arby's. I'm hungry.

646
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:26,160
So I go, all right, so we
go into the Arby's, right?

647
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,860
He owed us some shit and then I
ordered like some chicken sliders,

648
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:32,290
which I shouldn't have fucking got.
They were fucking disgusting.

649
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,330
It was like eating the, he'll have some
chicks fucking boot boot, you know,

650
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,050
just the way they were shaped like
clogs, they would just fucking gross. So,

651
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,620
um, we go around to the drive through
and this is right across from the drive

652
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:46,454
through liquor store.

653
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,940
And I look across the street and I
read the sign and what does it say?

654
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,860
It says the green door.

655
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:58,290
So the drive through liquor store is part
of this shady fucking teddy bar called

656
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,880
the green door.

657
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,190
That urban legend said that there was a
one legged stripper and now the younger

658
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:08,740
me would have been like,
I got to go in and go see that shit.

659
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:11,230
The older me goes like, oh my
God, that's somebody's daughter.

660
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,240
So I'm so technically I kind of
did go to the green door. I didn't,

661
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,810
I didn't go in there. I just fucking
pulled up or whatever. So I'll, I'll,

662
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:22,840
I'll post some pictures of that shit. Um,
let me see if I actually took them. So,

663
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,510
and then the next day we got up right.

664
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:30,180
And we want it to go to some
local place to get a, uh,

665
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,600
to get breakfast.

666
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,680
And we went to this local place and I
don't know if the regular chef was out of

667
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,514
town,

668
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,590
but I ordered eggs over easy
and I cut into them. Dude,

669
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,770
they were so under cooked.
Like it came out clear,

670
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,320
like the white part of the egg
was still clear. Like, you know,

671
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:51,820
when those people drink like egg
whites, it was like that. And so deans,

672
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:56,290
eggs were the same way. And a,
I just never sent food back.

673
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:58,540
So I just started them in
with the fucking Hash. I mean,

674
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,900
they should have just served the eggs
and a glass like fucking rocky Balboa and

675
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:04,810
I just suck it down.
And I noticed a woman diagonally from me,

676
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,580
she sent her eggs back to, and
then in the end when I went to, uh,

677
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,490
I went to pay, she was just like, how was
it? And then when I said it was great,

678
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,210
I kind of stumbled on when it was
great. It was great. And then she goes,

679
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:21,040
and then she immediately looked
up, she goes, is everything okay?

680
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:24,370
Is Everything okay?
So I've just guessing that the,

681
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,290
the normal chef was out of town, so I'm
not going to out this place is being a,

682
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,890
uh, as being something bad. But, uh,

683
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,970
it was pretty rough. It was one of the
worst breakfast as I've ever had. But, uh,

684
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,930
when we, when we came back
down, we'd drive down to Denver.

685
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,540
I lived for like a little kid right now.
Like,

686
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,480
I'm just telling you every moment
of this fucking, this tour,

687
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,010
but a dean's a big motorcycle guy.
It's been Ryan for 30 years.

688
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:55,660
So they had this huge fucking Harley
Davidson dealership right on the 25 as we

689
00:41:55,661 --> 00:41:58,240
would come down.
So we stopped in and I didn't know,

690
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:01,300
but Harley has a new bike that's
just right out of my childhood.

691
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:05,740
It's called the 72.
And it's got the big spoked front wheel.

692
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,910
It's got the handle bars, it's like
fucking Arthur Fonzie rallies bike,

693
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:14,380
which obviously was fucking, uh, from
the, the, you know, the 50s or whatever.

694
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:18,940
But um, I haven't written in
like a year and a half and,

695
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:22,240
uh, I dunno man. I think
I got to ride that bike.

696
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,440
I think I'm going to rent it just one day.
There's a park up around where I'm at.

697
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,620
I've co Brent it on like a Sunday and
just go up there in the morning time and

698
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,210
just fucking ride around
and bring it back on.

699
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:34,320
Too much of a pussy to ride all
the time because uh, you know,

700
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,260
I got too much to fucking lose and um,

701
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,500
oh my God,
they had one in,

702
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,910
in this black and gold
metal flake was fucking,

703
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,670
it's just perfect man.
As much as I love the road king,

704
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,560
like every one to be motorcycle rider
who watched a couple episodes of, uh,

705
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,510
whatever that fucking show was,

706
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:57,780
what was that fucking show there that
everybody watched about? About the bikes?

707
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,480
Um,
you know,

708
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,470
like every fucking want to be bad ass
who doesn't have a tattoo and it's not a

709
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:05,310
motorcycle guy.

710
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,140
Like Delray took a picture of me on
the fucking 70 to 72 and I just started

711
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:14,220
laughing. I was like, how much, how
much am I not a motorcycle guy? Like,

712
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:18,960
do you realize if what a fucking nerd
you have to look like to sit on a Harley

713
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:22,110
and still look like a fucking still
look like somebody you could pulley?

714
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:31,190
I look like every fucking just
white dude having a midlife crisis.

715
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,040
They're like, you know who watched
it? What is that fucking show?

716
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,330
What is the fucking show that was all
about the motorcycles that everybody

717
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:44,000
watched. I never got
into it. Um, goddammit,

718
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,020
it's the perfect reference for
this shit. But um, anyways,

719
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:53,820
I might have to rent one coming up, uh,
my go ride a dirt bike and get my fucking,

720
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,770
my skills back up to the ridiculously
low level that they were.

721
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:02,820
I just go to a local park out here and
I just drive this loop around and around

722
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:04,780
and around.
It's actually good because a,

723
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,080
there's a lot of downshift and
then that shit a lot of turns.

724
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,360
You got to look your way through all
this shit that I learned in the safety

725
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:11,550
course and everything.
But like I told you guys,

726
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:15,240
so one time when I rode a motorcycle
down sunset all the way out to the beach,

727
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:18,060
just like, I want it to just thinking
this is going to feel, you know,

728
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:21,300
freedom man America. Right. And I
was going to see all this shit, dude,

729
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,990
I didn't see shit.
I was fucking terrified.

730
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,840
There was just too many fucking
people. And um, you know,

731
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:33,150
we went later than I wanted to go. I
rode with Dean and dean. Yeah. You know,

732
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,000
I had done spots so he
didn't get up til like 10,

733
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:36,500
so we didn't get on the road till like 11.

734
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,250
And I want it to go at like seven in the
fucking morning when there was nobody

735
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:44,600
on the road and really just be able to
relax a little bit and not have somebody

736
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,730
right behind me.
Uh,

737
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,930
and I just remember getting off the bike
and I was like shaking and I was just

738
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:54,800
like, I had to have that fucking get
out of your ego moment and just be like,

739
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:58,460
Bill, this isn't you. You
don't have this in your blood.

740
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:03,230
You're not a motorcycle fucking guy.
He just not, so don't be that shithead.

741
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,610
And, uh, I immediately sold the bike
or get rid of it, whatever the fuck.

742
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:12,440
I don't even remember. But, um, I dunno.
I think every once in a while, if,

743
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:14,270
you know,
I smoke a couple cigars a month,

744
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:17,600
I got that under control for every once
in a while I run a motorcycle and I know

745
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:19,890
everybody's going to fucking
be like, Oh, who jokes reward,

746
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,370
you're a Jewish cause you're going
to be focusing rusty. I right.

747
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,070
Taking all the fun out of
everything. Um, all right.

748
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,530
Oh also, uh, this week, uh,

749
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,640
I got back into like drinking juices and
shit and there was this fucking algae

750
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,950
shit,
which was disgusting when I drank it.

751
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:42,590
But I felt amazing afterwards
and I'm trying to, uh,

752
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,190
you know, like Dean said, you know,
it's a good addiction to have.

753
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,790
Like you get addicted to shit.
I realized that.

754
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,190
And if you're addicted to
like working out good stuff,

755
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:56,660
that's obviously a much
better thing for you.

756
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,400
So I might try to get back into
that type of stuff. But anyways, um,

757
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,350
this, uh, this past weekend, on
Saturday night when I got back,

758
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,980
I went to a,
uh,

759
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,140
this music music cares event. And, um,

760
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,890
every year they honor somebody and whoever
they're honoring, everybody comes out.

761
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,250
And I'm just does this person's
music. So say they wandering, ACDC,

762
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,260
a bunch of famous fucking musicians that
are into ACDC would come out and do all

763
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:32,060
their songs and switch them up
and do different versions of them.

764
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:36,800
So it was Lionel Richie,
right? Oh, word. A feeling,

765
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,580
right.
So I go to this fucking thing and uh,

766
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,840
it was unreal.
It was like Lenny Kravis usher,

767
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:49,290
who I couldn't believe how small
he was. He fucking crushed it. Um,

768
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:53,810
John Legend, Stevie wonder. All right,

769
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,850
all these monsters.
And then Stevie wonder,

770
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,180
and I knew Dave Grohl was
going to go on and I'm like,

771
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:02,510
kind of fuck is Dave Grohl gonna follow
it? Is he going to play drums and saying,

772
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:05,810
is he going to do the,
come out with his blue guitar and sing?

773
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,290
And he just went up and just sang a song.
That was it.

774
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,150
He told his fucking story about,
you know,

775
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:14,990
when he broke his leg or very fell
off the stage where he broke his leg.

776
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,850
He was talking about all the
outpouring from the fans and all that.

777
00:47:18,851 --> 00:47:23,170
And then one day he just got this
giant fucking basket of muffins,

778
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,950
the biggest basket, I guess
ever. This fucking giant thing.

779
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,670
And there was no note or anything on,
and he's,

780
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:34,360
he's telling this story that the
band sorta just playing, you know,

781
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,740
some music underneath it and he's telling
this story. He's got people laughing,

782
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:41,410
but they're listening and all that shit.
And then like two days later,

783
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,360
I guess he got a, he got a, a,

784
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:47,920
a call from his manager
who said, yeah, uh,

785
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:48,940
Lionel Richie,

786
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,980
Lionel Richie just called up to see
if you got the fucking giant basket of

787
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:57,700
muffins. And then he just
goes, uh, so I just, you know,

788
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:01,840
I forget how we fucking ended the story.
I'm butchering it now,

789
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,140
right as the ends the store and you
realize that it was Lionel Richie,

790
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,570
they kick into that his song.

791
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:11,150
You are Dave Grohl just crushed it in the,

792
00:48:11,151 --> 00:48:14,290
let's argue are there's
something in you are the rain.

793
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,170
And he just was up there singing it.
Fucking crushed.

794
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:21,070
It went on after Stevie
wonder and crushed it.

795
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,520
Um, so I, I got to, I got to do that.
You know, it was funny. It was, uh,

796
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,200
I, I went down there and, um,
you know, I'm not a suit guy,

797
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:36,560
but you had to wear like a shirt and tie
dude. And I swear to God, like, I dunno,

798
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,750
just like me when I was on the motorcycle
when I had on that suit and tie, dude,

799
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,750
I don't know what it was. Sometimes
I look all right, but, uh,

800
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,020
the thing about suits is if you,
if you, you got to buy them,

801
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,970
like they go on a style really quick, and
this one was like three, four years old.

802
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,180
I just gotten a dry clean to some
show the last time I wore it.

803
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:59,140
And I put this fucking thing on. And,
uh, I was talking to Neil, I was like,

804
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:01,780
and I just kept going. I look
like an asshole right there.
And like, she's like, no,

805
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:04,990
you look fine again. Yeah, I don't
think so. I looked like an asshole.

806
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:09,010
So the whole fucking night, um, you know,

807
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:13,010
anytime I would walk into the bathroom,
you know, it was a long fucking night,

808
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,970
was like a four hour fucking
thing, you know? And, uh,

809
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,550
anytime I would go in there and I would
wash my hands and I would just sit there

810
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:21,010
and I would look at myself in the mirror.
I just kept laughing.

811
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:26,710
What a fucking jerk off I look like a,
I know it wasn't a good scene, you know,

812
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,070
I don't like hate myself.
It's not good place for me to be

813
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,940
like say I think it's time
to retire that suit. Um,

814
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,980
all right, let's get into some of the, uh,

815
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:43,810
some of the fucking questions
here for the week. Um, uh,

816
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:45,760
here we go.
A judge Scalia,

817
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,820
bill listener from Virginia here,

818
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:54,270
the death of Judge Scalia brought out
some jokes on social media and a lot of

819
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:58,000
people took the angle that they
were happy that he died. Now I'm a,

820
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:01,380
I'm assuming this is somebody
on the supreme court because
I don't pay attention

821
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:01,720
to shit,

822
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,860
but I did see some stuff about this is
the first time the supreme court won't be

823
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:07,480
conservative.
He goes,

824
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:11,350
what's your position on making
jokes about being happy people died.

825
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,920
Thanks for, for, for that.

826
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:19,150
Laughs and give me thank you.
Thanks for the laughs. Um,

827
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:25,600
my position on making joke about,
well yeah,

828
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,920
I think he got a be,
uh,

829
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,840
I think you gotta be like a dictator
for people to do shit like that. Yeah.

830
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:37,640
I mean, I wouldn't say don't do
it because there's always a joke.

831
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,150
I mean, someday when I die, there's
going to be a joke. I mean, I know,

832
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,330
and if I'm hovering around is a ghost,
I'm going to laugh about it.

833
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:48,250
What the fuck do I care? I'm a ghost at
that point, right. I didn't go to hell.

834
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,950
All right. I'm floating around. I
could deal with this. Uh, but yeah,

835
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:56,240
I don't do that. Um, well look,

836
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,100
if you just make a joke joke,
that's fine,

837
00:50:58,101 --> 00:51:02,810
but if you're doing it because you didn't
share like their political views, uh,

838
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:03,540
yeah,
I'm not into

839
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,330
doing that type of shit. Like,
you know, some, some Shithead,

840
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,610
I'm going to start doing this.
Like the shit had tweeted the week.

841
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,680
Somebody sent me a text today telling me
that I needed to distance myself. Bill,

842
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:17,040
just to let you know, you need to
distance yourself from so and so.

843
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,020
Um,

844
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:24,020
and then sent me a link and this is
somebody that had been friends with for 20

845
00:51:24,241 --> 00:51:24,991
fucking years.

846
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:29,991
And then I see this link and it has to
do with being a vegetarian or eating meat

847
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:36,450
and the name of the video is
so and so is an ignorant moron,

848
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,720
which right there I love,
like that's your angle,

849
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,680
like to get someone to listen
to your opinion right there.

850
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:45,060
I just look at it like this is just,

851
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,880
this is just somebody trying
to make a name for themselves,

852
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:52,740
trashing somebody that, that has
made a name for themselves, you know,

853
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:56,160
with some over the top title.
First of all,

854
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:59,100
I love is an ignorant moron.
Like that's like redundant,

855
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,860
you know, he's a stupid, not smart person.

856
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:08,740
I'm like,
I need to distance myself from some,

857
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,590
from someone who's been a great friend
for 20 years because of their dietary

858
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,930
decisions,
you know,

859
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:18,830
because they talk about food and nutrition
in a way that's a truth that they

860
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:21,350
believe in all of us, you know,
like, and then, and, and what,

861
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:25,010
you're a fucking genius, you know,
and it's just, you know, I dunno.

862
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,170
I Dunno why people do shit like that.

863
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:31,730
So that kind of ties into you and
I would never, obviously, you know,

864
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,150
that's, I don't know, I would
never tweet it. Somebody like that.

865
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,230
You need to distance yourself from this
person because I don't agree with their

866
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:42,310
workout regimen. And the same
thing with like, that, like,

867
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,300
I wouldn't be happy that somebody died
because I didn't like their political

868
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:50,210
views. You know what I mean?
I always have that in my head.

869
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:54,290
They add somebody's dad, somebody's
husband or some shit, you know, whatever.

870
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:00,020
He was a gay judge. That's somebody's
boyfriend right out of fucking know.

871
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,220
I, yeah. I don't do shit like that,
but if somebody does, you know,

872
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,140
I'm not the comedy fucking police.

873
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:10,450
Um, all right. Summer home bill.

874
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:15,040
My wife wants to own a home by a lake in
New Hampshire. That's fucking awesome.

875
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,030
I'm trying to convince her that it's
cheaper to just rent a sick house every

876
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,260
summer for a couple of weeks.

877
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:23,920
Instead of paying 15 grand a year
in taxes on top of the mortgage,

878
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,770
help me sort out business. Please go fuck
yourself. Well, what I would say is a,

879
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:35,160
you know, you can rent out your
house, your summerhouse, you know,

880
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,990
this is what I would do. Okay. I would,

881
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,080
I would buy that house on the lake and
then I would just rent the whole fucking,

882
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:48,700
yeah.
And then whenever I wanted to go,

883
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,720
I would rent some other place.
You know what I mean?

884
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,240
And this is how I'm weird
because I wouldn't want to
go into a place that I own

885
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,510
no one that everybody fucked in my bed.

886
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,010
I would rather go to a place knowing
that a bunch of people fucked it,

887
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:05,000
somebody else's bed.

888
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,440
It makes no sense. What you should do
is buy it and then rent it out. I mean,

889
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:16,740
buying property is always great. However,
if you're having a rough time, like I,

890
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,760
I'm a big believer in no
paying down your first house,

891
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,733
mmm.

892
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,080
You should really pay that thing down and
get it under control before you go and

893
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:33,190
get a summer house.
And I do know that in relationships,

894
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,630
when it comes to money,

895
00:54:34,631 --> 00:54:38,710
there's usually one person understands
it and the other person doesn't

896
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:42,610
understand it and they want everything
yesterday and you might be a little more

897
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:46,300
conservative, which is what
you sound like. So, um,

898
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,110
okay.

899
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,990
I, you know, I would just sit down
and just say, look, first of all,

900
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:53,690
you're in a great position because it
doesn't sound like she can just go out and

901
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:57,170
pull the trigger itself. So I just say,
listen, I definitely want to do that,

902
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:02,350
but we need to, we need to pay down
this house a little bit or, you know,

903
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,440
if we can't afford it,

904
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:07,850
let's buy it and then we'll rent the
thing out all the weekends that we're not

905
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:11,630
going to be there. Um, I
think that's definitely,

906
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,600
it's definitely a smart way to do
it. But, uh, I would just sit down,

907
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,570
okay.

908
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:24,570
And write out all the points that you
want to make and then draw a smiley face.

909
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,900
This is what I do when I'm being a smart
person because I know how short a fuse

910
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:33,100
I have. And, uh, I
write all this shit out,

911
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,440
everything that I want to
say and all that stuff.

912
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,630
And then I draw a smiley face
reminding me to not lose my temper,

913
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,660
reminding me that other
people are entitled to have
different opinions and uh,

914
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,210
you know,
and not to be a cunt.

915
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,530
I didn't do that a couple of days ago
and ended up having a big stupid fight

916
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:58,150
over the, the bathroom sink. You
know, I'd gone on the road in a ditch,

917
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:58,621
start,

918
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:03,180
started to clog up and I didn't
have time to fucking fix it,

919
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:06,830
but you know, we had drain
up. So I figured, you know,

920
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:10,340
my wife would fucking handle it and I
come home to brush my teeth and I turn it

921
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:14,380
on and within fucking two seconds,
it's already filling up as a puddle.

922
00:56:14,381 --> 00:56:15,680
It's completely backed up

923
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,590
and you know,

924
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,960
it's usual shit, usual shit in a
relationship. You say to somebody,

925
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,200
did you know her? No, I didn't
notice. And in your head you like,

926
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,350
how the fuck did you not notice the shit?

927
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,490
But what I learned in that argument is
I have to understand that this shit that

928
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:34,660
she's looking at me yet

929
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:38,210
looking at me at about like,
how the fuck do you not notice it?

930
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:41,060
And it's just cause I'm just not wired
like that. And that's why you get married.

931
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,690
Hopefully you're a yin and a Yang.
I finally set him right.

932
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,260
I didn't say ying and Yang. I said, yen,

933
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:52,590
Y I n I think that's the first time
publicly I've ever said it right. Um,

934
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,760
yeah, they're going to be good at this
shit that you're not good at. And um,

935
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,670
actually had a great
day with Nia yesterday.

936
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:01,910
Like I didn't do shit for once
and we just hung out all day.

937
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,920
And um, you know, we watched
some movies and shit.

938
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,550
You made a little bit of food.
And I always forget that,

939
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:11,780
that every once in a while you guys,

940
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,800
you got to hang out with each other
rather than just being roommates to remind

941
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:21,800
yourself like, oh yeah, that's right.
We actually really love each other.

942
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,740
I forgot about that shit and I don't
know the amount of times I've had to

943
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,370
fucking learn that, you
know, she getting married,

944
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:31,790
you really start doing the math like dude,
fuck too shit. I don't need anything.

945
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,330
I will literally give her everything.

946
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,720
I will fucking just give you fucking
everything and I will walk out with the

947
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:45,690
shirt on my fucking back and
I will start all over again.

948
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:50,040
Like I think that that's the way to
fucking do it and just walked down the

949
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,720
street after it like
Johnny fucking Appleseed.

950
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,723
Um,

951
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,950
cause I really think you just get
into having all of this fucking stuff,

952
00:57:58,951 --> 00:58:01,500
but if you just let go of all of it,
then you don't have it.

953
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:04,110
I think getting divorced could
be a really light feeling.

954
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,050
This is how far I went over an argument
over a clogged up sink before it came to

955
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,780
my senses.
I was walking down the street with the,

956
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:15,320
with the stick with the Bandana and a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich in it.

957
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,873
And I was just fine.

958
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,850
What am I doing? You know,
stop being a fucking idiot.

959
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,940
All right, let's get to some advertising
here. All right, me undies, everybody.

960
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,750
Oh Gee, I got to sing this quietly because
we have company over here right now.

961
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,810
Poop. Poop. Poop me and eat me undies.

962
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,620
No more sweaty nuts. Boo.
Doo Doo, Doo me undies.

963
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:40,530
BMDS keep it dry with your butts.
Wasn't that doesn't make sense.

964
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,840
And they said not sounds thinking bus
would rhyme. I, you know what I, I've,

965
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:47,140
I've got to retire this fucking
song and he's a new fucking,

966
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:51,550
I need some new bits on this goddamn
thing. All right, me undies. All right.

967
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:54,580
This year don't be predictable and show
up at your Valentine's Day dinner with

968
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:59,560
some last minute box of chocolate or
bouquet of roses. Bouquet bouquet.

969
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:04,360
I don't want to say it are going to die
in a week anyways. Uh, give the gift.

970
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:05,740
Everyone's talking about me.

971
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:10,060
Yon Ds me on days taking
care of your taint.

972
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:14,590
Bhutto dude do me, me, Andy's your balls.

973
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:18,730
We'll say you're a saint.
Uh, show your special day.

974
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:22,200
That fucking guy up here either fall.
Can you shake ski?

975
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,700
What is dry over here?
Show you a special someone.

976
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,030
Just how much you care with the present.

977
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,910
You're both love a gift that
looks great and feels great.

978
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:35,300
Something that says you deserve the
best. I have to tell you right now, you,

979
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,620
if you give somebody underwear for a gift,
you better be fucking them.

980
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:43,700
Are they better be your kid? Cause
other than that, it's fucking weird. Uh,

981
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:46,370
you know, give you kid under where
you know you're, there you go.

982
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:48,200
Jesus Christ straighten up and fly,
right?

983
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,553
No,

984
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,790
I have a little respect for yourself.
You know, and then if you, you know,

985
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,820
you're with the person intimately,
you can give it to them, you know,

986
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:58,790
there's no fucking way actually as a joke,
you can do that,

987
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,383
you know?

988
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,000
Do you know what was actually thinking
the other day when I went to buy my wife

989
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:05,070
a Valentine's Day card?
You know,

990
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,970
I was looking for the blank ones cause I
hate the fucking Valentine's Day cards.

991
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:09,181
You know,

992
01:00:09,181 --> 01:00:13,860
they're either over the top gross or
they're just fucking like too distant,

993
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,630
you know,
it's very hard to find that one.

994
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,600
That's the nice balance of I
love you but let's not be gross.

995
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,970
So I was looking for the blank ones and
I came to the sympathy cards and uh,

996
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,310
I just was thinking like,
you know what,

997
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:30,420
I really want to stand up with Joe de
Rosa again and then sent him a sympathy

998
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:33,120
card afterwards,
you know,

999
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,330
telling him I hope he feels better and
everything and just basically, right. Joe,

1000
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:38,940
I saw your set last night.
I know you're going through a rough time.

1001
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,460
Um, I dunno, it was funny to me. Anyways,

1002
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:48,910

cotton and they don't just feel great.

1008

Billy bubbles in the rain.

1044
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,940
Um, I went to high school with
the guy who picks up my trash.

1045
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,570
I get along with them and I always
wave and sometimes if he's not rushing,

1046
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,580
I'll have a short conversation with them.

1047
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,060
Last week I saw my neighbor yell at him.
He wasn't a,

1048
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,530
he wasn't a jerk back,
but he wasn't a dick either.

1049
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:26,760
What? He wasn't a jerk back, but he
wasn't a dick either. Later on that day,

1050
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,350
my neighbor came over and asked me if
I'd make a statement about the issue that

1051
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:35,460
he harassed her. I saw the whole
thing go down. He didn't harass her.

1052
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,650
She yelled at him for coming a day late
during a week when a holiday pushed

1053
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:45,570
everything back a day in terms of
sanitation, pickup a what? A cunt.

1054
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,060
She said that even without my statement,

1055
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:50,370
she's going to press charges
and file a complaint.

1056
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,300
I'm going to call the town or police
and let them know what's going on.

1057
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:57,480
I'm so livid that she would ruin
this guy's life. He's a great dude.

1058
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:00,810
Thoughts on how we should handle this?
Should I report her for lying apps?

1059
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:05,260
A fuckin lutely and I would take time
off from work to testify that she's Elian

1060
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,790
whore apps.
A fuckin lutely.

1061
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:13,260
Who the fuck yells in a trash man?
The service that they're providing.

1062
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:16,500
Fuck her. Fuck her. Do you know something?

1063
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,040
I would 100% do it and I would,

1064
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,290
I would even fucking tell her that
you're going to do it at some point.

1065
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:25,470
Not Not in the beginning because
you don't want to weaken his case.

1066
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:29,130
But I would do it without a doubt. And
when the whole fucking thing goes away,

1067
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,700
I would let her know that you did that
and I would let her know what a small

1068
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:36,570
person you think she is and that she's
disgusting and to stay away from you and

1069
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:40,560
anybody else that you love
because she subhuman there.

1070
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,740
I was at the limit dilemma. Dear Bill. Oh,

1071
01:04:45,741 --> 01:04:46,950
what a fucking whore.

1072
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:51,870
He came in day late and then you
harassed me to, you know what?

1073
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:53,640
You know what she I, you know
what? I bet she does for a living.

1074
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:55,110
She sounds like a blogger.

1075
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,760
Always playing the fucking victim and
always going down and just trying to get

1076
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:04,140
somebody in trouble and try and fuck
over there. Their ability, you know,

1077
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,860
to earn a living. What a
fucking Twat. All right. Derek,

1078
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,720
would you rather have to live
in an air balloon for a month?

1079
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:14,790
Never you having set down or would you

1080
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,560
rather live in a submarine? Never
breathing the surface for a whole month.

1081
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:24,020
Both scare the shit out
of me for a whole month,

1082
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:28,370
but I think I choose the submarine
seems more natural. Yeah.

1083
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:29,690
And there's also a bathroom.

1084
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:34,840
I wouldn't want to have to
shit on people and p why,

1085
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:38,540
but obviously wait till I
was over a a rural area.

1086
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:44,060
Yeah. Plus you'd be inside,
you'd have a bed. If you,

1087
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:47,430
when you were in the submarine,
you have a blanket, you know,

1088
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:52,390
you get to be down there
with all the fellows. Hey.

1089
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,280
Um, no man. I mean,

1090
01:05:57,281 --> 01:06:00,810
I think it would be cool to fucking look
out the window and see all the fucking,

1091
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,520
uh,
the sea life and all that shit.

1092
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,320
I would go fucking nuts down
there. But, um, I don't know.

1093
01:06:09,321 --> 01:06:14,150
Fucking up there in an air
balloon gets cold or hot.

1094
01:06:14,151 --> 01:06:16,790
You're really dealing with the fucking
elements when you're up there and starts

1095
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:19,770
fucking raining.
Uh,

1096
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,890
yeah, I dunno. I W I would be a, I
would get over that really quickly,

1097
01:06:25,891 --> 01:06:29,150
but I think being in a sub,
you know, you're down there,

1098
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:33,210
you get flake cards so you could fucking
break each other's balls or whatever.

1099
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,670
I don't know. Yeah, I definitely would
take, I would much rather do with sub. Um,

1100
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,180
and if I had to die either way,
I'd rather die in a sub.

1101
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:44,370
I'd rather have it just fucking, you
know, if you're going to die in the cell,

1102
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:49,340
it's going to be quick. You
know, it's just, it's just over,

1103
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,900
right. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know.

1104
01:06:53,901 --> 01:06:56,930
Sometimes maybe it might not be
quick. They close that door. Yeah.

1105
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:00,800
Those are two terrifying. Thanks. I got to
go with you. Got To go with you on that.

1106
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:01,973
Um,

1107
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,533
okay.

1108
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:06,560
Alright. Dilemma Billy boy. Uh,

1109
01:07:06,561 --> 01:07:10,610
if you had to choose which holiday to
get canceled and never celebrate again,

1110
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,490
would you choose Valentine's
Day or President's Day?

1111
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,530
Who deserves more recognition,

1112
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,560
your girl for doing what you
do all year without a holiday.

1113
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:24,290
That's hilarious. Yeah. We don't get a
holiday. Um, no. Maybe I read that wrong.

1114
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,850
Or presidents who may or may not be
horrible people who hurt the country.

1115
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,200
I canceled president's Day because
I'd rather keep the one that involved

1116
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:36,080
chocolate being around. Oh,
that's a good reason for it. Um,

1117
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:37,220
if I had to get rid of one,

1118
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,070
I don't think anybody really
celebrates president's Day.

1119
01:07:41,071 --> 01:07:43,910
I don't really consider it a day off.
It's kind of like flag day,

1120
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:47,630
you know what I mean?
Or a buttermilk pancakes day.

1121
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:51,610
Isn't there one of those
fucking days to, um, cheeses?

1122
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,450
Do you want me to cancel a holiday?

1123
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,880
Uh, I would cancel Valentine's Day
just because women like it so much.

1124
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:02,940
Believe it or not, I am a concert,
but I'm not that fucking bad.

1125
01:08:02,941 --> 01:08:06,780
So I'd keep that one. Yeah. You
know what? Fuck Presidents' Day.

1126
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:08,820
All those guys are
bought and sold any ways.

1127
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,610
You've seen it with Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

1128
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:15,650
You've seen how the Democrats had just
going to pick her because going to play

1129
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,484
ball,

1130
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,940
they're all tied into the fucking,
the fucking,

1131
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:24,530
I don't know what you want to call it.
Did she?

1132
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:26,870
She that Bernie Sanders
is too fucking radical.

1133
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:29,690
He's going to switch shit up too much
and then they're not going to work with

1134
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:32,000
them. Even if Bernie Sanders
gets fucking elected,

1135
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:32,840
they're not going to work with them.

1136
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:35,570
They're gonna show their fucking true
colors. There are a bunch of that.

1137
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:39,110
Just a bunch of, they're all bought
and paid for it. They don't. Well,

1138
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,580
how the fuck do the Clinton's got $3
million to throw their kid a wedding?

1139
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:48,210
You know what I mean? We have
fucking break. Cause you went out,

1140
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,300
you gave speeches to all
the people that fucking

1141
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,640
financed your campaign and then you hook
them up and look the other fucking way.

1142
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:58,310
I swear to God,
I swear to God.

1143
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:01,100
Do you want to have the
fucking pharmaceutical
companies and the people who

1144
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:03,890
fucked up the food supplier
able to do it and there's not,

1145
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:06,530
there's nothing behind it is cause
they fucking paid everybody off.

1146
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,010
I swear to God. All right, I'm
on my stomach on my eye is,

1147
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:12,950
this is why I always vote for that
third party guy. And everybody goes, Oh,

1148
01:09:12,951 --> 01:09:15,890
you throwing away your fucking vote.
How is thrown away my fucking vote?

1149
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:19,650
Vote for somebody as a decent fucking
human being. I swear to God, people, they,

1150
01:09:19,651 --> 01:09:22,610
they, they don't want to try to do
what's right. They just want to win.

1151
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,640
They want to be like, go buy one again.

1152
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:31,850
See that every time I sit there and I
trashed people for fucking given the

1153
01:09:32,461 --> 01:09:35,640
public opinion, then look, I meet
the gumby. I do the exact same thing.

1154
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,410
I am what's known as a hypocrite.
The HIPAA can't. Alright,

1155
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:44,240
that's the a, the podcast
for this week. Um,

1156
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,000
I want to thank everybody that
came out, Cheyenne, Wyoming, a,

1157
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:51,000
I know it was last second, but uh, I had
a great time. At a great time in your, uh,

1158
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:56,610
your, your state capital.
Uh, Joe was just a really,

1159
01:09:56,611 --> 01:10:00,660
really cool fucking town and I had a
great time in the Cadillac ranch there.

1160
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,390
That sounds, I swear to God,
like the fucking bunny ranch.

1161
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:06,060
It sounds like a fucking whore
house, but it wasn't, um,

1162
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:09,030
it was cool talking to the people
there and thank you to everybody.

1163
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:11,970
You know the bought me a beer and a shot
and all that shit. Thank you everybody.

1164
01:10:11,971 --> 01:10:14,010
Denver by the way,

1165
01:10:14,011 --> 01:10:18,720
which was just a fucking insane show.
Um,

1166
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,120
that was another thing,
special one.

1167
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:24,140
Just cause I'd done so many fucking gigs
in Colorado in the middle of nowhere.

1168
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:27,200
I always bring up Arapahoe community
college. I'll never forget that.

1169
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:32,090
Nooner where they had me standing in
an area where three hallways met right

1170
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:34,460
before class ended.
That was a fucking nightmare.

1171
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:38,600
Next to a popcorn machine and five
people scattered out about 40 chairs,

1172
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:42,140
empty chairs.
Anyways,

1173
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,080
that's a podcast for this week.
Uh,

1174
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:48,380
I'm going to try to watch some Celtics
and get caught up on the Bruins games, um,

1175
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,200
and keep drinking my juice.
All right. Go Fuck Yourself.

1176
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,520
I'll talk to you later on this week.
