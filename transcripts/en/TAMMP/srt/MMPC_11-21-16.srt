1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,580
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:05,670
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:10,380
November 21st, 2060 what's going on? How,

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,370
why, how's it going? Oh,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm doing good man. I hope you guys
would do all, it's a holiday weekend.

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,260
Dooby dooby do in school to lead Bop.

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,340
You only have to work three days
unless you boss is a fucking cunt.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,810
There's always other ones too are if your
fucking self employed or if you're not

9
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,300
happy with your home life, you'll
come up with a reason. Right.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,830
To go back into work just
to fucking avoid it. Um,

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,860
yeah. You know what this
year, cause uh, you know,

12
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,680
we can get in the fucking kitchen done.
We don't have time to cook or anything.

13
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:51,120
So we're actually going to a friend's
house for Thanksgiving, which is,

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,650
which is great because they
live in the same city as us,

15
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,750
so we don't have to go to the
fucking airport right now.

16
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:01,350
All these fucking people waddling around,
you know,

17
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:06,150
those people just oblivious of other, you
know, it's a great fucking human being.

18
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:10,680
Just totally being all about yourself.
Oblivious moment is when fucking people,

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,311
you know,

20
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:15,390
there's a whole herd of people just
riding down an escalator and people like

21
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,100
this second,
they step off it.

22
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,770
They don't keep walking and get
the fuck out of the way. They just,

23
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:23,190
they're just all fucking
oblivious. It's like, ugh.

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,840
You would just on the escalator,
there's 50 people in front of you.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,880
100 people behind your touchdown.

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,780
Sorry, I got the game on.
What a fucking throat.

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,190
What the fuck is going on with
the package this year, man,

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,120
I don't fucking get it. Um, anyways,
sorry about the screaming then. You know,

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,030
you got 50 people in front of, you got
a hundred fucking people behind you.

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,080
You know,

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,050
and people are getting off that kind of
meander in and you're on the escalator

32
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,940
thinking cow, go get out of the way before
we all fall down on each other. Right.

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,020
If for any sort of a thinking human being
going like, oh, assessing the problem.

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,680
Well when in fucking eight
seconds when I become that person,

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,780
I'm going to get the fuck out of the way.

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,120
So whoever the fuck is 20 people behind
me will not be having this panic moment

37
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:16,380
because of me going to become
part of part of the solution.

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,720
Not The fucking problem.
Right.

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,270
I don't even know what I'm
talking about at this point.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,160
I can't remember the point I was trying
to make, but what I know what I'm saying.

41
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,390
Yeah. That the kind of fucking people like
you know was the top. So thanksgiving.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,320
That's right. Right. So we're going to
fucking pee. I have no idea why point is,

43
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,620
you know what I mean?
I just said a bunch of shit out.

44
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:40,290
Hope it was funny cause God knows there
was no point and I think that actually

45
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:45,120
is the point of the Monday morning podcast
for all you people out there who you

46
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,580
know who tend to take it
unbelievably seriously.

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,630
Those of you out there who think that
I influenced the fucking election isn't

48
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,464
that hilarious.

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,010
$7 billion was spent to get Trump and
all these fucking people a chance to get

50
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:02,770
elected. But you know that all
goes out the window. The second,

51
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,290
some fuckhead who can't
even read out loud,

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,290
does a podcast all out the window.
I'll tell you if that's true.

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,320
I'm going to start, I'm going to start
charging more for my fucking advertising.

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,660
You know what I mean? Maybe I'll use
that as a selling point in 2017. Uh,

55
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,410
evidently I was, I was the reason Trump
got into fucking office. Oh, Jesus.

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,810
Hey, Trump's support. Is he liking
what you're seeing so far? Uh,

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,410
you like in these fucking,
you know,

58
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,420
you thought Trump was old
looking at the fucking people.

59
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,390
He's surrounded himself with Jesus Christ.

60
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,920
If they're not an a Nazi fucking movie,
they're like 450 fucking years old.

61
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,810
Rudy Giuliani.

62
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,790
This is like when some old hair metal
band gets back together again thinking

63
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,670
they're going to put out a fucking
relevant album. You're not, it's over.

64
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,860
You had your time. It's fucking
done. You know what I mean?

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,760
These guys are going to get the fucking
band back together and start singing

66
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,530
about what, uh, girls in a
strip club and the devil,

67
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,120
maybe the PMRC or whatever the fuck
people used to sing about back in the day.

68
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,620
I don't pretend to know. Um, you know,

69
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,500
we were fucked either way. All
these fucking people, by the way,

70
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,570
I gotta give a shout out to somebody.
Um,

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,170
what's her name from
cosmopolitan magazines.

72
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:24,400
Laura Beck calling out SNL for
the horse. Shit that, that was,

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,100
that was that opening completely
agreed when they were singing.

74
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,300
The woman who plays a Clinton,

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,280
Hillary Clinton played ilet Luhya and
it was kind of confusing. Like is,

76
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:40,390
was this a true tribute to fucking,
uh, Leonard Cohen Dying? Or what,

77
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:45,000
what's this a political fucking statement?
And uh, she kind of called them out.

78
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,520
Go and did you guys have Trump as a
fucking house while he was running for

79
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,220
president? And Al of a sudden, you know,
you help promote the guide then. Yeah.

80
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,440
I mean, shit, if I did by trashing
both fucking people, right?

81
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,830
She actually said it was bullshit. It
was fucking hilarious. It's a great read.

82
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:04,030
I'll give you guys a, uh, a link
to it, but I mean it's a TV show.

83
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,130
That's what they do.
They did that to a buddy of mine.

84
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:10,060
They did that to fucking Dane Cook.
They had them fucking a hosted twice.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,080
He made him a bunch of fucking money with
high ratings and then all of a sudden

86
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,420
there's a little blip on the
fucking Internet, you know,

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,930
tide turns a little bit and then they
use them as a fucking cheap joke when he

88
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,730
wasn't even a, he wasn't even on the
shelf. That's what they do over there.

89
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,200
That's what they do in this business.
Then at your fucking friends. See,

90
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,680
that's why you know what you do. You stay
where I stay right in my little cave.

91
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,630
You do a podcast by yourself and
then no one can hurt you. Um,

92
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,620
anyways, um, so I, uh,

93
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,940
every time I do a standup special,
you know,

94
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,860
and ends up being a little bit too long,
at least the last couple of ones.

95
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,950
So you start thinking,
what if you take this out here when,

96
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,770
if you do a little fucking thing here and
we have to do, and he ended up fucking,

97
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,040
the whole thing of what you really have to

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,430
do is you, you just got it. You
got to cut off a limb. You know,

99
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,850
you've got to remove a kidney. Basically.
You just got to take out a chunk.

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,940
And I figured out what chunk
it was going to be or I had an,

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,920
an idea that that's what I wanted. And
then the director Jay had the same idea.

102
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,921
We took it out and it flows and it
went from a too long of a special.

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,220
Now it's like fucking perfect.
And now we're going to, uh,

104
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,780
and all I've seen at this point
is just the raw feed of it.

105
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,840
So it's not even like an HD
and it looks way over lit.

106
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,960
And then my fucking
pasty God damn Whitehead,

107
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,160
I look like an asshole and it
still looks like a good special.

108
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,690
So I'm very excited. I got that
done. F is for family. Second season,

109
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,120
we're starting to fucking,
you know,

110
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,890
tighten these things down for
the final fucking edit. And, um,

111
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,830
and then next month I'm going to start,
uh,

112
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,500
the process of which should be a quick
editor is editing the audio from what I

113
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:57,530
did, Madison Square Garden a year ago
for the New York comedy festival. Sorry,

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,380
hiccups, New York comedy festival.
I didn't almost get emotional,

115
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,890
the New York comedy festival.
Um,

116
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,680
and then if once I get, I get all that
shit done right then I'm just like done.

117
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm done. I can just enjoy
the rest of the fucking year.

118
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,300
I got nothing to do really.
Right. And then, uh,

119
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,570
then it starts all over again in January,
you know,

120
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,960
be nice if I did cardio for the
rest of the week and just, you know,

121
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,160
then I can fucking throw down.

122
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,680
That's another good thing about going
to somebody's place for the holidays.

123
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,060
They got to clean up. You know, you
don't leave with a bunch of fucking food.

124
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,460
It's going to be good.
Um,

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,070
I'm excited about when he wants
me to make this fucking stuff.

126
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,650
And I knew she wouldn't let me
just go over there. It's like,

127
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:42,440
why can't I just be the 12 pack guy?
You know,

128
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,500
that's the best guy you put on a
sweater. Right? He go over there,

129
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:49,250
you make people fucking laugh to show
up with like a 12 or fucking whatever,

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,830
whatever the fuck you want.
You know,

131
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:54,560
I try this IPA lately and
I'm really not an IPA guy.

132
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,300
I go in and out of that shit.
I usually drink,

133
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:00,380
just drink shit that's considered
a white trash beer. And um,

134
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,860
cause I just like getting fucked up.
You know, I'm going to do the taste.

135
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,330
I just want to get fucked up. Right. And
I want you guys to say, well those IPA is,

136
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,540
have a fucking high alcohol content.
I don't give a shit. They're fucking,

137
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,080
they're heavy.
Fucking heavy as hell.

138
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,870
But I tried this one, it was called the
Green Line and I got it. I don't even,

139
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,140
because they only had a
couple beers at this place,

140
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,700
was this goofy fucking place and I
just wanted a beer. And they were,

141
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,100
that's one of the only ones they had.

142
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,950
I actually really liked it
and mind me living in Boston,

143
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:34,770
fucking going up to fuck and
Chestnut Hill and the gray line dote,

144
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,030
Kenmore Square,
go to the fucking sucks rich

145
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,570
Fisk. Um, Gary Allen said,

146
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,960
oh Jesus says a couple of red sox names
from way back in the day. Anyways, um,

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,260
I tried that shit.
I actually really liked it and uh,

148
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,230
I don't even want to did guys,

149
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,510
I'm just fucking talking in
circles cause I haven't been home.

150
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,740
I haven't been to my house and like
fucking two months and uh, I've had it,

151
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,120
me and Nia had been living on top
of each other and uh, you know,

152
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't know about her,
but I'm,

153
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm pretty sick of us being
this close to one another.

154
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,330
So hopefully Tuesday we get back
in the fucking place. Oh, nice.

155
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:20,270
Fucking throw Aaron Rogers over
the top DB complain and say it,

156
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:22,380
he fucking pushed off course.
You're going to say that.

157
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,590
That's what you say when a guy
fucking what a tight end beach.

158
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:29,460
You that deep as a fucking corner.
How the hell does that happen?

159
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:31,800
How do you let that happen?
I asked you guys,

160
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,880
he pushed him within five yards.
I think that was all right. Um,

161
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,850
anyways, how about those Bruins?
Huh? He handled in Winnipeg.

162
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:45,150
I was all nervous day that top two
scorers in the league. What did we tell?

163
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,850
We'd put fucking three of them. Three
goals in the second period, right?

164
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:54,851
Who scored fucking mash and fucking Burgee
Belsky whatever the fuck his name is.

165
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,540
And then, I don't know fuck suites.
We actually went up for nothing. One,

166
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,640
four to one.
That's another thing when I get back,

167
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,590
I got my Bruins and Celtics package.

168
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:08,460
I can start watching that shit so I can
really start boring you guys with the

169
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,650
sports talk.
You know,

170
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,740
I didn't see the Patriots game today
cause I've been running around and haven't

171
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:16,710
been spending time with my wife.
So I took her out someplace today.

172
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,060
She'll come on later and tell
you all about it. And um,

173
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,041
but all he knows,

174
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,890
it's the usual shit on my fucking
friends who are pats fans like, dude,

175
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,540
why'd we trade Chandler George?
Why we get rid of Jamie Collins.

176
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,170
I fucking defense stank
stone. Um, so I think it was,

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,610
you know what should have been an
easy game, I guess. Evidently wasn't,

178
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,510
but a, I didn't see any of that.
I watched the boxing though.

179
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,200
Who the fuck that Russian guy,
that ego Larry are enough.

180
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,190
Was that his fucking name?

181
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,210
Whoever was a real hacky
Russian name was Sergei Kovalev,

182
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,030
which is like every Russian
guy in the NHL. He's either,

183
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,410
his first name is Sergei
or his last name is called.

184
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:00,810
That's really like the John
Smith of Russian names.

185
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,700
So he's fighting this American dude.

186
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,520
So I got to go for the
fucking American and uh,

187
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,130
I got to tell you something the
fucking first, first fucking round.

188
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,043
All right.

189
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,670
Ego Iron off comes out and he
fucking punches Andre Reed.

190
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,440
Was that the guy's name? Was that the guy
in the bills? I can't fucking remember.

191
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:24,330
I'm not a big boxing fan. I
love the sport. I love it.
But uh, it's been ruined.

192
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,590
It's been ruined because every three
pounds is a new weight class that has yet

193
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,880
another fucking champion.

194
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:33,120
And then there's like 15 different
fucking boxing federations.

195
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,130
It's a shit show like this, more boxing
divisions than there are podcasts.

196
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,440
And I'll tell you that stayed
some, cause there's a lot of, um,

197
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,320
you know what I mean? When I was a kid,
it was like, it was like fly weight.

198
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,980
It was like fly wade,
featherweight, middleweight

199
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,860
welterweight, heavyweight, something
like dad, I can't remember.

200
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:00,280
I can't remember the fucking
divisions now. Even things like,

201
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:04,090
there's like 15 off shoots of each
one of them. It's, you know what,

202
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,180
it's like those superhero movies,
like back in the day,

203
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:11,130
like Superman was in a superman movie.
Batman was in a bat.

204
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,730
They didn't fucking know each other.

205
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,440
They weren't all hanging out at the same
place. Maybe on the, the super friends,

206
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:22,390
they were super friends. They did at the
hall of Justice. But they only did that.

207
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,480
They did that when they drew it,
but they never had that in movies.

208
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,650
You know what I mean? Superman
was Christopher Reeves.
That was his fucking shit.

209
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,360
And uh, see Batman. Right.

210
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,140
Okay.

211
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,640
Oh, they have. They had Michael Keaton,

212
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,650
remember that he was all sweaty in the
locker room with just a towel around him

213
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:46,160
where the bat mask and he got in the
face of val Kilmer and he was like,

214
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:50,270
that's right. Ice Man. I am
dangerous. And then Val said,

215
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,380
clicked his fucking teeth together and
then they all played volleyball, you know?

216
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:55,790
And then they were playing volleyball.

217
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,330
Aqua man didn't come out of the
Ocean Daddy. You know what I mean?

218
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,780
Looking at Batman being like,
take my breath away, dude.

219
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,500
Who Do you know Kelly McGillis
gets in an invisible jet?

220
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,330
I can't remember the fucking,
I believe the fucking names.

221
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:14,570
I remember from that movie.
I saw that movie a bunch of times.

222
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:19,550
That was the one that I owned on VHS.
Winnick Danke Danke [inaudible] right.

223
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,820
I was in high school and everybody
wouldn't want him to get a fucking Ninja

224
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:27,560
motorcycle and fucking flight
have sixteens, you know, inverted.

225
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,890
We also be, we're going to do that.
You know this, every once in a while,

226
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:32,630
like a movie comes out and you're like,
you know what?

227
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:36,290
I'm going to fucking do that.
Right. And then what happens?

228
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,470
You know what happens to geometry,
Algebra two and trig. All of that happens.

229
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:44,590
So then you're like, oh, I'll wait
a minute. Wait, I thought, oh,

230
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,330
thought I think I was going to fly jets.

231
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,770
Is that what I thought was
going to happen? Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,990
I'm going to be a salesman.

233
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,920
You know I make people laugh. You know
I, you know, am I coming over room?

234
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,220
I make people feel good. You got
a product? I'll do it. Huh? Well,

235
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:05,930
you second cutting potatoes like this.
What if you had that?

236
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,110
I liked the guy with the John Riggins
fucking Jersey in the crowd at the

237
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,780
Redskins game, man. 44 it was
always a bad ass fucking number.

238
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,980
That was always a full back number
when I was growing up. John Riggins,

239
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:23,720
Robert Newhouse, you know Chuck Foreman?
Yeah, I think it was a running back.

240
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:27,860
Was he 44 that was a bad ass
fucking number. Reggie Jackson.

241
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,620
You know, now you're this guy,
Starks. He's got to live. That's it.

242
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,410
That's a fucking legendary number.

243
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,940
I want to have any fucking
hall of famers were 44.

244
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,070
I fucked debt. How many fucking,
just like skirts were 44. Not a lot.

245
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,010
Everybody have a war. 44 was
a tough motherfucker. Right.

246
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,590
I like to thank John
Riggins broke my heart man.

247
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,100
Cause that was a big time cowboys fan

248
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,380
back then. Um, before,

249
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:58,750
how about them cowboys and they kicked
out Tom Landry and Tex Schramm. Uh,

250
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,010
that was just the worst.
You know,

251
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,070
I thought Tom Landry was going to be
this forever. You know, I was young.

252
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:08,390
I didn't know. I didn't know people get
old and it passes him by fucked up. Right.

253
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,823
And uh,

254
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,330
I hated the fucking red skins for beating
the cowboys so much that when they

255
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,840
were in that Superbowl actually rooted
for the dolphins and I hated the fucking

256
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:20,870
dolphins because we can never beat him.
And uh,

257
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,200
when Riggins broke through the line
and whoever the fuck that was on the

258
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:28,100
dolphins that came by and just
grabbed him by the waist in slid down,

259
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm like a greased fucking pole. And he
just kept running. That dad killed me.

260
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,940
Was it age eight Dewey?
And I'll fucking remember anyways.

261
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,900
Um, how much time have I done? He
was a time for the fucking region.

262
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,510
I don't think so. Um, hey, Neha,

263
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,870
you want to come in here and
tell people about your day?

264
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,830
I get to tell you this shit,
right? So I haven't been, you know,

265
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,630
I've been fucking busting my ass.
You know,

266
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,550
I was getting ready to do this special
and then editing all that bullshit I

267
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,460
talked about earlier. So, you know, if
you don't spend time with your wife,

268
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,550
all of a sudden your wife gets
all upset with you. Like, oh,

269
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:09,380
you don't spend time with me and
boo Hoo Hoo. I have fucking needs.

270
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,890
Hey Nia, I'm just, I'm doing a character.

271
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,540
What the fuck did I do with the Mike?
There's the microphone. Is the microphone.

272
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,860
All right. Hello. Talk to
me. Talk to me goose. Hello.

273
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,810
Um, so anyways, yeah, I
haven't been spending time
with you. So I figured today,

274
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:30,680
you know what, I gotta go, I gotta
do something, I gotta do something.

275
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,680
So I took my wife to go see Casap
blanket today while the Patriots were on.

276
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:41,990
I got to get credit
for that. Okay. So, um,

277
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,830
I thought it was at this old theater
I was telling you about these guys on,

278
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,260
I think Thursday I was telling
him about it. Like there was,

279
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,530
it was all these old theaters out here
then I'm obsessed with where they had the

280
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:54,720
Oscars throughout the years. I just
think of all the great, you know,

281
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,720
Comedians and actors and directors
and everything that had been on.

282
00:16:57,721 --> 00:17:01,040
And I love that sense of history,
right? So you've got the pantageous,

283
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,870
he got the fucking who, some of what's
out in Santa Monica, the Kodak Theater,

284
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,730
all these fucking places. So, um,

285
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,190
I just remember that one from
the 80s and I always saw,

286
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:12,920
I guess it was in downtown La.
Maybe that's the one down the other way.

287
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,980
I don't fucking know. But I just looked
him up and I was like, you know what,

288
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,760
I'd love to do maybe a show
there or I might want to do, um,

289
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,730
you know, just go to something. And I, I
looked up that one downtown and it said,

290
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,091
uh,

291
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,790
there was just a bunch of orchestras
there and then it said it was Casablanca.

292
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm like a fucking love Humphrey Bogart.
I'll take needed to go see that shit.

293
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,160
So we go down and of course we show
up in the theater. I want to go into,

294
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,960
there's nobody there.
They're like, oh yeah. Yeah,

295
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,890
it's not here. It's at the theater
next door. There's a little old couple.

296
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,610
So you go up and um, we're walking
around the theater. It's completely

297
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,020
deserted. Amari starting to
course fucking storm. Yeah.

298
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,430
Bill's already getting hot.

299
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,180
I'm going to fuck that. I was on the
fucking website. It looked it up.

300
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,760
I looked it up twice.

301
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Couple who are walking with their
little bonnets on because it was raining

302
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,040
outside. Yup. Bill Ass. Like, oh, is
this where they're having the movie?

303
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,110
I was a little more frantic than that.
Yeah.

304
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,530
Like you got you guys coming from the
movie. You're old. And that was my energy

305
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,570
[inaudible] across the
street at the concert hall.

306
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,870
And you had your,

307
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,570
one of your classic but you,
you,

308
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,110
you made the mistake and so you
started having a little meltdown.

309
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,770
I didn't make a mistake because if you
look the fucking theater up and you look

310
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,210
okay, and it says it was at the
Dorothy Chandler pavilion. No,

311
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:45,900
you click on calendar events and then
it just, it lists and it lists that.

312
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,590
But I think the same person owns the
theater. It's very fucking, you know,

313
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,080
it's like buying a car.
Yeah, we got it this lot.

314
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,870
And all of a sudden you're down the
street. It's like you're in good fellas.

315
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,710
They're a little further down. I Dunno
Jimmy. I think I'll pick it up tomorrow.

316
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,320
That's what they did to me.
Well anyway,

317
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,140
it was across the street at the Walt
Disney concert at the symphony looking

318
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:09,120
thing that looks like a fucking exploded
golf course designed by Frank Gehry.

319
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:13,950
It's like one of the most like impressive
the drummer from extreme, isn't it? No,

320
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,590
it's a very famous architect.
Zack,

321
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,350
go lock what you see here.

322
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,030
Get the fuck out. Get the
fuck out. Get the fuck out.

323
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,440
Get the fuck out. What are you singing?
We won't try to, it's one of the widest,

324
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,780
trying to be funky songs
ever. Get the funk out. That
one. And then there's the uh,

325
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,780
some big John is my name.
Anyway, this building,

326
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,010
this building was one of the most like
impressive piece of architecture in Los

327
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,650
Angeles. It's a beautifully designed
space and bill is just like,

328
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,980
I couldn't help but laugh at you because
you were just muttering and cursing and

329
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:57,390
stomping around in the rain.

330
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,490
Oh, go to this one. Oh, wanted
to go into the gray ones.

331
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,140
Super Modern Shit. I've done shows in
those stupid symphony fucking things.

332
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
You feel like you're in front of like
the council and one of those superman

333
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:15,430
movies where you're like down there all
fucking up above you in that behind you.

334
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,050
I fucking hate those things.
So it was like,

335
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,510
I don't want to fucking go into
this thing. So I end up showing,

336
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,030
but it's like I got to take it to
this thing. It's fucking raining out.

337
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:25,440
So Nia is all like, whoa,
good. Go to the theater.

338
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,100
Another time when it said Jan event,

339
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,390
so I calm you down cause it's not what?
We're going to another building.

340
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:34,510
No big deal. You know we're going
to go seek. And then what happened

341
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,520
going, we shout. So we show
up and I go, Hey, can I get,
and I literally said to you,

342
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,370
go, now we're going to fucking go to
this stupid ass fucking theater, right?

343
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,140
It's probably in some small room.
It's going to be be you,

344
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:49,060
me and four other old people and the
movies, the movies almost ready to start,

345
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:49,301
right?

346
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:54,301
So we fucking show up and I
go up to the booth and I go,

347
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,380
yeah, I need two tickets to
Casablanca. And the person's like,

348
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,610
I don't know if there's any tickets left.
And I'm like,

349
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,700
what are you talking about?
It's raining. It's Sunday.

350
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:11,590
Football's on his fucking movies like 80
years old. Who is going to come through

351
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,260
check, right? And then she finally goes,
well you can't, I should. We found too,

352
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,860
and I'm like, thank Christ,
trying to do some romantic here.

353
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,860
It's not the right fucking theater now
they're going to be sold out. She goes,

354
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:28,460
you got to go down to windows.
So I say, fine. I kept my
cool, they're there, right?

355
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,620
The rain and rain enough on my steam
and head that I walked over and it cools

356
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:35,110
you off a little bit. Cool me off a
little bit. And I walk on my goal,

357
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,580
let me get to, and I, they go, okay.
And then they go and the guy goes, okay,

358
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,710
that's going to be $161 I go $161 he goes,

359
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
each and we both were like,
wait.

360
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,390
So it turned out no way. So this
is what it turns. It turns out,

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,550
I think this is way too loud here.
I got to turn this down here.

362
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,380
It turns out that,
um,

363
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,750
what was happening was the La Philharmonic
was going to be playing the film

364
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,730
score while you watched the movie.

365
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Turns out this is a major la cultural
event that was basically the fall out.

366
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,170
Bill was just going to be a
movie for a few old people in us.

367
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,330
It turns out it's this major event.

368
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,830
Every he's got on like sport coats
and fucking dresses and shit.

369
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,140
I'm sitting there,
my wet hoodie going on,

370
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,950
Humphrey Bogart in there. What
the fuck's going on? Right.

371
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,350
We can view the view the body,

372
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,400
Aaron Eckhart and like introduces
the fucking movie. So you know,

373
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,070
you know when you just don't give a shit,
I just said fuck it.

374
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,590
So I light up the card and I go,
let's go in there.

375
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:47,950
And then I start getting this
feeling of like, this might be my,

376
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,420
this might be fucking amazing.

377
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,980
And then there's all these ushers walking
around hitting these things that are

378
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:56,740
gone. Boom, boom. Like letting people
know that, you know, that whole,

379
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,570
like you don't want to
disturb rich white people,

380
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:00,340
that the things are about ready to start,

381
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:05,110
whatever that fucking instrument is
called. Um, and they fucking go in there.

382
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,670
Uh, we go in there and, and
like, it's like Holy Shit.

383
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,060
Like we're going to listen to what
the La Philharmonic while we watched

384
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,660
Casablanca and I'll fucking great was,
it was amazing.

385
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,410
It was such an awesome experience.
So bill kind of fumbled,

386
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,530
fumbled his way into her.

387
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,680
Really amazing romantic
day and I get no credit.

388
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,590
I get no credit because I picked
the wrong fucking theater.

389
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,070
I just totally stumped. So
Kenny, you'd be like, Hey,

390
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,710
you see that with the orchestra?
I picked that out on purpose.

391
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,603
I

392
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,810
feel like you definitely get points
for you seeing that you saw something

393
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,180
cultural going on and you're, oh, that
sounds cool. Like Nini would like that.

394
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,970
And we went and it turned
out to be amazing. So it was,
it was great. Yeah. Erin,

395
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:54,830
it was Carl Marriner was not a hail Mary,
the actor,

396
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,310
the actor came out and
introduced the movie oil man.

397
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,320
Is there another famous Aaron Eckhart?
I don't know. Are you being sarcastic?

398
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,740
I'm being a Dick Right now. Was he in,
was he in no, no country for old men.

399
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,950
He was in then get out of here.
Bitch in the company of men.

400
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,660
And he was in Sally. Sally. Oh
yeah, the mustache. Yes. He was

401
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,260
in that movie. He was in that
movie, which, well that was a movie.

402
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,100
That was a movie they made up.
They made a,

403
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:31,310
evidently they made up all of this other
shit. It was just so fucking boring.

404
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:34,580
Can I just say that? You don't
have to say it. I'll say, come on.

405
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:37,070
It's Clint Eastwood.
It was wrapped up forward Senate.

406
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,860
Jerry's in it has a
bunch of us. We had, yes,

407
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,480
we have friends that are in that movie,

408
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,190
but thou are we a Hollywood
couple of our friends are in it.

409
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,670
That movie was so boring
because you know why?

410
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,170
Because nobody, this is some sounds
so terrible, but nobody died.

411
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,650
Nobody got no, he nailed
her leg. It was nailed it.

412
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,460
He put it right where it was
supposed to put it. Yeah.

413
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,490
There was no hype off by engines.
Went out at 1500 feet.

414
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:09,200
Should I try to land it in the water or
fly back over the most densely populated

415
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:13,900
area in the United States, so he put
it in the water. Everyone survived.

416
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,530
The whole thing took in real life,
24 minutes for everyone to get rescued.

417
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,230
It's like, what is the movie about? Well,

418
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,250
they had to have them have to do you
to have the evil corporate guys going.

419
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:26,720
You couldn't save the jet.
Yeah.

420
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,770
Could you push some people out on the
way over? It just wasn't exciting.

421
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,680
Tom Hanks is, is a, is a wonderful
actor. All the acting was great in it.

422
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:37,520
I want to see it play a serial killer.

423
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,180
I'm so sick of him always being doing
the right thing. That's not his brand.

424
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,480
That's not Tom Hanks is brand.
He's not a serial killer.

425
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,890
Did he die in saving private Ryan?
Spoiler alert number.

426
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,620
He was just sitting there firing at the
tech. You never saw that? No, it's not.

427
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,550
I'm not into those kind of, I'm not.
It's a war movies. It's not a war movie.

428
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,860
Saving Private Ryan is not about a
war and soldiers that dye in it. Well,

429
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,290
I mean that's literally what it is,
but it's more of a metaphor.

430
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,570
It is saving private Ryan is a
metaphor. Metaphor. What is it?

431
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,220
A metaphor for a,
please explain.

432
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,930
So you don't even know what you're talking
about. Even know what a metaphor is.

433
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,840
It's an incredible fucking movie
and I believe you. All right.

434
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,030
Okay.

435
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,860
We kind of just killed your credibility
to say Sally's boring and then you're

436
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:26,770
like, yeah, I'm not in a war
movie. That was private. Ryan.

437
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,150
Ryan's almost unbelievable fucking
moves ever saw. Why is that?

438
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:33,020
Kill my credibility. Just because
I didn't like I said, oh, I see.

439
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,090
That's how it works. One thing has
to do with the other. I don't know.

440
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,800
You've been bugging me lately.
Why? Yeah, I dunno. I just,
I don't want to be a dick,

441
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,570
but he putting on weight.
Excuse me.

442
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,710
You're like putting on weight every
fucking Monte getting bigger and I keep

443
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:52,830
telling you to fucking do something
about it. I have a condition.

444
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,970
You have a condition. Where
is a commission? Me Bigger
and bigger every month.

445
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,890
I wouldn't have enough.

446
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:03,670
Okay.

447
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,940
Yeah, the laugh factory
fucking tweeted that out,

448
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,570
so I guess we got us announce it.
Yeah, I'm going to be a fucking right.

449
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,510
Wait gotta be parents,
everybody.

450
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,950
I'm so excited for us. Do you know
what it is? They don't give a shit.

451
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,963
I'm actually,

452
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,490
I think people have been people who have,
you know who you are.

453
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,480
We already tweeted a offline stay offline.
Don't become that person.

454
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,420
I feel like people care. Listen. Why?

455
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:32,900
Cause it's going to bring out all the
people who have nasty things to say about

456
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,190
it. No, because people have lives. But
people have been actually been very sweet.

457
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,140
What,
what

458
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,990
no,
you know is you're watching those fucking,

459
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,200
those lady screaming at each other too
much and the ones where they sit around,

460
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:47,210
you know, it was one of the funny
things I saw lately. It was when you,

461
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,840
you had the fucking Kardashians
on what the sound down? Yeah.

462
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,160
So much of the footage as them just
looking at each other with their fucking

463
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:59,660
mouth kind of open like slack
jawed because someone else
is talking over the top.

464
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,850
Just going, I just feel like when
Mandy said to sandy that she, you know,

465
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:09,660
she couldn't go during the nose job trip.
I felt that she was upset and we,

466
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,520
as the person's talking, they just cut to
their faces. They're like, dude, I can't,

467
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:15,770
it's official.
They look like those little pouty cats.

468
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,880
Okay. Let me know. Okay, what the heck.

469
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,080
I don't know what that had to do.
I don't know.

470
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:25,140
I just want you to turn this
into a Kelly rip a moment guys.

471
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,930
And this is what were just
makes me feel like, you know,

472
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,140
I'm starting to understand why
Michael Strahan left that show.

473
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,500
Um, so anyways, yeah, it's official.
It is confirmed. All right.

474
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,320
No it is and I'm,
and I'm just going,

475
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,610
I'm not going to one of
these fucking assholes.

476
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,780
You're very, no, you're like,

477
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:49,350
you're grudgingly talking about
it and I understand why. I know,

478
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:53,730
cause I fucking hate parents.
You hate math. I hate it. Why?

479
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,580
[inaudible] is just the
hardest fucking job,

480
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,610
the most rewarding job. Like
Blah, blah blah. And you know,

481
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,740
and then they all say it,
they all fuck.

482
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,900
Even like chuck Yeager would
say some shit like that.

483
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,140
It's like really dude flying
a fucking jet up into space.

484
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,650
Like trying to get a kids fucking
backpack on for first grade is,

485
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:14,890
is more difficult than what the
fuck he just went through up there.

486
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,730
You know what I mean?

487
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,570
I think that they placate to fucking
isn't the right word to Joe Sixpack where

488
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:20,380
they gotta be

489
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,060
little heroes, panda, panda. They're real
people are the real heroes out there.

490
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:27,010
The people out there,
they're there. They're,

491
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,810
they're baking the tuna fish sandwiches,
cutting it into four fucking pieces.

492
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,840
You had sex and you didn't use
protection. That's what you did. Now here,

493
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,630
you're right.

494
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,630
You're not Tom Hanks pretending to
land a fucking into the Hudson river.

495
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,300
Okay. You did. It's not exactly
the miracle on the Hudson.

496
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,000
So all Billy booze bag's going to get a
couple more rights and lefts in before

497
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,120
the little, the little one comes. And then
I'm going to be, I gotta be, I gotta be,

498
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,010
so I've got to pick my spots.
Is that,

499
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:03,160
is that the idea is that's what's been
happening that you've just got to go on

500
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,220
like a little bit of a bender.
The,

501
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,380
I've been on a bender the whole fucking
year and then when the baby comes,

502
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:11,650
you're going to just like cut yourself
off. Yeah. I mean, what am I doing?

503
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:15,040
Maybe fucking hung over and we'll
be that guy. No, I hope not.

504
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,720
Yeah. No, I'm not going to do
that. Now that's over. It's done.

505
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:22,790
But then I got all this great hooch back
at the house, so I got, I got us kill it,

506
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,570
kill it before it comes. You have to like
drink all the alcohol before the baby.

507
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,950
It's not like you're
never going to happen.

508
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,500
Do I gotta make space for like fucking
sippy cups and shit though? Not Word.

509
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:39,340
A word. A wordle suck in my bottles
down. They're not going to go on the bar.

510
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,420
You don't have to worry about
making sport. You know what?

511
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:47,440
I'll save some of my pappy van winkles.
We had more than most spoiled kid ever.

512
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,340
When the baby's teething, I'll
rub pappy van winkles on. It's on.

513
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:56,050
It's fucking gums. Isn't that what
you're supposed to do? I Dunno.

514
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,090
I Dunno. I like that.
That's an old school thing,

515
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,730
but I'm already going to do this shit.
Like every time the kid cries,

516
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:02,780
I'm not fucking going in the,
I'm going to,

517
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,880
there's this great book that I read
on Norwegian parenting that says that,

518
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,100
you know, when the kid starts crying,
he just, it just kind of, you know,

519
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:15,650
you creep up to the bed and then
you kind of look and he just go hi

520
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,813
and then that's it.

521
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,420
You scare the shit out of it and
it understands what's going on.

522
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,960
You're making fun of, when I told
you was in the book that I'm reading,

523
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,700
by the way, it's 29 24 fucking Washington
Bay just score. This is a great kid.

524
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:33,340
This might just be one of those
old San Diego Charger Games.

525
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,830
Are you watching the football game
while you're doing the podcast? I Dunno.

526
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,400
I just thought that's not a push in the
back. Get the fuck out of here. Anyways.

527
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,170
What were we talking about?
Oh, you're having a kid.

528
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm probably the biggest moment in our
relationship ever. Nobody did. Well,

529
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:53,190
let's see what happens.
Yeah,

530
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:55,780
so we've been going to like
fucking lamaze classes and shit.

531
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,500
She's fucking Christ.
The classes have been great.

532
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,900
The classes have been
great, but this, this,

533
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:04,660
this is how far the fucking
progressive left has gone,

534
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,310
is a fucking line for when she comes in.
It says, mom, will you sign up in me?

535
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:12,580
I'm thinking finally name of mother,
name of mother and then I'm like,

536
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,510
and then my column like I'm finally going
to be called a dad after almost living

537
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:19,930
on this planet for half a fucking
century and it just says partner

538
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,320
fucking ridiculous.

539
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,920
And what kills me is everybody
in their heterosexual,

540
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,330
all in a fucking relationship.

541
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:31,750
Everybody there was was there was all
straight couples, straight couples in.

542
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:35,680
All the dads were there.
Yeah, yeah, that's true. And
then she just keeps going.

543
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:38,950
Coaches, coaches, calling them
coach. I swear to God, Dude,

544
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,970
I'm to show up with a
fucking whistle next week.

545
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,700
No fucking bill Bellacheck Hoodie and
shipped the fuck are you talking about?

546
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,990
She said she probably, she's probably
going to get in trouble. She said Dad's.

547
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:53,360
Why his last class?

548
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,780
I didn't hear it too busy muttering under
your breath about every time she says

549
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:02,240
coaches,
I say fathers or fathers.

550
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm not trying to cut out gay people
or people who got bag behind a fucking

551
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,270
Carl's Jr. You know what
I mean? But what about us?

552
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,100
That's the solution. I
thought it's inclusive. He's
supposed to include people.

553
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,480
I'll take second and third billing
behind a alternative people.

554
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,860
What did you think of that?

555
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:23,420
I'm birthing video that we
watched the last glass. Oh,

556
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:26,840
Paulie's a placenta.
That was tremendous.

557
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,980
I don't know.
I don't even know why I'm there near.

558
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,270
It's all going to go
out the fucking window.

559
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,730
The doctors and nurses are
going to tell you what to do.

560
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,270
I'm just there for your fucking
yell at me. It's so fucking stupid.

561
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,060
If I was going through
gallbladder surgery or whatever,

562
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,870
you would not be in there holding
my fucking hand. It's so dumb.

563
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,690
This is just classic you guys.
You know you got,

564
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:51,110
you got the shit end of the stick on
this thing and somehow you figured out a

565
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:53,570
way to drag us in there.
I'll tell you right now,

566
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:57,290
I'm staying in north of that fucking
sheet and when that guy comes in and goes,

567
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,480
hey, you want to hook up
your own cable? No I don't.

568
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,060
That's what the fuck I'm paying you for.
I don't want you to be below the,

569
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,500
the blanket below deck.

570
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:10,070
You don't need to be full
on that performance problems
for the next three months.

571
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:13,250
Cause I keep picturing my kid's
head coming Outta your twat. No,

572
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,170
I'm not doing this.
I shouldn't be in there.

573
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,880
My fucking in mash you
that after you said,

574
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,050
after you watch the movie,
you leaned over to me and he said,

575
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:28,270
I understand now why the guy
is an heir. You did? Yeah.

576
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,180
They get yelled at. No,
that's not what it was.

577
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,330
It was to provide comfort. You're
killing my fucking image here. Okay.

578
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,390
Don't stop showing your image.

579
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,770
Fuck urea image. No. So I'm
gonna. I want to be, yeah,

580
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,720
going to be a sober dead,
but on the road hobo time ripping it up.

581
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,220
Oh, it's just like every other
comic out there. You fucking heck.

582
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,700
I told you my last podcast.

583
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,690
I was going for a Boston accent word and
I realized that I was going to get in

584
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:08,840
trouble if I set it so that I had to
switch the concert. I was like, oh,

585
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,170
I'll talk to you. Liddy
Oh fuck yeah. Cool.

586
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:19,040
Fucking bed merely looks at me. He's
like, quants. I was like, it's a new day.

587
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,650
I'm going to get in trouble. If I say
to me, I don't mean anything by it,

588
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,960
so yeah.
Anyways,

589
00:35:25,961 --> 00:35:29,840
don't end up like Kanye and never
everybody be mad at you. Oh,

590
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,110
he's going to be fine.
He knows what the fuck he's doing.

591
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,940
He was yelling. I mean, it'd
be honest with you, I don't
understand shows. Anyways,

592
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,000
there's no band.

593
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,210
Everybody's standing with their cell
phones on and there's somebody a wrapping

594
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:47,610
and then they're just sticking them.
I it's, it's, it's for young kids.

595
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,290
They love it and I'm not
going to go. They're like,
hey, you think this is music?

596
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,600
I'm not going to be that guy I got right.
Stay away from them.

597
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,170
I'm going to go see Casablanca in
the rain with a bunch of old people.

598
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,000
By the way, Nia. Yes. Did you
see during the break, those
old people trying to walk?

599
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,170
Holy fucking shit.

600
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,350
I cannot stress stretching and getting a
massage if you can afford to do it once

601
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:13,620
a month. Oh Jeez. That was
a hunched over beeble yeah.

602
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:16,650
A lot of people roughly my fucking
age too. Haven't limps and shit.

603
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:20,400
Like what the fuck did you
guys do? You know, look,

604
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:22,300
some of them probably fight a fucking war.
Who's kidding who?

605
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:24,120
But I'm just saying generally speaking,
you know what I mean?

606
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,440
I know maybe we should give them a rank.
So they didn't all fight a fucking war,

607
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,630
you know what I mean? They weren't all
on the front lines is what I'm saying.

608
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:33,320
A lot of those people peeling potatoes
and they're still fucking limp,

609
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,420
but that makes no sense.
All right, let me, um,

You're stepping into a better
day. Think about it. Underwear.

647
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,920
It's the first thing you put on
in the last thing you'd take off.

only thing they have on, you know,

655
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,420
that's not true.
You just don't have a shirt.

656
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,100
There has been times where you just
have on a tee shirt, isn't it? Anyways,

657
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,740
why would you settle for anything less
than the best feeling underwear on the

658
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:33,460
planet? Well, because maybe you
have different priorities. I Dunno.

662
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:42,760

My friends at me,

663
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:47,110

You can't set the alarm.
Okay.

699
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,010
It's a nice extra layer of protection
to now simply safe is there.

MVMT watches pronounced movement was
founded on the belief that style shouldn't

726
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:20,120
break the bank. Yeah, you should listen
to this. Yeah. What they just said.

727
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,020
This means you spend too much fucking
money. You know exactly what it means.

728
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:28,040
So don't play dumb with me.
What are you calling me?

729
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,130
And he had to attack me.
I that was like what?

730
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,490
You can create the advertising thing. I
was going to come back when you're a ton.

731
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,020
Yeah.
And I suddenly show me.

732
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:39,500

pull the emergency brake and down here we

733
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:43,280
are. Everybody knows. Once again,

Right. That watch that I have, by the way,

755
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,350
I didn't say you did.
He just taken the bait and the,

756
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:19,600
I'm just breaking your fucking
ovaries over there. Um,

757
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,930
what does the score to the fucking game?
I'll just show them the highlights.

758
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:24,830
All right. Hey there,
Billy clairvoyant. Uh,

759
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,510
you probably didn't notice this because
I doubt you'll you listen back to your

760
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:30,390
own podcast,
but there have been throwback parallels.

761
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:33,270
I actually listened to my podcast is I
upload them. I just listening to them,

762
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:38,340
you know, I don't know why I do. He
loves the sound of his own voice.

763
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:43,140
Um, that's not true. I've learned to love
it when you first hear your own voice,

764
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:45,210
you don't like it.
Now I can't live without it.

765
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,370
I walk around with headphones in my
house just listening to my own podcast.

766
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,980
When Andrew cuts together the clips, he
uses the same date from eight years ago.

767
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,600
Last Thursday was from November
17th, 2008. Oh, he told me
he does it. That's cool.

768
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,250
He said in that episode you made a
reference to cash cab, which was hosting,

769
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:10,050
which was hosted by your guests this week,
Ben Bailey, also a couple of weeks ago.

770
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:12,570
When you first mentioned
watching Westworld,

771
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,560
the throwback clip had you mentioned
the original Westworld once again,

772
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,900
eight years ago to the, to
the day. Yeah, that back then.

773
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,020
That's what I wanted to buy the rights
to it until I realized it was zillions of

774
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:26,540
dollars. And I was like, oh, forget it by,

775
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,760
by everybody and all. I had in my
whole representation all excited. Like,

776
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,930
is he going to do something like this? We
can get a piece of this. And I was like,

777
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,810
oh, that's too much money. Um, he said,

778
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:40,320
I'll be on the lookout for more of
these and hopes to exploit your magic.

779
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,760
Love you love Nia. Well, that's
all. I love you too, boo.

780
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,580
That's all due to, um, what's his
face? Uh, Andrew. Andrew, like,

781
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,220
I think he tries to find like the
parallel, so that's his homework,

782
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,900
not mine. All right. Thanksgiving
recipe a there Billy White meat

783
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,610
and I liked it. Billy White
Paper, the other white meat,

784
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,780
the other white meat a
there, Billy White meat. Uh,

785
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:08,760
what are you going to
teach us to cook this year?

786
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,970
If I don't get another cooking video?
Like the pie crust masterpiece.

787
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,860
I'm boycotting the season.
I'm the single one of my siblings.

788
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:20,610
And last year I showed up with a Pi and
waited until everyone was done to let

789
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:21,510
them know I made it.

790
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,040
Then I showed them your Wii video and
we had some full fully belly last full,

791
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,130
I think full belly laughs is what you
want to say. Uh, don't let me make a,

792
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,140
don't let me make,
let my family down.

793
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:35,230
Don't let me let my family
down by letting me down. Okay.

794
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,990
Thanks for all the free labs. Um,
hearing you get through that. So I know

795
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,060
my eyes are always 10 words ahead
of what I can fucking remember.

796
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,730
I think that's what happens.
So maybe I'm just dumb. Um,

797
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,710
it's going to be sad when our
kids, a better reader than
me. Fucking six months in

798
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,980
her baby's going to teach you how to read.
It's going to read you a book.

799
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:03,220
And Maya, I, whenever I've read
to like my nieces and nephews,

800
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:05,980
like there's a point when they stopped
looking at the book and they just turn

801
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:09,700
around and look at me and then it's like
more pressure at him and I'm literally

802
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:14,200
reading like the rabbit
goes, hop, hop, hop, hop.

803
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,190
It doesn't go hop. It
hops. A cow goes moo.

804
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:23,130
And maybe that helps you out
there. Fucking old and bald. Um,

805
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,810
well I feel like last year,
like making a pie crust,

806
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:28,630
it was like a real fucking
skill that I had. Like,

807
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:32,830
I don't know what else to show you
guys, how to make, um, you know,

808
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:36,760
if Nia lets me get this fucking
griddle that I want to get, Oh my God,

809
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:40,930
this great old, oh my God, this fucking
griddle. It's like you love when I Cook,

810
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,880
but you don't want to be, you don't
want to, you know what I mean?

811
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,330
It's like you like your freedom,
but you don't want to see how it happens.

812
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,220
You're the same way with food. You know
touchdown fucking Redskins. God dammit,

813
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,550
because I don't know what,
what are you trying to do here?

814
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:57,450
You're trying to get like every fucking
invention that has to do with cooking or

815
00:48:57,451 --> 00:49:02,280
grilling or smoking or frying.
You want to buy it and it's just like,

816
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:04,260
where are we going to put all this shit?
Okay,

817
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,940
let's list all the shit that I've bought.
I'm not saying that you bought it all.

818
00:49:08,941 --> 00:49:10,470
I'm saying that you want to buy it at all.

819
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,330
Why? I do want to buy it all
and why haven't I bought it all?

820
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,200
Because there's no room for it.
Oh, and who determined that?

821
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,440
I mean, oh, another Ms Dexter point.

822
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,990
Who determined that Nia, I you decided
that? I thought it was a mutual. Yep.

823
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,890
Wasn't all right.

824
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,600
I had a buddy of mine was going to hook
me up with this smoke up pellet smoker,

825
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,740
you said? No. Okay.

826
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:40,400
Well because he tried to act like
he told me it was a size of a,

827
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,630
of a typewriter and then we'll be a solid
and when he actually showed it to me,

828
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,280
he was like, come here, let me show you.

829
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:49,220
Let me show you what it looks like
and then I looked at it and I'm like,

830
00:49:49,221 --> 00:49:53,840
and what universe is this? The size of a
typewriter? It's the size of her. I said,

831
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:56,420
it's a sewing, like a sewing
machine. He goes, oh yeah, yeah.

832
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:59,440
It's more like a sewing machine. I'm
like, a sewing machine is on a typewriter.

833
00:49:59,480 --> 00:49:59,720
Okay,

834
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,330
tell you something there.
That's why guys are great.

835
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:06,320
That's why I love that dude
forever because you know
we do that for each other.

836
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,140
I don't know if women do. I want to
speak for you guys, but guys do that

837
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,300
for each other. It was a
site. It's the size of a wall.

838
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:16,360
You need a kitchen the size of his
kitchen in order to do all the things that

839
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,194
you want to do.

840
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,330
Yeah, portable thing. It's on
fucking wheels. It's in the back,

841
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,260
but we got like three fucking tables in
the backyard and I can't get rid of any

842
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:30,190
of those tables for the
fucking potato salad. You know,

843
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,360
every piece of furniture I put in the
backyard has a function and we have used

844
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:39,220
it in that function. That doesn't make
any sense, but you could also mean no,

845
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:39,731
you're,
you're,

846
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:43,630
what you're doing is you've become
the dictator or the fucking backyard.

847
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,350
You're the woman. I own the
backyard. I own the fucking garage.

848
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:50,500
If we had a basement, that's my shit. You
can have the rest of the fund can house.

849
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:56,140
All right, so what is saying? I'm
saying I'm getting that griddle.

850
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,153
Okay.

851
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,213
Yeah.

852
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,110
All right. Well, I have
Jesus Christ. Yeah,

853
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:07,820
you're going to hear him say that until
I fucking make you a nice fucking steak

854
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:12,821
and cheese or make some hash browns
or make a grand slam breakfast gains.

855
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,040
You've been making all of
those things without the grid
because it guy, right? So,

856
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,080
exactly. So what do you need all this
other stuff for if you're so talented?

857
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,210
Because just imagine how good it would
taste if I actually had a fucking griddle,

858
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,130
even though it's fucking
stoves that have a griddle.

859
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,970
If the thing sucks because it's,
it's one heat source, so you can't,

860
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
you can't have difference. He can't move
it around. You can't play with your heat.

861
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,930
It sucks. It's like this
is the temperature. It's
a pain in the fucking ass.

862
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,920
It's one thing if you've got a pot or
a pan, you can take it on the heat,

863
00:51:43,921 --> 00:51:45,910
take it off,
but when you're on your fucking Gretel,

864
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:48,520
you know you want one on one off
and maybe one a little bit on.

865
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,670
Why don't you just get one of those old
little electric grills at the little,

866
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:56,500
the little way a freshman in college.
Once you can put on your counter, well,

867
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,060
when you divorce me. Oh, that's too
sad to say. If you ever do that.

868
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,271
Do you ever do that?

869
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:06,200
And I'll do everything that it can be
as a grown fucking man to buy divorcee

870
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:10,940
kitchen products. Fuck. Are
you talking about divorce?

871
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,230
I'll go to Mcdonald's and grab some extra
packets of ketchup for in the future

872
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:19,150
when I need more ketchup. I've done all
that. Nia, I've used shares for tables,

873
00:52:19,151 --> 00:52:22,610
ate pasta all fucking day, had pancakes.
I've done all that. I've done this.

874
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,890
We know. Yeah. Yeah. Yo, you sick of my
self made man. Shit, that annoys you,

875
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:31,810
doesn't it?
I would eat spaghetti with prego and,

876
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:35,350
and the bread because we fill me
up and it will last me all night,

877
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,610
do all my spots and I would eat pancakes
because it kept me the most full like

878
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,840
cement. And you know how I'm doing
that for the fucking people out there.

879
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,130
Women included.

880
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:49,030
Go on to be one to fucking make something
happen and food's a big thing cause

881
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:52,470
you got a fucking habit every day. She
got to have that shit that fills you up.

882
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,200
Right? Listen, don't let this little ray
of Sunshine fucking rain on your parade.

883
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:59,800
Okay. I'm here for all you
guys. I'm the positive guy.

884
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,510
I'm the motivational speaker.
Hey,

885
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,510
speaking of motivation of what the
fuck's going on with the P90x guy,

886
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,680
do you become a Vegan or something? Well
first of all, he's not too P90x anymore.

887
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,520
He's got a dick thing late night.
Yeah. Yeah. But now Tony Horton,

888
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:14,830
he's looking a little like,
he's not doing his pull ups anymore.

889
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:19,010
He's getting older. He's looking like, um,

890
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,990
I dunno. He's looking
all veggie. Hmm. Anyways,

891
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,480
so I don't know what I'm going
to make this year. I told you.

892
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,380
Oh, you mean for the people? For
this guy. Yeah. Yeah. You want me to,

893
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:35,910
I'm not showing my family secret family
fucking recipe of the best stuffing

894
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,070
you're ever going to have admitted.

895
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:41,170
Most people stuffing fucking
sucks stuffing that bill.

896
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:44,130
Maggs oh my God.
It's so delicious and I've never had good,

897
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,970
that's the only stuffing I've ever
had that even like it. Me Too.

898
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,800
I don't ever like stuffing.
I don't roast.

899
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,940
It was wet and it already
has a bad aftertaste. Yeah,

900
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,680
this is nice and crispy and like buttery.
Oh, it's so good. Yeah. When you got,

901
00:53:56,681 --> 00:54:00,070
you got that fucking barbecue the other
night. You didn't like the corn bread.

902
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:04,180
They put that weird ingredient in there.
Ah,

903
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,070
bumble you so and so. Read
another question. Dammit.

904
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,840
When the fuck did I
become such a packers fan?

905
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,840
This is certain old NFL teams I like.
I see like the giants.

906
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:20,420
Can you fucking believe that if the
what they did to my patriots twice, um,

907
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,560
one flew over the cuckoo's nest. All
right. Hey, they're all Billy bibbet.

908
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,390
Um, it's funny who's vivid?
It was a character in one
flew over the cuckoo's nest.

909
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:31,853
Oh Shit.

910
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,330
What's his face downstairs here and old
friend of mine has gone so far down the

911
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:42,800
rabbit hole of conspiracy theories that
he really can't even function in society

912
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:47,120
anymore. Oh, that's relatable.
Tell him to start telling jokes.

913
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,110
Ease.

914
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:53,110
He is unable to hold a conversation for
two minutes without going off on some

915
00:54:53,271 --> 00:54:57,950
rambling horse shit about chem
trails, Freemasons, aliens,

916
00:54:57,951 --> 00:54:59,030
and all of that crap.

917
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,290
Completely oblivious to the fact that
none of us are interested in hearing about

918
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:07,100
all that nonsense he reads on the
Internet. It used to be funny,

919
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,110
we were driving out west a few years
back and he pointed out at some lights

920
00:55:12,111 --> 00:55:16,520
moving up in the sky and said, those
are the aliens that follow me around.

921
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,640
Oh, this sounds like a
mental issue, dude. I said,

922
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,740
what does that sign on the right said?
He said, airport next sex, exit it.

923
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:28,040
And I said, yeah, those are airplanes.
You check. Yes. And he said,

924
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:31,790
well, maybe some of
them. Wow. He goes, okay.

925
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:35,360
It's been over a decade of that
kind of Shit. And it's gotten way,

926
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:39,110
way worse because of this obsession
and the resulting paranoia.

927
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,820
He can't even hold down a menial job. And
all of his friends have abandoned ship.

928
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,580
He become addicted to painkillers. I
think he already had a mental issue, man.

929
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,460
Yeah,
of course.

930
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:53,000
Has Been in and out of rehab centers
in hospitals because of bizarre health

931
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:56,750
problems and is now bordering on
full blown schizophrenia. Well,

932
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:59,270
you don't get that from reading
conspiracy theory, sir. Yeah.

933
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:02,990
You really kind of did a fucking
thing right here with that question,

934
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,050
that whole thing in the beginning,
which is like a red herring.

935
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:09,800
It turns out he's got like serious
mental problems. What's a red herring?

936
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,230
It's just, it's just a
distraction. Exactly.

937
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,380
It's something that you think
is the cause of, you know,

938
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,830
I'm not explaining it right,
cause I'm tired, but oh,

939
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,560
I gotta use that excuse sometimes when I
use an expression that it can, oh Jesus,

940
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,480
my brain mush
Christ.

941
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,670
How many points does fucking Aaron
Rodgers got to put up? You know,

942
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,620
it's like Tom Brady,
same thing.

943
00:56:34,621 --> 00:56:36,660
How many fucking points is you get a
score at the end. It's gonna, you know,

944
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:37,830
defense.
Um,

945
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:41,880
I want to respect his right to
believe what he wants to believe,

946
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,870
but in the end it has only caused him
to lead and increasingly miserable and

947
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:50,160
lonely life that will end in a tragedy
and a sparsely attended funeral unless

948
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:51,450
something changes soon.

949
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,380
So how the fuck do you bring someone
back from so far over the edge? Okay,

950
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,230
well he might be exaggerating a
little bit with maybe he's using,

951
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:02,970
schizophrenia is like a fucking filler
word. They're like, you know, this guy,

952
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,110
narcissists, guy's a sociopath, but sounds
like paranoid schizophrenia answers.

953
00:57:07,111 --> 00:57:08,490
Exactly. Oh, Dr. Hill.

954
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:13,320
Or you're going to diagnose that on this
fucking fucking email. Unfortunately,

955
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,870
a member of my family who
went through this exact thing,

956
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:19,980
I do feel that I recognize it a little
bit. Yes. As a matter of fact, I do. Okay.

957
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:23,970
But do you feel like that you can make
that diagnosis as someone who is not a

958
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:25,470
doctor? No, of course not.

959
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:30,471
A comedian is not even a podcaster that
you can on a podcast done by a comedian

960
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:32,670
as not a doctor.

961
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:37,110
Diagnose this person that you've never
met based on this four paragraph email to

962
00:57:37,111 --> 00:57:40,500
come in here. So I'm giving my
opinion. You're going to start a song.

963
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:45,570
You asked me to come here.

964
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,080
Are you annoyed that that lady
singing about all the ingredients,

965
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,100
you get annoyed when black shit goes
fucking mainstream and then white people

966
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:58,050
ruin it? Well, I got peas, greens,
tomatoes, potatoes. That she,

967
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,303
yeah,
that thing.

968
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,950
I swear to God if, if that's what my
whole week long run before everyone else.

969
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:12,280
That was my,
my church was like I would,

970
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,180
I would go every week if it was
only a half hour long. I still see,

971
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,630
I just can't get into the fucking,

972
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,290
I liked to sing and
part of black churches,

973
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:23,680
but even when the priest,
regardless of race,

974
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:27,250
when they get up there and they start
saying that this invisible guy gives a

975
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:31,890
shit about me, that's, I just, I tap
out. I just can't listen to it. Anyway,

976
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,900
he wants,
he teases tcis she hair that.

977
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,420
That's the second flat screen
downstair friend needs per chill stuff.

978
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,560
You're not going to be a, I like
Jola state. He's a very positive guy.

979
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,571
Well you know something,

980
00:58:45,571 --> 00:58:48,360
he's been out there long enough that you'd
think if there was a scandal it would

981
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:52,050
come up. I know, right. Um, this,

982
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:56,070
your friend needs professional
help. This is beyond your, um,

983
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:00,300
this is beyond your pay grade.
Cheez its don't Shit on the guy.

984
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:03,420
He might have just been being funny
just because I'm not shitting on him.

985
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:04,111
I'm saying that you're,

986
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:07,860
his friend needs help and this is not
anything that he is qualified to do.

987
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,630
So because he listened.

988
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,900
Not much nicer way of saying the sanest
beyond your pay grade a buddy and she

989
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,170
get go pick up your
Broman keep sweeping up.

990
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:20,970
This is the job of people
with lab coats. Um, hold

991
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,250
on a second.
But what does he is he said like,

992
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,890
I respect his right to believe what he
wants to believe, but in the end that Dah,

993
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:31,830
Dah, Dah. Yeah. I don't, I don't even
think he necessarily maybe even believes,

994
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,830
believes that he's just
got, yeah, he's, yeah.

995
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,740
He's becoming into paying claims had
been in and out of rehab centers and

996
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,260
hospitals because of bizarre
health problems. Yeah.

997
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:43,290
He is now bordering on full
blown schizophrenia. Yeah.

998
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:45,000
I think you just gotta be there for them,

999
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:48,750
but maybe just check in on them and
say, Hey, are you taking your meds?

1000
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,620
Are you going to see your doctor?
That type of thing. But sure.

1001
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,660
I don't think you're going to be
able to like help him with this.

1002
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:58,880
It's all on you. Is that what
I decided to, yeah. Yeah.

1003
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,490
You know,
it's fucking cool as shit.

1004
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,840
The Redskins still have a band and
they actually have a team song.

1005
01:00:04,841 --> 01:00:08,600
I think that's fucking cool.
It's a professional level.

1006
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:13,370
For some reason that all went away. I
hope our baby doesn't get your add. Why?

1007
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:16,700
It's worked great for me. It has it. Yeah.

1008
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,850
Yeah, it has. Yeah.

1009
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,090
I played drums for helicopter still jokes

1010
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,070
add as far as a fucking great thing
to have. It's sucks with some shit,

1011
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:36,760
but it's gets,

1012
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,910
it sucks when you're in school and
you're going to do poorly in school and

1013
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,940
everyone's going to say you're fucking
dumb, but when you get out in the world,

1014
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:44,320
man,
it's fucking tremendous.

1015
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,263
It's tremendous.

1016
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,280
I know I run around all
day long having very,

1017
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:56,170
so you don't have it like severely though.
You are able to fucking, you just get,

1018
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,790
you know, even get the lab
glasses on tonight though.

1019
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,990
Just fucking diagnosed and everything.

1020
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:05,991
How do you know what I have at is
remember when we tried to do that add

1021
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:09,120
questionnaire and you couldn't
even pay attention long enough

1022
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,710
to answer the question you have a part of
that was because I was annoyed with it.

1023
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:18,820
You want to revisit that real quick? Do
an Oldie but goodie. All Right, Bill,

1024
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:23,280
my kid is 14 years old, 14 years old
and he wants a drone for Christmas.

1025
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:27,330
The drone market is huge with
kids these days. When I was a kid,

1026
01:01:27,331 --> 01:01:29,730
we want it to fly something
for the sake of flying it.

1027
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:33,510
Now they all have cameras attached to
them and they hover in a real creepy way.

1028
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,930
He's not a punk, so he won't
flip out if he doesn't get one.

1029
01:01:36,931 --> 01:01:40,230
His friends have them. So it's not
like he, he had never used one.

1030
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,950
If I did get him one and he's not the
type of kid to fly it up to someone's

1031
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:46,140
window.
So that's not the concern.

1032
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,400
I'm coming from a place like if I
didn't want him to get an earring,

1033
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,350
uh, more of, don't be that kid. I might be
overreacting, but that's just something.

1034
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,760
But there's just something about
drones. What do you think, uh,

1035
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:02,400
congrats on the condition.
Uh, thank you. Um,

1036
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,470
I would say, uh, I agree with you. No
drowns, no drones with the cameras.

1037
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:10,080
That's too much to shoot the
shit I would have fucking done.

1038
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,180
I would have the hottest
chick in the neighborhood.

1039
01:02:12,181 --> 01:02:15,720
I would have had it out there hovering,
hovering near a bathroom.

1040
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,560
Yay.

1041
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,000
If he's not, then his friends are going
to, his friends are going to be like,

1042
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:25,530
let's just take it over here and just see,

1043
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,980
and this is a thing,
you know,

1044
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:31,060
that the person watching is jerking
off if it immediately crashes.

1045
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:40,280
So kids are really using drone like that.
There are they is that the hot gift?

1046
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,840
This Christmas is a drone

1047
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:46,840
for a teenager. I mean it's,
it's an amazing fucking thing.

1048
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,250
It really is.
I mean,

1049
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:51,340
I can't imagine like just flying
over a neighborhood to see what your

1050
01:02:51,341 --> 01:02:54,820
neighborhood looks like from the air or
your house. All of that would be cool.

1051
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,310
But the, the, the possibilities,

1052
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,230
the shit that she could do
with those things, uh, in a,

1053
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:04,360
with the juvenile brain, I
don't know. I would be nervous.

1054
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,380
One of the best things my parents did
was they never let us play video games.

1055
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,680
They never let us play it. They
just, you're not getting that.

1056
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:13,160
It's going to fuck with the schoolwork.
You know,

1057
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:14,860
it's funny as I still fucked up in school,

1058
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:19,090
but the great thing is is I'm
not a fucking 48 year old gamer.

1059
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,320
You know like I just think that's,
that's really like a

1060
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,470
I, I, you know,

1061
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:29,140
I kind of judges that shit like
after a while like like what do you,

1062
01:03:29,141 --> 01:03:32,950
what are you doing? You know what I
mean? Which you want to go outside.

1063
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,170
Like the amount of time that people spend.
You could learn a language,

1064
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:40,560
you learn how to play an instrument is
I'm literally doing whatever you get

1065
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:40,981
delta is.

1066
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:43,740
You could go out and do the things that
I find interesting the fuck if you're

1067
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:44,940
into video games,
go ahead and play it.

1068
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,910
But I'm glad that I didn't cause I wasted
enough time watching fucking sports.

1069
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,700
I can't imagine because I told you I've,

1070
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,100
I've always said I tapped out
after grand theft auto three.

1071
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:54,120
It literally took over my life.

1072
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:58,680
I'm so sick of this fucking commercial
where they showed the Ford F-150 with the

1073
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:00,390
aluminum bed and it has,

1074
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,530
it doesn't have any bed liner and they
dropped the fucking toolbox into it and

1075
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:08,970
then they showed the Chevy with the steel
one. This is such bullshit advertising.

1076
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:09,711
What it's really is,

1077
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:13,230
is I bet the Ford gets better gas mileage
because it has a lighter bed and then

1078
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:16,680
all you do is just put that to the same
rubber guard that comes in all pickup

1079
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:16,981
trucks.

1080
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:20,090
What kind of a fucking asshole buys a
pickup truck and you don't have the bed

1081
01:04:20,091 --> 01:04:24,930
liner? The Fuck Outta here. Fuck Chevy.
Even though I like this Silverado.

1082
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,740
All right. Thanksgiving
debacle. Oh, Billy Turkey legs.

1083
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:33,690
Don't get your kid a drone if you don't
want them to have the drone. You're the,

1084
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:35,850
you're the parent. All right. Um,

1085
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:37,890
it wasn't another add moment
that I leave it there.

1086
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,480
I'm going a little debacle with

1087
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,660
lady

1088
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,780
about Thanksgiving.
I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving,

1089
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:49,500
but it starts like only
an hour before hers.

1090
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,490
I'm going a little bit of a dip
out for my lady about Thanksgiving.

1091
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,590
I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving,

1092
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:59,670
but it starts only an hour before hers,
but they're in the same time town.

1093
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:02,910
Mind you, mine's at my aunt's
house in hers. Is that her parents?

1094
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:07,170
Mine starts at 12 hers starts at one
30 I wanted her to come to mind for a

1095
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,610
little bit before hers,

1096
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:13,140
but she's not having it because
she's got to help her mom cook. Well,

1097
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:13,681
this is easy.

1098
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,490
So you just say you'll be over there
at fucking one 30 and you just going to

1099
01:05:16,491 --> 01:05:19,480
make an appearance, which you can make
it nutsy your family on Thanksgiving.

1100
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,630
He said, on one hand, I'm super
salty and want to be a huge in,

1101
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,490
want to make a huge deal
about this because I really
want her there and I think

1102
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:29,350
she's being selfish,
but on the other hand,

1103
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,840
I understand she's got to
help her mom cook and stuff.

1104
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,320
At least that's her excuse.
I know she loves her family,

1105
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:38,380
but it really pisses me off because
she's never been to my family shit.

1106
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,590
But I've got gone.
I've gone to plenty of hers.

1107
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:46,030
Hers offense is that she's never made me
miss any of my family gatherings to go

1108
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:50,590
to hers. But my family is a bunch
of nut jobs and you get the point,

1109
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,240
uh, old Billy burnt Dick. I
could use some words of wisdom.

1110
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,310
I am a huge fan. Thanks. And Go fuck
yourself. Happy holidays. Huge Fan. Well,

1111
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:05,311
I mean this is all you're doing
so you can undo all of this.

1112
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:06,883
All right.

1113
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,150
Yeah.

1114
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,920
You know, you just gotta put your foot
down. Just say, listen, I respect,

1115
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:13,050
I understand you've got to help
you mother cook. But I, you know,

1116
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:15,960
I want to see my aunt, my family on
Thanksgiving, so I will go over there.

1117
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,990
I'll be there over the for an hour.
All right.

1118
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:23,280
And then I'll be over here at one 30
in time to eat and if she has a problem

1119
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:27,980
with that, um, just ask her why
do you have a problem with that?

1120
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,820
This is perfect. I, I'll, I'll, you
don't have, you don't have to come,

1121
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,420
you don't have to come to, to, uh,

1122
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,840
my family of nut jobs as you say.

1123
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:41,880
And uh,

1124
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,070
yeah,

1125
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,660
she's trying to get out of going to your
families is what I'm wondering because

1126
01:06:47,661 --> 01:06:49,340
most people,
I feel like in the situation,

1127
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:53,030
you just split it up so she's
got to go help her family cook.

1128
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:54,563
Okay.

1129
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,130
You could go over there with
her while they're doing that.

1130
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,320
Talk to the dad of the brothers,
whatever.

1131
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:04,530
I don't know if they're going to be
cooking or whatever. Spend that time,

1132
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,520
have the meal and then the
two of you then go to your,

1133
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:13,290
your family's house for dessert and like
coffee and a movie or a game night or

1134
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,124
whatever.
Yeah.

1135
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:18,320
There's his starts early. It starts at 12
they're starts at one 30 so I'm saying,

1136
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,230
I just, I tell, listen, you go
over your mom's house, you cook.

1137
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:25,610
I'm going over my aunts from 12 to one
I'll be back at one 30 show up like,

1138
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:29,250
and then you show up at like one 40
you know what?

1139
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:31,460
I'm going to spend like an hour though.
That's nothing

1140
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,700
you cause you'd like the food isn't
going on the table right at swell.

1141
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,860
Everyone's going to like saunter and
around 1230 1245 sit down then eat.

1142
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,960
I would take it,
it's going to be there.

1143
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,110
This is what I would do. I would say this
deal, I'm going to there for an hour,

1144
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:49,200
then I'm gonna go to one 30. Right?
One 30, I'll be at your place,

1145
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:52,660
but next year we're going to my families.
This isn't even about like,

1146
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,890
I'm not going to like never see my
family on Thanksgiving again. Right.

1147
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,540
I would never do that to you.

1148
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:01,780
Are you saying I can't see my family
anymore on Thanksgiving? You just do that.

1149
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:01,960
Just

1150
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,330
go, yeah, go to his
families and just say, Hey,

1151
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:09,010
text me when you guys are about to like
sit down because she's going to cook and

1152
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:10,810
do all this other stuff.
So it was like,

1153
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:12,700
text me when you guys
are about to sit down.

1154
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,070
I'll let you know where I'm at
with my dinner and then I'll just

1155
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,760
come over there.

1156
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,760
And that's what he need to do is say it
totally calmly do not trasher do not,

1157
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:26,930
do not say anything insulting about
her family. Do not let her. Uh,

1158
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,550
and then when you stay calm,

1159
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,240
if she does that thing where she
then tries to bait you into a fight,

1160
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,530
do not take the bait.

1161
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:39,260
Just ask her why she's reacting
that way or just stay calm.

1162
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:45,020
Stay on target star wars. Right. You just,
you just make your points and that's it.

1163
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,710
Yeah, that sounds reasonable.
Well there you go.

1164
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,160
So you like how great the movie was
Casablanca and it was really nice.

1165
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,530
I finally understood the fucking movie.
I always got confused.

1166
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:57,980
I understood the love story, but I,
I didn't quite understand, you know,

1167
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:02,510
unoccupied France and the talking
and like Nazi Germany and shit.

1168
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:04,700
It's just like the taking over
your country and it's just like,

1169
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,130
I guess they hadn't there.
Their power hadn't

1170
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,140
gotten to that point cause it
was like Italian soldiers there.

1171
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:16,640
There was German soldiers and there was
fucking these, these German Nazi guys.

1172
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,580
I don't know.
I'll have to watch it again.

1173
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,140
I'd maybe read a little
bit of fucking history,

1174
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:24,020
but I actually understood the love
story this time. It was fucking great.

1175
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,110
How beautiful is that woman
too, Huh? Yeah, she's beautiful.

1176
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,680
She was like modern day. Beautiful too.
A lot of them back then or back then.

1177
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:33,110
Beautiful. You know what I
mean? Like, Hey, what'd he say?

1178
01:09:33,111 --> 01:09:37,900
They're fucking Ellis
island. She's a classic. Ah,

1179
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,570
ah, there she goes. There you go.

1180
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:46,190
Sleep and like a damn dog lately
because of your condition,

1181
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:48,780
because the main condition,
very tired.

1182
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,860
I think you'd be in a
jerk about it personally.

1183
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,940
They think you're being a jerk about
it. I'm not. Why is my fucking leg hurt?

1184
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:59,180
Oh my God. I'm going to end like those
fucking people in the orchestra pit. Just,

1185
01:09:59,181 --> 01:10:02,210
we'll fucking Lisi that one guy
was like 55 just sitting there.

1186
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,060
He looked like he just
fell off a motorcycle.

1187
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:12,410
Um, anyways. Well I'm glad you had a
good time. I hope you enjoy it because a,

1188
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,580
I'm watching all the rest of the football
Sundays from here on out is they empty

1189
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:21,050
the liquor cabinet. So is that our last
Sunday out? Is that what you're saying?

1190
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:24,740
Until, and I would like to do that.
I've been asked and I've been, uh,

1191
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,750
looking up museums and
shit on the download,

1192
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:31,280
trying to understand Armoury I never
understood it. I find that I, I like,

1193
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:34,450
uh, uh, I forget what period is,

1194
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,080
it's the van Gogh when the period out
to van Gogh. I liked that shit. Okay,

1195
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,340
that's cool. I liked that. The abstract.
I'm starting to understand that. Well,

1196
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:47,210
you don't need lines. You have colors
to suggest moods. It's like, all right,

1197
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:50,330
let's get shit.
I know it looks like a five year old.

1198
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:52,070
It's always going to look
like a five year old. Did it?

1199
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:54,470
What do you like modern art do you think?

1200
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:58,950
Or do you like the more old classic stuff?
Uh,

1201
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,430
like the van Gogh versus the Jeff
Koons. I don't know who, Jeff Koons.

1202
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:08,000
Andy Warhol. Andy Warhol was the
original hipster. His brutally,

1203
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:12,410
brutally fucking overrated. Ooh.
Heartache and was not a nice person.

1204
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,160
And what about basket? Yeah. Did

1205
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,720
you like basket? I like basket. It's not
the dude looks like saving and Glover,

1206
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:22,920
but he painted
safe young Glover.

1207
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:28,180
Wow. Oh my God. I haven't heard
that name in awhile. Uh, yes.

1208
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:31,170
He's sorta like the weekend
before he cut his hair,

1209
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,570
he was doing like an homage
to basket. Yeah. Yes. That's,

1210
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:38,070
that's the John Michel Basquiat. That's
the most modern person I listened to.

1211
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:43,880
Yeah. To the point I preordered
his next album. I know, I love it.

1212
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:48,350
I got it. I got the first two
songs. I want to hear it. Oh,

1213
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,390
he said listen to it after this.
Absolutely.

1214
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,740
As I fall asleep because of my condition.

1215
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,030
How far are we talking about my condition?
Not that much. Right. What do you mean?

1216
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,780
Like we're not going to get into all
like all the specifics. No we're not.

1217
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:05,730
I'm just, something's got the sacks and
all that pictures. No, none of that shit.

1218
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,760
It's just like the kitchen.
You just get to know it got redone.

1219
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:12,720
Just know that after I share enough,

1220
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:16,290
there's too many fucking Weirdos
on the fucking Internet. I don't,

1221
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:20,900
I do not understand people that post
pictures of their children, you know,

1222
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,510
because you get excited because there's
so going home address right above your

1223
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,910
fucking head for them,
for the family photo.

1224
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:30,180
Cause they're so cute and you just
want to like show off, you know.

1225
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,920
But I definitely understand
why we will not be doing that.

1226
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,061
All right.

1227
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:39,150
This is probably a conversation that
should have happened off of the podcast.

1228
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:43,800
All right, you fucking coolant bill.

1229
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,610
What the fuck did I do to my leg?

1230
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:49,910
I just laid down and I feel
like I hyper extended my,

1231
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,610
who is the
comedian?

1232
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,810
What's his name? You always
bring him up, Richard Kind? No.

1233
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:09,990
Uh, oh. Robert Klein. Robbery Gla.
Robert Klein. I can't stop my look.

1234
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:14,010
Very good. Look at you. See I wear, I
wear saving Glover. Then you hit me back.

1235
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:18,780
White style little Robert Klein. All
right, that's the podcast for this week.

1236
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:19,740
Go Fuck Yourself.

1237
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:24,470
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and I will
be checking in on you on Thanksgiving.

1238
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:27,780
No, you will not. You say,
well no, you will not. Listen,

1239
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,800
we're going to eat at one 30 I'm going
to do a podcast at 12 at my parents'

1240
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:35,310
house. Take. You can, you
can take Thanksgiving off.

1241
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:38,910
People understand Nia,
I believe you are.

1242
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:42,820
People said money never sleeps right here.

1243
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,250
24 seven. What are some of the
stupid shit they asleep? We grind.

1244
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,860
Yeah. I'll let dumb shit like,
like Bill Gates isn't doing that.

1245
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:57,030
You're going to do a podcast
on thanksgiving. What
is wrong with you? Well,

1246
01:13:57,031 --> 01:14:00,330
maybe you'll do it the day
before thanksgiving. That's
a big pet peeve of mine.

1247
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:03,490
When performers or talk about how
fucking hard they work, you know,

1248
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,150
and they take those pictures
of them where they lived,

1249
01:14:05,151 --> 01:14:08,380
they got their head down like
they're fucking exhausted, you know,

1250
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,370
and then he just said leads to
these fucking and posed compliments.

1251
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,390
You know that people would stop.
I feel like I'm just beginning.

1252
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,870
But that essentially what you're doing,

1253
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:23,980
if you're going to be working on
thanksgiving, no, nothing. No,

1254
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,080
that was a really weak way to try
to manipulate it back and the,

1255
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,410
I'm going to do it. So if you just,
you want to have the argument now,

1256
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:33,730
cause I'm gonna do it. I'm too
tired. There you go. Go to sleep.

1257
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,570
Seriously, you're putting on
a lot of weight and Oh my God,

1258
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:41,710
I'm not attracted to you right now.
I just don't understand what it is.

1259
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:47,560
That's not true. Don't say that. Yeah,
he just told me I look beautiful.

1260
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:52,060
I do look through. You still look great.
You're all fucking baby in my belly.

1261
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:56,940
You're all belly. So
anyways, all right. I'm uh,

1262
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,790
I dunno.

1263
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:01,360
I'm going to figure out how to make a
fucking pan into a griddle and make myself

1264
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:04,750
something because I'm an adult and I,
I can't fucking have a griddle.

1265
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,280
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
No, I'm getting that grill.

1266
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,760
I'm getting rid of those
fucking tables out there.

1267
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:13,300
There's too many fucking tables. Huh?
What do we have in the last supper?

1268
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:18,880
Is Jesus coming back right in our back
fucking yard and that longwinded do,

1269
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:21,630
she's going to sit there and [inaudible].
Good to do for you.

1270
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:26,590
I did the trashy Norman. Yes.
He trash in Jesus. Jesus.

1271
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:31,780
Is that, is that what county he
goes by? Yes. Easy. Hey radio.

1272
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:36,090
Fuck you.
Um,

1273
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,670
I want to get,
I'm going to get that big.

1274
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:42,470
I would just yelling
at a fucking what did,

1275
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,230
what would you call that when his
radio form of communication. Yeah.

1276
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:50,570
Yell at a form of communication and
then cancel a show at the fucking,

1277
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,940
he has to be a magic Johnson's
house. Fuck you. A Internet.

1278
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:58,860
You Internet on a string,

1279
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,180
but you ham radio.

1280
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,770
We get it. Kevin Hart's
funny. But, so, uh,

1281
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,190
I was a kid I saw in fucking
the new def jam, first of all,

1282
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:16,690
Tony Rock flushing it as a host.
Tony rocks a fucking star by the way.

1283
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:19,750
I remember years ago when he had a sketch
show my next to the guy fucking pop on

1284
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:24,550
it. He pops on TV. Robert, uh, I forget
his last name. You tweet or not? Tony?

1285
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:27,780
Not Tony Roberts. Tony
Roberts. I have no, no, no.

1286
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,110
The name of the comic that you liked,
you tweeted about him,

1287
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:33,370
his name is Robert something. Oh
yeah, he was fucking hilarious.

1288
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:37,030
Fucking hilarious and didn't give a shit
if the crowd liked him. He had that,

1289
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:41,290
the fucking Luther Vandross
joke. Oh my God. Yeah. I
don't want to ruin it, but uh,

1290
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,550
yeah,
just definitely check that out.

1291
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:45,900
Cause if that's how funny that shows is
that that show was back in a, in a, uh,

1292
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,360
a big way and it was great to see
Tony rocket and that Gig. You know,

1293
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,190
definitely deserving ending on a positive
note. That's right. Go fuck yourselves.

1294
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,850
I will talk to you on Thanksgiving
and that's stopping you hear in the

1295
01:16:57,851 --> 01:16:59,170
background.
We'll be near

1296
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,780
on approvingly supposedly making
stuffing. All right, go fuck yourselves.

1297
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:08,650
Have a great week. Great short week.
All right, and off to Wednesday night,

1298
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:09,890
the greatest fucking night ever.

1299
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,720
If you're a young man, right? You go
back to your hometown. What's his face?

1300
01:17:13,721 --> 01:17:17,390
The thrill ride. The thrill ride did a
great rant on that. Who? The trail ride?

1301
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:21,500
The one man fucking, oh yeah,
that guy. We'd that guy.

1302
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:25,520
That guy should be in the WWE. He's one
of the best people on the fucking mic.

1303
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,280
I forgot about him. Yeah,
he fucking said that.

1304
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:30,020
That's the night you go
back and all the women,

1305
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:33,820
you know you went to high school with
that she would more afraid to talk to and

1306
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:36,320
now you come back.
You got your little man mustache.

1307
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,950
You make something happened the night
before Thanksgiving for Thanksgiving.

1308
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,480
That's right.
Okay.

1309
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,310
I love Thanksgiving. You. I
love bud Thanksgiving and she,

1310
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,720
we just rub it in the fucking
English England's face, you know,

1311
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:53,740
take that. Right. But no,

1312
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,620
there's a lot of people in this country
that think it has to do something with

1313
01:17:56,621 --> 01:17:59,680
our independence with England.
I nothing to do with that.

1314
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:04,360
Well that's one of my favorite things to
do is I say that to fucking London ears

1315
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:09,010
and shit. All fucking one. I
forgot to bring up. There's a,

1316
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:13,080
I got to do another benefit.
Uh, speaking of that, um,

1317
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,650
a buddy of mine who did stand up when I
started out and then moved on to writing,

1318
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,010
uh,

1319
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:22,720
Pete coming such a great guy
unfortunately passed away.

1320
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:27,160
Uh, Oh God, a couple of weeks
ago. It was an absolute shock.

1321
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:31,750
He's like a fucking year older than
me, was in great health and just, uh,

1322
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,760
had a heart attack unfortunately.

1323
01:18:33,761 --> 01:18:37,960
So we're going to be doing a benefit
at the laugh factory on December six

1324
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,820
tickets will be going on sale soon.
I should probably know by a thanksgiving.

1325
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,920
But uh, he's got two beautiful
twin boys, the only 10 years old.

1326
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:52,030
And um, the great thing is
going to be all so great.

1327
01:18:52,031 --> 01:18:56,050
Was Jamie Masada put his name
up on the, uh, the marquee.

1328
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:59,170
I'll never forget that. He did that. That
was such a great thing that he did that.

1329
01:18:59,171 --> 01:19:01,090
Cause Pete hasn't done stand
up in a number of years.

1330
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:05,470
It was great that Jamie remembered
him. He's a great guide. Jamie Masada,

1331
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,260
he remembered them. He put
his name up there. And uh,

1332
01:19:08,261 --> 01:19:10,900
so there's a bunch of
Boston guys I haven't seen.

1333
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:14,250
We're all going to be on
the same fucking show. Um,

1334
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,820
and I'm trying to think like the last
time we all worked together like that,

1335
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:19,930
it was probably the fucking
cow loon about 20 years ago.

1336
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:21,370
So it's going to be a good reunion.

1337
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:26,050
We're all gonna be telling great
stories about, uh, p. And so, um, yeah,

1338
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,190
it's going to be December six,

1339
01:19:27,191 --> 01:19:29,890
and I'll get you guys that link as
soon as I get it. If you're in town,

1340
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:33,460
you'd like to have a laugh, uh, to
great cause. All right. That's it.

1341
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,190
They have Fuckos have a nice thanksgiving.
