00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,050
Are you filming? You just
taking a picture? What are
we doing? Why are you doing?

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,150
Oh, picture. Okay. I always get paranoid.

00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:30,330

wouldn't be like, you know,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,920

I just like say merry

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,870
Everybody to the program. Hey, what's up?
Yeah, they should have have laws there,

18
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:08,880
but we don't have the sound effects.
I have porn in minds mine album.

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,920
Do you know what I'm trying to go? Uh,
I'm trying to go to the month of December.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,590
No porn. No boots. Why no nothing.
Because I think it fucks you up.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,320
It does. It does. I, if I didn't have to,

22
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,180
if I didn't get up so late
and had to be here at one,

23
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,470
I would have jerked up before I came here.

24
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,280
But I realized I didn't have enough time
to get into it in the way I want it to.

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,240
Jesus, what are you fucking
become a character or something?

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,080
I'll watch that flare documentary was
talking about and the guy asked him,

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,300
how many times a day do you jerk
off? He goes twice. I was like,

28
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,090
that's about what I do.
Rick Flair said that? Yeah.

29
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:42,700
You saw the documentary you told?
I don't remember that part. Yeah,

30
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,770
he's went to a sports
psychologist and the guy was like,

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,310
so how many times a day you drink off?
He goes twice a, how much do you drink?

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,700
He goes, I have 10 beers and and five of
Buckos. That part I remembered it. Yeah.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Well he said that before. He said to a
jerking off stuff before that. Oh okay.

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,100
He goes everyday everyday. How long you
been doing that? Oh it was nice. Me Too.

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,410
I started in 72 boom.
Going back about 20 years.

36
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,050
That's impossible. He said
it's been a week with me. Yeah.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,840
I liked when they said they
were like your first wife,

38
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:17,950
how long you faithful to her and
he was like, Eh, about a day.

39
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,340
And they go, really? Cause I
couldn't do it. Couldn't do it.

40
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,150
I came home and he goes, I was
bored. I just want like to see a guy.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,560
It was great to actually just say how
fucking board he is being married.

42
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:34,050
Cause you know anytime you have a thought
of just any sort of like resentment of

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,660
your situation that you fucking created.
Right, exactly. I'd have to say I do.

44
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,490
You didn't have to do all that,
but you created it. You have that,

45
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,940
that feeling of like, fuck I want to
do this. You have like that guilt.

46
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:47,880
I loved his complete lack of guilt or
honesty. Honesty. Yeah. Honesty. Well,

47
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,350
why don't, why don't you tell the girls,
why do you say scream at your hotel? Eh,

48
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,650
no. Why don't you wear
your ring and uh, you know,

49
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,370
no one ever comes to the old tale.
Hey, y'all come to the hotel.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,940
I like that one when he was in the middle
of nowhere and there was no party when

51
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,750
he went back to the hotel he created
when he just created one spot,

52
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,630
like a hundred kamikaze. He's dancing
on the bar. It's just like, whew. Yeah.

53
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,480
Told you. Just blew out my fucking
years. Jesus. Let me turn this down here.

54
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,810
I'm speaking of woe flare impression.
Yeah, man, you got to go. There you go.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,090
Speaking of honesty, tell me
about Shira. You're special.

56
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,160
And I also like how you're doing it.
Like you're a,

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,730
you basically went where all
the specials end up anyways.

58
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,560
And so he just bypassed all the networks.

59
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,830
It's just like someone's going to
steal this and rip it in any ways.

60
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,130
So whatever the kids say. Um, what
did you just shot it yourself? No,

61
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:44,020
it's a bill for the fifth time was the
album, what is it? Oh, it's an album.

62
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,560
Oh, it's a CD. Yeah. Well it's not
a CD. It's just digital I guess.

63
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,610
And I have drop cars. Did I sell it after
my shows and stuff? Oh, all right. Yeah.

64
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,960
Sorry man. I don't do a lot of
interviews and I'm not a good listener.

65
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,510
There we go, Bill, for the last
time. I'm here about a benefit

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,650
when just special come out.
I just assume it's a comedian.

67
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:10,420
It's gotta be a special film.
Good at Gotham comedy club.
Uh, Memorial Day weekend.

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,530
Well, how do you film
an album? Well, right.

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,810
I recorded it at Gotham comedy
club one more day weekend, and I'm,

70
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,350
it's on all the little media platforms.
All right.

71
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,800
45 minute album. I have to ask
you the white guy question here.

72
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,250
You're wearing a Phillies hat. All right.
Now I've learned this with black people.

73
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,570
That doesn't mean you're a fan.

74
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,810
Do you have on Maroon sneakers or
do you really like the Phillies?

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,830
I just liked the hat. Oh, he
just liked the hat. I Buy,
I'm a Toronto Blue Jays Fan.

76
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:38,170
You might see me wearing a few
different Toronto Blue Jays ads.

77
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,240
And you have a baseball background,
correct? Yes. Chicago cubs. That's right.

78
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,940
You were right fielder,
I believe in the 56 round,

79
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:47,830
which they don't have that round anymore.

80
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,130
You would draft in the 56 round in the
scouting report on you as you could go

81
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:55,690
deep, but you couldn't hit a curve ball.
Yes. So what did you do to try to work on,

82
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,460
other than just guessing,

83
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,950
what did you do when you stepped
up to plate to try to get,

84
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,600
because there's no fucking
way I could ever hit a curb.

85
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,070
I was always hunting a fastball,
which is probably not a great,

86
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,040
well that's what a lot of hitters
do equal to adjust. But I just,

87
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,810
I think it was mental.
I though, wow, I wish,

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,870
I wish I knew about sports
psychology when I was playing.

89
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,440
I would have went to one because it
was totally mental. You had a mental,

90
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,790
like Charles Barkley's golf swing where
you guys to stop and then like Jon

91
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,050
Lester who can't throw to first base,

92
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,560
but he could throw a pinpoint fastball
and inside corner to a hitter,

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,200
but he can't throw it to first
base with those somebody up. Yeah.

94
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,300
He will not throw. It can throw.
You ever say, I'll just take, take,

95
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,400
take fucking throw.
Like,

96
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,120
like I dunno what like a God damn gorilla
on the lounge and the second they got

97
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,690
to throw it, they throw like
a little girl like, oh right.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,280
Are you all know if you remember
chuck Knoblauch he played for,

99
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,790
he was a gold glove second basement.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,620
All of a sudden he couldn't catch
anything and we couldn't throw,

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,360
you couldn't throw. What's
the yeah, he threw it.

102
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,980
He threw it was like hitting people fifth
row. Yeah. Steve Sax was the first guy.

103
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,440
Was that the guy? Yeah, the Yips.
Yeah. It's what they call it mental.

104
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,020
Because you was doing

105
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,480
it your whole life until now.

106
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,530
So did you ever hit the curve ball
hit a few curve balls. Bad ones.

107
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,110
The ones that don't break that
much. Oh, okay. But a good one.

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,230
And too many people get a good one anyway.
You're not going to hit if it,

109
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,750
Clayton Kershaw puts a good one on that.
You're not touching it. What's, uh,

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,130
anybody you ever go up against made it in
the big leagues? Yeah. Lando Hudson. Um,

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,490
he used to, he used the only show against
him. Well, he didn't, he didn't? No,

112
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,410
he didn't pitch. He was a player.
Oh, okay. Yeah, he was playing night.

113
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,560
Jacob Shumake uh, he got drafted first
round by the Toronto by Atlanta Braves.

114
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,880
And um, he didn't make it, he
got to $500,000 signing bonus.

115
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,050
And um, so you did all that Bull Durham
Shit riding around in buses and all that?

116
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,150
No, I didn't make it that far. I
released extreme training. Wait,

117
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,050
so when you get drafted by the cubs,
they saw you at high school. Like, wait,

118
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:50,210
what did he saw me in high school?
And then they, uh, they actually can,

119
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,490
scouts can actually get help.
You get into schools,

120
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,880
they call other schools and go, we
liked this guy. Um, matter of fact,

121
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,450
I got recruited by NC state from a scout.

122
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,540
They call schools and they, hey, get
this guy, we're going to look at them.

123
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
And then you go to the school
and then after your first season,

124
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:09,360
they either pick you up or they,
cause I was a drafting follows.

125
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,620
It's just nonstop pressure.
Yes. It's every time.

126
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,760
So then it's already bad enough if you're
in your head, if you're in a slump. Yes.

127
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,670
Now it's just like, fuck, I'm not
going to get picked up next year.

128
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,050
My dream is going to die.

129
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,200
So all of these other kids
that are walking around
going to keg parties, going,

130
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:28,280
mom, send more money and you're, and
you're literally going, my dreams.

131
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,070
Fucking dying. Right, right,
exactly. It, most people don't.

132
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,210
Most people that we don't know,

133
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:34,940
baseball is extremely
competitive and hard to play.

134
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,340
That's why there's a minor leagues.
There's no minor leagues for,

135
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,490
but it is a little bit for football now,
but that's not my,

136
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:43,580
at least with basketball and football,
he would just go right to the pros.

137
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,900
But baseball, you need constant
work from rookie ball or way to AAA.

138
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,980
Rookie ball is not even able yet.
Is that because it's the games that hard?

139
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,930
It's really that hard yet.
You mean you haven't tried?

140
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,210
You ever seen a 97 mile an
hour fast ball coming at you?

141
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,620
I like those people that go down to the
batting cages and they just sat it on 90

142
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,110
and they know what the pitches and they
keep going. Dude, I was hitting it.

143
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,840
Just catching up with this. It's
like, okay, yeah. All right.

144
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,050
Now let's actually put a brain behind
that fucking machine that has two other

145
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:12,020
pitches. Exams. There's a
million people watching.

146
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,320
A fastball was actually easy to hit.
It's the other stuff. Slider, curve ball.

147
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,390
You don't know what's coming. Sometime
it's if the you, he's what is what?

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,080
What exactly is a slider?
It's a [inaudible].

149
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,270
It's a Baltic slides to the left or
slides to the right. That's it and yeah,

150
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,540
that's not a curve ball. Curve ball drops
off the curve ball drops off the table.

151
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah. That's a slider.
They call it 12 to six,

152
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:35,450
where it really drops from 12 to six.
A bad Kershaw has a 12 to six.

153
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,060
Some people just have a little loop,
but a slider is a,

154
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,200
an a cutter is a fast ball that at the
last minute darks to the left at which

155
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,630
goes into your, uh, the handle
part and you break your back.

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,990
Like Marianna had greatest
cutter and it was just like,

157
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,990
can't they just guess and just going,

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,510
I know he's coming with the
cutter and just gasp because even

159
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,980
just little left
out of the way.

160
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,750
I met a guy one time who you
got split second too to play

161
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,013
giants,

162
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,260
any own fucking Tim Wakefield who was
a knuckleball pitcher and he goes,

163
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,080
I, this is a visual here. But
basically he go like, well,

164
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,340
basically his pitch did this and he
would make all these crazy were with his

165
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:22,230
hand and then go either
went here or there,

166
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,800
your knuckle ball is crazy.
He would just guess he would go hide,

167
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,630
I'm going to just swing here on this
one or I'm going to swing there.

168
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,480
And I'm ignoring all of this
bullshit between me and him.

169
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,510
And he actually was successful doing that.
Yeah, I remember the Yankees won years,

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,900
we're just looking at tape
against Wakefield and they
realized that most of his

171
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,950
knuckle balls were balls. So they got
well just don't fucking swing at it.

172
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:43,450
And then he started getting
behind in the count.

173
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:46,690
I think that's when he had to like every
once in a while throw like his idea of

174
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:47,760
like a fast ball.
Right.

175
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,720
But I always felt if I was
going to get to the big leagues,

176
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,120
like that's the way to, you know, if you
could somehow develop a knuckle ball,

177
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,000
cause then you're not
going to blow out your arm.

178
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,980
You can throw like 26 pitches like, you
know, crazy like Johnson 60 19 hundreds.

179
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:03,790
Yeah. What do you think? I know we're
not, I love sports. Who gives a fuck?

180
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:07,140
We know you're funny. Let's just, let's
talk sports here. What if, what if, uh,

181
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,470
what do you, how do you look at
those early 19 hundreds you know,

182
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:16,270
specials on that specialists, the
fucking records that people and baseball.

183
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,740
Yeah. Like when somebody, you know,

184
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,040
pitch 93 innings in two days,
that'll never be broken.

185
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
The Home Depot League is what I call it.
Well,

186
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,220
today's date is, uh, baseball
is different because, uh, it's,

187
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:35,510
the training is the proper preparation.
Those guys, they just, they just,

188
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,470
they just played like now did coddle
the, uh, the players, the pitchers,

189
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,320
like they only go six innings now.
Really good. They're like veal. Yeah.

190
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,490
Like back in the day they planned
to go nine and right now he'd go,

191
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:50,660
you go six in some five. I don't, that
means your bullpen has to be very good.

192
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,220
You know, if you don't have
a great bullpen. I remember
her talk over which, uh,

193
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,530
which was, which is a blast for
me and I hope they never do it.

194
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,470
That just tried to, okay, you go
three and as you go through, no,

195
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,530
you let Clayton Kershaw our goal,
as long as he can go.

196
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,750
And then you bring in the bullpen,

197
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,850
you don't let them go three and then
let your other guy go three, I guess.

198
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,270
What do you coach any baseball when
you're not doing stand up? No, no,

199
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,730
I'm going to put my son in the league.
Um, probably next summer. That's good.

200
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,960
You're going to keep him out of
football. Lacey, she didn't pick soccer.

201
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,090
I mean I was, soccer is gradually taking
over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. No,

202
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,740
you can't do, cause he
said, you know what?

203
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:27,470
She was basically saying the Joe Jackson,
him in baseball.

204
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,650
You're saying you're saying I
want my son to be a flopper.

205
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,270
That's basically I want it.
I think you have to,

206
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:38,900
you got to take like a drama class before
you play soccer or whatever the fuck

207
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:42,080
they call it. Overseas
football. My favorite one ever
is, you know, people say,

208
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,740
you know, what do you call it football?
Talking about American football.

209
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,450
There's somebody, I forget what
comedian said. This is like, well,

210
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:50,960
why do you call it football? Why
don't you call it feet ball, right.

211
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,970
Using both feet. Right.
You want to be a clever

212
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,810
because you're clever joke
right back at Ya. Right, right.

213
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,960
I actually would rather watch women's
soccer than men's soccer with just because

214
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,130
they just play,

215
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,240
they don't do all that fucking
flopping around and it's embarrassing.

216
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,470
I would literally, if that was my
son, I would walk out of the stadium.

217
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,150
I would stand up all dramatic,
like Glenn close in the natural.

218
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,860
I'd have myself backlit.

219
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,430
And so he saw me up in the stands and
he'd be all excited that he drew a fucking

220
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,010
yellow card and I would turn
my back on him. That'd be it.

221
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,860
That'd be the modern day version of
that story where the guy bricked up the,

222
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:27,540
the room that the kid
was in. Oh yeah, that,

223
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,000
no, no. But I, I watch the ID channel
Song. I mean, he, he, he locked his son.

224
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,080
He bricked up his son.

225
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,950
His son was supposed to go to
battle and he fucking chicken doubt.

226
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,850
So the guys came there and they were
like, yeah, you know, uh, your son,

227
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,980
and you said that it was like
the king or some shit. They go,

228
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:47,090
your son who you said was
brave, a fucking, you know,

229
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,260
he chickened out. And he said, bullshit.
No son of mine would do that. And they go,

230
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:52,940
yeah, he's right in that room. He goes,

231
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,550
I refuse to believe that
and to demonstrate it,

232
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,470
I will now have this room sealed off.

233
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,890
And he started bricking the room up and
he got all the way up to the last brick

234
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,850
and then the pussy was on the other side.
He went though,

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,830
I don't want this and
that. Oh, this happened.

236
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:11,240
And to Honga Orange County or something.
And uh,

237
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,330
he goes brick it up now.
It was that to put the last brick in.

238
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:18,040
And that was at the dude done. They
found skeletons with powder bunk to it.

239
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,980
It wasn't. Now it's a, it's a
fable. I wasn't a real Jesus.

240
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:25,270
How crazy do you think white people
are? Crap. [inaudible] think we are the,

241
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,490
we can break our kids up in a
famine worse. We actually have

242
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,750
she, um, anyways, Jesus Christ.
Let's get out of slavery.

243
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,030
What else do you want to talk about
the tree? So Neil benefits coming up.

244
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,840
Yes. Yes ma'am. Yeah.
Um, I'm sorry about that.

245
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll always like seeing
Georgia. Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,530
I was actually spoke to
her before I came here.

247
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,970
What's your favorite Patrice
O'neil story that you had?

248
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:51,630
You went on the road with him?
He did Amsterdam,

249
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,770
man, man, we come back from Charlie
goodnight's, Raleigh Durham. Oh yeah.

250
00:13:55,771 --> 00:14:00,560
And you guys five crackers is
illegal in Boston, right? Fireworks.

251
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:03,830
The fireworks go up to New
Hampshire. Yeah. So Patricia, yeah,

252
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:06,290
you're in a hurry to get back
in New York. I go, uh, no, no,

253
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,090
we'll sell it because I never really
use fireworks. And I go, okay,

254
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:15,530
well we stopped by, he spent like
three with the fireworks and duty.

255
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,700
Yes.
He just,

256
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,770
just put them all in one bag and
just wrapping it up and he goes,

257
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,270
oh, I want to, I want to set some of
this off. So I go, yeah, I'm from dying.

258
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,180
He was in North Carolina,

259
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,670
I'm from here so we can just find one of
these blue abandoned fields. So we did,

260
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,990
but it was, uh, it was hot and
the grass was dry. Oh, Jesus.

261
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,380
We started a forest fire.
Uh, no. Oh, we lit it up.

262
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:47,370
We had just came back from
eating. So Patrice had t he
shouldn't have had to. Uh,

263
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,920
and I had a big glass of water or
tea and the fire getting bigger,

264
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
but before it got bigger, we
tried to put it, stomp it out.

265
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,770
So it was just two black dudes
like ti would. I know we did that.

266
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,070
We did the feet first. You both had
new sneakers on. I sneakers were black.

267
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,790
When we were done.

268
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,270
He was trying to stop this fire out and
then we went and grabbed the t and we

269
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,380
both put our team on the
fire that did nothing did.

270
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,390
I said, let's get Outta here. You Go.
No, no. We got to the ambulance came,

271
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,650
fire truck came,

272
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,610
the owner of the land came in 10 minutes.

273
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,370
I'll Patrice you said, let's get out
here. You're on the state. You were like,

274
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,970
fuck this place in New York. Yeah,
yeah. Let's get out here. What happened?

275
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:29,400
They put it out, they put it out and that
will really cool. Uh, Patrice was honest.

276
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,090
It goes, let me do all the
talking stupid. And um,

277
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,820
and when they got, when they got
there, he's like, ah, I'm from Boston.

278
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:42,320
I know pop firecrackers before. So we just
started to be like, oh, it's okay man.

279
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,840
Don't worry about it. I just, I just, uh,

280
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,910
put some pesticide on this crops and
everything is dry or whatever and they let

281
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:54,230
us go. Wow. It took our statement.
Let us go. There you go. Look at that.

282
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,020
But we almost started a forest fire.
That shit was going to cook.

283
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,740
The field is here and the,
uh,

284
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,050
the forest was like maybe
10 feet from a five.

285
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:05,610
Slide it off in a parking lot. There
was no booze and was in North Carolina.

286
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,830
There's a parking lot. Yeah, there is.
I lived there. W will not will ruin it.

287
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,380
We were like off the highway,
off the beaten path in the rest area.

288
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,410
Scare a couple of pedophiles out of
the bathroom here. We didn't do that.

289
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,040
Let's put it in this fucking a pile
of hay. Oh Dude. It was hilarious.

290
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,940
Our feet were both,

291
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:27,920
our shoes are black from trying to
stomp fire report out to you on it.

292
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,830
Where are you going? Where are you
working these days? Um, everywhere, um,

293
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,290
in the city. Um, I'm actually pretty
busy in January. I'm going to Denver,

294
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,120
Colorado, Dino. Which, and
um, um, Dana headboards man,

295
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,000
I haven't run into him in
a minute. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

296
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,400
and where were you guys playing
it out there on the Improv?

297
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,470
Was that I was like a funny bone to
Denver. Comedy works? No, no, no.

298
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:55,610
It's the Improv I think. Oh, the
Improv. Okay. And then, um, after that,

299
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,430
I am an um, Dan, where am I?

300
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:02,120
I'm in Myrtle beach where I
started at a comedy Cabana.

301
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,900
How close is that to the forest fire?
Myrtle beach.

302
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,040
What forest fire as far as far as in South
Carolina one that you fucking started

303
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,350
two minutes ago. Oh, I'm
trying to do a call back here.

304
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:14,060
That was on fucking help me out
here. That was enough. Carolina. Oh,

305
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,810
North Carolina beach. South South
Carolina. Yeah. Fucking same down there.

306
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,840
That's what I'm saying.
I've been in the south,

307
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,350
the chain of waffle house. Oh
yeah. I used to work in Warren,

308
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,360
the signage to what this sign,

309
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,140
the font is so not exciting and then
it's like piss yellow with like the most

310
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,480
basic thing and you get in there
and it's just, I don't know,

311
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,170
there's always like a, either a fight's
about to happen or just happened.

312
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,280
It's just really like, I worked there
three years and when I was in high school,

313
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
people go there. They seem
like they're hiding out. Like,
you know, I can't go home

314
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,860
because of such and such situation.

315
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,080
Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's uh,
I didn't enjoy working ahead.

316
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,410
How long did you work there
for? Three years. Off and on.

317
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,580
How many clients did you see? I didn't
see any fights but someone at the end,

318
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
after I work third shifts on time
and it club and the club let out,

319
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,620
these drunk people will come in and one
person went in the bathroom and shit

320
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,000
everywhere on the walls. So
the waitress comes out, she
goes, hey, I'm cooking food.

321
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:18,180
She goes, Harris, I need you to clean the
bathroom. I go, well, what's going on?

322
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,020
Somebody made an accident. I went in there
and it was just, it wasn't on purpose.

323
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,100
I don't know. It looked like a crime
scene, which shit. Uh, and I said, no,

324
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,620
I'm not cleaning out.
I don't get paid to clean shit off walls.

325
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,510
And they don't make a mop for that.
No,

326
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:34,990
they don't cause call a fucking Hazmat
group. Exactly. Exactly. I refuse.

327
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:39,300
And one of them did it and one lady came
in and she wanted a cheeseburger and I

328
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:42,000
said to Jesus, 50 cent
extra, she goes, 50 set,

329
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,790
can't you just put it on there at
coop? No Lady, I can't just do it.

330
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,990
You have to pay for it. And she
didn't get the cheese the next day,

331
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,160
the next night she came in, she had her
own cheese and the plastic and she said,

332
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,650
put that on my burger.
Like using a nightclub.

333
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,670
This cheeses in your glove compartment,
two hours, you left your house,

334
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,270
you've got your purse, your perfume,
and your high heels and your cheese.

335
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,930
So when you get to the waffle house to
cook can put it on your burger because

336
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:09,450
you don't want to pay 50% wow.
Hilarious.

337
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,580
That's that is, that is, that is a level
of fun. Cheekness cause that is cheapness.

338
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:16,090
If you're going out to a club and you're
going to pay a cover and you're going

339
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:18,530
to do some shit like that,
I fucking hate cheap people like that.

340
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,830
And also dumb with money. Yes. I
don't have any sympathy for that.

341
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:24,350
My white guilt only goes so far.
You know what I mean?

342
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,790
I'll white guilt all fucking day long
until I watched you get a deal and buy a

343
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,000
bunch of dumb shit. Then it was like
I'd forget it. Right, right, right.

344
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,550
You know all kinds of shiny shit.
Remember that?

345
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,020
Remember the member the age of the
deals and Montreal comedy festival and

346
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,400
everyone would go up
there and he'd be like,

347
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,300
oh my dad was crazy and my brother was
crazy and every was like, that's a show.

348
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,670
And then you'd go out and
you get a six figure deal.

349
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,380
Remember all those fucking idiots that
went out and they buy flat screen TV

350
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,510
title. They ain't got a bunch of money.
Todd land rest and peace literally did.

351
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:58,670
And I refuse to believe it
until Dean Edwards fucking, uh,

352
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,713
confirmed it.

353
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,530
Did the coming to America thing where
he fixed up a place he was renting.

354
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,150
He even redid the fucking floors.
He, he showed his landlord,

355
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:10,310
she raised the rent and he
had to leave after a while.

356
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,690
Yeah. Yup, Yup. He bought a bunch.
He, well, two cars. He, uh, he

357
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,190
bought that Gold Lexus. He had the Jesus,
it was, it was an infinity, infinity,

358
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:24,020
infinity. And he, he had a, he had a
waist length mink with a hoodie on it,

359
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,320
zip up and he would be on stage
talking about white people. Right.

360
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,000
You could be as white as,
you know,

361
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,850
you're never going to keep
money if you do that. Right.

362
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,700
He must have spent 20 grand on a horse.
It was hilarious. I feel bad to go and do,

363
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,710
we can't go that far.
It's not alive to defend himself.

364
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,940
But if it was less than it was,
say the spirit of him. Yeah.

365
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,010
Do you think

366
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,990
in the afterlife, both his
arms worked doing and he says,

367
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,600
Jesus, Oh God, you know, it's funny.

368
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,950
Tie wouldn't have their arm and
people were still afraid of him. Like,

369
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,870
what the fuck are you afraid? Because
he had that. He had the mean mug.

370
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,740
I used to always tease
him about this Roman nose.

371
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,080
He had like a Julius Caesar fucking
knows. Yeah, he was, I don't know.

372
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,980
He kind of looked like a male missy
Elliot. When I really think back,

373
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
you know what, she needs to
lose weight. You know, write,

374
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:20,830
write right that size missy,
whatever happened to her. Um,

375
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:24,610
I think she took her money and left.
I think Napster, which blew up comedy.

376
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm convinced to that. I'm smart
with my money. Did it when I,

377
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,660
after the accident I was,
I only did all he only bowl.

378
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,010
Can I get any credit here
for going this far and,

379
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:35,930
and not making you fucking relive
that again. Oh, that's fine.

380
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,640
We can talk about it. It was okay.
Yeah. Harris was one of the people,

381
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:43,900
unfortunately, uh, who was on the bus
with Tracy Morgan when that Walmart truck,

382
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,660
not the bus. I'm sorry. It
was one of those little,

383
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,050
those Mercedes like say the band thing,
Limo party bus without the polling.

384
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,340
Rest in peace. A uncle Jimmy.
Jimmy Mack. Yeah. Oh Man.

385
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,740
I remember bombing with him
at fucking Labar bat one night

386
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,390
and I remember he was alarmed a
little barbaric to, oh everybody,

387
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,560
that fucking room that was talents from,
I never figured that roam up. Never.

388
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:10,000
If that room was like this really
cool bar and it had an upstairs and a

389
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:13,150
downstairs and it was
Tuesday's the after work crowd,

390
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,090
you know they never
called any white people.

391
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:19,030
I remember that specifically.

392
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:22,250
All black crowd after work crowd
and the only time I went there,

393
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,890
I think I must've killed first because
I went back. Right, right, right.

394
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,020
So I killed the first time,
then I bombed,

395
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,550
then I killed and I bombed every other
fucking time. It was unbelievable.

396
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,690
He only did it twice and a bomb.
Both terms.

397
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,130
I remember one night when I was
new anyway, so I probably go bad.

398
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:42,750
You never bombed so bad that the next
guy's bombing off your bomb. Like,

399
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,640
that's like an aftershock
of what the fuck I did.

400
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,110
Uncle Jimmy went up there and was bombing
and he was bombing so bad and it was

401
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:53,220
so fucking quiet. He was just that guy,
man, fuck y'all. [inaudible] he goes,

402
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:57,340
I in this woman was giving him shit
and uh, he said something about like,

403
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,490
what happened? You know,
something about his career, right.

404
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,830
You still got my fucking Korea. And
she was like, Edward, what career?

405
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,500
And everybody, that was the biggest
laugh. Everyone laughed at him.

406
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,670
He was trying to talk about being
on bet. Dude, you remember raw?

407
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,140
What's his face? Uh, Gerald
Kelly. Joe Kelly and I abandoned,

408
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,480
I did one of his rooms out in Jersey.
He was one of these places.

409
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,291
It was a dance club.

410
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,490
And like the next week it
was closed because someone
shot off guns or some shit.

411
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:29,491
And I fucking went in there and it was
me and Ross g and I forget who else.

412
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,500
And he was supposed, he was supposed
to host it. It was his Roman.

413
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,200
He was like fucking two hours
late. And uh, he came on stage.

414
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,540
Oh yeah. And it just was
like, he's like, Yo, what up?

415
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,760
You just got back from Atlanta [inaudible]
kind of sound and he goes doing comic

416
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:46,130
view. He goes, made

417
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,580
six g's,
I'd say made six grand doing comics.

418
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,870
If you're not people not in the business
comic view, you got paid like 600 bucks.

419
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,040
I got thousand dollars one time.

420
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,650
Did you think that was actually after
everybody I remember was in the hundreds.

421
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:58,820
It was like 700 bucks.

422
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,383
MMM.

423
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,000
All inclusive. Like you lost
money. You lost money. Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,460
Got It to one of your hotel, you
gotta pay for your flight. So he shit,

425
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:10,120
nobody knows that. So he showed up,
told the crowd that had waited for him,

426
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:15,121
like fucking axl rose back in the day
that he was late because he was doing a TV

427
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:18,640
show and he made six grand. Hilarious.
That's how we start. Every was like,

428
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:22,530
what the fuck? And I remember Ross went
up and she had such a tough set that uh,

429
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,460
she ended her set and she goes, damn. She
goes, I don't know who's coming up next,

430
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:31,480
but he better be funny cause
you motherfuckers ain't
laughing at shit and walked

431
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:34,750
off. And then they brought me up
and of course the second I talked,

432
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:39,340
everybody did the white guy
voicemail. Hell yeah, I ate it.

433
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,950
Uh, Jimmy, I tell you a funny story
with Jimmy because Jimmy Hill had,

434
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,840
I guess he was away for
comedy for a little while.

435
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,980
So Tracy brought them on the roads
and it was on tour with us. Um,

436
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,570
but before I got on the tour,
uh,

437
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,550
mark field both said that Jimmy would
go up and open and be bombing. So uh,

438
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,280
Tracy said a chimney,
you go up,

439
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:03,290
warm the crowd up and just will go up
at Jimmy started bombing and then a

440
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,740
already comes back and goes,
you'll Tracy Jimmy's bomb.

441
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:08,840
You want me to get them off
the, she was like, no, no,

442
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:13,300
let them simmer for a little bit.
Goes back out.

443
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,110
Yo Jimmy stretch. It's to me
turns the Broncos. Oh, okay.

444
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:21,980
They want me to stay out here and he
just bombed for five more minutes.

445
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,531
Like Tracy,

446
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:26,810
you were an asshole for just letting him
sit in this bomb for five more minutes,

447
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,770
let them out off the hook man.
And before then,

448
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,770
so the next night he goes, Jimmy,
you're up against, you're up.

449
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:38,060
Sounded like that dude in pulp fiction.
Let them simmer a little bit.

450
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:42,350
It's similar little bit. And then so
the next night, Jimmy Tracy goes, Jim,

451
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:43,184
you're on again tonight night.

452
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,850
And Jimmy literally went in the corner
and started rehearsing his lines like new

453
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:47,684
comics do.

454
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,130
And he went out bombed again.
What an asshole. Tracy.

455
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,220
I had a

456
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,460
bunch of those. There was a guy, I
remember when I was in Boston, this guy,

457
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,940
this guy, Dick Doherty, he still has rums.
He had all of these fucking rooms, right?

458
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,240
Right. He was like the godfather of
the outside the satellite rooms. Right.

459
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:10,120
You had the,
the main clubs in Boston.

460
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,760
And then he had all of these
places in like fucking Drake,

461
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:16,900
it and all these places in Massachusetts
and uh, which are all great towns,

462
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,330
but you know,
not the best place sometimes to do comedy.

463
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:22,930
So he finally did want it.
He finally got one in Boston.

464
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,590
I guess he always had the, uh, he
had the comedy ball for a while,

465
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:28,300
but he opened this other
one in Kenmore Square,

466
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:32,910
right in the college area and they
called it comedy comedy campus. So this,

467
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:36,910
this journeymen guy, finally, he gives
him the room, like your book in this room,

468
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:38,860
your host it, and he's
fucking psyched, man.

469
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm finally fucking making something
in this business. And um, he fucking,

470
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,750
the first night of it,
I'm on it with Greg Fitz Simmons.

471
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,490
And the dude goes up and it's just really
small crowd. 10, 15 people on through.

472
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,950
When I tell you he didn't get a
fucking laugh. He got nothing.

473
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,720
Brings up the first act. The first
act immediately starts killing crowd.

474
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:01,800
Fucking livens up. Everything's
going great. Dude finishes
his set. Thanks a lot.

475
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:05,710
Back to your house. So, and so host
comes back up immediately bombing again

476
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,220
bombing. That's always funny when
the host is bombing also bombs again,

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,420
brings up, uh, the woman that
Greg was dating at the time.

478
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,470
Fucking she kills back to him bombing.

479
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,950
So finally brings up one more
person. That person's killing, right?

480
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,850
So fucking Simmons looks at him and he
just goes, hey buddy. He goes, dude,

481
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,590
you know, if, if it's not happening for
you, just bring acts up. You know, we, we,

482
00:27:30,591 --> 00:27:33,630
we got plenty of show here. We've got
plenty of showing, like piss this guy off.

483
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:38,040
So he got on stage and he fucking
immediately just starts bombing again.

484
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,880
So finally, dead silence. He just looks
at the crowd. He's like, you know what?

485
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,210
What the fuck? What the fuck the fucking
jokes do you fucking people want?

486
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,460
Exactly. And this guy and the crowd
goes, how about some funny jokes?

487
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,750
And he goes, he goes, funny how like
things going in and out of your anus.

488
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,430
Oh, that's that. Does that kill it?
Killed me and Greg. That's hilarious.

489
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,460
He said it was such
fucking bile in his voice.

490
00:28:01,461 --> 00:28:05,490
You actually pictured this guy's an
asshole. Pucker and up. That's your key.

491
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,700
Me and Greg were, it was the funniest joke
of the night. He will cry and Larry's,

492
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,300
and the crowd was just like,
Whoa, what the fuck? Oh, well,

493
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,770
you remember Kevin Hart's sweet cheeks
in Atlantic city? I never did that one.

494
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:21,710
But I remember they throw chicken
at big J. Oh, it was awful.

495
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,770
They love heavy bar it.
No,

496
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,200
it was a sweet cheeks and
it sounds like a gay bar.

497
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,190
Teres worked at gay bar called
fiddlesticks. I did one.

498
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:34,640
It was called Queen of hearts.
Oh Man. No, it wasn't a gay bar.

499
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,710
It's actually the opposite.
Gangsters hung out.

500
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,280
There was fights all the time
and they love little Kevin and,

501
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,830
but when everybody else we'll
come back on, they would just,

502
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,270
they do like the little plastic that
you put the menu in on the table.

503
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,410
They threw that at Jimique.
Uh, they just, they were awful,

504
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,380
but they loved Kev.
I was like,

505
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,360
well that guy is funny tools. Oh, I
didn't do rooms like that after a while.

506
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,790
Like there was a weapon if
enough people that last bag,

507
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,230
if enough people came back with stories.
Yeah. He was trying to get me to do that.

508
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:08,670
Roman. I remember I was far
enough in my career to do it.

509
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,100
I don't need to drive to Philly to bomb
like I can. I can do that. I'll do drew,

510
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,250
drew, Frazier's, rum, Manhattan
proper. I'll take the e to the end.

511
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,740
That just finally closed to take my,
I love that room.

512
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,200
I remember one time doing
that air all the time too.

513
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,890
I remember doing that one time and I
remember one entourage chasing another

514
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:28,820
entourage out of the club and then the
next week there was like a metal detector.

515
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,290
Yeah, wait, but yeah,

516
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,650
that's two parking gangsters used to
hang out in these cases just to hang out.

517
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:36,650
They're like real live drug
dealers. Yeah. That was the vibe,

518
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:41,650
but then this really cool after
work thing was there like supreme.

519
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:45,040
He, he, he was on American gangster.
He, they used to hang out there.

520
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,540
It was not a guy there named supreme WWI.

521
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,660
You probably didn't know
when your whiteness,

522
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:53,260
you had no idea that it makes the why we
thought it was a cut. People used to do.

523
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:57,010
When I got off the fucking, when I
took the EDA, Jamaica Queens get up,

524
00:29:57,011 --> 00:30:00,760
they would look at me like they would
just be like, people would try to help me.

525
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,010
Jamaica, queens don't like,
they'll get back on you want to go.

526
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,210
He wanted to go the other way.
Want to go the other way? Yup. Yup.

527
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,050
You know, use, use, performing
in front of killers. Digi. Uh,

528
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,800
no. I, I knew that there was definitely
some shit going on that wasn't legal,

529
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,340
but I mean, I thought it was kind of
like a, do you ever think about that?

530
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,720
How many, how many like people
that killed somebody at this point,

531
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:26,960
how long you've been doing standup?

532
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,730
How many people in the crowd who have
killed somebody that people just don't

533
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:34,110
even know yet? All right. All
right. I just think that on
the subway, right. Well, in,

534
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:37,010
in Manhattan, probably, you definitely
had it. Some clientele and it kills him.

535
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,370
Might I add somebody killed some,

536
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,600
some future stars are for the first
48 yes. Let me make him some appetite.

537
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,330
How far into the Samurai?
Half. Half Hour. Okay, cool.

538
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,100
Look at me since still can fill a half.
Huh? I got typed in my God damn password.

539
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,300
What's your name? Your special again,
so people know to look for my name,

540
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,650
my special city. Uh, sorry,

541
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,810
got deck that naive innocence
and that's the thing,

542
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:05,180
cause I moved from South Carolina
and I was naive, innocent.

543
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,020
Then I got up here and it got wrong. You
guys and I became fucking terrible. Yeah,

544
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,470
we're going to blame us like that demon
wasn't in you. You're right. You're right.

545
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,400
Yeah,
it was in there.

546
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:18,520
But you guys haven't even talked about
half the fucking shit that I heard.

547

supremacy group of friends
you to least clan neo Nazis

598
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,280
or just the average Douche on Youtube?

599
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,980
That was a good question.
Probably the clan

600
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,500
even though they're out there
and that just kind of saying it,

601
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,030
I would think the youtube, cause it's all,
you know, you might even run into that,

602
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,000
you might even know that guy,

603
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,490
but they don't have the balls to put on
a uniform to say what they're thinking.

604
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,800
Okay. Yeah, that's,
that's better. But, uh,

605
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,570
the clan is just like funny
to me now. Like, you know,

606
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I see it all on.
Somebody

607
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,490
shows you we wouldn't take the claim.
That's the only place they are.

608
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,750
The plan is only a, I'm as white as it
gets. I've never been asked to join,

609
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,700
I don't know any fucking members.
Right.

610
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,170
I mean all through the South [inaudible]
I've been in Connecticut and evidently

611
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,960
they got, they had a good
following around Connecticut. Yeah.

612
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,880
Not as prominent as they used to be.
I guess they kind of fell off.

613
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,970
It's like the mob. They're all doing like
identity theft now in the fucking whip.

614
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,370
Yup. All right. He looks everybody helix.

615
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,630
There are a ton of online mattress
retailers popping up these days.

616
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:25,490
All with a one size fits all solution
for better sleep to a better sleep.

617
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:29,630
Guess what? One size fits all doesn't
work when it comes to mattresses.

618
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,620
He likes sleep offers something that
doesn't exist anywhere. Anywhere else.

619
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:38,621
A mattress personalize to your unique
preference and sleeping style that won't

620
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,700
set you back. Thousands of dollars.
That's true. Like even not,

621
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:44,070
not just your height,
like if you sleep face down,

622
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,780
they take a plaster mold or your junk
so it the contours to the mattress.

623
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,410
That's true. Are you
serious? No, no. I was like,

624
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,850
you don't need that.
Go to helix,

625
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:01,230
sleep.com/burr and take their
two to three minutes sleep quiz.

626
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,060
They'll build a custom mattress.

627
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,520
That will will be the best thing
you've ever slept on for couples.

628
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,420
They even personalize each side of
the mattress, which we both know.

629
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,280
That's the beginning of the
end of the relationship.

630
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,600
You're starting to live separate lives.

631
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,690
You can't even sleep next to the
person you need your own space.

632
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,820
Everyone from Gq to cosmopolitan to
the New York Times or talking to vibe

633

magazine, reaching out to
your people if they still do,

634
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,460

just, it was the last black magazine.

635
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:30,750

646
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,120
every year millions of people receive at
least the least like gift of all time.

647
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:21,330
Underwear. Harris, what if someone
gave you underwear for Christmas?

648
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,300
I will love it cause most loan over have
holes in it because I'm one of those

649
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,134
guys who just,

650
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,650
I won't buy new underwear until
someone's a former baseball player.

651
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,490
You're superstitious. You hit your last
curve ball with that pair of underwear,

652
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:36,670
you're still gonna wear it. Right? Um,
well listen to this. [inaudible] okay.

They'll give I love socks.

654
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:43,080
Now I'm trying to do a segue back into
this fucking copy and I can't do it. Uh,

655
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,501
anyways,

656
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:46,470
but we still give it to our family
and our loved ones who just don't want

657
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,620
underwear. But maybe it's not
that underwears the problem.

658
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:52,260
Maybe it's the kind of underwear.

Me undies made underwear.

There's not a camera is a camera

710
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,401

The camera.

Just so people don't want you to drink or
does that really well? I just feed. No,

00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:46,460
I'm just like, what if you're banging
your wife and you just have your thing on?

713
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:49,310
Like these fucking nerds, you know,
they're not getting any pussy.

714
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:52,580
They just watch you. They actually
caught people like they, they want the,

715
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:57,380
you buy a TV, they watch you
watching TV. Oh fuck yeah.

716
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,300
And for some reason that's not illegal.

717
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,810
And now all these fucking morons
who are ah, they got that,

718
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:05,430
that little thing there in the
house being being like, Alexa,

719
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,710
what's the Capitol of South America
or whatever. I mean, sorry, Brazil,

720
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,330
South America in the morning. Um,
yeah, you just bugged your own house.

721
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,330
I mean you already have with all these
devices and now you've got this other

722
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:20,960
thing, right. That's like a excellent,
I'm not all have locks of my house. No,

723
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,650
it's like inviting a vampire into
your house. You got to put a thing,

724
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,920
a garlic around his fucking fuck.
Alexa.

725
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,700
Fuck out my house, Bitch. That's
exactly what I said. Okay,

726
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:34,030
here we go.

727
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,780
It was bad timing. We both took a sip.
All right. Uh, here's some questions.

728
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,040
All right, now I tried to get
some ethnically diverse. Once,

729
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,020
so I can show you that I'm woke.

730
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,390
How annoying is that to hear a
white person say that by the way,

731
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,210
are you married to a black
woman? Huh? Yeah. But you know,

732
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:51,370
once you're married that long,
just a woman,

733
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,080
you know it's the same file cultural
fight. It's not like the little,

734
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,900
you'll hold the fork like this
and I hold it like that. Wow.

735
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,840
There really is a difference.
It's the same shit.

736
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,730
Like can I finish up here in the bathroom
before you try to steal the sink?

737
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:09,000
Brushing your teeth. It's
the exact same shit. Right?

738
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,830
It's only when you go out in
public and everybody's like,

739
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:13,830
what the fuck are you doing together?

740
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,480
You fucking race trader. Yup. Um,

741
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:24,600
but when you're in the House,
Huh? I low ball. You can
have mine. You can have mine.

742
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:27,570
Whatever one I was supposed to be
with and I took yours. There you go.

743
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,410
And then one day we'll go on a double
date like those too. Freaky fucking,

744
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,160
was it the Yankees and the Indians near
here? The button that they swapped wives?

745
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,340
No, there was two teammates.
They went on a double date.

746
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:42,780
By the end of the end of the date,
they fucking realized, hey man,

747
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,070
we're like sorta like, you know, they
probably sat at a four top boy, girl, boy,

748
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:49,890
girl.
And I think they just sort of uh,

749
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,950
the dude stop talking to
each other and chicks up top.

750
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:55,830
You should have by the end of
it some they agreed to switch.

751
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:59,100
Swap wives like to just
go forever like yeah.

752
00:42:59,101 --> 00:43:01,920
And I think one of them made it and the
other ones didn't. That's hilarious.

753
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,060
The other one didn't.
That'd be the funniest fight.

754
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,620
I should have stayed with that right.
Feel there.

755
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,710
Well I know he's getting a better blow job
than I am old. Be Brutal. Um, all right,

756
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,480
here we go. So I tried to have
some ethnically diverse. Okay,

757
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:19,051
so you want to start,

758
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:22,200
this is a nice one that I feel like
anybody have any sort of background?

759
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:24,030
Transgendered? Anybody? Uh,

760
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,300
this one's called favorite
Ozzy Osborne guitarist.

761
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,060
So this is right in your wheel house.
This is a fast ball.

762
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:31,410
I feel like you can jump on this one.

763
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:36,110
Why is this in my wheel house isn't
being an asshole. You are breaking bad.

764
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,500
I'm watching a documentary on Ozzie
that's four hours long and booze and while

765
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:44,520
the girlfriend is out with her
peers doing sex in the city,

766
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:48,240
shit a while,
Randy Rhoads always gets to me,

767
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:51,690
especially during Mr Crowley,
that none of this means anything to you.

768
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,630
My favorite is always been Jakey Lee.

769
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,100
I grew up on bark at the moon when I was
a kid and still listen now and again to

770
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:03,630
the last furious rips of Jake and the
last minute of the song I always felt he

771
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:07,020
was under appreciated. Could not
agree more. Zack Wylde is all good,

772
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:11,180
but it feels like he's using five pedals
instead of showing pure skill. Well,

773
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,980
you should've seen Zack wild when
he played with the almond brothers.

774
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,730
That would have cured all of that shit
for you. A more style than substance.

775
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:18,690
I don't agree with that.
Uh,

776
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,610
what do you think Drumma boy ps was great
to see you Montreal last summer when

777
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:27,900
it was your birthday. Um, all
right. What do you think Harris?

778
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,190
Just by the names alone.
Who would you think is the best guitars?

779
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:36,720
Would you go with Randy
Rhoads, Jake Jakey Lee or, or,

780
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:38,040
uh,
Zack wild.

781
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,390
Probably Zack Wylde Zack
wild by because it's wild.

782
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,830
It goes crazy.
You can jump on that Janky leave.

783
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:52,280
What does that sound like to you? Jakey
lease. I was like borderline Asian,

784
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,820
mixed Asian trying to fit
into the culture. Okay.

785
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,430
And Randy Rhoads. Randy
Rhodes, uh, as a racist.

786
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,250
And um, he died in a plane crash by
the way. Oh yes. She'd go easier.

787
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,220
This is like making fun of
Tupac for a lot of white.

788
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,930
Right? Right. Oh, sorry. I don't know
any of these people, uh, listeners.

789
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,280
I don't know any of these people. I
would never say that if I don't know him.

790
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,070
Well, he did play in an all white
bands. So I mean your theory does work.

791
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:25,390
Fucking racist. Uh, no,

792
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,960
no. Is it brutal story is he
was on tour with the Ozzy,

793
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:34,470
Ozzy left black sabbath. Right. And that
would be no doubt. That would be what,

794
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:35,600
whatever they had a fallen out.

795
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,240
It'd be like one of the one on how
do we relate to, you hear, well,

796
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:39,830
it'd be like something
in the Wu Tang clan,

797
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,850
they leave and then they put out a solo
album. That's, that's critical there.

798
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,590
Right. But Blue Tang never
really broke up, right? No,
not religious. Haven't made,

799
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,360
no. Okay. Well just say they broke up
and then all of a sudden, uh, you know,

800
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:56,030
one of those guys that's not old,
dirty pastor and method man,

801
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,580
ghost face killer decides
I'm going to fucking put one
out. You know, uh, you know,

802
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:05,990
it's a very, it's a very
precarious point in your career.

803
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,450
Like you, you don't get a second
solo album if the first one bombed,

804
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:13,100
especially if, you know,
came out in a supergroup. So
black Sabbath thing was over.

805
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,840
He was coming out on his fucking own
and he ended up meeting Randy Rhoads and

806
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,440
Randy Rhoads basically saved
his fucking career. Hey,

807
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,880
so they go out on tour, he's destroying,
he's like the new guy and everything.

808
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,750
And they, uh, were in Florida and
they pulled in and the bus driver,

809
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:32,610
wherever they were going to gas up the
bus, that was also a little plane there.

810
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,800
And this guy had a pilot's license and
he fucking got in the plane with Randy

811
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,860
Rhodes and he was fucking buzz in the
bus doing all of that shit in his last

812
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:41,960
pass,
clip the bus,

813
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,850
and either flew into the house or
into the barn to one of the other.

814
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:49,070
And then that was, it does
crazy. And that was it.

815
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,810
And you just said he sounded
like a racist. I hope you're
happy. No Man. You know,

816
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,480
maybe if she shouldn't be
googling all your fucking porn,

817
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,830
you could look up Randy Rhoads before you
soiled his name. All right, here we go.

818
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:04,670
Here. Here's, here's one that
we can both jump on here at.

819
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:09,560
Girlfriend isn't very attractive
and I want to cheat. All right. Um,

820
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:12,680
I've been dating my girl for a year
now and I love the shit out of her,

821
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:16,910
but God damn, if she isn't on the
wrong side of the 10 point scale,

822
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,320
God, what an asshole.
You don't love her? No.

823
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,160
And why would you date her if she's
ugly? If you think she's ugly? Yeah,

824
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,050
yeah, yeah. You don't love this
woman. All right, we got it. It's not,

825
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,410
there's anything wrong with their face.
She's just not really my type physically,

826
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,160
personally, personally
wise. Does he eat, flight,

827
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,800
physically personal.
Personally,

828
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,760
we jive what he says personally
wise, personality wise. Sorry.

829
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:46,460
We jive like crazy jive.

830
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,850
This guy's to be like 50 it's
like, dude, what are you look like?

831
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,830
Does he eat food or he doesn't like to,

832
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:56,860
and let's say she's really pretty
when I'm laying on top or next suffer,

833
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,490
but any other position,

834
00:47:58,491 --> 00:48:02,960
and I can't help but be disappointed
in how overweight she is. She says,

835
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,590
this guy's a fucking monster.
On one hand,

836
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,330
the sensation of being with thick girls
really appeals to me on the other.

837
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:14,720
My male gaze does not
agree because of this.

838
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,380
I've found my thoughts wandering to other
women have started flirting with them

839
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:22,040
for seemingly no reason.
I'm afraid I'm going to cheat,

840
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:25,910
but I really think all things
considered that I could marry this girl.

841
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,080
This guy's all over the fucking map is
breaking up with her for something so

842
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,770
shallow would absolutely kill me
and it hurt. The woman I love,

843
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:38,790
loves heart for no reason. What
should I do? Go see a therapist. Yeah.

844
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,590
He's like

845
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,960
oddly like brutally honest.

846
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,270
He's being brutally honest here, but
what? He's all like, it makes no sense.

847
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:51,830
I like purple but I don't like
purple, which is it? Pick,

848
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,130
pick the pros and cons and you know,
he went on it is,

849
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:59,570
he made a very mature move where he
actually fell in love with the person and

850
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:01,940
now I think that that's
getting old. Yeah. You know,

851
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:06,830
there's no more surprises now he's just
looking at her and I think that that's

852
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:08,690
what's going on and exactly what
was going on. All right, now,

853
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:10,790
how can he for Christmas,

854
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:15,410
what gift can he give her that in
a funny loving way can be like,

855
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,480
you need to lose some weight
or I'm going to cheat on you.

856
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,570
Sherry's berries.

857
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,780
Oh,

858
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,830
there is no way. There is no way. Like,

859
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:32,250
you know the end of an action movie
where it's which wire do I clip and they

860
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:36,770
fucking take a guess. Yeah, both of
them blow up. Yeah. Alright Harris,

861
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,370
I gotta to put you on the spot.
How would you do it?

862
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,760
How would you tell the woman
you love personality wise,

863
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:45,540
you guys jive is this guy says,
how the fuck would you tell her?

864
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,730
You putting on too much weight.

865
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,300
Well, if you know someone that
long, when you go bitch, you fat,

866
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:57,000
you need to lose some weight.
So you just,

867
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,370
so you rip the bandaid off. Go listen,
you're getting a little overweight.

868
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:03,670
I had a boy,
a friend of mine who dumped his girl.

869
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,410
He wander before doing it while they
were dating. He said, if you get big,

870
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:12,040
I'm outta here. She got big. He
was out of there. She tested him.

871
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,080
She ate two bucks. She,
she tested the brand.

872
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,890
He said that they said that
to her and he left her crying.

873
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,600
I told you exactly what did I say?
Look in the mirror.

874
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,100
Look,
what did I say?

875
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,230
You're a hundred pounds bigger
than you was when I said that shit.

876
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,150
But he has the thing

877
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,700
though.

878
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,530
I actually think there is like a complete
lack of respect for your partner if,

879
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,710
if you let yourself go. Absolutely.
There is. Now here's the thing,

880
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,960
unless you know you Sikhism, oh or she,
you know, she got what? She was pregnant,

881
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,470
she had a kid talking about all of that.

882
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,560
But before having kids or if
you're not having kids, all right,

883
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,970
if you sit in a man or a woman,

884
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:54,650
if you're just sitting there just
becoming a fucking lard ass. Exactly.

885
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,390
What are they supposed to do? Exactly.
That you putting a lot of pressure,

886
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,650
like Patrice said, whenever you,
how will you look to get him?

887
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,550
You have to somewhat maintain it all.
Otherwise he's going to venture,

888
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,040
we're animals.
We're ma like we were.

889
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,920
And what I loved about Patrice as he
could be that overweight in the crowd,

890
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:16,840
they would never even think to say like,
well, what about you? Right, right, right.

891
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,720
He would just be like, bitch, I've
always been this size. Um, yeah.

892
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,300
I don't know what, what should he do? Um,

893
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:27,470
talk to her like you're talking to
you on these. I would just say this,

894
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:30,710
I would put it on me.
This is what I would do and this is this.

895
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,730
If you really loved her, I'd put on 20
pounds myself and then just be like,

896
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:38,570
listen man, I got to get this weight
off and get diabetes. If I loved her,

897
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,000
I would put on 20 pounds
myself and just say, listen,

898
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:44,600
I got to get this weight off but I
can't do it on my own. I need you. Okay.

899
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,120
I mean week lately,
I need you to know,

900
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:49,220
oh and she'll be there for you and your
take around and walks and this is what

901
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:52,820
you do. You buy, I wouldn't do that. No,
I wouldn't. I'd dumper. No, I wouldn't.

902
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:58,060
You buy his and her fucking matching
workout fucking outfits walk.

903
00:51:58,171 --> 00:52:03,020
Just steer right into it. Just walking.
Be that couple that dresses the same. Oh,

904
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,290
I know. That's one of the, it's just like,

905
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:10,700
that's either like whenever I see that
that's like either they literally are

906
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,120
soul mates if you believe in
that or there's one person
that needs to be rescued

907
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,440
from that relationship
because the other person,

908
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,360
like who was that guy in the NBA when you
ric flair do, what would Rick flair do?

909
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,660
Yeah. Oh Jeez. Well he wouldn't be
around long enough for her to get fat

910
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,970
when he came over on the road when she
fucking put on all that way and he'd do

911
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:36,680
the flare flop right in front of it

912
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,080
and just turn around.
Oh you do the Henry Hill.

913
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,320
He just do that laugh member that and
he'd go walk turns right back around and

914
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:47,690
he gets, he gets back in the,
got that fuck kind of people.

915
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,870
Are they getting back in the car with the
Joe Pesci I think that's what he would

916
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:54,920
do. Um, this guy, I think
he was trying to be,

917
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,380
sometimes people try to be
funny by being really blunt.

918
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,580
I actually think this guy does
really like this girl, but like, uh,

919
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,110
yeah cause I think if they start
getting that fat before you had kids,

920
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,010
you just start thinking like, oh
my God, I don't want to be with a,

921
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:11,230
well no one wants to be with the,

922
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,810
no one wants to be a whale and no one
wants to be with a whale. Well some,

923
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:18,530
some guys like big women.
Okay. All right. Okay.

924
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,890
But he doesn't know. He
likes it. Will Thicken and

925
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,100
sunken obese.
My had a best friend

926
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,200
who wanted his woman as
fast as she could be.

927
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,470
Oh he did? Yeah. He had a best friend. She
was, his wife was a fat motherfucker too.

928
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,350
What is that about? I don't,
I think they liked it.

929
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,820
This is what's so weird. You know, maybe
they want them to just look adorable.

930
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:48,181
You know,

931
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:51,940
the durable a baby looks with all those
roles of like a roll of fat in the mid

932
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:55,030
forearm. He just looking at like,
what is that? Right? What is that?

933
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,510
That they didn't want a big, a big
giant baby. I think there's a lot of,

934
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,740
they like a lot of woman,

935
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,840
but I like a lot of one
but far as like not fat,

936
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:11,070
but like let's say six, five,
11 that's a lot of women too.

937
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:15,600
Yes, I understand what you're saying,
but it's not fat, not fat. What's,

938
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:17,640
what's the biggest she would
go give me height and weight.

939
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,500
Let's break down your draft
picks and in the foot.

940
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:24,810
Then the first round of the big
girl draft terrorists, Staten picks,

941
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,550
picks 185 pound,

942
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:34,680
six foot. Nope, five tall. How tall
are you? I'm six. Two and a half.

943
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,890
Six, two and a half. All
right. Yeah, so she has to,

944
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,620
if you're going to weigh 200 pounds,
you'd have to be five 11 and better.

945
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,680
Otherwise you're just a fat bitch.

946
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,780
Let's consider an insensitive,
but it's actually,

947
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:54,630
there's an endearing thing where
you're just being brutally honest.

948
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,780
I mean that's, that's what
your heart is saying. Yes.

949
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:01,850
It's saying you're a fat bitch. It's
not being like listen. Um, right.

950
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,120
Your heart's doing all the
work. Yeah, I would, I would go,

951
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,860
uh, whatever. Cause I'm like, I'm
five, nine, three quarters. I'm,

952
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,780
I'm exactly Doug Flutie height, not
quite five 10 big woman with curves are,

953
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,570
are, have a chance. Like if you
still, you don't have the fat woman,

954
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,680
they are really fat, but you can
still see the curve. Yeah. Curvy.

955
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:25,560
Like it was like a skinny woman, but fat.
Yeah. Like a deck, a hot chick giant.

956
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:29,250
Just sacrifice that.
Ah, right. I would say,

957
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:35,060
I would say one 65 cause I'm about one
75 I don't want to throw me around the

958
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:38,790
fucking room height.
Is it like five,

959
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:43,270
five [inaudible] six as big. Yeah. That's
not that big. Depends on the, you know,

960
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:47,380
depends. Five, five 160 pounds.
She, she's got a nice ass on her.

961
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:53,040
I don't like those. Cankles would
ankles or went into the, to the foot.

962
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:57,190
You know what's weird is when he got,
they got fat feet and skinny. Oh yeah.

963
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,110
It's like, it's like someone was
at, you know the carnival, right.

964
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:04,800
We slam the hammer down and trying to
win that prize and the hit a mid feet.

965
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,290
Right.
You've heard Corey Holcomb's

966
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:12,900
fucking underrated comedian.
Absolutely underrated in my fucking head.

967
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:16,470
But uh, he, he felt welcome.
You have a fuck the fat girl.

968
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:19,680
We're regular people legs, but God
damn, I just fucked the hamburger.

969
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,920
That's usually an alcoholic body.

970
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:33,100
There was a guy that I used to work
with who I found out recently died,

971
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:36,650
which wasn't a surprise.
He was like the biggest booze hound coke.

972
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,380
He was like six, five. It was funny,
man. He was just big, just like, dude,

973
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:45,880
his legs were skinny as mine and he
would push his jeans down and just up top

974
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:46,714
was all,

975
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:51,810
was just all booze and burgers
and he said hello and uh,

976
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,350
and he had the little skinny hit, but
he had like his arms and legs was like,

977
00:56:56,351 --> 00:57:00,010
he never worked out in his life was just
skinny as shit and he just kept all of

978
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:02,350
that stuff there again. Well, I
think he died of a heart attack.

979
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:06,970
That's it right there. Which is why
going back to this guy, it's just like,

980
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:08,950
that's another thing you have to look at.
Going to be like,

981
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:12,370
I'm going to be a
widower in my mid fifties

982
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:17,360
there's gotta be an exercise video just
to get rid of your flat feet or at least

983
00:57:17,361 --> 00:57:19,970
to fatten up your toes, right?
You should get like, no,

984
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,120
you should get like the acid injections
in your toes just to fucking even it out,

985
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:28,630
you know? Um, all right, here
we go. Ladies. Get deprived to,

986
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:33,490
how are we doing on time? Oh, good.
Killing it. We're right on schedule here.

987
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,710
All right ladies,
get deprived to dear bill.

988
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:40,630
I am a lady in my late twenties and I
need a male perspective on something

989
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:44,530
that's too embarrassing to bring up with
my friends. All right. On a good day,

990
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,000
one might consider me quite easy
on the eyes. I exercise every day.

991
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:53,710
I have a natural look, I. E. Not
trashy, 20 layers of makeup kind of Gal.

992
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:58,450
However, I always make a case of
looking well put together even at home.

993
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,010
See, she gets it. However, my
husband's a fat fuck anyways,

994
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:07,450
but for some reason in the last
year of my five year marriage,

995
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:12,040
my husband denies me sex.
Even if I only want to service him.

996
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:16,330
He knows I like to do it. Geez. He's like,
don't you want a job? Yeah, this is bad.

997
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,060
Uh, yeah. This is bad.

998
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:21,430
This is when you're not going to start
taking off the police tape and getting

999
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,190
out the blanket too to take
a blow job from another dude.

1000
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:32,090
I Dunno about that. All right. On
any given evening he will be a,

1001
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,880
it's not the mouth,
dude. It's the stubble.

1002
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,680
I think that that's what
you couldn't get past.

1003
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,800
I almost got need to do a spit
take on any given evening.

1004
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:43,510
He will be sitting on his desk working
late and if I try to initiate things by

1005
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:47,170
touching him and kissing his
neck, he will say, sorry babe,

1006
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:51,040
it's too late and I'm tired.
Same goes for when we are in bed.

1007
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,540
It has gotten to the point where I just,
you know what,

1008
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,340
I got this paranoid thing just
cheating like a month ago. Huh?

1009
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:02,430
Either that or he got replaced by a robot
and the days they haven't worked out

1010
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:06,370
the genitals yet. Sorry Babe.
It's too late and I'm tired

1011
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:12,640
and we're throwing their voice. Um,
same goes for when we are in bed.

1012
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,750
It's gotten to the point where I
will try to approach him in lingerie,

1013
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,680
sit on his lap and even go as far
as begging for just five minutes.

1014
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,400
All any success.

1015
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:28,160
Uh Oh, this is like, this
is one of these things.

1016
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,060
If it was a new story,

1017
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:31,640
I would shut it off cause I don't want
to see the fucking ending. Here we go.

1018
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,360
What baffles me is that
during normal day to day life,

1019
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,500
he will frequently grab my
ass or tell me I'm hot. Wow.

1020
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,240
I also do the same for him as I know men
like to feel manly around their lady.

1021
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,590
This woman is like a dream.

1022
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:49,720
I don't know what's this guy's problem
is the possibility of NFL. Okay.

1023
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,940
The possibility. She said she's,
you know, she's easy on the eyes.

1024
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,990
She takes care of herself. Yeah. I
Dunno, I got a nice picture in my head.

1025
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,670
Um, anyways, the possibility
of an affair is very unlikely.

1026
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:06,530
Seeing as we both work on the same male
dominated company that's not good and go

1027
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:11,150
home together. Um, also he doesn't
have a password in his phone.

1028
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,410
I think maybe he's gay male dominated.
I know something wrong with him also.

1029
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,660
He doesn't have a password in his phone,

1030
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:20,300
which is another huge
indication of nothing to hide.

1031
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:25,070
We have a very nice interaction.
I never nag him. If anything,

1032
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:30,071
he nags me and we do cool stuff like
play ball together or watch some Netflix.

1033
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,500
It was Dick don't work no more. You
don't want to tell her yet. Yeah.

1034
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,790
You need to sit down and talk to him.

1035
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,090
He's a very loving husband except
for the actual physical loving part.

1036
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,920
I've tried to ask, but
everything is fine. Uh,

1037
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,650
everything is fine isn't
as it appears a bill.

1038
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:47,600
Could you please let me know
what the Hell's going on?

1039
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,400
Aren't men supposed to be always in
the mood? Uh, that's not true. But, uh,

1040
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,430
generally speaking,
yes,

1041
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:56,930
I am going crazy and I'm starting to get
aroused from the most ridiculous thing

1042
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,290
like men's smiling at
me or opening the door.

1043
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,970
Jesus,
thank you.

1044
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:07,430
I really enjoy everything you're
doing contrary to what you think.

1045
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:10,250
You are very balanced and insightful
in your opinions. Look at this.

1046
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,210
I got to read that to my wife.

1047
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,910
Happy fucking holidays and
go fucking fuck yourself.

1048
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:18,320
One itching lady itching
to get fucked. Uh, listen,

1049
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,020
I think you've been nice for long enough.

1050
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:25,670
Exactly where you need to sit down and
be like, look or leave him. No, no, no.

1051
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:27,650
You've got to have the conversation
before first I said, yeah, of course.

1052
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,970
What is going on?

1053
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,160
Because you know I'm about ready to
get jumped on a rolling pin. Exactly.

1054
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,490
What the fuck are you doing it you need,
you need, you guys need to have a talk.

1055
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,740
Need to go on.
And I wouldn't,

1056
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:45,290
I would go nice because just in case
it is some physical thing you got to go

1057
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,680
nice first year. But now maybe, maybe,

1058
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:52,330
maybe he's addicted to
online porn as a problem man.

1059
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,440
But that definitely can't
continue what they're doing.

1060
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,930
They seem like they're around
each other the whole time.

1061
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,180
I don't know what's going on.
You get a lot of,

1062
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:05,000
you have a lot of weird stuff. Yeah. All
right. Need Advice? Quitting drinking.

1063
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:08,030
So I wouldn't, I guess our advices, I
w I would sit down and talk to them.

1064
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:11,960
Absolutely. You're not being
a nag at all. If anything,

1065
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:15,110
you've been too nice and uh,

1066
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:20,130
I would just go easy just in case it's
something fucking a problem. Yeah.

1067
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,770
Like he got molested as a kid and it
finally came out and now he doesn't like,

1068
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:25,890
did they ever used to go at it
like bunny rabbits? I don't know.

1069
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:26,521
That's a good question.

1070
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:30,030
Did y'all ever used to have like a
real healthy sexual relationship then?

1071
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:34,020
It just fell off a cliff? I,
oh, was it gradual or, yeah.

1072
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,160
I think once you have a kid though,
that that just happened,

1073
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:41,010
like the appeal of going to sleep
is just fucking unbelievable.

1074
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,490
It's unbelief and it's something if you
do it together, like that's your sex.

1075
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,070
Gosh,

1076
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:49,160
we're going to get eight hours.
This is fucking awesome. All right.

1077
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:53,360
Needed vice quitting
drinking. Uh, I know you're,

1078
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,500
I know you're at 100 something odd
days now of no drinking 116 days of not

1079
01:02:59,961 --> 01:03:00,590
drinking.

1080
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:04,670
I'm at a whopping day three and this is
my third attempt in the last two months.

1081
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,870
Take some serious time off.

1082
01:03:05,871 --> 01:03:10,280
Most of my attempt only last three or
four days max because every Friday rolls

1083
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:13,250
around and I can't help
but buy some booze.

1084
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:15,240
I want to quit because
my problem is serious,

1085
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:20,210
not serious enough that I experienced
minor withdrawals like minor shakes,

1086
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:23,930
LG. Oh Wow. If I haven't had a
drink in like 12 to 16 hours,

1087
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:27,860
meaning I'm physically dependent. Yeah.
Dude, this is a great reason to stop.

1088
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,730
It's not serious to the point where
people notice I'm able to keep it under

1089
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:33,950
control, but drinking
everyday needs to stop. Yeah.

1090
01:03:33,951 --> 01:03:36,320
Your what's known as the
intelligent are alcoholics,

1091
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:38,270
so you can fucking what I call you.

1092
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,720
You're a smart guy and your booze and
so you can play shit off and nobody

1093
01:03:41,721 --> 01:03:44,960
notices where they're just
a fucking moron. Everyone's
going to notice. Exactly.

1094
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:49,700
My question for you is how did you go
about filling up the boredom that comes

1095
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,750
with being sober? Oh, what
a great fucking question.

1096
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,360
I feel like I'm drinking a,
when I'm drinking anything.

1097
01:03:56,361 --> 01:03:58,310
It's fun sitting on the couch for hours.

1098
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,760
It's so true on end
watching youtube videos.

1099
01:04:01,761 --> 01:04:05,810
But when I'm sober I've got like 20
minutes tops before on board with whatever

1100
01:04:05,811 --> 01:04:08,430
I'm doing. Also. What was your prop?

1101
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:11,990
Was your problem ever bad enough
that you felt withdrawals? Uh,

1102
01:04:11,991 --> 01:04:15,410
I know how to tape her
pretty well at this point,

1103
01:04:15,411 --> 01:04:20,411
but I have failed so many times that
if you know of any tapering tips,

1104
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,800
basically how to Wean your way off, I
guess. Uh, I'd love to hear them. Ps,

1105
01:04:24,801 --> 01:04:28,940
I've always missed the old overrated
underrated segment you used to do circuit

1106
01:04:28,941 --> 01:04:32,780
2009 ish on the podcast. You should bring
that back or actually bringing it back.

1107
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:37,220
Um, all right. This week we'll bring
it back. Uh, we'll keep doing it.

1108
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,700
And if you guys want to send an
an overrated, underrated. Um,

1109
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,630
I find when I stopped drinking,
like when I stop, it's,

1110
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,630
it's tough for like the first,
uh,

1111
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:53,590
like six to 10 days and what
it is I'm more habit addicted.

1112
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:58,940
Like I just like if, if I'm eating
well, like I'm addicted to go,

1113
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:01,130
I'm going to get a salad.
If I'm eating like shit.

1114
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:03,320
Like if I eat McDonald's the
next day I'm craving McDonald's.

1115
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,730
If I'm drinking then I want to drink.
So it's basically,

1116
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:12,790
I tried to be conscious of those
thoughts in my head and just be like,

1117
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,920
try to get to the next morning,
going tomorrow morning,

1118
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:20,470
what's going to make me happier that I
had a drink right now or that I didn't

1119
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:23,560
and it was always that I didn't. So
I would choose that. That's a good,

1120
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,310
that's a good word.

1121
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,460
I used to do that at the Boston comedy
club when we never really know what she

1122
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:32,070
had. Like I never really seen you drunk
ever back in the day. Uh, yeah, I,

1123
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,690
in the last like, uh, like 15 years,

1124
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:39,010
I gradually just drank more and
more and more and more important.

1125
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:44,350
And then I, uh, I just, I'm
not an alcoholic but I, but
at the amount that I drink,

1126
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:45,250
I absolutely am,

1127
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,640
but I'm one of those guys that can shut
it off and like this guy just sit there

1128
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:52,470
and be like, shows you don't, I can do
it. If I'm not performing arts, I can,

1129
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:56,950
I'll have a drink.
But if I'm performing I need one or two,

1130
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,060
but I'm not an alcoholic but far,
but I have all the problems. I,

1131
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,530
my thing is like, I, uh, if I'm
doing something, I'm doing it.

1132
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,230
So the first thing I do when I sit down
at a bar is I always order a double

1133
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,060
because I'm assuming that they're poor
is you go to the Bart destination,

1134
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:19,430
leaving your house is the bar or like,
how's this Nigga ours after shows?

1135
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Oh by the sumps this this summer it was
becoming like going to the liquor store,

1136
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,560
buying a bottle and always like I was on
the road doing an acting gig and I made

1137
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:32,080
sure I had a bond and I just close
it and I knew I was shutting it down.

1138
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:35,920
So it's just like this is where
it is. Bill, this is bad. Um,

1139
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,090
yeah, it got, it got way, way,

1140
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:43,510
way worse than it ever went as
far as like, what am I doing?

1141
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:47,080
I remember coming home from the set one
night and being excited that the bar was

1142
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:51,700
still open and before I went in there's
no road debt to where where I was

1143
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:55,330
staying.
I was by myself and I ordered a double,

1144
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:58,570
sucked it down and said give me another
double cause I was sort of addicted to

1145
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:02,830
that, that crazy buzz and
then going asleep. I think,

1146
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:03,910
um,

1147
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,780
I like the tube and then the whole time
wanting to stop or wanting to not do it

1148
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:10,480
as much. And that was the only
time there's was first time ever.

1149
01:07:10,481 --> 01:07:14,950
My wife brought it up going on, you know,
you're really drinking a lot and hey,

1150
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:16,690
you're going to snore
and blah blah blah blah.

1151
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:21,050
And then one night I came down to set
up good wife, meet all I can see you.

1152
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:22,840
I know I'm so embarrassed by this.

1153
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:28,290
I came downstairs and I
actually was hiding the glass
of booze on the other side

1154
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,330
when I was coming down the
stairs and I was just like Whoa,

1155
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,020
I'm that guy now how soon before the
bottles in the back of the toilet. But

1156
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,470
I kind of too much of a control freak
to make it happen like that. So,

1157
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,440
but I find like once I go 10 days,
the way I'm wired,

1158
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,220
I could go, it gets easier. In
theory, I could go forever. Okay.

1159
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,050
Cause now it's just something I don't do.

1160
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,720
I'm just like audit the whatever
it is that would, that had its,

1161
01:07:56,721 --> 01:07:58,120
it's fucking claws in me.

1162
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:03,310
It only takes 10 days for how I'm
chemically made up to just be like, yeah.

1163
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:07,180
Like right now I'm 116 days in,
I could easily go a year,

1164
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,010
I could go two years.
I could,

1165
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:12,490
I could like never drink
again for the rest of my life.

1166
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,990
I don't think about it
anymore after the shows. No,

1167
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:20,480
there's certain things that like makes
me just wish I was still drinking. Eh.

1168
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,670
I'm like, what did I see the other
day that was just like, aw man,

1169
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:26,110
I love to do that. Like, uh,

1170
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:29,250
I saw some cool looking bar
and it was just like, man,

1171
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:34,110
I would love to go there at two in the
afternoon and just get fucking drinking

1172
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:37,170
till six get fucking hammered.
But then,

1173
01:08:37,171 --> 01:08:41,160
but now the way it plays out
is renewable flare though.

1174
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:46,430
I know I would jump into Uber and I would
come home drunk to my daughter and I

1175
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:48,660
was like, ah, can't
have that on the resume.

1176
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,380
So that's over.

1177
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,450
So my life also kind of, I'm not
telling this guy needs to have a kid.

1178
01:08:57,451 --> 01:09:01,620
So I would just say what you need to do
is you got to push through that boredom

1179
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,330
and uh,
I put the,

1180
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:08,310
there's so much fun shit that you can
actually fill that time up with that.

1181
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:11,100
It's stuff that you wanted to get good at.
Like,

1182
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,310
like I've always been in the music,
like playing drums and playing guitar.

1183
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:18,300
If you do that instead or
working out like if at night.

1184
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:19,460
Yeah.

1185
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,170
If at night you go out for a jog
instead and then this is nothing,

1186
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:28,050
this is nothing to about not drinking
is the fucking pounds just fall off.

1187
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:30,990
You really, you know, as long as
you don't substitute it with them.

1188
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:33,120
Like I'm going to eat ice cream
so I can get like a sugar rush.

1189
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:36,250
If you actually eat well and you don't
booze, yeah. It just falls off. Yeah.

1190
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,480
It's got nowhere to hide. So, um, I dunno
man, but it sounds like, you know, the,

1191
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:46,080
the shakes and stuff, you're on another
level than I was. So I'm, I, if I was you,

1192
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:47,400
I might even go to a meeting

1193
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,370
as borderline intervention TV show.
What'd you get to shake?

1194
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,380
Yeah, a little bit. I
would go to a meeting,

1195
01:09:52,381 --> 01:09:55,410
just check out a meeting just to go down
there, check it out, sit in the back,

1196
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:58,920
have a fucking doughnut,
whatever the hell they do there.

1197
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:02,340
And just listen to these people's insane
stories that actually make you feel

1198
01:10:02,341 --> 01:10:06,780
better about himself. Self. Exactly. Um,
all right. Okay. Here we go. Overrated.

1199
01:10:06,781 --> 01:10:11,490
Underrated. Bringing this back because
this is something that's, this guy said,

1200
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:12,840
so we actually were going
to do when this week,

1201
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,180
this is something he used to do way
back in the day. 2090 [inaudible] too.

1202
01:10:15,181 --> 01:10:16,800
Overrated. Underrated. It
was the thing of the week.

1203
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:19,590
Whatever you thought was over eight
and whatever was underrated. All right.

1204
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:23,280
Overrated. Texas hold'em. Underrated.

1205
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:26,870
Five Card Stud.
Now here's the deal.

1206
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:31,460
I don't know shit about
cards. Um, I, I don't know.

1207
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:34,160
You got to give me the explanation.
All right. That was a bad,

1208
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:37,970
that was a soft open. I don't know
anything about cars and don't play cards.

1209
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,680
All right.
What do you think is overrated right now?

1210
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,333
Oh,

1211
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,070
this, this topic. No, no.

1212
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,000
What I think is overreading right now,
hip hop.

1213
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,690
Rarely. Yeah. Like th th th th

1214
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:01,140
the not having any words in your song
and it being a quote unquote a classic.

1215
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:05,200
Ours a hot a song for this time and it,

1216
01:11:05,201 --> 01:11:09,550
but 10 years down the road just
guy said nothing. It was just be,

1217
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,490
be in sounds. I was just beaten
then like mumble rap. They don't,

1218
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,780
they don't say anything.

1219
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,400
Oh everybody. Yeah. Everybody sounds like
they're kind of like half in the bag.

1220
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:19,010
Yeah.

1221
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,640
And there's no originality anymore,

1222
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:24,750
but people are still celebrating something
that is less original than it used to

1223
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:26,700
be.
Do you know how old you sound right now?

1224
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,730
The people in your
generation has gangster rap.

1225
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,120
Originality is not old at arrest.

1226
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:38,240
Universal and they don't have any original
that their name's not even different.

1227
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:42,540
How many little rappers do we have?
Little this little, that little,

1228
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:46,170
you can't even name yourself
and the original name. All
right. When did they live?

1229
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:49,950
When did it hip hop lose you? Hmm. Uh,

1230
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,140
probably mid 2000.
No,

1231
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,160
late 2000 late 2000
maybe 2011 12 on and up.

1232
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,890
But not all you want. You hung in
there. Yeah. But not all hip hop night.

1233
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:04,320
You got artists like m and M and nozzle
was still doing what they're supposed to

1234
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,660
do with God.
You're doing like,

1235
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:10,590
that's like me going Yo Zeppelin
and ac DC going back like 20 years.

1236
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:15,080
But those guys are still wrapping those
chaos and it's still relevant and it's

1237
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,540
the words like you got, you can't
have a song. It's instrumental.

1238
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,300
What about the WHO? Who's it?
They got all the awards. Migos.

1239
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:24,660
The meek is at the Migos. I don't even
know him. He throw listened to him.

1240
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,670
I don't even know.
I heard of him,

1241
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:31,671
but I know a lot of rappers name got
little in it and that bugs me little Uzi

1242
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:36,780
Vert and they could just change
your name to original name.

1243
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:41,520
Little Wayne was first and then
everybody else's little bit.

1244
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:45,000
My Tupac and Biggie, they had their
own names. Not that it's original name.

1245
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:50,190
Yeah, he went there. He went
little because there was
already a too short who is,

1246
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:53,970
who is the, uh, the little
person there and uh, uh,

1247
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,890
that fucking guy was that, fuck. I don't
know anybody. There was a guy, Bushwick,

1248
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:03,010
Bill Bush. Yeah, he was, no, he
didn't even say little. No, he was,

1249
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:06,120
he was bleeding with bill several
years from, well, you know,

1250
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,180
these millennials are sensitive.
Okay. I would say overrated.

1251
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:12,750
Being informed is overrated.
Absolutely.

1252
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:17,430
I am off social media is, I don't read
the shit anymore. I post my shit on there,

1253
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,850
but I'm done. Like, oh, I fucking
took a picture of this thing today.

1254
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:25,770
This is the classic classic is going
to take forever to turn my phone on.

1255
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:29,430
Somethings gotta keep going.
Classic fucking like a joke.

1256
01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:32,740
When you forgot the punchline, you just
keep repeating and set up. Oh yeah.

1257
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,940
Shit is crazy. She is crazy
shit. It's crazy. We used to say,

1258
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,630
we used to say when when comic
white comics will lost in their act,

1259
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:44,610
they'd look down and be like, yeah,
yeah, so uh, what else is going on?

1260
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,510
And that shit is crazy.
She just crazy out here.

1261
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:54,600
But you're a good looking crowd. Applause.
But let me now, tonight for the ladies,

1262
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:58,530
ladies, all the strong women in
the crowd, they're always strong.

1263
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,580
Women are always wrong.

1264
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,750
Do that. So I wouldn't bomb
early, like in black rooms.

1265
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:04,540
Like I'll just go give
it up for the ladies and,

1266
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,170
and compliment the crowd of milk.

1267
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,490
So they'd give me at least 30
more seconds not to Boomi. Okay.

1268
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,860
What's the hardest room you ever did?
Sweet.

1269
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:17,150
She's sweet cheeks back to sweet cheeks.
It's not even, I don't think it's like,

1270
01:14:17,151 --> 01:14:21,110
it's just a fucking place to go get
pick up $200. Well the two 50 back then.

1271
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:25,250
Oh yeah. That was literally like fighting
might like Mike Tyson. It's just like,

1272
01:14:25,251 --> 01:14:29,060
all right, if I can survive around I
get, I get my fucking purse. All right.

1273
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:34,010
This is something that somebody tweeted
today about that pipe bomb that went off

1274
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,100
on in the uh, the port
authority has happened.

1275
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,500
Yeah. Am I mean, fortunately nobody
died. They said there was non,

1276
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:45,440
I like non life threatening injuries but
that doesn't mean somebody didn't lose

1277
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:47,690
an eye or fucking hearing or something.

1278
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:51,320
Bomb went off on 23rd street right by
Gotham comedy club and they closed the

1279
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:54,560
street off. I, you going to do a
joke? No. And so just got off stage.

1280
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:58,670
When I got there, they was, the street
was closed off and I actually asked a cop,

1281
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:03,200
but, but I have told because I have a
spot I didn't give a fuck about. Oh Man,

1282
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,690
I just want to do much spot.
Well this is what,

1283
01:15:05,691 --> 01:15:09,560
this is what this fucking jerk off tweets
about the port authority bum. He goes,

1284
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:12,710
I have no idea what's going
on at the port authority,

1285
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,750
but it was chaotic and I did

1286
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,040
state of find out

1287
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:19,980
so you have no idea what's going on.

1288
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:23,250
But we had to find out how you felt
about what you did know was happening.

1289
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,790
Who gives a fuck what you did? People
down there hurt you fucking asshole.

1290
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:30,480
This is what I can't stand. I, I'll be
an old man here about young people now.

1291
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,710
Nobody cares,

1292
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,770
right about every fucking thought
and your stupid fucking headaches.

1293
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:38,220
When you there, did you see what
happened? Do you have any information?

1294
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:39,960
Okay.

1295
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,300
Oh my gosh, I have no idea what's
going on at port authority,

1296
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,970
but it was chaotic and I
didn't stay to find out,

1297
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,910
and then there's going to be a thousand
fucking people going. So happy.

1298
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,650
You're okay. Yeah, exactly. People
just want them. I didn't know.

1299
01:15:51,651 --> 01:15:53,480
So many people want it to be known.

1300
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:55,430
Oh No.
All these fucking people.

1301
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,560
The reason why at least
fucking people on social media,

1302
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,740
it's like they have their own TV show
and they're acting like celebrities,

1303
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,580
self-involved fucking celebrities
as opposed to cool ones like us.

1304
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:08,390
The one who that skill, sorry. Sorry.
All right, last one. Here we go.

1305
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:12,470
How do I tell the truth?
Uh, Hey, bill. Well,

1306
01:16:12,471 --> 01:16:16,670
I've been thinking with my
Dick, I recently downloaded
the popular hookup app,

1307
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:17,750
Tinder,

1308
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:21,380
and I've been using it to fish for some
action with some college chicks in my

1309
01:16:21,381 --> 01:16:24,320
area. I'm pretty good looking
and I'm not bad with chicks,

1310
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,600
so I've had moderate success.

1311
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:30,950
I recently found this one
chick in my area who is,

1312
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:36,560
oh, premed. Is that all
one word? P? R? E? M. E?

1313
01:16:36,561 --> 01:16:40,700
D? No, there'd be. Okay, thank you. All
right. That was like, I knew I was dumb.

1314
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:44,510
I didn't think I was that fucking
dumb. Um, you know what's funny,

1315
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:48,530
that fucking guy who said, the guy who
I was telling this story about it, like,

1316
01:16:48,531 --> 01:16:51,080
you know, funny how like things
going in and out of your ass.

1317
01:16:51,081 --> 01:16:54,200
He just sent me a text.
I'll fucking random sec. Um,

1318
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,950
I recently found this check
in my area who's premed.

1319
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:02,120
I really like spending time with her
and we have the same sense of humor and

1320
01:17:02,121 --> 01:17:05,660
political beliefs and she has an
excellent body and face in short.

1321
01:17:05,661 --> 01:17:09,170
She's pretty close to my ideal
girl. However, there's one problem.

1322
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,230
I'm in high school

1323
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:13,110
and she has no idea. Fuck, fuck this guy.

1324
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,230
Fuck this guy, dude. You Dude, you are a
legend. I, you should be giving me advice.

1325
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:24,480
I have dodged most of our questions
about the classes I take and where I

1326
01:17:24,481 --> 01:17:28,530
couldn't dodge. I lied. Jesus. We
haven't done anything physically,

1327
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:31,800
but she made it cleared. She is
interested in me. I'm in deep bill.

1328
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:35,190
How do I tell her without her hating
me? Uh, do I have to tell her?

1329
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,680
I just fucking tell her. Just say, listen,

1330
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,040
I don't want to go to a physical level
without fucking telling you the truth.

1331
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:44,430
I'm still in high school. I really
liked you. I would have told you sooner,

1332
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:48,030
but I was afraid you weren't gonna like
me. Just do that. Put it out on the table.

1333
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,670
If she tells you to go fuck yourself,
fine.

1334
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:53,190
But you've learned a very
valuable lesson with women,

1335
01:17:53,191 --> 01:17:56,310
which I wish somebody taught me way
back on my teen years, teen years.

1336
01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:00,810
Just tell him the truth. What
are we doing? I wanna fuck you.

1337
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:05,190
I have no intention to having
a relationship with you.
Okay? Most will walk away.

1338
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,083
Some won't.

1339
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,500
But you can literally leave your fucking
car out in the front of your house and

1340
01:18:10,501 --> 01:18:13,270
it will never be keyed.
None of your shit will be lid on.

1341
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:19,080
Yes. That's why when I see
guys who, who, uh, um, um,

1342
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:20,590
damn,
I forgot my train of thought.

1343
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,040
But honesty is always the best policy
because you don't have to worry about

1344
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,920
people getting mad and doing crazy
shit to you. Dude. It works with cops.

1345
01:18:26,921 --> 01:18:30,340
Two cops and women. Nobody lies,
gets lied two more than those two.

1346
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,970
And when you actually come with the truth,
even if they don't like the truth,

1347
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,660
it kind of like, yeah, you might not get
a ticket. That's probably why Patrice,

1348
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,000
the fire that no one, no one,
we didn't get in trouble. Yeah.

1349
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,880
Cause he was fucking
honest about what happened.

1350
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,780
The only time I fucking bang this, you
turn right. And on Fridays I did it.

1351
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,340
Just fucking cop got out of his car and
I'm, as I'm pulling up and thinking, wow,

1352
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,101
maybe he didn't see it.

1353
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:54,640
He's just coincidentally getting out and
he walks right up to my window. He goes,

1354
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:58,270
let me see your driver's
license and registration. I
was like, yeah, fuck. He goes,

1355
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:02,410
uh, he goes, you know why I'm asking for
that? And I was like, yeah. He goes, why?

1356
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:06,610
I go, because I just made an
illegal uturn. And he goes,
why did you do that? I go,

1357
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:09,130
because I'm impatient and I didn't
want to wait in that line in there.

1358
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,220
And he just laughed and he goes,
do you want me to give you,

1359
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:15,130
what do you want me to give
you a ticket? And I said, no,

1360
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:18,130
but I'm not going to lie to you. Right.
And he laughed again. He goes, all right,

1361
01:19:18,131 --> 01:19:21,370
get out of here. I said, you're
awesome. Right. That was it.

1362
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,800
Then other times I've told the truth
and like all the way to the point,

1363
01:19:26,801 --> 01:19:28,720
is this your current address?
And I said No.

1364
01:19:28,721 --> 01:19:31,660
And the guy wrote me up for everything
and my fucking address and I was like,

1365
01:19:31,661 --> 01:19:33,640
this motherfucker.
He trying to get

1366
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:37,190
fucking cop of the month. Like I did
that in western New York. All right.

1367
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:38,970
We're out of time.
Um,

1368
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:43,610
Harris. Yes. So great to see
you once again, your album,

1369
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,380
my comedy album is coming out.

Thank you so much for stopping by. Thank
you for being on the podcast. Everybody.

1376
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:08,010
Uh, I forgot to mention

1377
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,280

the Great Steve Simone and regular hero
are raising money again this year for

1379
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:19,590
children fighting cancer
and their families. Um,

1380
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,600
that's worded really weird.

1381
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:24,690
They're fighting cancer and the families
of the children fighting cancer.

families fighting cancer.

01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:41,330
A Monday morning podcast listeners helped
raise 15 grand last month and it had a

1387
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:45,270
huge impact on a lot of families. The
stories are brutal and every bit helps.

1388
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,360
We're going to save you the
fucking stories. Okay. Uh,
