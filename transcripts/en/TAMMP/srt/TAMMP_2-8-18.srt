1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,830
Hey, what's going on is bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:07,180
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,490
just checking in on. You
see now your week's going. I
know your week's going great.

4
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:23,720
And Philly right now. She'd not a sports
fan then. You probably all upset it.

5
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:27,650
Everybody's all excited running around,
tearing up the streets sides,

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,670
you know,
eating horse shit.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,940
I felt bad for that Philly fan that had
to eat horse shit. You know what I mean?

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,470
It's just all the shit that
diff fans have gotten, you know,

9
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:43,820
attention for like the bar has just been
set so high that this poor bastard that

10
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:47,900
was through, he was like
out of ideas, you know,

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,330
you know where it is as far
as bad behavior, you know,

12
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,310
or Philly fans are right now.
It's kind of like,

13
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:56,180
remember when they did the dunking contest
every year in the all star game and

14
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,800
at first it was amazing, you know, so we'd
just like takes off from the foul line.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,110
It's like, Holy Shit. You
know, the next thing you know,

16
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:07,700
you've got to have like some fucking
quivering fucking woman standing there and

17
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,180
you got to jump and your balls have to
just scrape the top of her fucking head

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,750
while you covered your eyes
like Dee Brown. You know,

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,200
that's kind of like where
eagles fans had flyers, fans.

20
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,910
All Philly fans are as far as like,

21
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:24,710
how the fuck are we going to get on
ESPN this time? What are we going to do?

22
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,690
Throw up on a kid already did that.
What are we going to do?

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,970
Punch an old lady in the con.
Ah,

24
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:36,680
we've been doing that since
the 70s what does fall, my God,

25
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,350
there's a pile of horse shit.
Ah,

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,750
turn on your fucking video camera.

27
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,910
That didn't even make sense.
I'm not going to put that on eagles fans.

28
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,390
I'm not going to put that on Philly.
I'm in bed is an individual act.

29
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:56,720
That guy wanted to do that
shit for the longest time.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,440
He just needed an excuse.
You know what I mean?

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,170
It's like all of us, most of us have
never eaten another human being. Right.

32
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,780
But put in the right situation,
you'd fucking do it. Right.

33
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,850
What was that movie alive plane
crashes in the rocky mountains.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,970
You know, they're right next
to aspen, but they're all rich,

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,300
so they're not going to help out.
It wouldn't give them a sandwich.

36
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:21,740
And next thing you know,
they're eating each other.

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,950
There's this have to do with Eaton.

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,930
Why the fuck did this have
to do with eating horse shit?

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,450
I was trying to think where they
actually landed. Where was it?

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,710
They didn't land the crashed.

41
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,280
I would actually be upset if I survived
that. You know, like you're like,

42
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,600
Oh fuck, I'm gonna die. Right.

43
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,420
And then you fucking survive me on top
of that mountain freeze and you fucking

44
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:44,600
ass off then you wish you did.
Um,

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,790
anyways. Anyways, um,

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,280
I actually was finally able to look at
some of the highlights because I really

47
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,070
wanted to see eagles fans celebrating.

48
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:58,520
I just couldn't handle it cause
they'd beat my team. And, um,

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,070
I believe I said,
you know,

50
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,300
on the podcasts and towards the end of
December that if the Patriots get bounced

51
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,820
out of the playoffs, I was going
to root for the fucking eagles,

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,130
just cause you know, they
had one, one, like I said,

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
I really don't have
anything I wanted to say.

54
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:16,400
I forgot to say that on Conan because
so many people fucking reached out,

55
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:16,760
you know,

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,330
Twitter and all of this crap because of
my Philly rent thinking I really didn't

57
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:24,140
want the eagles to ever win one. And all
of it. It's just I got booed in Philly.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,740
I made fun of Philly.
If I got booed in Texas,

59
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,780
I would have made fun of pickup trucks
and women who wear too much makeup.

60
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,270
You know, when you dumb fucking
boots walking around. All right,

61
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:38,630
if you've got a flat screen TV and
not a fucking cowboy, all right.

62
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:40,370
You look like you're on
your way to a gay bar.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,970
I would've said something like that in
Texas. That's what I would've done. Oh,

64
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:46,990
look who's here.
They'll love bleed knee.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,900
The fuck are you eating?
What are those things called?

66
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,240
Panoramas alright, take it
down. Take it down a bit. Hey,

67
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,880
that's when you know your wife's here.
Hey, what are you having a good time?

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Take it down a bit. I'm eating pomegranate
seeds. I'm eating pomegranate seeds.

69
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,240
I heard they're good for my
ovaries and my lady parts. They do.

70
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,670
I heard, I read that this post to shine
up the advantage lips over there. Oh baby.

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,840
You know it's weird. Has
a weird segue, you know,

72
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,500
a year ago or so when I didn't have a kid,
oh,

73
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,620
we'll go back a year and a half when you
didn't get yourself knocked up. Right.

74
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,610
Um, I would just be walking around the
house that would be singing whatever

75
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:31,490
contemporary shit that you know,
you would listen to to, you know,

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,260
did she say why gold and Michelle
fiber that some bum, right.

77
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:37,960
I'd been singing that shit. Right. Okay.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,280
Then now that we have a kid down
there brushing my teeth going right,

79
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,120
whoa.
Bab Arena.

80
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,760
I may be blue with Koi tea tea's Whoa,

81
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,250
arena,
but I'm not so different in Daddy.

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,610
Yeah. What happened? What happened to me?

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,220
A pop up a puppy dog

84
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,690
close when they're going through,
when they go on the adventure.

85
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:08,470
How's the song go? Go in on a
mission, not a mission that's

86
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,510
going on. A mission going on
a mission. That's true. Sure

87
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,850
about. Ooh, what? Oh, I was,
that's why I brought you on.

88
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,410
Yeah. Yeah. Those are me undies
beyond these sent matching,

89
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,150
matching. Underwears I love
it. They're so cute. What's,

90
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,490
what's on this a Taco with hot sauce.
You get it.

91
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,350
Do you need to be explained that
hearing these on Valentine's Day,

92
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,600
I may make him be fun in front of me
for being a redhead. I didn't make it.

93
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,740
Make it fun. Make it be fun of me
for being a redhead. What though?

94
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:49,190
What the hot sauce did you see the text
that I sent you that now they're going

95
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:53,000
to have red hand emojis in June? Uh, yeah.

96
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,310
Which I just think it's going
to lead to more redheaded hate.

97
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,080
The thing about being a redhead is what
you want to do is not stand next to

98
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,720
another red head. You want to sort
of like fade into the background.

99
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,300
But you know what, you don't really,
you're not going to use those.

100
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:09,000
But they also have, um, bald, bald
emojis. Do they have a bald what?

101
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,580
The Red Beard?
I don't know if the baldy has facial hair.

102
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,050
When am I ever going to
fit in my whole life? Oh,

103
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,310
when are you ever be represented?
No.

104
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,400
You realize how difficult it is
to be a redheaded white male.

105
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,420
He's so close to the brass ring,
but those blue blood and what?

106
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:28,480
They won't let me get to know Jesus.
I am like the lazy,

107
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,420
I'm like the runt of the litter. The
one that the mother rejects. Yeah.

108
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:34,960
You're the real underdog. Um,
I hate when you do you? Yeah,

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,340
you're the real law under the, why
don't you just do it in a giant fucking,

110
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:43,630
I roll with that.
There it is a meme level.

111
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,230
It looks beautiful outside. So why
don't you put on your underwear, Nini?

112
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,470
I want to see you in those.
I want to wear it on Valentine's Day.

113
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,050
We have to both where I'm Valentine's Day.
No we don't.

114
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,910
That's why they get cause.
I'm going to,

115
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,170
I'm an adult and I can make my own
choices despite the fact that you know

116
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:03,460
something. What's killing me? Can
you just wear your taco underwear?

117
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,310
Can you just have a little
fun and not be so uptight?

118
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,780
Did you just say uptight like we're in
a fucking black and white comedy movie

119
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:15,700
here. He's white and she's black.
She teaches up to loosen up. Huh?

120
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,300
You're really uptight. You're not
uptight. I'm a fucking control freak.

121
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't like people telling me what to do.
It means you're uptight.

122
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,380
If you're a control freak,
that means you're uptight.
No, it doesn't. Yeah, it does.

123
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,470
Oh, black people uptight because a sick
of white people fucking running shit.

124
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,570
What does that have to do with anything
that troll did Janet Jackson do a whole

125
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,040
fucking album about that?

126
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,790
Why am I here? Because I want you
to see the match and underwear.

127
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,460
I thought you'd have fun with
it rather than put demands on.

128
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,650
Isn't it enough that I have
to pay for the whole evening?

129
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:54,760
We're celebrating our relationship.
Where is your contribution?

130
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh yeah,
but you supposed to do that.

131
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,480
You supposed to do that. They blowy. Yeah,
but you're supposed to want to do that.

132
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,360
That's the question. No money.
And you're burning calories.

133
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:13,340
Ridiculous burning
calories. What do you, what?

134
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,370
It's an aerobic exercise
if done correctly. Oh,

135
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,300
whoa.
Getting a blow.

136
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,460
We were wearing matching underwear.

137
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,660
Don't fuse those two worlds
together. I will. And I just did.

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,670
MMM. It's because of that world
that you now have a new world.

139
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,070
Okay. There you go. Okay. By
the way, I, I lovely little one.

140
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,200
Um, oh, she uh, she took her first
steps this week. Oh, it was awesome.

141
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,520
I want to start crying. Yeah, she did.
It's funny. You're going to start crying.

142
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:52,430
I wanted to film it and then fucking
put Aerosmith's walk this way.

143
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,940
Underneath it. Yeah. Be
Time she falls, that debt

144
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,380
ball get, and we'll hit the snare as
when she falls down and arrest. So cute.

145
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,870
She was so proud of herself too.

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,110
I didn't realize babies get like
proud of themselves. Yeah. Like what?

147
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:09,950
She learns how to do stuff. She looks over
and smells like, Huh? Yeah. Look at me.

148
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:14,170
Seeing this. He checking
this out. So cute. Um,

149
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,240
anyway, so, well, let's get down
to what everybody's talking about.

150
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:21,530
The scandalous interview
by a Quincy Jones. Nia. Ah,

151
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,730
Jesus Christ. Iconic and Rbo. I
didn't like it. Of course she's in.

152
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,630
What do you like bill? What a was
popular that you actually enjoy?

153
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,310
What do you mean? There's a bunch of shit
that I like. Chocolate cupcakes. Oh look,

154
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,580
a basket full of puppies. I hate it.
Like what's not? No, that's true.

155
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,510
I like cupcakes.

156
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,690
I actually know how to make them and
I've made you some and I love dogs.

157
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,230
You've never made me a cupcake. You
fucking whore. Put that microphone. Yeah,

158
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,900
that's exactly what I just said.
Excuse me. There's no need for that.

159
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,990
I drove all over the fucking La base and
trying to find you a fucking Yellow Cup

160
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:04,280
cake with chocolate frosting and it
didn't exist and I went out and I fucking

161
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,620
made them for you.
You don't remember that.

162
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,640
You haven't that were in
your life made me cupcakes.

163
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,450
And this is in Los Angeles or in New
York? This is here. Like when the last,

164
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,830
within the last two years.

165
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,590
Give me that microphone off the podcast.
You're up the podcast.

166
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't remember that.
Unbelievable.

167
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,390
You made it and you went out and bought
me cupcakes like late at night when I'd

168
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,500
have like cupcake cravings.

169
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:32,490
But you've never made because that
would mean you'd make it like a dozen

170
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,750
cupcakes because that's how
many were in the pants. Yeah.

171
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,210
And you frosted them and everything.
Yeah. I don't remember this.

172
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:41,570
Okay.

173
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,970
I ain't fucking with me, right? No.
Go into the cupboard and go look.

174
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,420
There's a fucking cupcake tray.
Why would I have one of those?

175
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,610
Uh, that's right. There it is guys.

176
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,290
For years,
the only as good is the last act.

177
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,300
It doesn't mean shit to them.

178
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,840
You know the Patriots are always
just pushing fucking all pros out.

179
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:08,640
The door liners are in there too.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Wow.

180
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,570
Well guess who's not
making cupcakes anymore?

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,780
Maybe I should film it. Well, you make
some for Valentine's Day. No. Why? Why?

182
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,770
Cause you're not going to remember.
And then you can come on a podcast.

183
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,390
You know what?

184
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,030
I made red velvet ones and meanwhile
I'm wearing matching underwear.

185
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,890
I'm playing the game, I'm playing the
game, right. And then I make it cupcakes.

186
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,430
You don't even remember. How dare
you. You look gorgeous. So by the way,

187
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,730
oh name, he's been hitting the
gym and I've been noticing,

188
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,090
I'm trying to keep it together,
keep it together, keep it together.

189
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,500
Do you know my issue is positive
right there. I made you cupcakes.

190
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,620
I said you're looking good. All of that.
Whose wedding? Like about Quincy Jones,

191
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,690
he was talking shit about
people who were dead.

192
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,540
And then everybody took
everything he said is fact.

193
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,300
And it's like you didn't notice
halfway his gold. I know who killed

194
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,270
Kennedy. Oh Shit. You should
have told Oliver Stone.

195
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,320
He wouldn't have wasted all that time
making that movie when he could have just

196
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:06,180
called you up. Um, I
just like when he said,

197
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,250
when you go for the money,
God walks out the room.

198
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,500
That's where like as far as
all that gossip about everybody
else, it's like, dude,

199
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,900
why once you grow up?
Huh?

200
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:14,620
Okay,

201
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,630
well who? Who goes around doing that?
Who just got used to steal songs.

202
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,600
He didn't say that. When you will
make an records with the whip,

203
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,890
he was still fucking alive.

204
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,860
Tell all the stories. This
is what I'm telling you. You
are mad. Cool, cool. Damn it.

205
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:28,720
Old People, my family, they
just, they don't give a fuck.

206
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,250
They're just tell him
stories about everybody.

207
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,340
This person did this and this person
did this and back in the day it was that

208
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,110
because what are they apt to
lose? They're not, you know,

209
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,510
fearful of being politically correct.
Let me get this straight line.

210
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,730
You're not supposed to be.
Yes, you supposed shit.

211
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,680
You're not supposed to be a snitch.

212
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,280
He's supposed to keep your mouth shut
and all of that shit your whole fucking

213
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:52,690
life. He's not in the end when everybody,
do you know what the fuck? I mean,

214
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,100
well,
I dunno how I was brought up.

215
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,770
What'd she didn't do that to
people? It does get stitches. No,

216
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:04,580
not that street shit. Yeah. Like I
said, I don't pop off. I'd flip out,

217
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,090
but even in the hard
streets in the suburbs,

218
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,340
pretty classic line I
think for the podcast.

219
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,910
But I lived in that Culdesac you want
to talk about dead end streets, man,

220
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
you had to go out my suburb

221
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,350
but street ended and all it was was
beautiful woods into a lovely pond

222
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,230
lunch yesterday with mom and she like,
did you hear her?

223
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,690
Like kind of chastised
me for not drinking water

224
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,810
cause it all,
but I wish I could have enjoyed that.

225
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:41,030
Claudia and I drank a whole bunch of
water like the whole entire morning and

226
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:46,451
then automatically they automatically
filled up my glass again for more.

227
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:50,240
All right. In Password. They
just automatically filled
it up and my mom was like,

228
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,890
do you want some water? And
I was like, no, it's okay.

229
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,160
And she like hits me on the arm
just you should be drinking water.

230
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,710
And it's like I drink
water all God damn day La.

231
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,690
It was just a mother's love I guess.
So I just annoyed me anyway.

232
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,530
It has nothing to do a little word. Hey
Nia, you should drink more water. Wow.

233
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,950
I literally drink water all day long.

234
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,310
Nobody notices that system and why
in that moment she had to like,

235
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,810
I dunno. It literally has been bothering
me since yesterday so it doesn't, yeah,

236
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,141
hold on.

237
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,720
I wouldn't have slapped you on the wrist
if I knew it was really bothering you.

238
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,190
It's just annoying. You want to talk
about it, Neil? No, I got it off my chest.

239
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,420
That's what I've learned about women.
You just, Oh, I didn't know that.

240
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:39,220
You just said about women. No,
nothing. You have no instincts.

241
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,470
You have no intuition.

242
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,450
I nailed that whole thing about how you
guys stopped giving compliments when you

243
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:46,900
get married and you even said,
fair enough. I don't remember that.

244
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,930
Of course you don't just like the
cupcakes. You know what's funny?

245
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,050
I'm going to stop doing shit for you.
Just say that I did it.

246
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:57,770
Cause you're not going to remember either
way and you're going to be like, wow,

247
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,890
I must, I can't believe I keep forgetting
that I have the greatest husband ever.

248
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,360
He made me a chocolate
cupcakes. I'll keep, forget

249
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,740
what I, I can't believe that fucking
sat to what? That God damn kitchen aid.

250
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,680
I weren't goddamn apron foil. What do I
get for that? Huh? Nuh Huh? I'm sorry.

251
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:22,670
I can't remember. Oh, look at you. A
little sunflower icon. Isn't that cute?

252
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,710
I've never noticed that.
I think that comes with it.

253
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,670
So what's up? What's up? Why am I here?

254
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,680
Because I want you to see the
underwear and I want you to, you know,

312
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,550
Our anniversary's coming up. Yeah, and we
don't even officially know the date. No,

313
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:18,890
we don't. No, we don't.

314
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,490
I mean,
do we always say it's Valentine's Day?

315
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,380
No, we don't. And we never go
out on Valentine's Day. No.

316
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,950
We usually go out a couple of days after
when the price has come back to some

317
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:33,670
sort of sensible, you know, you
can get a table, right? Bounce.

318
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,620
I say you go to Wendy's at
night, they're like, we're sorry.

319
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,120
It's going to be like a 45 minute wait.

320
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,470
But we never came up with like,

321
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,000
I guess we just now our anniversary is
our wedding date as opposed to like the

322
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:50,050
first time we ever hung out. Right? Yeah.
Neither one of us are big on dates. No,

323
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,480
but in one of us is a
little bigger on cupcakes,

324
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,900
but it was February 14
years ago. Wow. Yup.

325
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,460
That's so crazy.
14 years

326
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,710
still looking.
You still looking great.

327
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:10,220
Now they'll tell you that and I already
knew that until that little little

328
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:15,200
fucking display you just put on.
I'll make you cupcakes.

329
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,260
I knew each other and you look good
too. All right, let's stop this.

330
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,750
This is annoying people.
All right. Thank you.

331
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,420
The Conan O'brien show
for get me on on Monday.

332
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,000
Even though much of it was
painful for me to sit there.

333
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,900
I think a Philly fans deserve that.
You know,

334
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,740
after all this shit they've
got because of that rant,

335
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:33,960
which I said once again was not fun.
It wasn't personal. It was a personal,

336
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,960
it just so long ago too.
It was,

337
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,180
that's the funny thing is now people
that go to another you share you get was,

338
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,300
well, he fucking won one and only took
half a century fucker. You bragging about.

339
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,770
That's like the guy who fucking finishes
a marathon in Lynn, like nine hours.

340
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:48,040
It's like,

341
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,590
yeah dude, I could have walked it
and that, that amount of time. Also,

342
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:54,520
that audience deserves it. Who did
the audience and Villi they deserve?

343
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,270
Yeah, they did. They were
assholes. Yeah, and it was funny.

344
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,650
Most of them probably have kids now and
they're raising little asshole kids,

345
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:06,390
but you know something. Not
all Philly fans. I like that.

346
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,430
I remembered having Shay's a nice
guy. Oh we love you. You know you,

347
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:15,090
I remember those guys aren't always
sunny. Yeah, they're nice guys.

348
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:18,890
I didn't see them do it. Yeah. They
weren't tipping over any cars and stuff.

349
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,890
Oh my God.
Um,

350
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,350
I remember you called me after that
whole thing in Philly happen and you were

351
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,280
like, I have a massive headache.
And I said, what happened? He like,

352
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:31,620
I just got into a fight
with like 10,000 feet.

353
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,920
You did you call me right
after it happened. I'll never
forget it. And I was like,

354
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,960
oh my God. Whoa. And then
it just blew up. And I think

355
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,741
that's right.

356
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,710
You were at my apartment that I was when
I rode home with Bobby Kelly and he's

357
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:49,970
going to judge Whitehead tonight.
Kid. Yeah. I was like, Bobby,

358
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:54,890
I've got a headache. Yeah. Does
people, they go back and shells get,

359
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,770
you know what Bobby Kelly
had to follow that night?

360
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,980
Bobby Kelly had to go on after
the intermission where they,

361
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,830
somebody was an ear infection.
Drained it. Somebody else drank it.

362
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,720
And somebody who watched it.
Cute.

363
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,340
This is in Philly?
Yeah.

364
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,610
What is going on with the P and
let that guy that he'd horse shit.

365
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,930
Like what is going on? No, no,
no, no. Well, what is going
on over there? Seriously.

366
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,730
You know what happened to Philly was
when they built night interstate 95 they,

367
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,920
they got bypassed.
Okay.

368
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,430
So I just think that
they're just stuck in time

369
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,640
back in a time when people ate horse
shit. I don't know. I don't know why.

370
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,260
I think there's something there.

371
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,900
There's either some sacred burial
ground that they built the city on,

372
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,620
or there's some sort of toxic waste,
like the Simpsons thing going on.

373
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:44,730
I don't know what their deal is,

374
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:48,570
but all I know is they don't care that
people don't like them and they're proud

375
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:50,520
of their behaviors.
So I say God bless him.

376
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,270
There's some really amazing people
though, and affiliate. Right?

377
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,900
If you had the Horse Shit, uh, the roots,

378
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,210
that's not a person, Jill
Scott. It's a band. Um,

379
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,470
all the black people

380
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,540
I know. You're like really racist,
Huh? Kevin Hart. Keith Robinson.

381
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,390
Kevin Hart. Yeah. I didn't

382
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,900
know that he sold out the Eagle
Stadium. Yeah. And he was,

383
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,690
he did stand up in a fucking football.
So funny. He was so happy after they won.

384
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,260
You saw him on TV drunk. So I can,
but I know that sounded hilarious,

385
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:28,760
so it was pretty great. It was pretty
great. He was very happy. Yeah.

386
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:31,430
So that's the deal. I'm, what
am I going to get mad? You know,

387
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:36,280
my team can't win it every
year. Right, right. I know.

388
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,720
I think you're very gracious about it.
You like,

389
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,950
that's the one thing you've actually
mellowed out about as the years have gone

390
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:45,500
by. I mean, I can't, it
compliments, go ahead boards.

391
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,900
That's the one thing I can actually say.
I see you

392
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,940
improvement on the rest of it is
taking a fucking nose dive now.

393
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,050
You're very gracious when it
comes other teams. Yeah. I don't,

394
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:02,610
I don't take it to the point of like,
like I said, I just, you know, what's his,

395
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,510
I retweeted that, that uh,
nick foals audio in the, uh,

396
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,020
in, in the huddle was great. Other than
he said, I love you guys. And just like,

397
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,610
why does everything have
to be so fucking sweet now

398
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,010
I would love to tell a boy,
nick,

399
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,830
I would advise your responses
in a huddle in an NFL game.

400
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,220
I mean,

401
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,180
I would've loved to have had teleported
him back to that fucking 1980 Superbowl

402
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,960
team when they were playing the Raiders
and just be okay before we do this first

403
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:35,080
place. When to say, I love you guys. I
just said, well, we'll put Montgomery,

404
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,980
look at him when they win the Superbowl
and stop. He can't say, I love you too.

405
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,780
Now when I was not,
when I was a kid,

406
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,783
didn't,

407
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,950
they didn't think anybody.

408
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:47,250
Actually the cra had emotions when you
were a kid and then all of a sudden it's

409
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:50,250
a new millennial thing to
have emotion and express them.

410
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Men did not cry when I
was a kid that I saw,

411
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,890
I saw the Celtics went three
championships. I saw the Lakers went five.

412
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,040
I saw the Pistons went to,
you know,

413
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,990
the first time I think I
saw a guide cry was Jordan.

414
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:09,950
It was because his dad died and he
wasn't there and that was understandable.

415
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,070
You know what I mean?
But he didn't just cry because he won.

416
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,250
He said that angry look on his face going
like five fucking six and you always

417
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,660
seem to win it on the road.
And you know,

418
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,120
he's looking at some little kid
who was crying. He got off on it,

419
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,850
he got off on PNB. That's what
a man was back then. Okay.

420
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,150
Um, first of all, just want
to say, I love you guys

421
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,800
want to just take time to just,

422
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,790
everybody knows how much
weight to offensive line is
lost. You guys, you know,

423
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:41,990
you were really,
you know,

424
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,580
I dare you coming out of your football
pants the beginning of the year and now

425
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,910
just looking so shapely,
dare you and your next show.

426
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,600
What's the show when you say goodnight?
I dare you to say I love you guys.

427
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,420
Goodnight. I dare you to
say it. Oh, you kidding me?

428
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,620
I would fucking do that per 10 minutes
until everybody just got so on,

429
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,140
so uncomfortable

430
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,830
and left. I want you to
do it shows over. But uh,

431
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:07,340
I just want to take some time. You'd
just speak from the heart. You know,

432
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,640
my life has changed a lot in the
last year and in a great way.

433
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,970
I became a father and I look at the
world at different time, different way,

434
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:17,400
and I've noticed the whole thing.
You can just be like, all right, no,

435
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,740
it has to be a big thing because then
they're going to expect that there's going

436
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:24,200
to be this punchline that never comes.
Right.

437
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,890
And this is going on and on about
how much love you have in your heart.

438
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:31,670
And don't forget to look at this.
Don't forget to look at the sky today,

439
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,550
everybody, you know, it's those little
things that we take for granted.

440
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,970
If you get some of that fucking
pomegranate and my jacket. Oh, all right.

441
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,260
He was in my jacket is a table.
Yeah. I'm telling you now.

442
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:44,310
The second this podcast

443
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,670
is over,
we're going to do a dry run.

444
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:49,200
It puts you a little fucking booty
shorts on just to make sure we're,

445
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:52,840
as we're in sync.
Oh,

446
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,370
was that was in another life.
I was a the new kids. Yeah.

447
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,060
I'm going to said the right boys.
I can I keep this?

448
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,710
Darryl's. Oh, Joseph Maton sign away.

449
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,080
The rights stuff. You got the
red stuff. That's right babe.

450
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,710
Okay, well I think that
might be where you turn me.

451
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,590
Yeah.

452
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,150
Sorry,
I didn't mean to keep going.

453
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,830
Yeah, but you were of that age, those
boy bands, they caught you, right?

454
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,100
Miss Dead Telephoto. Yes. New Edition.

455
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,230
And then you know the white new edition
also known as new kids on the block.

456
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,400
And wait a minute,
wait a minute.

457
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,830
Are you talking about the
Osmonds came before new edition?

458
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,910
No new edition. Had the same manager.

459
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,421
Okay.

460
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:51,100
As new kids on the block and their
manager at Maurice Starr said he wanted to

461
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:55,510
make a white pop crossover version
of new edition that don't get mad,

462
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,270
don't get mad at white people.
It was a black guy's ideas who said,

463
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:01,770
I'm mad at white people. And you
were doing that fucking Elvis Shit.

464
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,960
New Kids on the block have always given
props and respect to new edition their

465
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,270
whole entire careers.

466
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,920
That's good because I would hate to
know that those two bands are fighting.

467
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,170
Okay.

468
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,550
I'm just saying it's, it's a nice thing.
All right, well you have a new addition.

469
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:21,880
Got Screwed. They really,
really did big time,

470
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,300
so it's just nice that new kids on
the block has always given them their,

471
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:26,134
their props.

472
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,370
Okay.

473
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,110
Okay. Why? Why get all weird?
Not Weird. It feels weird.

474
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,010
Well, that's because you live in a
place of fucking awkwardness and anger.

475
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,810
Can I ask you a question? Do you
know what to tell you about my issue?

476
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,390
Question sincerely.
Is it ever you,

477
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,110
is it always me and my world of
awkwardness and anger and negativity,

478
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:54,820
as you say, fucking unbelievable. If
you guys, of course she said to me,

479
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,660
I woke up this morning,
but I do what I do.

480
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,850
I fucking change my daughter's diaper.
Right?

481
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,310
Okay.

482
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,440
The hanging out with her,
I'm watching cartoons.

483
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:06,420
It's all the great shit that had
done today and this is what we, all,

484
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:10,650
she all she talks about how
she just just dials into is my,

485
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,090
is my fucking anger.
Right.

486
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:15,510
And I haven't even been lost my shit yet
today except when it burned my hand in

487
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:19,060
the kitchen, which is not why
I yelled. Fuck. That was why?

488
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,830
Because I was putting the fucking
Keno into my thermos and you know,

489
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,230
and it always falls down in between.
That's a stupid harness.

490
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,020
And you said that's why you
screaming obscenity? Yeah,

491
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,590
cause I went out before it fell off the
spoon and went all the way down anyway

492
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:37,830
to clean it up and I just went fuck. And
you were in the other room, you're like,

493
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:40,380
whoa.
I was like a burned my hand.

494
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,100
No, you're a sweetheart because you've
just given me a bunch of compliments and I

495
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:51,880
love you and you're fantastic. Yeah.
That's really, doesn't hold any water.

496
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,170
Been trashing me. But you've been the
last three times were on the podcast.

497
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,710
You make it sound like you're emotionally
held captive here when you're running

498
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,190
the deal. Yeah. Puts into that laugh.

499
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,880
That is the laugh of somebody that's
running a fucking relationship. All right.

500
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:11,881
That's the podcast for this
week is a very happy anniversary

501
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,070
anniversary. Uh, sit today.
Just be our anniversary.

502
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,100
All right. Why can't we just say the
seventh? I'll remember that. Well,

503
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:27,820
what day is today? Well, it's the eighth.

504
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,070
So it was yesterday.

505
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,240
What kind of life are you leading that
you don't even know what fucking Datas.

506
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,460
We have the nerve to talk about me. What
month is it? Quick, quick. There you go.

507
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,920
Show a history monster and you'd be
like lighting a candle every day.

508
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,350
Don't they make a giant Black Menorah with
28 candles and science Blackman. Nora.

509
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,280
Yeah, no, I know. Then our,

510
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,300
this day in 1932 I'm reading stories a
little every day about African Americans

511
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
and Americans and that did the shill lace,

512
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
which was later taken credit was taken
by the light bed and actually it was

513
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:10,180
three women who were good
at math of African descent.

514
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,430
February 9th

515
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,260
the first steam ship was actually built
by a native American African Blood

516
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,850
Robert Fault and killed that person
that said, I invented the steam ship.

517
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,780
This happened February 9th,
1845.

518
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,800
I said it.
February 9th,

519
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,150
eight eight Oh four Thomas
Jefferson finally gave into
his desires and hopefully

520
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:46,840
it was her desire to, but that's not
how it worked back then. Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,940
Where are you performing next?
Um,

522

Uh, something like that. Um,

524
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,070
that's on February 20th. My next
one is going to be in Santa Barbara,

525
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:03,941
Santa Barbara,

526
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:08,941
which was actually an African American
named it and 1970 til like people took it

527
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:13,240
over because they liked the
view of the beach. Are you a,

528
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:16,570
are you flying to Santa Barbara
and me decided, yes I am.

529
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,370
I'm frying playing a helio copter
out there. Are you chilled? Yo,

530
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,940
meet there and then flying back.
So can I come?

531
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,470
There's no room for you.
What do you mean there's no room?

532
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:34,360
There's no wrong blue and the
copilot and the opener. Yeah. Okay.

533
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,020
Well I guess that's that then.
Oh two openers to open up.

534
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,670
The still flying out there.
One them is as he,

535
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:42,920
and I'm going to be fucking dying laughing
cause he hates to fly and it's going

536
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,390
to freak them out that I'm on controls.

537
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:46,100
Even though we're going
to have the copilot there,

538
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:49,280
he's going to be freaking tell
whoever the other person is.

539
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:53,690
It's coming with you to film him. Oh
yeah. When we first go into a habit,

540
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:54,900
because you know when the
first time you go into Howard,

541
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,540
this one of the weirdest feelings ever,

542
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,830
other than realizing that you
were attracted to me 15 years ago,

543
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,650
14 years ago, it must have
been, am I attracted to that
orange headed Weirdo? Um,

544
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,160
so negative. Well, that's
nice. Nice. That's a nice dog.

545
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,830
And You wonder why I live in a world
of anger and awkwardness. No, no. The,

546
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,200
when I first saw you,
the first time ever,

547
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,810
I saw your freckles really
handsome and I was like,

548
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,540
oh, what were you like? That's,

549
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,040
that's what I always know,
like five years later.

550
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,910
So it was meant to be, oh,
you like me. I saw, I met,

551
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,920
I met my wife in an alley behind the
first one in an alley behind the Apollo.

552
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,750
Yeah, that's the first I
was going into do fish area.

553
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,630
It was going in to do showtime at
the Apollo. My Dad had booked you on,

554
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:50,240
it's showtime at the Apollo.
My Dad used to book the Comedians on it,

555
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:55,220
show Timothy Paulo. My Dad is actually
known bill longer than I have. And, um,

556
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,260
I saw, he was like, oh,

557
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:02,210
I got this funny wipe away from Boston
on the show. And I was like, okay,

558
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:02,571
cool.

559
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:06,890
I had just graduated from college and I
went back there and you said hi briefly.

560
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,410
And I was like, oh, he's
really good looking.

561
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,950
And then when I saw you years later on,
tough crowd,

562
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,980
I immediately recognize
you. I was like, oh my God,

563
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:19,550
that's the guy that I met at
the Apollo with my dad, Jen.

564
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:23,570
And you were such a jerk to me. I
wasn't, I kept trying to ask you,

565
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,990
he was such an asshole. No,
that's not how it went at all.

566
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:29,540
I wouldn't even look at me if you were
in the elevator. I was looking over it.

567
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:29,961
I was like,

568
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:32,330
think of something to say something
with something saying he was staring

569
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:35,750
straight ahead like those fucking guys
in London with the big furry hats.

570
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,380
Expressionless trying to play hard to get,

571
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,460
but you also had a girlfriend at the
time and I had a boyfriend. No, I didn't.

572
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah, you did. I thought
I did. No, you did.

573
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,580
And then when we ran into each other
at the party for Chappelle show,

574
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,530
that's when you told me you
didn't have a girlfriend,

575
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:54,440
but when we first met you did
have it in fucking asked you why?

576
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:57,680
When I had a girlfriend I know.
Well then all right then and I'll buy,

577
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,410
but you were still looking
at so what I can look,

578
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,010
I was looking to,
even though I had a boyfriend,

579
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,810
but we didn't do anything until after
we were both still after. Exactly. Yeah.

580
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,610
Jesus. That's all you're going to go
all Quincy Jones there. Oh listen.

581
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,160
When you guy kicked the bucket and kicked
the plug that you wait til the week.

582
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,140
I would never do that to you, but I
do. I don't. Why would I give a shit?

583
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:27,380
I be dead. I had to imagine myself.
No, I don't want to, first of all,

584
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:30,140
I don't ever want to think about your
time before me. That would be too much.

585
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,630
Well, it's going to happen. I'm 10
years older than you and I'm a guy,

586
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,920
but I do take better care of myself.
Then you do. Wait, what I do,

587
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,080
I do the elliptical.

588
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,530
I swear to God you eat Kina war for
three weeks and you think you're some

589
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:45,130
fucking like health,
like you really need to knock it off.

590
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:52,330
Fair enough. You're like, Oh
wow, you don't want to have
so much energy. Yes bill,

591
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:55,990
we are all aware of like the health
benefits of joining or jealous of my new

592
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:57,070
healthy diet.

593
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,810
I'm not jealous you are you always nosing
around like a little fucking rabbit.

594
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,040
We didn't know was wiggling like wait,
what are you eating over there?

595
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,240
What are you going over there?

596
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,240
I'm just curious what you're
doing. Cause Yeah, you're,

597
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:11,650
you're doing really well with your diet
and stuff but I just think be like we're

598
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:15,450
the first person that discovered Keana
was the way you go on and on about and

599
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:17,260
not what I think.
What do you think?

600
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,610
I think I went to the dentist yesterday
and found out that I was supposed to do

601
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:23,530
16 weeks of Invisalign,

602
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:27,790
but because I've left these things in
sometimes even during shows spitting on

603
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,700
the front too. Fucking rose cause
I want to get this over with.

604
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:35,110
He says it's only going to be 13 weeks,
and I just put in train number nine,

605
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,313
bitch,

606
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,060
I got another month to
these fucking things.

607
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,490
That's it.
Yeah.

608
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,350
You just, you know, excited. I was,
when I got, you remember when I got,

609
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,830
I remember my, I got your teeth fixed.
All this shit that I've done for you.

610
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,690
Please put it that way.
All this shit that I've done,

611
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,110
I see one more fucking piece of clothing
that you just had to have the chief

612
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:04,111
judge just frisbee down at a fucking
goodwill for some homeless guy to traipse

613
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:07,830
around in while these looking
to get his fucking junk.

614
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,440
All right.

615
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,880
I got to get off.
I have to get on on with my fucking day.

616
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,920
This has been the podcast.

617
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:17,160
We're gonna not play a little bit of music
and then you get to listen to another

618
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,660
half hour of bullshit from a Thursday
podcast, uh, earlier this year,

619
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:26,190
10 years ago. I don't know how it
works. Um, that's it. All right.

620
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,360
Have a wonderful weekend. You'd concert
once again. Congratulations to everybody.

621
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,050
You'd Philly, uh, please don't eat
excrement from an animal, right?

622
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,550
Eh?

623
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,563
Yeah.

624
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,893
Yeah.

625
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:32,600
Okay. Hey, what's

626
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,700
going on? It's bill bird and it
is the Monday morning for Monday,

627
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,880
February 8th,

628
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,660
2010 one day after Superbowl 44.

629
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,120
Well, um, usually I don't begin
my podcast with a warning,

630
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,130
but I'm going to this week. Um, if
you live anywhere near Indianapolis,

631
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:58,420
you want to shut this thing off right now.
Okay?

632
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,630
If you one of those fantasy football
playing Douche bags with your stats and

633
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,410
your Peyton manning poster
hanging above your fucking bed,

634
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,860
you want to shut this thing off right now.
All right?

635
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,800
Because this podcast is
dedicated to you guys.

636
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,780
You fucking cunts who I've been telling
you for the last five fucking years that

637
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:24,040
Peyton manning is overrated.
I even went off on him last week.

638
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,660
Last week I went off on that guy.

639
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:30,661
And you can not believe the emails that
I got from people all just fucking,

640
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,340
not only defending Peyton Manning,

641
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,200
but brushing off Tom Brady and
his three super bowl rings as if,

642
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,090
oh, you can plug anybody into that system,
you know? But paint may, who hate Manny,

643
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,780
who paid money? He used to, he threw
for 50 fucking touchdowns during what?

644
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:49,840
He threw five touchdowns against
the fucking Buccaneers in November.

645
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,000
I said it last week.

646
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,200
Peyton manning is a regular season
statistical juggernaut. All right?

647
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:59,860
If you want to know who the fuck that
guy is, if you're still confused,

648
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,700
the fuck is there an invasion.
You hear that shit?

649
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,730
That's what happens
out here in fucking la.

650
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,550
So we'd probably just
robbed a convenience store.

651
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:14,140
They got a little overboard out here,
dude, I'm telling you right now,

652
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:15,400
if you want to know who Peyton manning is,

653
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:17,260
you wanna know who that fucking guy is.
Picture this.

654
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,080
If Dan Marino fucked Brett Farve,

655
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,610
their baby would be Peyton
manning. That's who he is. Okay?

656
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,670
And this asshole had only
one one fucking time,

657
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:31,150
his whole career and all these
analysts on TV, it was ridiculous.

658
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,600
They're all going, you know, I'm
telling you right now, you know,

659
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,480
if he wins here, uh, you're, you're,

660
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:41,350
you're arguably looking at one of the
greatest quarterbacks of all time because

661
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:46,210
of what? Based on what? Based on
what his regular season stats.

662
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,440
This guy fucking chokes every year in
the fucking playoffs. He's only one once.

663
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,610
He's only one once and everybody's
just fucking talking about and all you

664
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:59,130
assholes. Who fucking emailed me this
week? Where are your emails now? Huh?

665
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,540
I emailed each one of you,

666
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,420
every one of you fucking back and I
never heard it from you. You know,

667
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,740
maybe he's still fucking stunned.
Maybe he's still fucking confused.

668
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:09,550
So you know what?

669
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,790
You know what I'm going to do just for
all of you fucking idiots out there who

670
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,220
think that Peyton manning is
the greatest fucking guy ever.

671
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,580
Totally disrespecting Tom Brady.

672
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,170
Tom Brady has to wear,
you know,

673
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,220
he has to wear a fucking welder's
mask at night to go to sleep.

674
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,790
That's how fucking bright his room is
from those three championship rings.

675
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,930
And you guys still disrespect him.
The analysts on TV still disrespect them.

676
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,790
They never talk about the way they talk
about Peyton manning all accounts is

677
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:40,440
what the fuck you do in January. You
know, nobody talks about Terry Bradshaw.

678
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,280
You guys haven't watched super
bowl 10 it's up on fucking youtube.

679
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:48,210
Watch that game. Terry Bradshaw,
if you looked at his numbers,

680
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,870
you fucking stat boy pussies.
If you looked at his numbers on paper,

681
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:54,610
you wouldn't think the guy was
shit. You'd be like, Oh, pick many.

682
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,140
He's like twice as good as this guy.
He's closing in on 50,000 yards.

683
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,950
All Bradshaw has a 25,000 yards.
Yeah, in four fucking rinks.

684
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,470
Superbowl 10 Terry Bradshaw Fades back
to pass and the fourth fucking quarter

685
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,920
gets knocked. Unconscious
gets a concussion. Okay,

686
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,690
and on that play that he got a concussion,

687
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,410
he throws a 50 yard strike to Lynn
Swann for the go ahead. Fucking score.

688
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,500
All right.
That's what the great ones do.

689
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,530
And nobody ever brings up Terry Bradshaw.
You. What the fuck has he ever done by?

690
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,560
Other than when for fucking super bowls.

691
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,690
So just in case you guys are still
confused about your boy Peyton Manning,

692
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,380
I'm going to read you some of his stats,
the stats that fucking count. All right?

693
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Yeah. We go the greatest
quarterback of all time.

694
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:42,270
I've got a little music for you this week.
All right.

695
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:48,750
December 30th I'm such an obnoxious ass.
This is Carly Simon,

696
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:52,440
by the way, singing. Nobody
does it better. You know,

697
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,780
this is what all the analysts have been
singing for the last fucking 10 years of

698
00:42:56,781 --> 00:43:00,270
this guy's career.
December 30th all right.

699
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,410
Kicks ass in the regular season.
Dolphins beat the cults.

700
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:08,430
2117 overtime wildcard game.
Oh, whatever. Whatever.

701
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,100
It's his first trip to the playoffs.
He'll get better.

702
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,700
2002 colts lose 41 nothing in a playoff
route against the New York jets,

703
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,480
j e t s jets, jets, jets.

704
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,630
This is the greatest
quarterback of all fucking time.

705
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:27,240
Potentially with one fucking ring.

706
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:30,330
Everybody tune in and watch and
see how he does against the saints.

707
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,950
That's look how he did.
January 8th,

708
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,910
2004 called slews 24 14 to
the New England patriots.

709
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,740
Greatest swapping quarterback,
potentially a better one fucking ring.

710
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,350
You see his footwork? He's
an unbelievable, okay.
His hand eye coordination.

711
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,370
He's got the pedigree.

712
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,050
January 60 2005 cults
again lose to the Patriots,

713
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,790
20 to three greatest fucking
quarterback of all fucking time.

714
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,670
January 15th,
2006 cults lose to this Steelers,

715
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,860
21 to 18

716
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,650
greatest quarterback of all time and
right around then people start going, oh,

717
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,940
is this another Dan Marino? But no. The
next year he finally fucking shows up.

718
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,440
Finally grows as Dick comes back.
21 points down against the Patriots,

719
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:26,130
winters for a super bowl, and then I'm
thinking, okay, he's a fucking man now,

720
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:29,850
right? I'm going to see some
Montana Shit. I'm going to see some,

721
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,560
some fucking Terry.
I'm going to see some time fucking Brady.

722
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,810
What's he doing in the next year?
He loses at home

723
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,240
to the San Diego chargers. All right.
Maybe he had a fucking hangover,

724
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,820
maybe at a fucking hangover. What's
he do in the next year? Wait,

725
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,850
is quarter fucking quarterback ever
loses to the eight and eight chargers at

726
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:56,280
fucking home? Right?
And you hear this song,

727
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,280
this is what these fucking analyst
has been. Just continue to sing.

728
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,140
He's the new Brett Farve.

729
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,990
Brett Farve can do no wrong throws
against his body over the fucking middle.

730
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:09,540
And what is Tom Jackson
say? Well, you know,

731
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,510
he's never been afraid to lose the game.
He fucking blew it.

732
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,080
He mushed those vikings purple nuts right
into the fucking ground and it's still

733
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:21,300
fucking rubbing his god there.
Mississippi Caucus. I'm sick of it.

734
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,280
So here you go.
She goes up against the lowly saints.

735
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:31,650
They've never won a fucking thing in 40
fucking years of being in the league.

736
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,520
What's going to be the difference,
Peyton? And I'll tell ya,

737
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,860
I got to go with Peyton manning. Oh,
Peyton manning cyst. Peyton manning stat.

738
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,670
Peyton manning lost the fucking
game yesterday. The final drive.

739
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,470
I've got a question for you.
Indianapolis fans.

740
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,030
Does Tom Brady throw a pick six
at the end of the Superbowl?

741
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,620
Does Joe Montana throw a fucking pick six

742
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,810
is Terry Bradshaw.

743
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,190
Does Ben Roethlisberger one of the most
overlooked quarterbacks of all times

744
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:05,140
sitting in home with fucking two rinks.
Does he know?

745
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,970
He doesn't. All right, so fuck all you
fucking idiots out in Indianapolis.

746
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,990
There you go. How was that? Did you
like that? Right in your fucking ass.

747
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,730
God bless the saints. Everybody. Huh? Do
did they say drew Brees his name? What?

748
00:46:18,731 --> 00:46:21,730
Maybe three times when they finally
figured out he's going to win the game.

749
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:25,090
Then they're like, oh, by the way, drew
Brees is about to break Tom Brady's,

750
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,730
you know, single fucking Superbowl
record for completions there.

751
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:33,580
I got it out. I've got a little started
there for a second, but it got it out.

752
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,420
Unbelievable.
Unfucking believable.

753
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,400
You know something.
This is how fucking bad

754
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,250
and Nadeem bad.

755
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:50,200
How fucking I predicted the IC got Keith
Robinson to fucking apologize to me.

756
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:54,760
Keith Robinson, classic black dude
doesn't like white people. Hates cops.

757
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,270
Okay. There's no reason
for him to apologize to me.

758
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,720
He actually apologized. He goes,
you know what? You're right.

759
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,040
You were right about this
guy. Uh, I feel vindicated.

760
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,020
Vindication. What a great emotion.
So there you go. There you go.

761
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:13,690
Congratulations to the New Orleans saints.
Okay?

762
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,420
And I know what it feels like
to fucking have a great team.

763
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:18,030
And nobody even fucking talks about you.

764
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:21,490
Do they even bring you guys up for half
a second? Oh, by the way, Big Bang.

765
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,610
The luncheon city, the amount of shit that
you guys have been through down there.

766
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,680
How many Superbowls had
been played in New Orleans?

767
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,890
How many times have you seen people from
other cities come to your town and feel

768
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:36,220
the joy of winning a championship
and you just sat there, you know,

769
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,120
with your beads and your chicken
foot and you're Voodoo. Go on.

770
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:44,590
When the fuck is it going to happen for
us? Well, it finally did. Congratulations.

771
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,950
You're totally fucking deserve that.
Your defense was the shit.

772
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,500
Even when the culture receivers,
we're catching balls. I mean,

773
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,480
you guys were hitting them. They
look like they, they'll like many,

774
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:57,430
many explosions. You will not get them off
their feet. Totally fucking deserve it.

775
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:01,750
Can't be, could not be happier, could
not be happier. Not only did you know,

776
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,970
I don't know, it feels like to
wait for a fucking championships.

777
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:07,300
So congratulations to
everyone down in New Orleans.

778
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,140
And I also want to thanks the
saints for fucking proven me right?

779
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,760
Proven me right. There you
go. There you go. All right,

780
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,440
so while you fucking
analysts, hey, then you,

781
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,690
and are you a pas at ESPN in Bristol,
Connecticut. You listen to this shit.

782
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,110
Why don't you go play it to
some of those jerk offs at Upi?

783
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:28,510
Have on the fucking hair. Who can't
do anything, dude, I'm telling you,

784
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:31,060
they'll even go on. I'm even watching
a little bit of shit this morning.

785
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,400
This is loosen me. I'm stuttering.
I'm so fucking pissed right now.

786
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,240
They're still not saying, ah Brady.
What's his face paint and blew it.

787
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,070
They keep talking about drop passes.
Ms Field Goes,

788
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:47,050
get the fuck outta here. Pick six
nail in the coffin. Thanks Peyton.

789
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,350
You know he was going to lose
you see all tanned up. He was,

790
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,650
oh

791
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,130
Jesus Christ. It's going to be
a great week. I feel fantastic.

792
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,480
You know, especially as a fucking
Boston fan, you know what I mean?

793
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:08,340
I already watched, I watched the Lakers
come in and win another one. You know,

794
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,400
I watched the Yankees win number 27 was
I actually got to sit here and have to

795
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:16,350
watch the cults when
to and prove me wrong.

796
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:20,130
That may be Peyton is let's be puberty.
Peyton maybe is,

797
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,750
maybe Peyton is one of the greatest
of all time. Fucking unreal.

798
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:27,780
I had this one guy this week was sending
me an email saying, you know what Dude,

799
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,730
if uh, if I, you know, if,

800
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:34,110
if Peyton played for the dolphins,

801
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,050
I don't know what year this guy's talking.

802
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,060
He said they definitely would win at
least one championship and it Brady went

803
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:41,700
there. You know, it wouldn't
have made a difference. Yeah.

804
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:44,940
Why would it make a difference?
Brady only is cool under pressure.

805
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,260
How many fucking Superbowls does that
guy have to fucking win on the last drive

806
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,640
to get some respect? I don't get
it. I don't get it. I don't get it.

807
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:58,260
And what about Ben Roethlisberger who
has twice as many fucking rings as Peyton

808
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,310
Manning?
Okay,

809
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,300
let's look at Peyton Manning's brother
Eli Manning against the Patriots.

810
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,060
Tom Brady, once again drives them down
the field for the fourth fucking time.

811
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,740
For the go ahead score. Huh?
Did Eli get nervous? No,

812
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:16,460
he didn't drove him right down the
fucking field and did what his big brother

813
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:19,280
didn't do. Oh, I would love to
hear that awkward phone call today.

814
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,540
Ah,

815
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,600
sorry. I'm sorry to everybody who
doesn't listen. Yeah. You know what?

816
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:28,460
I'm not sorry. Fuck you. I was
right. I always write. Okay.

817
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:30,080
This is the Monday morning podcast.

818
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,780
I'm fucking strutting around like a God
damn rooster here. Loving life. Anyways,

819
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,880
let's get down to the podcast here.
Um,

820
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,220
last week I worked in a, I
worked in Irvine, California,

821
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,730
and uh, I worked at the, uh,
the Improv for the first time.

822
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:50,750
It's just south of Los [inaudible].
And uh,

823
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,230
I gotta tell you something. You
guys ever watch that show, uh,

824
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,790
the real housewives of the Osi? Of
course you don't. Why would you?

825
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,601
All right,

826
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:04,010
but do you have a woman in your life
who dominates the TV once a fucking week

827
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:07,730
whenever that show comes on? You know,
you can't help but see it. Right?

828
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,760
I remember watching that show going like,
there's no fucking way.

829
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,070
You know what I mean?
You know, it's a TV show.

830
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:17,810
They take the extremes of different
areas in the dumber you addicted like the

831
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:19,790
Jersey shore thing. You sitting
there going, you know what,

832
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:22,940
there's no fucking way people are that
goddamn stupid. And then what happens?

833
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:26,630
You go on youtube and you see
bootlegs, bootleg cameras, you know,

834
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:28,940
shots of the Jersey shore and you're like,
Holy Shit,

835
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,250
there's an element of truth to this.

836
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:36,251
Now I'm not saying everybody in the Osi
is a 63 year old cougar with their face

837
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:41,780
yanked back. But uh, uh, wow.

838
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,990
After, uh, after one of my shows,

839
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:48,260
I hate a group of women coming
up to me who collectively,

840
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:52,630
I think their age was about 606.
And um,

841
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,720
if you saw it, I don't know these
plastic surgeons to gets sued.

842
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,710
Do these you ever seen Rhianna's Mugshot?

843
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,710
All right.
It's not a mugshot.

844
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,380
You remember the picture after she got
the shit kicked out of her by a Chris

845
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,930
Brown or wherever the fuck his name is.
You remember that?

846
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:17,220
Just picture that face except
wherever her face was swollen.

847
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,780
Just imagine if it was equally swollen.
On the other side of her face,

848
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:27,080
like it was a symmetrical beat down.
That's what,

849
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,730
that's what plastic surgery looks like
rather than Evan one swollen up fucking

850
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,670
Aye. You got to and there
and you're like, wow,

851
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:36,770
what the f did this person get
the shit kicked out of him?

852
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:41,870
But because they're too, and they're
exactly perfect, Ula and you know,

853
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,590
Michelangelo is dead. You gotta be like,
well, he didn't kick the shit out of her.

854
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:49,540
This must be plastic surgery.
I'm talking like my eyes,

855
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,590
my eyes were watering when I
looked at their faces and, uh,

856
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,340
they, they, and they all get
like the, the, these, uh, those,

857
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:03,260
those fucking lips and then not even in
it was a, it was a fucking nightmare.

858
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,830
But anyways, uh, but you know what I mean?

859
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:10,730
So of course I bring that up on stage and
there was like a talking about plastic

860
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:11,720
surgery in,
uh,

861
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,550
the Osi in Orange County is like
bringing up Scientology in Hollywood.

862
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:21,350
It just gets really fucking
quiet and awkward. So anyways,

863
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:25,110
but I want to thank everybody
who came out to my shows and, um,

864
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,040
actually, you know what? I had
one person come out. Uh, you know,

865
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,410
a lot of people who are in this business
and a lot of people who aren't in this

866
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:31,741
business,

867
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,460
they try to act like they don't give a
shit about fame and they don't care about

868
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:38,520
celebrities. Well, I am
not one of those people.

869
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,590
I love famous people and if they
even look in my general direction and

870
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:48,090
acknowledge me, it actually fills me up
inside. That's how fucking insecure I am,

871
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,860
right? So Thursday night I'm doing
my show down in, uh, down in, uh,

872
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,670
for the fuck was I Irvine, right?
Yeah. Belt. We know you're there.

873
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:59,340
We're not arguing. Just get to
the fucking point. I'll, right.

874
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,500
So I'm standing there after
the show, whoring myself
out, I'm selling my DV Dvds.

875
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:08,590
I'm shaking hands and kissing
fucking babies. Right?

876
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,410
And all of a sudden this like famous
people, they just got that thing, man,

877
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,250
I didn't even know who the fuck this was.
This woman comes up and really quickly,

878
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:21,000
like two seconds just goes, hey, I
thought you were great and shook my hand.

879
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:24,500
I felt that electricity. And then
she went away. I was like, God damn,

880
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,830
who the fuck was that? I just got done
shaking like fucking a hundred hands,

881
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,560
nothing, nothing. Regular
Hallway Accountant, a plumber,

882
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:38,400
eight as a college student, she
comes up, she fucking unbelievable.

883
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,850
Felt a connection and then she ran
away. I'm looking at it, I'm like, well,

884
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:47,250
that looks like a Tonya contain is
how I was standing. And he evidently,

885
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:51,540
it's tawny [inaudible] and I walked in
there and someone goes, hey, they just,

886
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,120
that was tiny container.
If you don't know who the fuck that is,

887
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,800
she was the best looking video girl
for my money out of all the heavy metal

888
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:01,920
movies of all fucking time.
The Whitesnake video,

889
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,650
you know the one she danced on the cars.
I didn't like that one.

890
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:07,980
I like what she danced at the foot of
the bed with that little mini skirt,

891
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,430
barely covering her little a whatnot,
you know,

892
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:14,970
lifted her fucking leg up like
a fucking show pony, you know?

893
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,750
I know that doesn't mean shit to you
kids nowadays, but this was pre internet,

894
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,700
Internet porn and all that type of stuff.

895
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:23,610
All you had was Victoria
secret and your imagination.

896
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,980
I guess you could rent
points at that point,

897
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:28,950
but I was too fucking young and I was
like Eagle in you begin to think of a book

898
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,560
and read. So I never rented one. Okay,

899
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,570
so that's as far down the fucking pussy
rabbit hole I had been as far as video

900
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:41,220
pussy and a unbelievable
unfucking believable.

901
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:45,120
So
I don't know,

902
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,700
you guys probably think
that's a lame fucking story,

903
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:48,570
but I got to tell you something.

904
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:52,230
When somebody who you used to jerk off
to comes up to your 20 years later and

905
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:56,040
says, Hey, great job. That's
a special moment. You know,

906
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:02,250
I had a lot of special moments this
week. I really did. You know what?

907
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:03,750
I didn't want to beat on my car.

908
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,610
I like saying that I don't
want to beat him my car.

909
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:08,290
The reality is I have a
Toyota Prius and it has a,

910
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,980
what looks like little
breath mints for tires.

911
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,380
And I didn't feel like driving
it down in the fucking rain.

912
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:17,640
So I went out and I rented a car and I
rented one of those dodge challengers,

913
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,730
black on black.
All it had was the v six,

914
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,700
just waiting for all the gear heads to get
done. Ah, dude. That's a fucking bitch.

915
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,680
What'd you suck a Dick after you
drove the, it was a v six 3.5 liter.

916
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,860
It's still moved the car. It
was a, I'm telling you man,

917
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,560
even if he get the v six dude,

918
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:37,750
you're going to feel like fucking
Steve McQueen in that car.

919
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,290
That car is the shit.
I think it's way better than the Mustang.

920
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:44,710
I rented the Mustang when I
was in, uh, Fort Lauderdale.

921
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,560
So all I have left to
rent is the new Camaro.

922
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,300
I like all of those cars and, but I got
to admit, man, the challenge of man,

923
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:53,440
that fucking,
you know what it is?

924
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:58,120
It's the forefront lights for
headlights in the front. I don't even,

925
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,670
I don't even know if one of them does,
you know,

926
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,560
if two of them are just
dummies or they just, you know,

927
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,840
they're like blinker lights or
something like that. I don't know what,

928
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:08,860
but it just reminded me when I was a
kid that was a sign of status to me,

929
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,860
you had the forehead lights cause I
was always into the caddies. You know,

930
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,140
in the late sixties one they had the Ford,
you know,

931
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:16,480
the two and two and they
were on top of each other.

932
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,170
And then for some stupid fucking reason
in the 70s they put them side by side

933
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,170
and they just didn't
fucking look right. But, um,

934
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,370
I dunno, I, I would really, uh,

935
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,090
I think I'm going to get one
of those cars at some point.

936
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:33,310
I've got to find out how much they
are and uh, you know what I mean?

937
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:37,150
Cause I'm an insecure guy. I mean
that's a perfect car for a guy like me.

938
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,810
You know, look at me. I'm
a winner. Rife of a window.

939
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,660
Dodge challenger 41
nothing. Alright. Anyway,

940
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,600
uh, let's get on with the podcast
here. I got a lot of different uh,

941
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,300
sections to this. I'm hoping you guys are
actually listening to this. If you are,

942
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:59,860
that means I figured out my new podcast
server that Mark Marin have dubbed the

943
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:03,860
WTF podcast too. I'm going to
try to have on as a guest, uh,

944
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,690
in the next month. Um,
this is my new server.

945
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,100
It's costing me about 36 bucks a month
and I'm still not charging for my fucking

946
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:15,130
podcast. This is a little
bit of guilt, so, you know,

947
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:19,540
I figured you guys can pay me back.
Don't steal my DVD online. All right?

948
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:23,830
Go on in order the fucking thing. I'm
giving you a podcast every God damn week.

949
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,690
Now, I'm not going to be,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

950
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:30,691
I don't expect anybody in Indianapolis
or re anywhere remotely related to Peyton

951
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:34,540
manning to buy my DVD.
But the rest of you,

952
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:38,500
sons of bitches just go on and
pay for the damn thing. Okay?

953
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,590
We spent a lot of money on that.

954
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:44,290
They gave you a bunch of extras
or come out to one of my shows.

955
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,910
Pay me back that way, okay? And whatever.

956
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:51,250
If you're in between jobs right now
and you're going through a rough time,

957
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:54,520
here's some free fucking comedy.
But when you hit it big, remember,

958
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,010
remember who fucking held you up?
Huh?

959
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,790
When you look down in the sand and
there was only one set of footprints.

960
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,900
That was when I carried
you with my podcast.

961
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,160
Look at me getting all biblical.
Why are you getting biblical bill?

962
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,820
I thought you don't believe in that shit.
You know why? Cause I have a confession.

963
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,310
I've got a confession to make to you guys.

964
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:19,840
You know what I did on Sunday and I
think this is why Peyton manning got his

965
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:23,780
fucking ass kicked. I actually hope
you're all sitting down at this point.

966
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:25,370
I actually went to church on Sunday

967
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:33,500
after all the Shit I talked about
organized religion and all that shit.

968
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,400
I actually went,
I went to church,

969
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,790
I went to fucking church.
And uh,

970
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:44,690
I don't know why it's one of these
deals is something about I haven't been

971
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:48,410
drinking. I'm trying to clean up my
act and the last 20 years, you know,

972
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:53,411
I've just slowly become a complete piece
of shit and I'm really trying to get

973
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:57,380
back to who the fuck I was. You
know, I used to be a good guy.

974
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,940
I used to not be cynical. I used
to believe in people. I had hope.

975
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:06,880
I gave to charities, you know, I
was a fucking swell guy, you know,

976
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,450
20 years of being on the road,

977
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:13,430
drinking who was corrupt club owners
fucking me over at the end of the weekend.

978
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:17,840
You know, you start to uh, I got
no excuse, whatever, I'm weak,

979
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,690
I'm so whatever. So I was like,
I don't know, I need to, uh,

980
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,510
I need to do something good. So I
was actually, this is how far I went.

981
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:30,420
I actually considered going to confession
and not even because I believe in the

982
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:33,470
shit. I just wanted to see what the
priest was going to say. Cause I, I never,

983
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,620
you know, at the risk of
burning some of my new material,

984
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:40,970
I just never bought into that shit that
like I have to talk to God through you.

985
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,760
You know,
now you're,

986
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:47,450
you're some sort of voice and you want to
listen to all the fucked up shit I did.

987
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,690
As you look through the fucking screen,
pretending you're not looking at me,

988
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,270
you know,
plus I gotta admit,

989
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:56,930
I kind of want to see how many our
fathers and hail Mary's I was going to get

990
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,530
considering the last time I went
to confession. It was simple stuff.

991
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,280
Like I beat up my
brother, you know, I, uh,

992
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:07,190
had impure thoughts about my fucking,
you know,

993
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:10,880
whatever English teacher or
some stupid shit, you know,

994
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:16,490
why is that a sin? Doing ice, have
this fucking language teacher.

995
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:19,130
When I was in middle school,
we didn't have junior high.

996
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,730
It's just fucking girl was so
fucking ridiculously hot. Right?

997
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,560
And she used to wear these dresses with
a slit going right up the fucking side.

998
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,030
You know, it's a little Italian girl. She
was short. So she'd wear the sky high,

999
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,800
fuck me shoes. You know, every once in a
while she'd give us a treat once a week,

1000
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:40,190
you know, she come in with those
fucking things on it. It was really,

1001
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,210
it was ridiculous. Um, and
not only that, she was,

1002
01:01:44,211 --> 01:01:47,060
she was my French teacher. She's trying
to teach me a different fucking language.

1003
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,530
Right.
So one week she comes in,

1004
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,070
she literally has a slit
going up both sides.

1005
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,110
And she had this habit,
she'd,

1006
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:57,890
she'd write whatever she wanted us
to learn and she would step back.

1007
01:01:57,891 --> 01:02:00,470
So she'd have one foot,
like,

1008
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,970
I don't know how to explain it.

1009
01:02:02,971 --> 01:02:05,120
It's like if you're a wide receiver
and he looking at the quarterback,

1010
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,880
checking for the audible,
you got one foot in front of the other.

1011
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:08,790
That's what she's doing.
But she's got a slit on both sides.

1012
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,330
So now not only do I see a slip
and the outside of the leg,

1013
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:15,050
I can actually see the inside of
her fucking thigh on the other side.

1014
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:19,920
I am in eighth grade. Okay.
My Dick is that his fucking,

1015
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:22,680
you know,
saluting the troops at that point.

1016
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:25,500
I'm not listening to what the fuck you
saying in English, forget about in French.

1017
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:30,180
And then she ends up calling on me as
I'm sitting there with my little Woodrow

1018
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,940
Wilson, right? And she's
like, ah, you know,

1019
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:37,030
fucking whatever the fuck she
said in French. And I had no idea.

1020
01:02:37,031 --> 01:02:41,760
And I tried to play it off and then she
got all fucking mad at me because I lied

1021
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:45,090
to her and I didn't have the
emotional maturity be like, really?

1022
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,100
Why don't you put some
fucking clothes on sweetheart?

1023
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,880
And maybe I'll pay attention to your
fucking language lesson here. All right.

1024
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,370
You stand standing here with half
your fucking hoo ha hanging out.

1025
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,320
You think I'm looking at chalk on
the board? You asshole. But I didn't,

1026
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,400
I just sat there and stared at my
books as she screamed at me. And, uh,

1027
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:05,730
when she told me to go down in the
office, I did, didn't even put up a fight.

1028
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:10,500
Then I missed my bus home and then I
walked home in the rain fucking saying all

1029
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:14,340
this shit that I wish I had the balls
to say, but I didn't. All right.

1030
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:17,790
That was a sad memory. Okay, let's plow
ahead here. So anyways, so I decided,

1031
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:21,390
I'm like, I gotta go, I'm going to
go to fucking church, right? I got,

1032
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,280
I got to start doing some
something good in my life,

1033
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:26,820
something positive or whatever. And
for some reason, I don't know why.

1034
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:30,060
I'm going to church because I don't
believe in this shit. I don't,

1035
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:35,910
but um, I don't know. My girlfriend's
mom goes to church every week.

1036
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:38,700
She's a sweetheart. I'm
like, you know, fuck this.

1037
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,550
I'm going to go to church
with my girlfriends mom. Huh?
That's a nice thing to do.

1038
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:45,660
Right? Then all my female listeners
just go walk. Did you just do that?

1039
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:50,220
Of course you did. It's a
fucking nice thing to do. So,

1040
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:55,110
you know, and I'm going all out. I haven't
gone to God's house in like 20 years.

1041
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,760
So I'm like,
what am I going to do?

1042
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,000
Go there with a button down and some
jeans and some shoes. Fuck that.

1043
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,330
I broke out the tonight show
with Conan O'brien, suit number,

1044
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:07,860
that shiny one that some of you cunts
bitched about. Some I fault is fucking HD.

1045
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:12,540
And you can see the inside of my nose.
It looked good and real life anyway,

1046
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,910
so I put that on.
I'm looking like a fucking million bucks.

1047
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:17,400
So maybe I'm looking a little ray Liotta.
I don't know how I'm looking,

1048
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:21,720
but I'm feeling good, right?
Went to church and I walk in.

1049
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:25,920
What's the first thing I see? I see a
big Jesus nailed on the cross, you know?

1050
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,830
And as he looking at me, no,
he's looking down and I'm like,

1051
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:32,460
is he looking down because he's in
pain cause he's slowly dying from this

1052
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:36,830
torturous device or is it part of
the guilt? Oh look, I dude, for you,

1053
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,480
hope you appreciated.
You know,

1054
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,050
so I'm a guy.
You think thinking negative bill,

1055
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:46,160
don't think negatives is a good
thing. It was a sunny day. You know,

1056
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,370
it's been raining out here.

1057
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,210
La has never more beautiful
than right after it rains. Wow.

1058
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,680
That was the cheesiest
thing I've ever said.

1059
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,730
I should just broken into a fucking song
right there. Reminds me of my mother

1060
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,710
now.
You'd already as it fucking,

1061
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,750
I don't know what beats down all the
smog and you can actually see out to the

1062
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:05,700
ocean. It's fucking awesome. So anyway,

1063
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,660
so I sit down into the pew and I got to
admit, it's kind of bringing it back.

1064
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:13,200
Good memories. You know, we
used to go with the family.

1065
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:18,150
I used to go to church every fucking week
from like third grade till I was like

1066
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,490
22 I don't think I missed a week.

1067
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,600
And I go with my family and then
afterwards we go to fucking Dunkin donuts

1068
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:27,360
stowed and we get some fucking donuts.

1069
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,620
I don't know why we get a dozen
donuts and then we go home,

1070
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,940
have Sunday breakfast, and then we all
sit around eating donuts. While we did.

1071
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:39,750
It was a good thing though. It was a
family thing. So part of it was like, wow,

1072
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:42,720
this is what I actually felt
better that I was in there.

1073
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,070
Right as I was starting to feel better.

1074
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:51,100
First fucking words out of the
priests mouth is a, he goes, hey,

1075
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,170
thanks for coming out everybody.
I see a,

1076
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:55,660
I see you all came out here
early to get it out of the way.

1077
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,260
She could watch the super bowl.

1078
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,130
That's what he says right off
the bat comes with the guilt.

1079
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:01,510
What do you mean get it out of the way?

1080
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,470
Fucking game comes on at
three 30 out here. What do
you got? A three o'clock mass.

1081
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:09,830
You asshole. You don't, I'm not getting
it out of the way. How about this? Um,

1082
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,000
I made time for it.
You fucking cunt.

1083
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,300
I still have to go to the grocery
store and buy the fucking hamburger.

1084
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:20,680
I came here first. It was right out of
his mouth. First thing you fucking says,

1085
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,300
all right here.
You guys all came here and only here

1086
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:30,930
one to suffocate him with that fucking
Smocky he was wearing. I was like, no, no,

1087
01:06:30,931 --> 01:06:33,780
no, no. You don't try to think fucking
positive. Trying to think positive.

1088
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,890
Stop looking at the negative.

1089
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:37,080
Cause there is an element
of this that does feel good.

1090
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:41,320
There's an element of this that
feels right. So I'm still sick

1091
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,490
now. You know, and uh,

1092
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,710
then all of a sudden they start reading
the stories and here comes the reader.

1093
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,370
If you're not Catholic, they always
have a reader and they read a couple of,

1094
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:55,200
a couple of little Jesus did he sing a
couple of songs and then the priest comes

1095
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:58,830
in and he fucking brings it home.
Like the headliner, you know,

1096
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:03,360
reads a little bit of Gospel.
So I don't know what this guy's doing.

1097
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:05,970
If he's reading scripture,
I don't, I don't know. I
don't know the fucking words.

1098
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:09,480
I don't know the technical
words. So anyways, the reader
for this week comes up.

1099
01:07:09,481 --> 01:07:14,010
I swear to God, he's like fucking
45 years old and I shit you not,

1100
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,860
he's wearing a boy scout shirt,

1101
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,130
a fucking boy scout shirt,
and he has facial hair,

1102
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,290
a boy scout shirt and facial hair,

1103
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:27,610
and you're in your forties I'm I
the only one who sees sex offender,

1104
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:28,893
you know,

1105
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,310
and you would think with the scandal that
has gone through the Catholic church,

1106
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:35,530
they'd be like, hey dude, we
appreciate you coming in here,

1107
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:40,360
but could you take off the fucking boy
scout uniform considering that's another

1108
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:44,410
organization that doesn't exactly have
the greatest tap track record when it

1109
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:47,860
comes to little boys. Right.
But they don't. So I'm sitting
there going, no, no, no,

1110
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:50,680
no. This guy's a good guy.
This guy's a good guy.

1111
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,270
He stayed on the path to the right.
Unlike you, Mr Burr, this guy,

1112
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,320
he stayed in scouting. All right. If
he diddled somebody at this point,

1113
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,630
they would have figured it out.
Maybe he's just a good guy.

1114
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:05,320
He knows how to start a fire without a
match. Let's listen to what he has to say.

1115
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,980
All right, and what does he do? He
fucking goes up there and he starts,

1116
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:10,480
this was basically the story.

1117
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,800
Jesus is standing on the edge of a
lake as he is. You know what I mean?

1118
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,400
James Brown had the cape, Jesus has
the lake. Everybody's got this shtick.

1119
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,050
It's fucking show business,
right?

1120
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,600
So Jesus is standing by the edge of the
lake and there's a couple of fishermen.

1121
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,800
Of course, of course. There was like three
jobs back then. You were fucking black.

1122
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:34,910
Smith of fishermen are a leper. Okay? So
this is one of these fishermen stories,

1123
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:37,070
right? So the fishermen, Simon,

1124
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:40,970
and some other fucking Douche bag is
sitting there cleaning out their nets and

1125
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:45,380
Jesus goes a Romy out Romy out, you
know, 10 feet into the lake and they go,

1126
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:49,370
absolutely wasn't like we weren't fucking
busy over here cleaning up after a

1127
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:53,240
hard day's work. So they roll the dude
out there, he's 10 feet off shore,

1128
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:58,030
and now he's preaching to the
people on the shore from a Robo.

1129
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:01,900
You know, I'm sitting there going,
what a fucking arrogant ass,

1130
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:04,300
but I got to give it up to him.
That's a little show Biz there.

1131
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,250
You stand on the beach,
you're just regular.

1132
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,230
All of a sudden you're out
there in the water, you know,

1133
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,710
all of a sudden it's like
he's got a stage, so whatever.

1134
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:15,740
So now he's out there like the arrogant
ass. He is. He standing up in the boat,

1135
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,770
which you're not supposed to do.
You're not supposed to fucking do that.

1136
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,120
He just breaking the rule.

1137
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:22,970
Just like when you see a cop
speeding in a fucking cruiser,

1138
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,120
not using his directionals.
He's not even on a call.

1139
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:30,230
What kind of fucking example you
set. So anyways, he starts preaching,

1140
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,150
he's done preaching.

1141
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:36,170
He then tells these fishermen to
take their nets and they go fishing.

1142
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,740
And they were like, wait a minute, son of
God. Not trying to step out of line here.

1143
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:43,880
I know, you know, you came
out of that debt vagina. That
was never fornicated with,

1144
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:47,810
uh, you know, we've been fishing
all day and well, you know,

1145
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,290
the risk of sounding crass, sounding
crass, we haven't caught shit.

1146
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,600
So Jesus goes,

1147
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:56,670
am I not the son of God?

1148
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:00,660
Did I not just tell you to
bring your fucking nets out
here? And they, hey. Yeah,

1149
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:04,050
sorry man. Will, what was I thinking?
Right. Okay. By the little casino moment.

1150
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:07,440
How about stick your head to that little
fucking hole. Yeah. You weren't laying,

1151
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:09,120
that's why he had the fucking money ready.
Right.

1152
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:10,710
So they grabbed the fucking nets.

1153
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,410
I only know that quote because Joe
to Rosa uses that line all the time.

1154
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,360
So they grabbed their fucking nuts and
they bring it out to the lake and they go

1155
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:24,540
fishing. And what happens,
not only do they catch fish,

1156
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,720
they catch so much fucking fish that
it almost breaks their nets and they're

1157
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:31,440
dragging them back into that.

1158
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:35,330
Jesus is the best shit ever. And
then he looks at him, he goes, today,

1159
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,330
you caught fish.
Tomorrow you're going to fish for men.

1160
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,070
And then they all walked away,

1161
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:47,071
evidently leaving their fish behind
to follow Jesus to go fish for men.

1162
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:55,250
Can you fuck, I mean, what kind of a
fucking story is that? You're hungry.

1163
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,070
You wanted the food. You're going to leave
that to go try to pick up some dudes.

1164
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:02,180
And I'm listening to this with some guy
with a fucking boy scout fucking uniform

1165
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,980
on.
I'm not making any of this shit up.

1166
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,790
I was waiting for them to start
playing the weather. Girls

1167
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,390
Rain in men. I don't understand.
I know it's a metaphor.

1168
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,770
You going to go fish for men?
It's fucking Amway.

1169
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,750
We got to get somebody else to believe
this shit. What a crock of shit.

1170
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,220
You didn't catch shit. And then he
said, hey, put you, netsuite has done,

1171
01:11:21,221 --> 01:11:23,310
we got a bunch of up. He said, come on,

1172
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:26,490
let's go tell it to more people so I can
make more fucking money and live rent

1173
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:31,440
free and not pay taxes. So anyways,
um, but I'm still feeling good.

1174
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,333
There's something about,

1175
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,330
there's something about going to
church though. It's, it's getting me,

1176
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:42,960
get me in my chest is something
that's still feeling good. Oh,

1177
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:47,040
I'm a master at telling story. Okay. I'm
keeping the fucking, the, the, the, the,

1178
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,110
the peep,
the blast for many people in this shit.

1179
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,030
And I'm also keeping the Jesus freaks.

1180
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,650
I'm driving you right to
the fork in the road. What,

1181
01:11:53,651 --> 01:11:58,140
is he going to choose Jesus or is he
going to keep trashing organized religion?

1182
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,030
Hang in there. Here we go. Getting
into the third act. So then the uh,

1183
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:07,500
the priest there, the headliner, he comes
up, you know, and I'm thinking, all right,

1184
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:10,980
let's, he reads the fucking Gospel and
everything and now I'm waiting for it.

1185
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:15,120
He's going to say, and what does
he do? He pops in a CD. All right?

1186
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,970
And all of a sudden we'll listen to
some cardinal is some bishop from the

1187
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:22,780
Vatican doing a guest spot and you know,
and what does the guy said he teach,

1188
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,710
he does some quick little bullshit
up front going, praise Gigi.

1189
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:30,100
You praise him for a few benching, knows
your news. Wonderful Day. And we'll,

1190
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:34,170
you know, give days to hear him.
And G. G. G. Oh Geez. Right.

1191
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:37,560
And when he's done saying that Shit,
little five minutes of that shit,

1192
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:40,850
just stroke stroking you with the
Jesus stuff. What does he do? Huh?

1193
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,300
Come on people. You haven't seen this
episode before. What's his next move?

1194
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:50,400
What is the move after they bought a you
up and hit you with the guilt and tell

1195
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:53,940
you how thankful you should be for Gigi,
what does he do?

1196
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,650
He starts hitting us up for money.

1197
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,360
Start setting up sup for money for
some of the poorer churches that aren't

1198
01:13:00,361 --> 01:13:02,460
making it.
And we got a quota.

1199
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:06,510
We got a $41,000 quota and
we didn't make it last year.

1200
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,800
You know, it goes on and fucking
on. Right? And right then.

1201
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,970
Right then my girlfriend's mother
was hilarious. Leans over, she goes,

1202
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:17,850
of course you'd have to come this week
because she knows, I think it's bullshit,

1203
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,360
right? Fucking guy in the cub scout
uniform. Now they're asking for money.

1204
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,110
So we're laughing. And then the priests,
when they finally, he, you know,

1205
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:28,250
he shuts off the boombox wherever the
fuck. Oh, I know it was a boombox,

1206
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,410
but they had it hidden so it seemed holy,
you know,

1207
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,850
then he spends the rest of his
homily telling people, you know,

1208
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:40,440
where to fill in their credit card number,
like in an unbelievable detail.

1209
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:44,400
You pick up the envelope in the front.
If you look over there and the left,

1210
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:45,570
if you fill in your credit card,

1211
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:48,690
I'm sure a lot of you don't have
your credit card numbers memorized.

1212
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,700
Trying to make little fucking jokes, you
know, and one of the things was, you know,

1213
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:58,560
if you don't want this to be a monthly,
uh, um, deduction on your credit card,

1214
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:00,000
just, you know, check the box.

1215
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:04,590
I love that they're trying to get you
every month and the only way they're not

1216
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:08,390
going to charge your card every month
as if you do something. Then you know,

1217
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,460
that hope and all those fucking
old people with hard of,

1218
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:13,730
and they're not going to check
the fucking box in the next month.

1219
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,410
I couldn't buy it. Right.
They don't give a fuck.

1220
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,650
And then that was it.
And then the mass ended.

1221
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:22,980
But there was something doubt
still, I don't know. It felt good.

1222
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,830
You know what it was when I walked
out and they were having their,

1223
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:31,180
their little fucking bake sale and they
were having their raffles and I bought

1224
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:34,600
my girl's mom a ticket to win some
fucking pots and pans and shit. You know,

1225
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,550
it felt good because
you around good people.

1226
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,730
And that's what I hate about religion
is because the people who show up,

1227
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:44,050
they're good fucking people and
they getting fleeced, you know,

1228
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,770
you know it's funny. It's actually,
I gave two bucks if you know,

1229
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,610
bought a raffle ticket
for the pots and pans.

1230
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:51,640
And then we walked by another table
and the lady's like, Oh, you know,

1231
01:14:51,641 --> 01:14:54,720
this one's only two bucks for this raffle.
And I look what they're raffling off.

1232
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,020
It was one of those fucking,
you know,

1233
01:14:56,021 --> 01:14:59,440
Virgin Mary pictures with his like
holy blood dripping down her face or

1234
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:00,850
something like that.
And it's like,

1235
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:04,270
I really don't want that hanging
in my apartment. Okay. It's just,

1236
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:07,280
it's creeping me out. I'll take
some pots and pans, you know,

1237
01:15:07,281 --> 01:15:10,810
and make a rump roast, have
a little get together. Right.

1238
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,920
I'm not going to wash anybody's feet
as they come through the fucking door.

1239
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:19,430
Leave that FGCs. Um, so
anyways, there you go.

1240
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,310
Actually went to church and,
uh,

1241
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:24,550
I didn't buy into any of the bullshit that
the fucking guys with the uniforms on,

1242
01:15:24,551 --> 01:15:24,971
we're saying,

1243
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:28,720
but there was something that I kind of
felt a little bit nice and evidently

1244
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:33,250
they're having a car wash on Saturday.
I'm going to go by,

1245
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,920
I'll go by,
I'll get my fucking car washed.

1246
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,960
Why not the car wash in my neighborhood?

1247
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:41,380
They're always protest and that they're
not paying the fucking illegals to wash

1248
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:45,340
the cars. So fuck it. I
don't know. So there you go.

1249
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:49,390
That artist sparks some fucking
discussion. One side's going to say,

1250
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:52,990
I sold out and the other side's gonna
to keep trying to push me towards Jesus.

1251
01:15:52,991 --> 01:15:56,050
It's not going to work. I know what
the feeling was when I went in there.

1252
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:00,790
That's that overall natural spirituality
that you're born with, that uh,

1253
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,850
organized religion. Okay. I'm
going to give them a bent,

1254
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:08,770
the benefit of the doubt that they started
off with a good, uh, a good purpose,

1255
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,290
but they hoard it out.
They whore out that feeling.

1256
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:15,430
But when you do something nice, you
feel good. You know, I felt though,

1257
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:18,400
cause I was there with my girlfriend's
mother and it was a nice thing to do and

1258
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:22,990
I wasn't hung over and I wasn't a Douche
bag the night before I did my shows,

1259
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:27,610
everything was good. I didn't hurt
anybody. You know, I can do that without,

1260
01:16:27,611 --> 01:16:29,800
uh,
you know,

1261
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,130
you know I can do that and still
have a fucking chicken sandwich on,

1262
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,590
on Good Friday. Whatever the fuck
it is when I'm not, you know,

1263
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,740
tell me what to eat and when I can
jerk off a fucking jerk off all I want.

1264
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,820
He cuts. All right, let's
get to the topics here.

1265
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:46,690
Spend a great fucking podcast. She
got to give it up. Come on man.

1266
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,220
It's been a great fucking podcast.

1267
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:51,070
Started off with some music
I got into religion. I'm,

1268
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,160
I'm feeling this one and right now
when you know what I'm doing right now,

1269
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,130
you think you think I'm fucking
pat myself on the back? I'm not,

1270
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:01,540
I'm actually killing time right now
because I'm trying to get to the fucking,

1271
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,560
where the hell is it? The questions
for the week. Podcast. Quick questions.

1272
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:09,110
Click twice. All right,
let's get into this.

1273
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:13,250
Let's get into this as quickly as we
can and then I'm getting Outta here.

1274
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:18,880
Um, all right. Oh, here's
a new one. This is what,

1275
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:23,780
this is one that I like because as you
can tell, I'm really into sports. Um,

1276
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,240
I'm into sports the
way I'm not into Jesus.

1277
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,930
And is that how I spelled obscure?

1278
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:35,210
O B s c u r e
size.

1279
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:39,530
Spell obscure. It's not,
you spell anything that's
fucking, and that looks weird.

1280
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:42,620
That made sense to my
brain when I wrote that.

1281
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,040
You know what's funny is I'm so fucking
stupid. That might even be right.

1282
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,410
But now I'm looking at it and it
just looks wrong. You ever do that?

1283
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,940
You have actually spell
it right and you're like,

1284
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:51,200
there's no fucking way I got it right.

1285
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:53,900
I'm too stupid and then you look it
up on the Internet. Like Holy Shit,

1286
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:55,970
I got to write and actually got it right.

1287
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,150
I wish I could retain that information
because I know God damn well.

1288
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:02,180
The next time I write it, I'm going to
go through the exact same process again.

1289
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:07,070
That happens to me with
the word restaurant. I can
never remember if it's e,

1290
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:10,670
s t a,U r a n t or r e s.

1291
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:15,460
T. A fuck a R. A. U. N. T. I keep
always forget whether you goes,

1292
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:20,840
all right, here we go. Yeah,
that's, that's what I get
for Sansa. Great podcast.

1293
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:24,950
Now it's going to fucking Peter out.
Alright. Obscure movies, bands in books.

1294
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:26,210
If you guys have read a great book,

1295
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:29,930
if you've seen a really cool band and if
you've seen a really cool movie that is

1296
01:18:29,931 --> 01:18:34,520
not, you know, I mean don't, don't
fucking recommend Lord of the rings.

1297
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,470
Okay? He's check out this
band. You too. You know, they
got a Nigga, they got there,

1298
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:42,950
got a pretty good catalog, you
know, just some shit that is um,

1299
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:47,030
you know, under the radar a little
bit. Here's one foya that uh,

1300
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:50,060
one of my brothers actually recommended.
They recommended the movie,

1301
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:53,180
the conversation that
stars are gene Hackman,

1302
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,780
a young Harrison Ford and that
fucking dude who plays Freightos.

1303
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:57,890
I can never remember his name,

1304
01:18:57,891 --> 01:19:02,270
but he is the greatest IMD B
I've ever seen in my life. Okay,

1305
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,010
go look it up.
You know,

1306
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:06,980
he died tragically young of some
disease is fucking horrible,

1307
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:11,981
but you can't mess with his IMD be he
never did any meet the parents bullshit.

1308
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:14,990
This guy was in the godfather
that he did the conversation.

1309
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,590
Then he did the godfather part two,
then he did dog day afternoon,

1310
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:22,880
and then he did the deer hunter
and then he tragically passed away.

1311
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:28,250
It's not even tragic he did it.
There's no reason for him to continue.

1312
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,730
Guy Was the shit I was
actually reading up on him. He,

1313
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,870
I guess he was one of the reasons why,
you know,

1314
01:19:32,871 --> 01:19:35,990
Al Pachino moved down to New York to
become an actor and he was like his best

1315
01:19:35,991 --> 01:19:39,290
friend who was a really sad story.
He was engaged to a Meryl Streep,

1316
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:43,580
phenomenal actor. And I don't even
know his name, very tragic, whatever.

1317
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:47,600
But the conversation is a great
movie and I think it's very, uh,

1318
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:51,230
it,
it holds up and it's very,

1319
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:54,080
I don't even know what the
fucking word is of this time,

1320
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:57,320
whatever the word is to say that. All
right, here's something, somebody else,

1321
01:19:57,321 --> 01:20:01,610
I'll recommend it. Somebody said, um, he's
a couple of movies recommend you there,

1322
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:05,660
Woody Allen Pictures, um, that
not a lot of people talk about.

1323
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:07,500
One of them is called whatever works.

1324
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,870
I'm not going to describe
it because I'll ruin it.

1325
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:13,470
All I'm going to say simply say is it's
worth a watch if you've not already

1326
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:17,460
indulged. Also, have you seen the
flick Allen did a few years ago,

1327
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,010
a few years ago called match point?

1328
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,090
Definitely not your average woody
Allen picture, but it was really good.

1329
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:25,680
So I'm going to check those out.

1330
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:30,360
And somebody actually
this weekend recommended,

1331
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,900
I can't remember.
Sylvester Stallone,

1332
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:39,820
I talked about people getting microchipped
and they were trying to say that's

1333
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:43,800
invested like demolition man was that
the name of it was saying that movie was

1334
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:46,590
so on point as to what the
fuck is going on right now.

1335
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:50,250
And they basically talked about the
phasing out of cash and everybody getting

1336
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:53,610
fucking microchipped and if you fuck
with the deal they turn your chip off.

1337
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,530
I think it was called demolition man. Um,
if anybody knows what the name of it is,

1338
01:20:58,531 --> 01:21:03,090
please let me know and I'll, I'll, I'll
reconfirm it next week on the podcast. Um,

1339
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,530
and here's a book that somebody saying,
um, if you don't have to read Socrates,

1340
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,220
this woman from Germany, I thought that
was really cool. Somebody from Germany,

1341
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:12,210
he's actually listening to this,

1342
01:21:12,211 --> 01:21:16,590
actually recommended this sang Socrates
is really dry obviously because it was

1343
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:21,000
for fucking 9,000 years
ago. And, um, so they said,

1344
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,560
if you want to,
I have a better read for you,

1345
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:27,240
which is based on the great philosophies
of soccer, Socrates, Aristotle,

1346
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:28,630
and Plato,
uh,

1347
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:33,770
is called Sophie's world is the name of
the book and has the same core ideas and

1348
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:36,510
it really takes you to
the edge of your mind.

1349
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:42,270
How great is that to describe a book? It
takes you to the edge of your mind. See,

1350
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,400
I love stuff like that.
There's no fucking way.

1351
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:47,940
I'm not going to read that Sophie's world.
It's spelled s o.

1352
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:51,480
P. H. I. E. S. Come on man, start ringing.

1353
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,960
Stop being a dumb fuck like me. Come
on everybody. Let's, let's try it.

1354
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:59,460
Let's try it. Try to improve ourselves.
You know, I'm trying, I went to church.

1355
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:01,030
I try not to fucking heckle dude.

1356
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:04,500
You know what's funny when I was there
is I was saying prayers I had not seen

1357
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:09,380
set in like 20 fucking years. And
this is one pray prayer after, uh,

1358
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,630
the homily at in Catholic
Church that is like,

1359
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:16,560
it takes a minute or a minute and a
half everyone to say. And it's like,

1360
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:20,280
and it goes on to something like we
believe in one God, the Father Almighty,

1361
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:24,460
the maker of Heaven and earth of all
that is seen and unseen, the Bible by,

1362
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:25,680
I don't even know what the fuck it was,

1363
01:22:25,681 --> 01:22:29,190
but it was like one of those
things where like I was just,

1364
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:34,340
I was just reciting it like a fucking
Zombie to the point I was laughing because

1365
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,650
I couldn't remember it.
But as people were saying around me,

1366
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:40,890
I was just right on it. You know,
kind of like when there was a song,

1367
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,380
if you're really into this band in high
school and you hadn't listened to the

1368
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:47,190
song and 20 years and all of a sudden it
comes out and you just fucking find in

1369
01:22:47,191 --> 01:22:50,460
the words like, where the fuck are
these coming from? Cause they, they get,

1370
01:22:50,461 --> 01:22:54,990
they had embedded in my head 20 straight
fucking years and not missing mass,

1371
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,670
um, or whatever it was.
14 years. All right,

1372
01:22:59,671 --> 01:23:02,010
here's his last thing I'm going to read
for this week and then I'm gonna do some

1373
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:05,740
overrated, underrated. Um,
all right, here's some advice.

1374
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:09,170
Somebody was asking me about a
broad over there. Dear Bill, uh,

1375
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:10,720
since you have no idea who I am,

1376
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:14,110
I don't mind writing to you and explaining
my current problem I'm experiencing

1377
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:16,780
with a certain female.
And since you don't know me,

1378
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:18,280
you'll probably be more than honest.

1379
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,600
You'll be more honest than the girls I
tell this story to. Okay, here's the deal.

1380
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:27,280
I'm currently chasing this girl that
I've known for a year who for some reason

1381
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,610
goes through phases where one
day I'm the greatest thing ever,

1382
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,540
and then for the whole next I could die
from cancer and she wouldn't blink an

1383
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:39,340
eye. She also has a tendency to make me
jealous on purpose for no reason at all.

1384
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:44,110
I've confronted her on the issue and her
explanation was that she hates when I

1385
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:46,300
get jealous. All right? Right there dude.

1386
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:51,900
She is standing on top of an old Victorian
House waving the where I'm a cunt

1387
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:58,240
flag. All right. Told you, you
got to get away from this girl.

1388
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:03,010
This is the, you know what
this girl's deal is? She
wants to be in a relationship.

1389
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:07,180
She doesn't want to be in one with you,
but she doesn't want to be alone,

1390
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:09,640
all right?
And in the back of her head,

1391
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:13,630
she knows she's wasting her time by
hanging out with you rather than going out

1392
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:16,570
trying to find Mr, right?
So what she's doing is,

1393
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:21,460
is rather than dealing with that herself,
is she's taking it out on you, you know,

1394
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:22,831
and,

1395
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:26,140
and another thing she's doing is really
sadistic is she knows that you like her

1396
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,260
and she's playing you. You
know, just playing with you,

1397
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:33,400
playing with your fucking mind and just
trying to see the shit that she can get

1398
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:37,750
you to do. Fuck her. All right, this, you
know what? You want to fuck that girl.

1399
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:40,780
This is the guy you got to walk
away from her. Walk away from her.

1400
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,310
Go hang out with your buddies. If you
don't have any buddies, go get somebody.

1401
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:47,440
Go hang out in a bar and do what
I always say to do. All right,

1402
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:50,260
cause you're wounded right now and you're
going to be in the bar and you can be

1403
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:53,860
feeling now will these girls don't make
me feel the way that each other girl

1404
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:54,970
does.
Fuck that.

1405
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:59,620
You got to beat that feeling down and
you beat it down with alcohol and hitting

1406
01:24:59,621 --> 01:25:02,590
on girls. You don't give a shit
about getting the fucking game.

1407
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,360
It's going to build up your self esteem.

1408
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,000
Now I'm not saying be
mean to these other girls.

1409
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:11,080
Don't take out your heartbreak that
this other fucking chick gave you.

1410
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:14,950
Don't take that out on these other girls
because then you become a con to go out

1411
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:17,530
there and fucking find out
how your personality works.

1412
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:21,610
You know it's going to build up your
self esteem. Next time she sees you,

1413
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:24,730
you got to fucking broad on each arm.
She's going to get competitive.

1414
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:28,570
Next thing you know, your Dick
is in her fucking mouth, okay?

1415
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,630
And you finish in their son.
All right,

1416
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,100
sorry man. I stood up. I stood up. I
started feeling like a fucking coach.

1417
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:44,080
I want a little big there. Don't finish
unless she says it's okay. All right.

1418
01:25:44,081 --> 01:25:45,640
But if you bang are
definitely wear a condom,

1419
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,820
you have fucking respect for yourself.
You have respect for your body. All right?

1420
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,670
To go out there and talk some shit.
Son,

1421
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:54,070
you had shoulder pads that be fucking
banging on right now and send you out

1422
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:58,480
right through the fucking tunnel
into some meat market. Okay.

1423
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,690
Overrated. Underrated for
this week. Uh, overrated.

1424
01:26:01,691 --> 01:26:06,530
This guy says children right off
the Bat, I love this guy. He said,

1425
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:09,500
I'm sick and tired of people
doing shit for the children.

1426
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,570
We got to do it for the children.

1427
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,690
I understand that you need to
look after infants and toddlers,

1428
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:18,770
but I remember being nine, 10 and 11 and
at that age I really didn't give a fuck.

1429
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:21,560
I was too busy trying to hump
some girl behind a garage,

1430
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:26,030
all the while trying not to get caught
by the people who were supposedly looking

1431
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:27,530
after me.
My parents,

1432
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:31,790
half of the little twats just want to
fucking eat cookies and ice cream and play

1433
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,510
Xbox three 60 all day.
So I say, fuck the kids.

1434
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:40,550
Help the adults that are struggling
with bills and shit. I love that.

1435
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,480
What a fucking great guy.

1436
01:26:41,481 --> 01:26:44,780
I love him because he's speaking from
his heart and the right in the end,

1437
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:46,490
it petered out with his ignorance.

1438
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,620
Fuck the kids and healthy adults who
are struggling with bills and shit.

1439
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,510
I love and shit.

1440
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:57,710
It really just knocks it down by fucking
90 Iq points right down to my level.

1441
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,840
All right, I'll go with that one. Exactly.

1442
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:02,270
Why don't we help out the
fucking people without jobs.

1443
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,840
And then this is how the his,
his other one underrated, uh,

1444
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:09,350
he says whores and he
spelled it h. O. A. R. S.

1445
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:15,380
I think that's hilarious because isn't
bores spelt with a B, which is a pig,

1446
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,800
you know, which is another fucking
derogatory term from a woman.

1447
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:23,600
So he's kind of combined
whores and Boris Horse Hoa Rs.

1448
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:27,080
He said there's nothing
like a good whore Hoa are,

1449
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:29,090
she will make you appreciate a good woman.

1450
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,840
I can't tell you how many times I've
looked at a stripper or some country,

1451
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:35,960
little whore and thought to myself,
thank God she goes,

1452
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:40,400
she goes home to some other dumb
fuck wives and girlfriends hate them.

1453
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:44,150
But until you spend the night at
a club full of skanks and horrors,

1454
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:46,850
you can't really appreciate a good woman.
See,

1455
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:51,170
I liked that because it's actually
positive for women. That's right.

1456
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,890
That's absolutely right.
I totally agree with you on that one.

1457
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,700
And that's the podcast for this week
and I'm not going to go long because I

1458
01:27:58,701 --> 01:28:02,510
think this was a fucking great one.
I had a blast on this. Fuck that.

1459
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:07,130
I say a blast. How fucking old am I?
I had a rocking good time. No, I did.

1460
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:11,300
I feel fucking vindicated.
So fucking vindicated.

1461
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:15,860
Peyton manning was exactly who the fuck
I thought he was and they were crowning

1462
01:28:15,861 --> 01:28:18,350
him.
King crown and him fucking King.

1463
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:21,740
And I'm not saying that that dude
won't eventually become king,

1464
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,660
but you got to do some shit first.

1465
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,440
That's all part of that marketing
shit where they're selling.

1466
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,550
They're just selling you a like
before they ever do it. You know,

1467
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:33,050
fucking guys come in and lead.

1468
01:28:33,051 --> 01:28:35,780
They get a sneaker contract before
they gain a yard. It's bullshit.

1469
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,070
When the Superbowl's when I'm in the end,
drive your team down the field,

1470
01:28:40,071 --> 01:28:43,520
tie up to score, winning her over in over
time, and then I'll give it up to you.

1471
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:46,910
I'm not that much of a homer where I'm
going to be, I'm going to be a conduit.

1472
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:50,390
You got to fucking do it first before
people say you're the greatest. All right.

1473
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:53,210
I know I repeated myself,
but you know, it's not,

1474
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,080
it's not a lot of times in life when I'm
fucking right. And I was right on that.

1475
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:01,410
So congratulations to the saints and a,
all the fans of the saints and all that.

1476
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:03,720
It was fucking awesome to
see that you guys deserve it.

1477
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:06,990
Hope you make a bunch of fucking money
down there and your rebuild the houses

1478
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:10,170
and you give them back to the fucking
people who previously owned them rather

1479
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:11,640
than the consumer want to
build cheesecake. Yeah.

1480
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,770
Factories down there. All right. That's
it. I'll talk to you guys next week.

1481
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:15,604
Have a wonderful,

1482
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:29,183
yeah.

1483
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:02,330
Wow.
