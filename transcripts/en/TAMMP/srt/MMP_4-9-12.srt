1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,030
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
it's the Monday morning podcast. Ooh,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,800
Hyundai April 9th,
2012.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,170
Um, and uh, we're gonna do some,

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:17,220
a little different this week rather
than me just sitting here in my pajamas

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,410
ranting,
ranting and raving.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,580
I decided that I would get closed this
week and have a friend of mine come by.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,710
The one and only dom. I rera
everybody. Thank you everybody.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,870
Do you mind if I get undressed?
Huh? I would feel more comfortable.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,590
I like in the nude, in
the news, in the nude,

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,820
in the nude. You know, I think
it's very fitting that I'm,

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,240
I'm with a Daigo bastard. Like Ewan was
sitting here drinking the Vino. Hey,

12
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:45,540
not for nothing. You mic brick, but let
me tell you something that is funny.

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,660
Is it that I bring red wine over with
a little class little you're doing.

14
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:50,820
I was embarrassed that I only had a one,

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,110
a red wine glass and the fact that
the only thing I've had here is stuff.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,600
Stuff I brought over. And you had a
delicious Sushi dinner. I've done. Okay.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,453
Let me tell delicious.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,480
I thought I thought I told Don to come
here at seven 30 so me and Nia ordered

19
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:10,140
some Sushi and evidently I said seven
and this guy's Johnny on the spot.

20
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,780
Seven o'clock, right? As a
structures in the professional.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
I didn't think I delivered it, didn't
I? I know. And then you showed up.

22
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,230
The only thing I could offer you is
the fucking wine that you brought.

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,030
Do you want some the at a mommy
with your one and you said to me,

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,600
well listen, let's quit fucking around
here. All right, let's get serious comedy.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,070
No. Yeah, let's sit down. I want to know
about your process when you sit down, Tom,

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,670
when we're going to talk about comedy
here, talking to about my instrument,

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,950
tune my instrument.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,460
We're going to talk about two comedians
were going to sit here for an hour and

29
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:45,320
talk about the logistics. Is that the
right word? You can use that word.

30
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,860
When you put the pen to the paper.

31
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,590
Did you see the, you get a little heavy
now bill, but you see the masters today?

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,420
I did. And, uh, were you happy
that Bubba Bubba Watson won it?

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,141
You know,

34
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:04,050
I like seeing different people with
it's thing that's amazing to me is the

35
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:08,680
nerves it takes when you know, a friend
of mine is a scratch Golfer, he goes,

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,100
the one guy goes, why don't you
turn pro? Because you have no idea.

37
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,610
The difference between me being
alone out on a course, you know,

38
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:19,530
hitting his 70 when the compared to
millions of people looking at you. Yeah.

39
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,120
You know what always blows
my mind at those, those,

40
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:26,121
those PGA things is when those guys go
to tee off and they hit it like 300 miles

41
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:26,580
an hour.

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,350
All those people standing gen off to
the right and the left sitting there in

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,540
their face just like
they've really trust them.

44
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,250
They're looking for a subway
to come. Yeah. Yeah. Like what?

45
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,560
Bobby's shot there when he was,
he was in the pine needles.

46
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,790
I mean everyone was staying there.

47
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,380
There was a guy sitting
there was like a camera,

48
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,370
like the level of faith that they had.
The one guy did get hit today.

49
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,110
Did you know? I saw him getting it
yesterday. I saw a guy get hit you.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,800
That's how we do it. It was, it was
like a delayed reaction. This old guy,

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,310
he hit her head.
I didn't get hit like center mass.

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,220
You couldn't see cause those people but
as low enough where it wasn't his head

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,380
and it looked like he was walking
around looking for the ball and all of a

54
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:03,790
sudden they just sort of collapse this
tree and then the announcer just goes,

55
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,830
oh dear one. Damn. Somebody
got hurt and just whispered it.

56
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,760
W I wonder what happened if somebody
got killed like I got hit in the temple.

57
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,370
You think they'd stopped the match
after they took the ambulance?

58
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,350
Took the body away?
No,

59
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,070
I think that they would keep going and
not say that he was dead. It would ruin.

60
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,040
It doesn't look good. It would
ruin spectate. The spectator,

61
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,210
the spectator part of it.

62
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,590
We then have to all be wearing helmets
and stuff like that. Years later.

63
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,500
People Goggles. Yeah. Years later
people would watch it on youtube.

64
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,200
The way you watch like a goalie back
in the day that didn't wear a mask.

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,230
This guy's out of his fucking not,
I'm still there on the fairway.

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,680
And you play golf. No I don't. I, I,

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,960
I appreciate the game but I,

68
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:48,550
I'm just be in a no pigment Irishman.
I mean by the fourth hole.

69
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,760
I don't give a fuck. It sounds great.
You go out there with your friends,

70
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,220
you get a 12 pack and
you, you know, you just,

71
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,400
we could make a lot of money cause they
had like these celebrity things that you

72
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,190
could go on and they, you've got an
offer as a golf with people, right.

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,120
Maybe carrying somebody bags, how many
you got and those kinds of things. I mean,

74
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,130
celebrity golf,
now I'm out of that loop.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,010
Well I'd have to go out
there with some big,

76
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,770
like Hannibal Lecter Sun hat that he
wore it like at the end of the morning.

77
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,790
But they had, if they had nighttime
golfing, golfing, I would do it.

78
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,530
I have friends at golf a lot.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,130
I just don't want to suck at something
else at this age. You know what I mean?

80
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,600
So I stick to, I stick on the
close to the vest. I shoot pool,

81
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,840
I played ping pong because I love
ending up where I started. [inaudible]

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,990
there was no big thing.
People go,

83
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,270
you play ping pong like what are you
a hand for the fe with the people.

84
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,320
My thing is I don't play like standing
there with a beer in my hand. I play like,

85
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,290
you know, you put some spin on it. I put
some spin on mother. You don't, you don't,

86
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,370
you know who you got to. You got to play
as a Jimmy Dore. Was he good? Jimmy Dore,

87
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,930
Jimmy Dore invites you over, you know
the whole area is Jimmy Dore brings you,

88
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,230
invite you. If you think you just
go on over there to uh, you know,

89
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:55,960
have some burgers.
It has lovely place and really he's,

90
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,800
he's just sick of beating everybody
in his neighborhood and he talks shit,

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,110
where's he at?
And like silver lake or something.

92
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,650
I don't want to out where he's at.
He's like,

93
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,460
this is about as far as I'll
go and only because I love you.

94
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,200
This is as far as it's come and these
fucking God damn fucking Moss. You know,

95
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,140
you're old when you have
to buy a a cedar chest,

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
take chest of drawers because they're
eating at your old man sweaters.

97
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,220
I wear the V neck sweaters now on stage.

98
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,420
I go with that with a t shirt
underneath the casual look. Yeah.

99
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,610
I'm trying to disguise how much I,
I dropped the F bomb on my act.

100
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:31,660
I figure if I dress, how many, how
need to have a February 15 minutes.

101
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,360
Why usually do four days when I go out.
So I got four different colors.

102
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,120
Maybe I'll switch it up with a button
down just to the wait staff doesn't start

103
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,680
snickering at me.
Off the record.

104
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,780
I always show you were sharp Joseph
off the record. I'll take that.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,010
And even that Maroon goes, go with
your eyes. Well, you know, I mean,

106
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,570
I knew you were coming over
Tom. I appreciate that.
Appreciate the look. Listen,

107
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,010
that fucking guy today who
won that thing. Okay. I'm, I'm
sitting there, uh, the, the,

108
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,160
the fucking, uh, golf
thing. I'm, why I watch

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,540
it every year. I think
it's awesome, right.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,650
But I'm looking at the guy and I'm texting
back and forth. My Buddy Paul Versey,

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,890
um,
back east and when,

112
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,670
when he hit it off that that pine
needle, that was amazing. Yeah.

113
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,920
Oh yeah. Insane. And
went right to, you know,

114
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,580
landed right there and then he
tube goes in two putts and wins it.

115
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,710
He said that that was the equivalent to
when Eli through that pass to Manningham.

116
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,680
And I was just like, dude,
you know, oh this year,

117
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,380
don't compare like real sports to golf.
So Golf was delicious.

118
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:33,320
Like a giant pool table. Yeah, it's
a, it's a three hour mind. Fuck,

119
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,220
I will give you that.

120
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:38,030
But it's just like Eli had a 300 pound
guy in his face taking, you know,

121
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,960
taking a shot to the head. It's,
it's not, this is what kills me.

122
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,050
This is what the thing about golf,
first of all did,

123
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,030
you saw it bubbling when he won and
he's got, I think that double chin,

124
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,420
this seventh grader arms,
he never took a lesson in his life.

125
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,060
And Tiger Woods is on the course.
And so Phil Mickelson,

126
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,380
so that's like Gretzky and fucking,
uh,

127
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,880
Mario Lemieux are out there
and he beat him. So it's like,

128
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,820
I know guys who suck at
sports like really bad.

129
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,360
Like you throwing the ball and they
like tense up. It's one guy I know,

130
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:10,130
like when he goes to shoot hoop, it's
the fucking, it's like the greatest,

131
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,720
like if physical comedy ever seen,

132
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:16,550
he bites his bottom lip and he holds the
ball right in front of his face so he

133
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,730
can't even see the rim. And at the
last second, he bends both as risks.

134
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,450
So we can see it for half a second and
then throws a line drive and it hits the

135
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:27,890
underpart of the rim. That's how bad
this guy, he gets on a golf course,

136
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,660
he can compete,
he can hit it straight.

137
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,390
And I'm saying he kills guys
and wins money out there,

138
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:36,350
but to watch him hit a golf ball,
you'd have no idea.

139
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,870
They give you like going
to play softball here.

140
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:41,370
Let's see you hit a golf ball high.
Let's, let's get this guy out there.

141
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:44,000
This guy's struck out.
I worked with him.

142
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,870
He struck out slow pitch softball
with a girl. Underhanded.

143
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,780
Struck out to the point. He
was so embarrassed. I remember
later on that night, uh,

144
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,990
this is how long ago was
he got me wine coolers.

145
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,100
It was the 80 as discussed the hell.
They were horrible.

146
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,910
But you a psych if you underage.
He was like, uh, and I was like,

147
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,490
this sounds like getting molested story,
but I swear to God it was.

148
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,940
I had to go back and I threw him
pitches until it was dark out.

149
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,100
I think it was the next night.
The next night I did it.

150
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,230
He was so fucking embarrassed.

151
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,310
He struck out three times and
everyone was giving him shit at work.

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,260
But this guy can go to the golf course.
So I, I think bowling, Golf Pool,

153
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,320
I know people have said this before, but
after watching that guy went today, I, I,

154
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,560
you know, I totally
respect the game. I think,

155
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,290
oh shit. One of the things about golf
is you can also be a normal person.

156
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,700
And I mean like in basketball you
can't be normal. You're how many?

157
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:36,390
Six 10 guys did you see today? You know?
Yeah. When you go to the mall, how many?

158
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,970
Six 10 guys,
you'll see none because it's so,

159
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,510
it's such a freak game and the guys that
are small or even freaks cause their

160
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,060
quickness is being unbelief.
Like John Stockton,

161
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,830
his hands were twice as big as ours.

162
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,980
There's always something freaky
about something. It's spelling. Yeah,

163
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,820
but in golf you can be like pretty
much a normal guy for some reason.

164
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,130
You got that, you whack
that ball, whatever

165
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,310
it is, the Torque, the physics
behind it. All golfers,

166
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:03,180
they're all like almost in shape. Right?
But I mean the guy, a little bit of packs,

167
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,420
but they got little bit of a belly. Dude,
if you can kill that fucking mouth, man.

168
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,440
I meant killing them every God damn
week. Oh Shit. How did you miss that?

169
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,990
I didn't miss it. I hit it. I
do. I stunned them all rang.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,390
He looked at me, just see him looking
at me. How much of a Dick I am, I,

171
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,870
I got you over here. You brought the
wine. He got an offer. You might have

172
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,690
now eaten that my clothing and I'm
giving you shit about it and I was always

173
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,780
good to you, Bill. I took care
of you in back in the day.

174
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,440
Now early on you were really mean to me.
Get the fuck out. You used to bully me.

175
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,010
Yeah, right, you did? Yeah. When I was
in the comedy locker room and you came in

176
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,640
way back in the day,

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,340
that was just horseplay and we
had some horseplay is horseplay.

178
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,230
Well nowadays is considered hazing.

179
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,210
You know I have a friend who's
prosecuting that Sandusky case. Oh yeah.

180
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,710
He went off the other day. He
went to television. You went off

181
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,140
on that sand. Duskin his lawyer. But
by the way, not to be egotistical.

182
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,930
This is pretty funny about ask his lawyer.
I said,

183
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,670
what an idiot that guy is because
I see such a more like it.

184
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,620
And they go and my friend Joe goes,
I gotta tell you something dumb.

185
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,610
He's a big fan of yours. If they
said, what an idiot, well, he's that,

186
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,950
I'm not finished. There's so bad.
He does have good taste. The comedy,

187
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,960
how many times? That's a, that's
a great thing to bring up though.

188
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,390
How many times have you made
fun of somebody in your act?

189
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,960
They like a cartoon deal and then
all of a sudden, you know, five,

190
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:28,950
six years later you're standing
in the room with them. Oh
yeah. And then you just,

191
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,530
then you're just going, oh my
God. Did they hear what I said?

192
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,560
Well, one of my first jokes, uh,

193
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,610
that was a closer joke in my act
was before I did the tonight show.

194
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:41,550
I did star search right now when you
did the tonight show was Atlanta or no,

195
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:45,320
it was Carson Carson. So, but I did the
stage here, but before I did is I show,

196
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,750
after I'd done star search,
I had a joke about it McMahon.

197
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,740
The joke was a kind of went, like
I said, I meet Ed Mcmahon. I said,

198
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:55,070
I'm thrilled 35 years in the business.
What do I say to them in a calm ed?

199
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,550
Do I call him Mister Ed? They'll call him
mister e. Mr Eddie Mcmahon, Mr Ubic, fat,

200
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:02,450
lucky talentless Hump Kissing
Johnny's ass for the last 30 years.

201
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:05,690
You Budweiser's sucked in outposts,
slinging nothing. What do you do?

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,370
I don't mean that in a bad way,
but that was the joke. And uh,

203
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,880
he comes up to me right before I go on
to say hi to me. No, I didn't know that.

204
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,950
He thought the joke was
funny that he had seen me.

205
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:19,730
They knew who I was and he pulls me
towards it. I'm thinking, Oh shit,

206
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:23,400
ed McMahon is gonna slide guy
real big six floor, you know,

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,560
and he was strong then.

208
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:28,520
This was what this was like before
he got kind of Strunk and, and older.

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,160
And I thought, man, I that make
man's going to sucker, man.

210
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:34,730
I got to go on stun my first
tonight. Chose that, you know,

211
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,490
but I'm starting to be
saying, well, what he's,

212
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,130
what are you gonna just said he'd
have a great set and you know,

213
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,800
he was just very nice, you know, but
he had, he heard the better and he had,

214
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,590
but I didn't know he had,
his daughter told me he had,

215
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:49,460
and then we worked together at the
Philadelphia Academy of Music doing some

216
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:53,030
benefit. And he told me he loved the
bit, you know, he thought it was funny.

217
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,040
Let's see.

218
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,900
Yeah, we gotta love a guy who was
like comfortable with a, yeah,

219
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,060
with where he's at. He's big enough that
you, that he's famous and it's funny.

220
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,140
So in that sense, so you don't do
jokes about, not to talk about comedy,

221
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,550
but how fucking nerve wracking was it to
do the tonight show with Johnny Carson?

222
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:13,150
Because there was that whole thing that
you couldn't just go out and have a good

223
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,960
snow. He had to get the
okay. The thumbs. Okay.

224
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:21,430
Was like you did good thumbs up.
It was the imprimatur of comedy.

225
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,720
I mean it was like,
you know,

226
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,620
most of the time you got called over
either because he wanted you over there or

227
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,460
because of timing.
And you know that guy who's that comedian,

228
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,700
that really alcohol comedian from
Boston. Teddy bears on. Yeah.

229
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,330
And no offense to teddy, but he got it.
Got It. I get it. I can open my hand.

230
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,730
I can't open my hand cause I got it.
We'll just keep squeezing your hand.

231
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,840
Was He there? He got fucking crawl
away again. Sorry. I tell you,

232
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,520
he's indestructible. He looked at me
like, you got to bring to the table. Yeah,

233
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,330
it gets a bit more to
the table and that baby,

234
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,800
but a teddy apparently did too long,
so they brought him over to the thing,

235
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,380
you know.
But what we were asking me before,

236
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,600
it was an interesting thing
because there was no fun in it.

237
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,680
There was no joy in it. All it was
was a passing, passing through some,

238
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,070
some worm tunnel.
It was like the White Apollo in a way,

239
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
but rather than the crowd,

240
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,590
it was like he was going to pull
you by just not bringing you over.

241
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,710
And I remember looking out into
the hills and Burbank thinking,

242
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm going to run away.
I'll start a new life up in the woods.

243
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,440
I really did because I couldn't. It was
so, there was no fun. My fucking head was,

244
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,400
he led the curse. Yeah. My
head was pounding my, my I,

245
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,860
I never get headaches.
I would buy a pounding headache.

246
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,970
My heart was beaten like a rabbit's,
you know? And then I got off,

247
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:39,550
he gave me the songs,
they told me we got to have you back.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And that was like how many like hours
of just absolute relief is that?

249
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,520
Oh, that must have just been
unreal. Yeah, that's what I always,

250
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,920
I hope the amount of times I
think that like why do I do this?

251
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,110
As you're standing there before
you're going out like kids,

252
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,990
I'm really actually a really introverted
person before I started doing this shit.

253
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,020
So now I'm just sort of a loud mouth
asshole kind of grew into, but you know,

254
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,380
just from being on stage.
But like the first I would say like eight,

255
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,690
nine years of doing this shit I,

256
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,260
the amount of times I was just standing
in the waiting to go on in some fucking

257
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,980
impossible situ with some awful, yeah,
like next third show or something.

258
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,210
We were around for those days and all
the Nick's, Nick's comedy South Boston,

259
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:26,650
I started at nick. That was a,
I mean luckily the, the guys,

260
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:30,070
the Boston comics were good to me, but
that was a tough place. I was brutal.

261
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,650
That was tough. If you are from
Boston, I heard show Friday. Yeah.

262
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,890
And then they would put like
10 fucking Boston headliners.

263
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,670
But see they took care of me, you
know like uh, Gavin and Sweeney,

264
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,090
they all looked out for me and he,
they didn't try and bury me, whatever,

265
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,020
for whatever reason we always got
along. So it was different for me. Like,

266
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,130
like I heard Richard Lewis was so
upset because somebody's swinging,

267
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,680
he goes follow right. Follow that.
All my stuff, my esoteric stuff,

268
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,543
Boston stuff.

269
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,020
And Richard apparently hid under the
seats hit under the stage until everybody

270
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:04,730
left. Yeah. I don't know
why they used to do that,

271
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,700
but they, I guess they used
to get territorial or it's
really kind of a funny,

272
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,460
funny thing considering I didn't have to
go through it and I wasn't from out of

273
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,570
town. The fact that they'd be like, you
know, what do you need a headline is for,

274
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:14,990
we're here,

275
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,190
we can close this and that you would
cause so many comics do when you go on the

276
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:23,090
road, tried to bury you, but they never
have the audacity of just say like,

277
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:27,080
follow that. You know, they always watched
my back. They were always good to me,

278
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,090
but does your, then you ended up stealing
from the club and what happened there?

279
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,420
I stole from the club. Yeah.
You don't remember that cash.

280
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,870
The guy went out. And
what do you know? Uh,

281
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,900
does your audience know that you were
the one I was part of the, I'm sorry.

282
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,090
That's all right.
We got to do a commercial here anyways.

283
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,500
Hang on one second and get a fucking type
in this stupid password. Um, all right,

284
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,800
here we go. stamps.com everybody. Dom,
I don't know if you've heard about this,

285
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,510
but do you hate going to the post office?
I hate it. I absolutely can't stand it.

286
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,800
Why do you have a suggestion?
Oh, wouldn't it be great, Donna?

287
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:07,070
If somehow you could have the post
office within your own apartment. Great.

288
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:08,860
It'd be more, it'd be
unbelievable. Unbelievable.

But if you know somebody that
could do then these guys,

321
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,980
That should be in their bumper sticker,
stamps.com. It's a hell of a deal.

322
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,410
All right, back to the podcast here. Um,

323
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,090
now does your audience know
that you were the one that, uh,

324
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,410
I mean I was the one that kind of sparked,

325
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,160
sparked but kind of set you up a little
and then when he did that brilliant rant

326
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,460
and Camden, oh, the Philly thing, Bill. Oh
yeah, you went, you went on before. Yeah.

327
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,200
You went out. You were one of the other
ones who went to the, uh, and you also,

328
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,850
they started booing you
and you didn't leave,

329
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,980
but for some reason they
didn't put that on Youtube. No,

330
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,450
I told them that I make $12,000
in 10 minutes. Fuck. You know,

331
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,050
I remember you standing there going like,
why,

332
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:30,900
why would you think you
guys could make me leave?

333
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,020
And they actually paused from
booing you for half a second,

334
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,550
but it was only the people in the back of,

335
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,970
the thing I loved about you was you were
like sticking up for me and I thought

336
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:41,480
that was really cool. And you
went, they boot dom Irrera like,

337
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,980
like one of my heroes. Fuck, come on.

338
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,240
You remember when I was in Boston and
somebody new you a headliner and was

339
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,600
saying that a yeah.
You know,

340
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,650
the other night don was in town and
we were shooting pool and I remember

341
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:55,140
thinking that that was smart.
He knows dom I rarer,

342
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,480
so I was psyched to be working
with you and not to mention,

343
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,410
do you remember that line up that night?
Yeah,

344
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,540
the way that they would be because
everyone went out there and there was that

345
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,840
dance motherfucker vibe. Do
the, as far as I can remember,

346
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,860
it was rich Vos. Tracy Morgan.
Yeah. Remember Tracy Tree?

347
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,640
So Neil, you, Bobby Kelly, me,
Jimmy Schubert, Jimmy Schubert.

348
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,290
They booed me. Schubert. They
didn't let him say a word. He says,

349
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,510
I bombed and see you can't
bond with a late at talk.

350
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,810
You can't bomb when it's still light
and you're standing outside and half the

351
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:27,930
crowd is sitting down. That poor
bastard brought half his family there.

352
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,640
But the funniest guy, I know
Jim Norton. Ralphie may,

353
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,870
that was the show.
Dude.

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,560
I can tell you in 20 years people are
going to look back at that lineup and be

355
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:41,940
like, why were people getting booed?
They were drinking all day. It was crazy.

356
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:45,320
And it just outside though. Can I tell
you something? My car, my deserve it.

357
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
Cause like in 1988 I went to go see
a dice clay at the Worcester Centrum,

358
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,880
uh, at the height of that, uh,

359
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:56,940
of the dice stuff and an unknown
Eddie Griffin was opening for him,

360
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,380
which is a great time for comedy and we
will all Boone and out when I was born

361
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,260
it was who? Eddie Griffin. Yeah.
Eddie. It was your born Eddie Griffin.

362
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,190
He wasn't famous.

363
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:08,500
I wasn't a comic and I was doing
that more on audience sing like that.

364
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,560
Tyson is going to love us because we're
doing this because we want dice to come

365
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:17,760
on. And, and Eddie Griffin stood
there going, fuck you mother fuckers.

366
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm not getting off stage. And
people kind of like, Whoa, oh,

367
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:21,540
we thought you were just going to run off.

368
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,660
And then he ended up killing doing that
Michael Jackson thing that he did or

369
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:27,210
something killed.
He ended up turning around and killed.

370
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,050
So that's the thing about that Philly
thing. Why don't make such a big deal?

371
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,950
Because I was like, guys, a
bunch of guys have done that.

372
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:35,520
There just was no youtube where you told
me that they expect you to do it after

373
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:38,430
that. But I gotta tell you the
funniest line for some reason.

374
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,450
Fuck the Liberty Bell. I Dunno
why, but that made me cry.

375
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:47,150
I lash and like what the fuck?
The Liberty Bell Dunne.

376
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,070
I'm with nab.

377
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,670
I hope he gets an HDL to shift flyers.

378
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,070
Have a once is Gerald Ford was president,
but then fuck the liberty.

379
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,170
That's like so many Boston yelling at
somebody going, hey, fuck Paul revere.

380
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,030
Like we give a shit. Right, right. Damn
man. I'm saying don't talk about our bell.

381
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,040
Hey, don't talk about our
tourist attractions like that.

382
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,830
That's not the boat's buddy.
Yeah.

383
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,730
And that was, uh, one of a,

384
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,360
now they're happy night on that happened
on the happy night on the road when you

385
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:18,710
got anything. And I, rumor
has it that you're going to
be starting up your own, uh,

386
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:19,620
your own podcast.

387
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:22,970
And rumor has it that I might be on a
short list of guests that you're trying.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,361
Well,
yeah,

389
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:25,730
you said that you didn't want to do it
right away because we're talking now,

390
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:27,440
but I want you to do it as
soon as you want to do it.

391
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:30,290
It's going to be a dom Irrera
live at the laugh factory.

392
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,930
I'll come, I'll come down
and do it, Mike. Mike,

393
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,110
because you're our conversational guy.

394
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,320
I just don't like when I go and I do
somebody's podcast and for an hour we tell

395
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,690
all our stories to each other,
blah, blah blah. And then hey,

396
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,370
come and do my podcast next week.

397
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:48,360
And then I had always feels like what
I did for VH one where I wasn't on,

398
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:51,510
I love the eighties I was on,
I love the 80 strikes back.

399
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,300
So they had already talked
about all the a level shit.

400
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,850
So when I came through it was like,
do you remember,

401
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,230
what would you do for a Klondike Bar?
All the Eddie Murphy Raw,

402
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,120
uh, back to the future. All that shit
was gone and it was like the really, uh,

403
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,250
do you remember a show called square
pegs? A, you know, Short live show?

404
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:14,280
Can you got to comedy on that? It was
really like a, so that, that, that's,

405
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,100
that would be the reason why I
don't do that though. But if you,

406
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:18,710
if you're wondering,
I want to tell you,

407
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:21,870
I really appreciate you breaking
out your new shoes for this.

408
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,541
These aren't new.

409
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,640
I just don't wear them much because
they look like bowling shoes.

410
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,510
These are Todd's there. I was
going to say bowling shoes. He 85

411
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,260
a shoe. Three 85 a shoe.
That's how expensive

412
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,920
you have to be.
Can't buy a pair by him individually.

413
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,131
I bought,

414
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:39,200
I bought the first one and then the
other one I'm going to come back and get

415
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:42,350
later. How do you rate bill?
What's your process? Well,

416
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:45,230
you know what it is is I try and
go out and live a life. Okay.

417
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,610
And then it writes itself.

418
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,310
And as a community you always
have to be observing things.

419
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,500
You know the newspaper I read like 17
newspapers a day. Dot. That's what I do.

420
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,990
Wow. I just cause I want
to see it from every angle.

421
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,360
So you're more of a informative person
than an actual comedian, do you?

422
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:02,440
You don't even go for lab.

423
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,230
Oh No, no, no, not at all. Well, you've
seen my sets down there, don't. Yeah.

424
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,990
Well what dumb. That's what I always
loved about watching you on stage.

425
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,720
I didn't go for left handed to the
crab Felicity to just stand there,

426
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,760
stare at me and just not walk off stage.
It was this amazing.

427
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,190
I want that crowd think,

428
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,480
and this is what I'm more of a
motivational speaker when they,

429
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,620
when they leave my show, I want them
to think, fuck, I could do that.

430
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,330
So that's what I'm about you with the
labs and the killing I, yeah, it's old.

431
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,450
It's old school. I liked the teaching.
You know what I love what comedians say.

432
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,400
A true story like that makes a difference.
Like,

433
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,110
like they're going to leave say savor.
Yeah, that was a true story. Yeah.

434
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:43,520
But you're going out at the end
that go, you know, a second guy.

435
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,080
I didn't think he was funny,
but when you talk about

436
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,450
my God, he was honest. I think there
was other guys made that shit up.

437
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:55,360
That really funny shit. Oh well, you
know what I love is you, you, uh,

438
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,810
you still come down and work
out and I always work out.

439
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,540
I feel like there's just a handful of
us who once you start selling tickets on

440
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,120
the roads will still go down. I don't
know why guys who take off to the club,

441
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,430
I mean, I understand that like if you're
married and like I'm single right now,

442
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,470
but even when I wasn't, my girlfriend
didn't understand. I go, well,

443
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm trying to get better, but what
do you think? I said, you know,

444
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,970
like you can't say like, like when I
did the tonight show, that was 1987.

445
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,820
Right. That's a long time
ago that, you know, I could,

446
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,260
I mean I PR you have to practice. I can't
let go. Like, if you play basketball,

447
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,760
you can't say to somebody, uh, you know,

448
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,710
I usually score 25 points of the
game and he's going to, well,

449
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:35,450
you know what palliate you
scored for tonight. So, you
know, I, you want to be good.

450
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:38,690
I mean, I know you have the same
motivation that I have to keep improving.

451
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:41,330
You're not, you're not really
competing against anybody else.

452
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,140
You just compete with yourself.
I am competing with a lot of people.

453
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,500
Who are you jealous of? Who's
really makes you angry? Success.

454
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,210
It's just something about,
you know what it is.

455
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:53,630
I've always been jealous like swagger.

456
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,550
My tough guy to know about you is your,
uh, your, your arm wrestling abilities.

457
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,910
Mm. We were talking about that last
night. Not to be a name dropper. What?

458
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,550
Renee Zellweger cute. You ever
see her live beautiful? No,

459
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,860
I've only seen it in the movies with that.

460
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,230
That fucking guy looks like Phil
Mickelson buddies from England.

461
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,860
You got to go to the
hooker. Oh yeah, yeah. Yes.

462
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,410
It should've been like on the $20,000.
Yeah.

463
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,900
The one that he was that hookers
name like names like Phillip North.

464
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
What the fuck was his name now? I
forgot I'm Harry Harrington. No,

465
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,100
it's something Bobby Bittman. Yeah,
it was like, oh, he's Rosenthal.

466
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,450
It was like something, just a
little Rosenthal. He's the producer.

467
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,000
Draymond now he's a, what the fuck
was his name? Harry crumb. No, no,

468
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,090
I don't. I'm terrible at names.
Harry. You really terrible.

469
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:45,830
It's not able to close your gray
Harry Carey Harrington. Hugh grant.

470
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:49,350
I knew that. Something like that. What
was the hunter's Dan Remembers? Uh,

471
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,180
it would be a great memory. That'd be
a great recall. It's like destiny or

472
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,450
holy shit get good that she has to ask
me. What a question though. She was hot.

473
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,410
She was hot, she was hot. And she,
she, you know, and that's, you know,

474
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,600
that's one of those great things
about being a hooker here in la.

475
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,350
Just like everybody at any moment.
You don't know.

476
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,600
You're gonna run into lot of exposure
and movie star. It was great exposure.

477
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,580
How about the Eddie Murphy
thing with the transvestite?

478
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,110
Was that ever proven though? Well, he,
I think, I think it was proven that he,

479
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,371
you know,

480
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:22,640
and nobody could ever prove that he didn't
know it was that he knew it was a man.

481
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,923
But,
uh,

482
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,270
you don't go to Santa Monica Boulevard
and pick up a regular hookers.

483
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,210
What if you're going just going to
swing it by yum, yum donuts. He,

484
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,840
this happened to me. They
look, I don't think Eddie
Murphy, he's a brilliant actor,

485
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,980
but I mean the thing is the
way, what is with all the, what,

486
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:41,380
what's the deal with all deal?

487
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,310
What's the deal with all the doughnut

488
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,470
places out these people and why
do they eat so many doughnuts?

489
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,310
I don't have a Billy donuts.

490
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,900
Never seen so many, not only so many
fucking doughnut shops out here,

491
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,970
but they're all like,
seem to be independently owned and uh,

492
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,400
everyone has a different
name is yum, yum donuts. Go,

493
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:06,900
go down another Arlo boy, they got some
donuts and everybody out here works out.

494
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,510
Who pays the whole you to a
hole in the middle of the year,

495
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,310
your friend Renee Zellweger eat a dozen
and then fucking Yak. I'm up in Maya.

496
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,550
What I was going to say, but at any
point when you were talking to her,

497
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:22,290
did she do some sort of touching of your
arm or maybe tapped you on me and it

498
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,580
just made you feel like
a little boy again? Well,

499
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,580
she had to believe that
Chris was like her. Her whole

500
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,240
aura aura is really positive.
Entered her.

501
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,900
She is right in the middle of her chest.
She is a centrally located key.

502
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,770
But uh, but you know how
I met her. Listen to this,

503
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:44,130
talk about a name dropping thing first
was on a Sunday night. I'm in Cleveland.

504
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,240
It's snowing sideways. It was so bad
at next day. Fox, it was snowing.

505
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm telling you it was start
talking about Snowden. I'll tow.

506
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,760
It's got ran off the lake. It's a
lake effect. Snow. It's real snow.

507
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,560
It's like effect. You see the
difference. Uh, but uh, I'm,

508
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm sitting in Cleveland
looking out the window of the,

509
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,990
I'm not even going to
get out of here tomorrow.

510
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,380
I had to go to a reading
ready for this name drop city.

511
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,940
Sean Penn had called me up the
Jesus Christ dom. I know. Wait,

512
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,920
there's more to read with
the Chazz Palminteri Deniro.

513
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,940
Renee Zellweger go fuck yourself for what?
For a movie.

514
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,350
A comedy movie about,

515
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,550
and I was supposed to play deniros
brother now shorts over Broadway. Yeah.

516
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,360
Bullets of row. No, this is really, this
is just last year. The matter of fact,

517
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,850
they called me a month ago to come
in and read the rewrites with them,

518
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:35,700
but I couldn't make it. I
have bronchitis. But uh,

519
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,900
I'm sitting there and I've really turned
into woody Allen because at the end of

520
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,240
the thing, I, you know,

521
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,360
I just got to kind of a crush on Renee
Zellweger and she's so pretty and soak

522
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,100
such a good actress and she says,

523
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:51,690
you really good to cause I hope I get to
work with you babe. And she said, Babe.

524
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,220
And I went and I was walking down the
steps alone. I'm going, she called me be

525
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,100
Babe Babe. Yeah. Powerful. The
power of a beautiful and figure,

526
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,290
but if they have famous, yeah, I did a,

527
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:07,291
I did a show one time and down Irvine
down at the mall there and a the end of

528
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:13,471
the show there's this woman came up and
just really quickly shook my hand and,

529
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,090
and then said really funny and then left.
I'm telling you,

530
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:19,720
it was like fucking electricity
was in our hand and it was,

531
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,620
it was the chick from the white snake
videos who walked around in the of the

532
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:27,280
white dress still looking good. But
like, and I had no idea who she was,

533
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:28,450
but she just had like that.

534
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,960
Like there was no way she wasn't going
to become famous. I'm telling you dude,

535
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:34,750
she shook my hand and it was like fucking
a lightning bolt. Went through it.

536
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,330
There's definitely energy and she's like,
I don't know,

537
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:40,360
pushing 50 and there was all these other
20 something year old hotties and I'm

538
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,980
watching her out the door. Like, who the

539
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,680

want to talk like that. Oh,

540
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,610
that you had that sort of electricity dom.

541
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,490
Do you ever wish that you had that sort
of, I never went. You know, he wish I did.

542
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,670
Even when I was good looking,
I wasn't a good look at the it factor.

543
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,330
You know what? I love that. Who,
who's been uh, um, uh, oh man,

do that. Welcome back Kotter. Nope. Nope.

548
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,750
He passed away. Fuck man. It's now
it's becoming really stressful.

549
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,584
The show redhead,

550
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,490
redhead with the mustache does Wartburg
Dennis Wolfsburg when he used to do they

551
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,490
just say that cause I'm bad with
names and then I totally love the guy.

552
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,660
Then I panicked and then I just forget
it. This is why I do this. I sucked.

553
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:34,420
You're blocking, you're blocking.
I'm putting too much pressure.

554
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,460
That's why I don't golf.
I don't golf with these bubbles.

555
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,400
He's self taught guys who beat the
Gretzky's in the Mario Muse. Um,

556
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,530
he used to do this bit about the
it factor, having it with women.

557
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,230
But remember that joke you can,
I don't know what it is.

558
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,250
I don't think I ever had it.
He goes, but whatever it is,

559
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,420
I have the antidote gentlemen.
And he would stick his tongue out.

560
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,990
Fucking love Doug Guy. I probably
just butchered his God damn joke.

561
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,380
And it was probably gonna say there's
a funny, but you know, he was, he was,

562
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,820
he mugged a lot, but he was
funny. Oh, it's just to me,
this whole act was mugging.

563
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,260
He went, he went out to, uh, the
comedy connection of Providence,

564
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:13,370
right in the end when he
was sick and he sat down,

565
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,490
I heard about Lloyd and
got a standing ovation.

566
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,270
I heard he did that and they already
did Boston when it was still open to

567
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,630
connection. Absolutely
destroyed you. I heard one time,

568
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,630
I heard you one time,
you did a set half sitting,

569
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:30,631
half standing simultaneously either
in your fucking destroyed it.

570
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:34,630
No cracks me up is like a c
like better the kid, you know,

571
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,110
what does he like 39, good shape,
whatever. He started looking guy. Yeah,

572
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,160
and he sits down after
about two minutes on stage.

573
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,280
We don't 15 minutes to
calm store all day long.

574
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,960
We all fuck who don't work and then he
sits down. He takes a break. Two minutes.

575
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,921
Oh boy.

576
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:55,420
Anybody fired and he looks like he could
do like 40 pull ups when he wakes up.

577
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,370
He could do it. I'm sure he could. Yeah.

578
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,250
Well I'm glad we finally got to that
about 40 minutes. Then we finally know,

579
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,830
30 minutes said that we realized that
a bright orange says he's really one of

580
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:06,910
the, one of the more lazier guys out
here, which is, yeah, he's a lazy,

581
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:09,250
funny comedian.
This is the kind of things,

582
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:13,240
I mean I can't believe you got me to
admit certain things in the show or you're

583
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,970
about to to. I want to make
your cry is what I want to do.

584
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,110
I think since somehow
Brent Ernst's killing while
sitting down and being better

585
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:21,700
looking and in better
shape than both of us,

586
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,030
I think this is going to
lead you to crank. Well, I
realize now, you know, look,

587
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:27,710
look how much weight I've
gained right now. You know,

588
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,820
I've gained since I've known
you for 30 pounds. All right?

589
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,420
And I know that I can't tell.
Well, you don't really look,

590
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,110
you don't really check me out. It is all
done. Look at my head. My head is bigger.

591
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,010
What are you wearing?
That slimming black tee

592
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,340
shirt.

593
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,340
I've got a Bob Barry bonds head,

594
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,640
but it's interesting because now, and
I don't even know if this is a bit yet,

595
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,310
Bill, but I think there's
something in it. I have to look.

596
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,670
I don't like women my own age,
and you know what I mean? I can't,

597
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,680
I can't fake that. I could get aroused
by them. No, I always wanted it.

598
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,670
I wish I had that kind of
love or something, but I
need like a hot young chick.

599
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,830
But the only hot young chick I'm
going to get has to be floored.

600
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,570
She's gotta be daddy issue
inside or outside. Yeah.

601
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,330
He's gotta be messed up in some way.
But that's what I'm looking for.

602
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,500
How many, uh, how many strippers
have you, have you dated,

603
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,760
dated, uh, only a couple. I was
in love with Warren. How old?

604
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,460
How old were you when you did, when
you made that move? Uh, two years ago.

605
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,140
You fell in love with the
stretch? Yeah. When you,

606
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,530
first of all this a
country song, she was, um,

607
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,690
she was not stripping at the time.

608
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:39,540
She was bartending and just
given the occasional lap dance

609
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,710
and really beautiful girl and under
that bar and fun. But I'll tell you,

610
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:48,120
oxycontin and alcohol really mess you up.
I don't know if you knew that,

611
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,140
but I still loved the girl,
but she's a, I don't think,

612
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,200
I don't think we're getting
back together that oxy,

613
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,210
her husband and their two
kids keep blocking us.

614
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:01,530
Oh, Jesus. Dom, you're making
me feel good. Make me feel good.

615
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:06,000
Some of the choices I made
back in the day, dude, oxy
is, uh, that's a terrible one,

616
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:09,270
right? Yeah. That's one of those things
like even when you get off at your,

617
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,990
I don't know that you're ever, uh,
depending on how long you do it, the same.

618
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:17,620
I lost a buddy of mine did that. I got
another one. He's not doing so well.

619
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,260
Did you grow up in a neighborhood that
was a lot of drugs. I'm not like that.

620
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,090
Not like that. It was a, I
grew up, you know, it was, it
was called the sac bullshit.

621
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:28,680
It was weed.
There was the weed guy,

622
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:32,880
there was the bookie and then w and then
there was, you know blues obviously,

623
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:37,710
but you know in some coke
when you got older, but uh,

624
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,160
like nobody was doing like
heroin and crack was like,

625
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,560
you're out of your fucking mind. Cause
everybody thought if you smoke crack,

626
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,650
that was it. You had done well the, they
say you get addicted the first time.

627
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,230
The look, that's what they said. But I,

628
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,230
I got friends of mine who had did
and they're like, yeah, you're okay.

629
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,400
It was all right. Still Rolling. Yeah.
Maybe they're addicted to other things.

630
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,850
They don't have time to be. Maybe they're
just better people. Better, stronger.

631
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:58,740
You have good friends.
Let me ask you this.

632
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:02,880
If you had one drug that you think
you would like, what would it be?

633
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,370
I know what mine is. If you, if I could
do a drug that I've never tried it,

634
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,550
we tried and you think that like it's
not going to have any repercussions.

635
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:15,250
Just want to the feeling.
What feeling would it be?

636
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,490
I have a tie. Well, I want to know.
I want to know what it feels like.

637
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,050
Like that train spotting where you
sink into the rug the first time you do

638
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:28,560
heroin. That's exactly, that's
exactly what I want that.

639
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:32,450
But I got to admit the hallucinating
thing tripping. Yeah, but I'll,

640
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,380
but that doesn't go on your trip it,

641
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,980
and it's not like you don't know
the a trepan you the door fucking

642
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,230
melting. You're like, oh,
it's because I'm on acid.

643
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,600
It's not like those high school
films where you'd be like,

644
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,490
you thought you could fly in.
That jumped out to me.

645
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,530
Uh, what was that movie with that
old guy? Was it something to me,

646
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,000
Larry Allen Ark and did a part where he
played an old guy and he fucking, uh,

647
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,150
he just, he got addicted to heroin
like his seventies and he's just like,

648
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:04,680
what the fuck? I'm 70. That's a guy
she had good idea just to try it at 70.

649
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,040
I mean I'd rather go out shooting drugs
and go out taking a kick in the ass.

650
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,990
That must hurt man. That's a
thing. You ever think about
that seriously bill? Yeah.

651
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,550
Excepting one at things. Take one for
the team and taking one for the team.

652
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:23,700
I dime your number came up. So you're
not going to like this like this.

653
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,740
I don't think so. We worked this out. Now
I've actually thought of early a priest.

654
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,330
How I,
how I want to go out in by wolves.

655
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,960
Eat shredded by animals.
Yeah.

656
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,560
I either want to live to be like 105 like
you lived so long that there's nobody

657
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:45,561
at your funeral because you outlived
everyone who gives a shit or you know,

658
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,631
cause that,
cause that,

659
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:49,650
that is funny image cause that's one
of the things if you live long enough,

660
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,500
I'm sure we had people that cared
about people doing the eulogy. Like,

661
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,330
I mean ever since I met him when he
was 87 and uh, you know, he was old,

662
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,290
like he like playing cards,
which were those slippers.

663
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,420
He always wore those slippers.
But if you die,

664
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,610
like you know,
like all my friends,

665
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,410
you know who have died tragically
fucking young it seems,

666
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:16,000
I mean you pack the house and
everybody's up there try and get a good,

667
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:20,350
that's the only good thing about dying
young is everybody gives a fuck it,

668
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,420
there's articles written about you.
There's nothing worse when,

669
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,940
I mean there's nothing worse than dying
yet, but Diane old also is, you know,

670
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:30,770
you sit in there that you've got
that fucking old terrified picture.

671
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,500
My uncle Tony, when he died, he really
was very prejudiced and very angry,

672
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,920
but he also loved his children.
He loved God, he loved mountains.

673
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,910
And then when he died was so fun.
Is that makeup for the racist side yet?

674
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:49,820
But I'm saying he was that balance process
on people in the nature love Berlin.

675
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:52,150
It's true though.
He was like all that and he's,

676
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,920
and we're standing around the coffin.
You see that mountain. It's for us.

677
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,030
That's for us. Not these other
people. This is God's country.

678
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,270
But when we're around the
quote from we're standing,

679
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,970
you know people lie about people after
they died and this guy leaves the Deli,

680
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:10,950
who was the first a tank character ever
did? Like I got down a little, he said,

681
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,521
we're staying there.

682
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:15,060
Me and a friend of mine who a priest and
like a couple of my cousins and we're

683
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:16,920
standing there, oh over
the body. And he goes,

684
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,170
he never had a bad word
to say about anybody.

685
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,860
And we went from crying to fucking
laugh. I'm thinking, I said,

686
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:25,710
all they do is have bare word said,
but everybody, and then he goes,

687
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,690
listen to this, this is a
really old reference. He goes,

688
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,110
he never hated anybody except Larry Bowa.
Right.

689
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,010
Larry both of the old for the Phillies
and he, and he looks up, he goes, he

690
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,840
hated that motherfucker would engine. Huh?
Was he a gambler? No, he didn't gamble.

691
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:41,674
He just hated him.

692
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,520
He hated the Larry Boat cause he hit
one 75 but he was a great fielder.

693
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,600
But I mean, Halloween. What a, what an
obscure reference to make at a funeral.

694
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,520
And so in general,
back in the day,

695
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,820
he probably just didn't like
second basement frustrating,
maybe that the floor.

696
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,220
But I love that everybody laughed.

697
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:59,860
I've had a couple of those it like
funerals were crying, crying, crying,

698
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:00,694
the crying,
laughing.

699
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,140
I did that one time a buddy of mine,

700
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:07,940
his dad died and it was just one of those
fucking, you know, tragic. You know,

701
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:10,400
we were young and he died on a
nowhere and the kid had already lost,

702
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:14,360
his mom was fucking horrible.
And uh, so it was pouring,

703
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:19,160
raining to make it even worse. Fucking
like the, remember the movie seven?

704
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,410
It was raining like that. Okay.
Yeah. So we, we, you know,

705
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,870
go, you know, go through the surface
and now they're going to, you know,

706
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:29,150
put the guy in the ground and
the guy was so popular. I mean,

707
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:32,180
it was just a zillion people there. So
they had like one of these, you know,

708
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:37,010
one of those pop tents with no sides to
it. So there's so many fucking people,

709
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:40,910
everybody's jamming in there. Me
and my buddy can't get in. You know,

710
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,340
we're on the outer ring,
we're just getting rained on and shit.

711
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,420
And my other asshole friend is just
inside the tent and he's sitting there and

712
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:50,420
we're all crying and stuff and it bringing
the body down and all of a sudden,

713
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,830
just from the weight of the rain,

714
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,680
like this little like canal started
pouring down in just missing my friend and

715
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,700
my buddy in the middle of
crimes was standing range,

716
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:02,300
just reached up and adjusted it.
So it went all over as a coach.

717
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:06,050
But he had like this wool kind of coat
on so he couldn't feel it at first.

718
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,130
And Dude, I'm talking, crying, laughing,

719
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,930
just crying because it
was so sad and that,

720
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,730
that's the thing too that I never thought
people ever understand about comics

721
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:18,290
when they have a distasteful joke,

722
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,950
like a boat sinks as a plane
crash and you have a job.

723
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,170
They always think it's cause you're
insensitive and they'd sometimes don't

724
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:28,610
understand that it's, it's a defense
mechanism where exciting. The pain. Yeah,

725
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:32,090
I'm feeling something bad. I don't
want to feel it. And then you, you,

726
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,780
you make a fucking joke and then you're
laughing because you don't want to feel

727
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:39,090
that. So you actually doing it because you
can, it's kind of a, I think, I think, uh,

728
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,110
a dysfunction.
It's kind of a form of dysfunction.

729
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,410
Well, like the pedophile jokes,
we all know how terrible that is.

730
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,240
And yet you could twist sentences, but
you could, you could twist it around.

731
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,830
I usually bring it back on myself.
You know, like a one jokes that says,

732
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:58,130
you know what about me, father, I wasn't
hot enough for you. You know what I mean?

733
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:00,980
Like that kind of thing to make it me.
I wouldn't want to hurt a kid.

734
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:03,800
But there is a good example of something
that has caused so many people,

735
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:08,240
so much pain. And I'm not just talking
about the physical pain, but um, you know,

736
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:08,910
we do,

737
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,210
you're, you end somebody's life when
you, that's why that that sent Dusky guy.

738
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,440
Yeah. You know, like they
shouldn't put those get date.

739
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:18,750
They should automatically get the
death penalty just immediately.

740
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,350
They take 'em out. Dude, if you've
got a rabid dog in your neighborhood,

741
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:26,130
you fucking put it down. Those
sex offender guys, that's it.

742
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,090
Because all those people
that that dude fucked with,

743
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,490
it's like that's can now affect,
you want to talk about dating strippers?

744
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:37,220
Like how that's going
to affect who they pick.

745
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,970
You know who they pick as a
uh, a wife, how they treat
their kids. They might, they,

746
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,050
there's a chance that they
could, you know, sometimes,

747
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:45,830
I don't know if he had happened,

748
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:50,150
I'm going to go beyond my intelligence
on this shit, which isn't too hard to do,

749
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:54,840
but I all I know is that
that's generations of therapy
because of the abuse of

750
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:59,070
the, they, they repeat the whoever.
Yeah. Those guys, they don't get the,

751
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,550
you can't put that guy in jail and like,
I mean,

752
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:06,470
how long like you're attracted to what
you're attracted to or in a cell. Well,

753
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:08,330
especially with, at Dartmouth,
they stuck you in a cell.

754
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:10,550
How long before you wouldn't
like big tented strippers,

755
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,790
you'd come out 80 years
later. I'm dumb. I,

756
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:18,140
I get bring me to some
big tatted stripper. Those
guys, like eight year olds,

757
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,450
you stick them in a cell
and you talked to him.

758
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:24,590
You try to undo it and show him an adult
that they're wired that way. That's it.

759
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,640
Just fucking sick. Is that put in,
put them to add. It's terrific.

760
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:32,810
It's why I don't believe in a
higher power that gives a fuck.

761
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,890
Well that's a whole different subject,
but I understand that.

762
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:40,880
But do you hear that pedophile joke about,
uh, he might have a total joke joke. No,

763
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:42,920
not at all.
It's a two guys sitting on a bench.

764
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:46,940
You see an 11 year old boy walked by, one
guy better. Paul says to the other one,

765
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,910
it goes, boy, he must have
been hot back in [inaudible].

766
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,360
He must've been subbed
the back in the day.

767
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,380
Oh, that's fucking twisted here. And
with that, a little more advertising.

768
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,260
Oh yeah.
But that's still,

769
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,370
I still like to stamp the Isaiah
Dotcom was tremendous for me. Bill I,

770
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,770
amazon.com. Oh, okay. I got think now
telling me about it. Oh Geez. Dom,

771
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:13,340

that. I was worried that you would say,

772
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,430
hey bill, don't tell me about that.
Cause I hear great things about Amazon.

773
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:17,923
I don't know enough.

774
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,530
Oh
this is the deal.

775
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,780
I'm not saying you have to buy something,

776
00:43:24,781 --> 00:43:27,860
but the next time you buy something on
amazon.com if you want to contribute to

777
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:28,694

podcast and on the right hand side,

779
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,090

you'll see the little banner for Amazon.

780
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:40,080
If you click on that, you know by whatever
you want to buy a pen and pencil set,

781

00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:53,670
so@amazon.com amazon.com actually does
is they kicked me a little bit of money

789
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,000
That's one of the great things
about ordering something
offline because a lot of

790
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,880
times you forgot, you ordered it and
you had a bad day and you come home.

791
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:11,070
There's like a little, it's like
a present. Let's nice. You know,

792
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,330
and you forget that your body.
No.

793
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,180
I heard great things about that
company and I've worked there.

794
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:16,410
I was talking to a friend of
mine from Cleveland, by the way,

795
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:19,720
I'm playing hilarides this week in
Cleveland. Oh, let's hype it. Wow. Yeah.

796
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,890
What days? Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday. Only

797
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,980
four days only. Dude, how great
is net cost? This is great. Yeah.

798
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,010
The nervous nervous
Nelly of on one of my fit

799
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,240
and can still knock out a 20 year
old at whatever. What does he like?

800
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:40,710
65 Oh, at least it's still still, I was
given a break there. He's still like, oh,

801
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,470
I didn't mean it. I mean he's
in curls and all of that. Yeah.

802
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:46,200
Last time I was there as
motorcycles to allegedly,

803
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,600
allegedly someone who looked like him,
a yank somebody out of a car and a,

804
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,810
yeah, tune them up a little bit. As
they say back east. Really? Yeah.

805
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,740
The guy kept blowing his horn,
you know, you know? Yeah.
Nixon that gets worked out.

806
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:00,660
Yeah. Nick's no joke. And
this thing about him too,

807
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:04,200
he's a truly as a tough
guy because he didn't tell,

808
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,660
he didn't tell me he did it.
Somebody else did.

809
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,210
You know somebody who doesn't fight.
So he, Oh, I grabbed this guy,

810
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,650
nick didn't say shit.

811
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,290
Somebody else told me the story
that was laughing my ass off.

812
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,830
And I went and said, hey, you know, I
heard some guy was beeping the horn at,

813
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:18,990
you know what happened?
Cause I wanted to hear the story for him.

814
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,100
And the way he told the story
was, oh that's right. No,
he told me the story first.

815
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,730
I said, hey, you know, how's
business going? And he tells
me the story like I ain't,

816
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,470
it's been cool. You know how he
kind of had a problem with this guy?

817
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:30,390
You know the guy, you
know, he kinda, you know,

818
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,660
I just had to kind of sort some stuff out
or whatever. Just the way he told him.

819
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,210
I said, there'll be great in a
movie like him, some real tough guy.

820
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:39,520
Tell him the story and then you smash
cut to like what's really going went down

821
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,460
and his head against the
quiet. No, like, yeah.

822
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:44,760
Like he seemed like he went
into one of those rages way.

823
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,460
You don't even remember what you did.
I wanted to work things out with them,

824
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:51,060
you know? Yeah. Greatest guy ever. And
I absolutely love that club. And uh,

825
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,940
I'm hoping, I'm trying to work on a
date there right now, but dom Irrera,

826
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:58,050
the legendary, the one and only the
guy with the swagger swagger swagger,

827
00:45:58,051 --> 00:46:00,630
who's who has table reads
with Renee Zellweger,

828
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,370
she calls him sweetie is a jealous
Robert Deniro, stairs bullets at you.

829
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,190
He was damn near broke character,
right. He starts laughing,

830
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,790
which I thought was great.
The one of the greatest American actors,

831
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,180
and I say to this guy who
wrote the script and go,

832
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,230
it was so fun for me to see Robert
Dinero getting the giggles and breaking

833
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:22,260
character. He goes, well, you know, he
doesn't really put everything into that.

834
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:26,550
And I said, Oh, you don't have to defend
Robert than hero to me. Well, you know,

835
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:30,000
I was in Puss in boots in
children's theater. He's,

836
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,910
he's doing raging bull and I'm
going to put some boots, you know,

837
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,320
it's great actor. I can't, it's just a
table read. It's like, you know, I like,

838
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:37,711
I liked it.

839
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,280
He said that to you as if you
didn't realize that that's
one of the great actors

840
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:43,680
of all time. Because I was going
to say, what does better than that?

841
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,860
Was it all smoke and mirrors? Anybody
can get lucky with the deer hunter,

842
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:50,660
taxi driver, raging bull,
Goodfellas. Anybody can get
loved because see, you know,

843
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,890
yeah. Uh, main streets. Uh, what was the,

844
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,600
let's go back and forth
to see me to ever moves.

845
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,360
We was the one that he played ruper
Pumpkin, the comedian a comedy. Great.

846
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:04,050
Wasn't it phenomenal? I can't believe
I don't own that. That's like a sin.

847
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,830
I know as a comedian that I, I
don't, uh, I don't know that.

848
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
Let me ask you, let me ask you
a favorite actor of all time.

849
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,990
Oh Geez.
Comedy or a drama trauma.

850
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,180
They don't let a lot of convenience to,

851
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,640
even though our lives are so critically
the like acting compared to movie stars.

852
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,060
Uh, let's make sure you have
the mic up. They'd dump. Oh,

853
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,350
you proposed shit. Sorry. I would say, um,

854
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,240
maybe Pachino Ah,

855
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,490
let me be Chino because of a dog day
afternoon. But the narrows right there.

856
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,250
I mean those two guys, you're not
cause there were Italian, you know,

857
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:44,970
I mean like ned Beatty is a great app.

858
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,670

the last 40 years. Yeah, I
mean, do you know, you know,

859
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,520
uh, I was joking with somebody
who does yours before we go,

860
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,620
I always talk about this
greatest imdv page. Flawless is,

861
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,850
is John [inaudible],
John [inaudible] I MVP for eight.

862
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:07,800
He has five movies. All were
nominated for Best Pitch Godfather.

863
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,670
Then he was in the conversation all
day, afternoons, Godfather to dog day,

864
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:16,620
afternoon, and then the deer hunter.
Wow. He doesn't have one. Uh, you know,

865
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:20,100
boat trip we had, doesn't
have one now. Dude. Money.

866
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,150
Like what went bad news bears part
three. Like what was it? That room,

867
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,790
those are rang Tang movies.
Clint Eastwood was the one,

868
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,430
he didn't show up in any of those things.
I fucked him.

869
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,240
That's a really sweet short resume,
Huh? Five those five movies.

870
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:39,450
I took a train with him just
by coincidence from really
from New York to Boston.

871
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,100
Him and his girlfriend were sitting
next to me and we talked the whole time.

872
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,330
Meryl Streep? No, I don't
think so. He's beside his
girlfriend. But towards the end,

873
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:47,700
yeah. I didn't know her.
I didn't know who was

874
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,670
sound good. He was, he was giving her
tips and I watched this thing. Uh,

875
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,160
uh, what, what's, what's
the famous phrase? I knew it
was you. You broke my heart.

876
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,430
Is that the other two?
I knew it was you in the boat.

877
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,590
So there's a documentary
that was on HBO called.

878
00:49:03,591 --> 00:49:07,340
I knew it was you and it was about John
Because Alan and like, and it dude,

879
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:12,100
it's just, it's Deniro, OPA,
Chino, Meryl Streep, all this just,

880
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,380
he was so great and dog day, afternoon,
the way he played that psychotic guy, the,

881
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:21,170
uh, we remember, he didn't
even know what Montana was,

882
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,850
thought it was a country or something.
Just that innocent stupidity psycho. Yeah.

883
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,670
Never been out of Brooklyn away,
right. The whole way that they did.

884
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:28,680
The whole thing is your favorite.

885
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:34,880
Oh, I have the hackiest I like,
I like going to Laurence Olivier.

886
00:49:34,881 --> 00:49:38,900
Those guys are great too, you know. All
right, well I'll, I'll, I'll give you the,

887
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:43,510
the, when I was young I was, I liked, uh,

888
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:48,260
leave me out of this. I
like, I, I was Lee Marvin,

889
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,110
Charles Bronson,
Charles Bronson.

890
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:54,550
I just watched one of his old movies
called the big house in 1955 years.

891
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,800
Small partner. And I'm telling
you as far as like physiques,

892
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,060
he's the original like fucking marketing.
He was dude,

893
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:06,920
he was fucking shredded before people
knew how to do p nine dx as he used to

894
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,960
work in mines and Poland.
Like back then,

895
00:50:08,961 --> 00:50:12,860
like what I love about the forties and
50s and even into the sixties like,

896
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,700
like being in shape just meant you
weren't fat. You know what I mean?

897
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:17,560
Like when those guys like

898
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,810
let's you were Hercules
or one of those guys,

899
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:24,010
but even some of them back in the
back way earlier that didn't have the

900
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:24,710
muscularity.

901
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,950
Yeah.

902
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,460
Like you watch like Ben Hur and they're
all just like Weissmuller all suck in

903
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:31,040
their guts in,
they always had like some sort of like,

904
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,510
it looked like have some sort of wrestling
championship belt that they would put

905
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:36,261
Lomas like a,

906
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:39,430
a cumber bun that they would always have
over their gut and they would just sort

907
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:44,190
of have their sort of, uh, sort of
packs. Right. You know what I mean?

908
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:47,570
It was just like they just
showed up with what they had.

909
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,050
Christopher Christopher Reeves, who was
the guy who played superman. Christopher,

910
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:56,580
he's now the other, the older superman
and television. He wasn't in show his, no.

911
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:58,910
Who is it? Shape it all? He Leonardo,

912
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,670
I played Batman wasn't in shape
that a white utility belt,

913
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:07,710
but his brother was Hercules' oh,
Steve Reeves and his name was Reeves too,

914
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:12,680
even though, but, and he, he was
really in shape. Excuse me. Bless you.

915
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,550
It is one of those guys that really look
like a look like Hercules and they both

916
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:21,390
thought they both did. Superman dry
died tragically then that weird.

917
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,540
I remember I used to do a bit on
Christopher Reeves and it was, it was,

918
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:27,180
it was after, you know, he got paralyzed,

919
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,020
which might seem insensitive
but I was tight. But it was no,

920
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,180
I was actually talking
about what a pussy I was.

921
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,840
People had like those horrific
fucking injuries like that.

922
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,840
And then they always go, I, you
know, I consider it a blessing.

923
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:43,330
I'm just going to every day I'm
alive and Blah Blah Blah and like,

924
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,850
and then they always go like,
well God,

925
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,570
pick them because he knew that
he could handle this challenge.

926
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,560
Might bit was don't have a fucking pick
me cause I'll be in that wheelchair.

927
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,850
Kill me fucking kill me.
Just being in the head and kill me.

928
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,890
And I was saying how I would steer the,
the fucking wheelchair.

929
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:07,060
I'd zone myself down the stairs.
There's no fucking way.

930
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,030
Okay.
I can handle.

931
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:14,050
The only thing I can handle is somebody's
Wa flipping me over it and fucking a

932
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,730
wipe my ass and I would just be going,
I would just have to be joking around.

933
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,810
I shouldn't be saying this.

934
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,220
There's a few things I'd never make fun
of us when I was younger. I never make,

935
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,790
I don't make fun of handicapped. I
don't like. I actually know some things.

936
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,620
I don't make fun.
I don't make them a special needs kids.

937
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:30,660
There's just shit I don't do.
Ooh,

938
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,010
I just make fun of like
adult retarded kids.

939
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,570
We started people rather I, once they
get to a certain age, you can make fun.

940
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,580
You want to hear one story that I tell
that that I only usually tell offstage.

941
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,060
I was at a, I was in a red sox
game fan way plaque, right?

942
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,350
And I'm sitting in the bleachers and
there was this family of like it was a

943
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,270
father with three sons.

944
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,950
Two of them were just regular people
and the other one was special needs,

945
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,130
but he was a monster.
He was like fucking six,

946
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:07,131
two and we were sitting out in center
field and we will almost behind the

947
00:53:07,411 --> 00:53:10,680
bullpen. And so, you know the
weird configurations of Fenway,

948
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,640
it's like our row went to a wall and
then the wall went up and then there was

949
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:18,950
like left field, right field. It's
sort of like Centerfield I guess. Yeah,

950
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,793
it center,
right.

951
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,650
And then there's the center field
bleachers where the garage doors.

952
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,950
So the Keto at the mental problems was
like up against the wall or whatever.

953
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,700
And he was,
I don't know what his deal was.

954
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,390
He was getting worked up and his dad was
telling him to calm down and he's like,

955
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,170
fuck yeah, he's like Carson. And
he was like retarded or whatever.

956
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,710
And then his dad find goes, come on, calm
down. I think when the crowd was like,

957
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,450
oh Nah,
he was getting like amped up.

958
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,110
And then the kid got to
fucking amped up dance.

959
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:47,430
They come on and sit down and he
was like, no, I'm not shutting down.

960
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:51,910
His Dad wound up and as hard as he
could slug this kid in the chest. Well,

961
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,990
but the dad was like 65 and this kid was
like 28 and he was a monster and he hit

962
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:01,250
him in the chest and the
kids, fuck you, dude.

963
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:04,470
I was one of those things. Look
your Daddy, no one wanted the lab,

964
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,780
but it was fucking dude. He was like
right out of it. Like, I don't know,

965
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,150
we don't have a fucking
like over the top comedy.

966
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,790
And then you will also terrify
because you're like, yeah,

967
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:18,420
get that dude settle down because
he's big enough to kill all of us. Ah,

968
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,011
what am I doing?

969
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:21,040
I'm talking about people with wheelchairs
is all the shit I don't talk. Yeah.

970
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,720
Well, I got a Charles Bronson story that
I was doing a roast for Mickey Rooney,

971
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:29,610
right. And I'm there with
Martin Landau, George Segal, me,

972
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,420
Charles Bronson.
This is the half of the day,

973
00:54:31,421 --> 00:54:33,960
if someone that is Christ
and Charles Bronson, I go,

974
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:37,720
I just turned to him and he was
very quiet, you know, and I said,

975
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,830
am I gotta tell you it's really
cool to meet you? And he goes,

976
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,060
we're not even like inflecting
any, make any emotion. He goes,

977
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,010
pitch been at Napkin and I go,
yeah, how fucking cool is that?

978
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,070
Branson, he's so rude. I love it. Right?

979
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,930
So I go up on stage and I'm like roast
and not only Mickey Rooney but like other

980
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:01,500
people and the day is, and I tell
the story about Bronson, I go,

981
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:03,690
how cool that he's like,
you know, this is Charles,

982
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,640
this guy is death wish guy and he's so
cold that he doesn't even accept a count.

983
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:12,120
Me just ask me for it and the Napkin
and then I come and I sit down and goes,

984
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,730
hey man, I'm sorry I can't hear
out of this year. I got shit.

985
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,233
I wanted you to be

986
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,060
mean. You know dude, I loved all those
guys. And I was wondering the other day,

987
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:23,770
like I was talking to somebody going like,

988
00:55:23,771 --> 00:55:26,920
why did it the stars back then the Lee
Marvin Sapp Bronson's and all them.

989
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:32,140
Why did they seem through, those guys were
like 130 140 pounds. But you just had,

990
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:34,480
they had that vibe. Like I was like,
I would never fuck with that guy.

991
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:37,480
And then you look at the stars today,
you look at Brad Pitt had, you know,

992
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:41,680
fuck him or whatever the guy is like
six, two, six, three shredded, right?

993
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,230
It's the highlights in his hair. I
don't know what it is, but fucking,

994
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,930
I finally was reading
something about Lee Marvin Lee.

995
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:50,670
Marvin was fought in world
war two and like his entire,

996
00:55:50,671 --> 00:55:54,370
he was like one of two people who survived
as entire platoon eat to got a purple

997
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:57,550
heart and all that. And it's like, no
wonder we seem like such a fucking bad ass

998
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:02,290
was remember him in the Wild
One? Marlon Brando, you should.

999
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,220
Well, I think the big red one
was Lee Marvin, the wild one.

1000
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:08,530
Was that the one with the motorcycle one?
I saw that.

1001
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,430
But you know what's the worst,

1002
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,050
the cringeworthy movement moment in that
movie is when they start singing those

1003
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,170
two actors and you can clearly see
that there. Actress playing tough guys,

1004
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:20,680
they start singing like some sort of
do up at the end of the bar and they're

1005
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:24,220
supposed to be shocking. The
bartender, dude. It's such a Douche

1006
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,480
chills moment where I remember
that that was in why one?

1007
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,770
As long as you've got the Harley
and they come into town. Yeah.

1008
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:35,490
The one where it goes, that's calm
ball style. Marlon Brando had that one.

1009
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,270
Do you know what the, you know when you
play the a, the Wilbur theater and uh,

1010
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,190
yeah, in Boston, that Green Room
Brando live there. Oh really? Yeah.

1011
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,920
I had heard that he was tell the story
like he, when he was a broke actor,

1012
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:51,070
he was doing the doing theater and that
was like some sort of dressing room.

1013
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:52,300
He was so broke. He actually stayed. Yeah.

1014
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,800
I'm a, I'm afraid of that place
when there's people in there,

1015
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,280
I can't imagine going to bed
because the place is haunted.

1016
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,530
Oh, you think it is. Do you believe
in ghosts? Oh yeah. Fuck yeah.

1017
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,890
I don't believe in them. Although
when I come down here, I, I kind of,

1018
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,270
I heard one time I heard one so clearly.

1019
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,730
Then here's a, I'm in my Bo.
No, a cough just kept coughing.

1020
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:19,650
It was, oh, don't, I don't get any sort
of laugh on that or the Gospel. Clearly

1021
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,210
he had broadcasters speech,
sorry.

1022
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:26,930
No, no. I hear, I'm in bed.
I had a studio apartment.

1023
00:57:26,931 --> 00:57:31,700
I just moved out from my wife
and I hear a cough. I go,

1024
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:35,510
Oh God, you know, guys, got a club. I
go, guys, you got a club? Who's in here?

1025
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:36,860
It's only a studio.

1026
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,400
So I go and I look and I walk through a
field of energy that my hair stood up in

1027
00:57:43,581 --> 00:57:48,380
the back. I got the chills, but
like a chilling feeling. And I go,

1028
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,110
Oh shit, this is, it
was during the day too.

1029
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,730
So I get down to the office and I tell

1030
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,150
now, when you walk through
that energy, the person like,

1031
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,980
like take over your body
and you started making like

1032
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,670
pottery. I started, uh,

1033
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,480
I started moonwalking around
the apartment. Uh, but anyway,

1034
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:10,730
I said to the department manager,
so this is weird. She goes, oh,

1035
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:14,060
that's the ghost with the smoking cough,
right?

1036
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,710
That there was a regular ghosts there.

1037
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:21,310
That is a stand.
So what the fuck is with that stupid show?

1038
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,210
Ghost hunters, they can't find a
ghost. So save that Goddamn life.

1039
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,860
That show is the funniest fucking show on

1040
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:27,120
you.

1041
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,290
Don't they find like an energy and then
they always know the name of the ghost

1042
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,124
and they're like,

1043
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,440
I'm here forever. I
don't understand. I uh,

1044
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,780
I don't know about that shit. I don't
know that. I don't believe in God.

1045
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:50,550
Um,
I believe that there's something beyond

1046
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,660
all the time

1047
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,830
since we have, there's, I believe
in all that stuff that's beyond us,

1048
00:58:55,831 --> 00:59:00,720
but we don't know what it is.
And religion is a guest and,

1049
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,620
uh,
it just doesn't,

1050
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,440
it just doesn't do it for me.
It just doesn't,

1051
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,050
that whole fucking ain't got
to have faith. It's like, no,

1052
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:13,980
you don't have the fucking answers.
To me, religion is science. Okay.

1053
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:18,330
Science gives me fucking answers. And if
they don't have answers, they go, well,

1054
00:59:18,331 --> 00:59:21,920
we got to work on it. And then they
gradually figure out more shit. But then,

1055
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:26,000
then there's the spiritual side where
you do something good, you feel good,

1056
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:30,020
you do something bad, you
feel bad. And uh, yeah.

1057
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:34,150
And like she like a psychopath. Yeah.
Um, I believe in that. And that's that,

1058
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,270
that feeling I feel is in everybody,
unless you're a psychopath.

1059
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:41,900
And I feel that religion exploit's
that and they turned it into this,

1060
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,490
they turn it into a science. They turned
it into this formula and this this too.

1061
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:45,751
Yeah.

1062
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:48,770
And then they turn it into this punishment
thing and then there's this fucking

1063
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:51,680
guy who's mad at me
cause I got a lap dance.

1064
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:55,820
And it's like when you really just start
reading about space and how fucking

1065
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:59,300
gigantic the Goddamn universities
is, the fact that, you know,

1066
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:01,560
you're staring at me, it's
like me looking at it, uh,

1067
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,500
a fucking an Amoeba and getting upset
about what the fuck is doing with other

1068
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:09,290
Amoebas.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

1069
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:14,590
The fact that God would need to be
praised and sung to would seem like he's

1070
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,800
insecure big time, but how
could it be God, you know?
But that's where I don't get,

1071
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:21,740
you know. Yeah. And it's like,
if I'm a fuck up, it's like,

1072
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:24,950
it's like you made me like, where is
your responsibility? That's like a fight.

1073
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:29,660
If I build a car and it doesn't
go and I get mad at the car. Yeah.

1074
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:32,990
You know what I mean? You fucking
this car, this car is evil.

1075
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:39,230
It needs to be thrown into a pit of fire.
I think I look,

1076
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,350
I think if you're a piece of shit you,
you,

1077
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,140
oh actually I'm a philosophy.
Another philosophy in this,

1078
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,520
if you're a piece of shit, you basically
get yours in life. You do. Unless you're,

1079
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:52,430
the brilliance of a
sociopath is you don't,

1080
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,420
calmer doesn't affect you, I don't
think. Unless you believe in it.

1081
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,800
If you don't believe in it,

1082
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:00,230
then you don't feel like you did
anything bad and you just don't attract

1083
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:04,070
anything bad to you. But if you
actually feel guilty, you bring it to,

1084
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:06,640
cause there's guys,
I'm not going to name guys because I've,

1085
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,800
I've seen guys in this
fucking business just do like,

1086
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:12,170
you know people who they
just such a piece of shit.

1087
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,460
It gets to the point where you're not
even Maddie Collins. It's like funny.

1088
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,720
I Dunno Bobby like that, but like
it's, it becomes like funny. You know,

1089
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,880
you don't get mad. They just
like what? Like, yeah, well
I don't want to name names.

1090
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,660
I remember there was a guy,
this dude, this dude I do,

1091
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,090
he borrowed somebody's workout
bench and he said, yeah,

1092
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,070
I'll give it back to you in a week.
And He,

1093
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,910
and he's the dude came back in a
week and he sold it. He sold it for,

1094
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,360
I forget what,
but like some drugs or something.

1095
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:49,160
And what I loved about it was just
that in the moment of it of like,

1096
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:53,160
yeah, eventually in six days this
guy is going to come back and I says,

1097
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:57,470
but for these next six days, I don't have
to deal with that guy in that moment.

1098
01:01:57,471 --> 01:02:01,760
I want drugs so fuck you.
So like that's that type of shit that,

1099
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:06,170
that's such a dirt bag move. But that,
that thing, like if he had done it to me,

1100
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:10,610
I would be mad. But the joy I would
get out of retelling the story,

1101
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,220
don't you fucking believe
this kind of were laughing.

1102
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,940
Like the joy that I would
get out of it. Like, yeah,

1103
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,550
I could only get like a can only
get so mad at him. Um, well,

1104
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:23,820
when you are speaking to that like,
cool. Yeah, we, I never named names.

1105
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,430
I try not to name names and like
the podcast or something like that,

1106
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:30,510
but I guess it's, there's always a,
there's always people that, you know,

1107
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,810
not that I'm coastline and on whoever the
hell you just said that. Cause I don't,

1108
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,680
I don't know the guy like that. I
Dunno. We're only an hour in done.

1109
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,840
How easy with this our flow. Seamless with
you, Bill. Seamless. Terrific. Listen,

1110
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,680
you know,

1111
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,310
one of the best comedians around may
say that without the risk of the best,

1112
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,290
it's turning into the Sami
Moylan show. Well, Tom,

1113
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:54,420
I learned from stealing from you. I
stole all my stuff from you. I just,

1114
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:56,390
I just turned it into the iron better man.

1115
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:02,520
Can I steal a bag? Can I steal a
bag? Now that it's getting tighter,

1116
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,520
let me just, just give me
another six months with it. Hey,

1117
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,840
you know what I learned today?
Uh,

1118
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:12,230
you cannot get a breakfast burrito on
Easter Sunday at any of these Mexican taco

1119
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:16,410
stands. Speaking of Jesus,
they are Mexicans are,

1120
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,720
are down with hey Seuss.

1121
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,750
I went to three different places
to get a breakfast burrito.

1122
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,430
And when I get a breakfast Burrito,

1123
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:27,870
I don't want it made by white people who
looked over some Mexican guy's shoulder.

1124
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:30,270
I want to, I want the real
fucking deal. Well, why don't you,

1125
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,580
why don't you go to two?
Don't you think it's time to give up?

1126
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,310
I thought it was a flu fact that he
went to three is kind of sad. No,

1127
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,260
I went to the first one. People think
of you as a celebrity. He's done.

1128
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:42,180
It's kind of sad seeing you driving
around Hollywood and a pres. Nope,

1129
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,140
no burritos.
It's Easter bread.

1130
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:48,300
It's Easter a man.

1131
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,330
And one of them just had a big
picture of Jesus in the window.

1132
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,410
I don't know if it's there every
time. Old Jay Star. Uh, hey dom,

1133
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:58,050
do you play video games?
I do, Bill. Oh yeah.

1134
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:03,000
Well what do you want to asteroids
PAC man. You old school like me,

1135
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:07,080
I love to asteroids.
He hit hyperspace Ms Pac man pac man.

1136
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:12,210
I got addicted to that so badly that I
would see it in my sleep or when I closed

1137
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:15,010
my eyes. Let's see like
the last one, you know,

1138
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,560
that's when you know you love video games.
I used to play uh,

1139
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,330
some sort of sniper game and I remember
one day I played it like eight hours a

1140
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:24,190
day and then I walked out on the street
and they had this thing like when you

1141
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,230
get somebody in the scope,

1142
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:29,400
like the scope would just fit
right over there that cross the X.

1143
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,770
And I was walking down the street and
I was just looking at people cross the

1144
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:34,420
street and I was seeing that x on
their head could blow them away.

1145
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,840
It was awesome.

1161
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:34,270
This is what, this is what
I would do if I, if, uh,

1162
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,910
if I had the time to get
back into video games,

1163
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:40,100
which I would love to do because I haven't
played them in five years or users.

1164
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:45,280
Oh Dude,
I played the grand theft auto three.

1165
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:48,430
It just took over my life and then I,
I loved it so much.

1166
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:52,780
I played it for another year after where
I would just use the cheats and I would

1167
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:57,040
go on a rampage and I would,
and I didn't like when the army showed up.

1168
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:59,770
I like those secret service cars that
they would show up and kind of look like

1169
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,960
the caprice classics.
But they will like hooked up.

1170

1171
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:10,270
they would start to shift to think of it.
Ah, what about this? A little obsessive.

1172
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:14,680
A little bit, a little bit, a little
bit of a little bit of obsessiveness.

1173
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,510
Wait a minute,
I ain't got to type this back.
