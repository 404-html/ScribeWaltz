1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,680
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:07,870
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,490
Just checking.
I'm just checking in on you.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,190
Seeing how you're doing. How are
you today? Huh? Are you upset?

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,760
Thursday afternoon, the Thursday
night football. What happened?

6
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:30,761
What happened during the song this time
that made people upset and decided that

7
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,610
they were going to get all up in arms
about their corner of the fucking world.

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,130
Unbelievable. I'm so fucking an hour.
I'm going to be the guy talking.

9
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:45,131
I'm so fucking listening to people making
that thing about what they want it to

10
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:49,070
be about. It's like, that's not
what the initial protest was about.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,730
If you would like to discuss
police brutality are more
than willing to listen to

12
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:55,340
what, I don't want to hear
your fucking Soliloquy.

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,000
You know all those people who are
like, you know, want to be the revenue.

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,480
Like I don't even care. I don't even
he, yeah, of course you don't care.

15
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:07,430
It doesn't fuck what they talking about
doesn't affect you. It's not about you.

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay. But gives a fuck. It's one

17
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,650
moment at the beginning of the game
commenting on something that people are

18
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:21,400
trying to fix. That's all. That's all

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,570
my biggest complaint about tonight's game
between the bears and the fucking pack

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,480
is they stop the game because there's
potential of lightning God for fucking

21
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:39,370
bed. Somebody gets
electrocuted. It's unbelievable.

22
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:44,371
It's unbelievable how important human
being still consider other human beings.

23
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,970
I just don't have it. It really
isn't about that. It's like full.

24
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,490
Do you think the NFL gives a
fuck about you? They don't.

25
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,140
They don't give a shit about you.

26
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:56,920
They don't want you to get electrocuted
because then you can't go out and buy

27
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:00,850
another jersey or another
ticket or NFL Sunday ticket.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,250
That's what they care about and some
are, they're going to get blamed, right,

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
because everybody in the crowd
is going to be like, well,

30
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:12,160
they should've known that
God was going to do that.

31
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,163
Okay.

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,420
You should have known what the weather was
going to be. You know? There's no more,

33
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,730
Hey, Fucko, you went outside,

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,400
you know what's outside lightning and you
went outside and God dammit lightening

35
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:30,280
found you and that's your own dumb luck.
Guess what?

36
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,390
You can have your own Wikipedia page now.
You don't have one now.

37
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,540
Nobody knows who the fuck you are,
but you get struck by lightening.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,280
Okay,

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,020
Jami is going to find you on Wikipedia.
Maybe you won't get your own page.

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,730
You might be on a page.

41
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:49,731
That's just the list of people struck by
lightning in 2017 or in or in whatever

42
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:54,600
the fuck we're calling this decade.
It has to be an extraordinary

43
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,590
circumstance to when you
get struck by lightening,

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,310
for you to get your own Wikipedia page,

45
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,220
you'd have to get struck by lightening
and then something else happens.

46
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,170
He struck by lightning.

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,640
You catch on fire and you run into
a paper machine factory. All right?

48
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,170
With a bunch of children there,

49
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,470
hose make a wish was that they could go
to or make our fucking paper machine a

50
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:15,941
factory.

51
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,750
Then you run in there and and then it all
goes up and all those little kids died.

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,470
Then now they need to have to share
it with the kids. It's a tough thing.

53
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,550
It's hard to get struck by lightning
and get your own Wikipedia page,

54
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,500
you know? You know what's funny
is if that actually happened,

55
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,150
you got struck by lightning. You had a
nice afro going, you catches on fire,

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,760
you run into a paper, Ms Shea
factory, there was a bunch of,

57
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,250
make a wish kids in there and
then they all fucking died.

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,300
The funniest fucking thing about all
of that is how much shit your relatives

59
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:50,890
would get. You know what I mean?
Saying Ah, you know that gag guy,

60
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:54,100
he's one of those Wilson
kids. Yeah. You know,

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,460
his fucking brother gets struck by
lightning instead of just die and laying

62
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,810
there burning the fucking asshole content.

63
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,090
He has runs into a paper machine factory
and kills a bunch of kids that were

64
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,230
already dying anyways.

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,013
You know,

66
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,570
then everybody treats them like shit.

67
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,010
Like you can keep your wits about
you when your head's on fire.

68
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,220
The bottom line is, is uh, I don't
know what happened to football.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,210
I don't ever remember it being
stopped because of weather used to be,

70
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,820
they play in all kinds of weather.
Right.

71
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,020
And you had the ice bowl
up there in green bay.

72
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,300
You had that game when all the locust to
send it down on the Kansas city chiefs

73
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:34,390
when they played the fucking uh,
New York titans.

74
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,940
I'm just making up shit at this point.
I don't know what happened to the game,

75
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:40,270
but now any time there's going
to be a little bit of crosswind,

76
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,540
what if it blows somebody's sunglasses
off and goes into somebody's eye?

77
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,030
I mean Jesus Christ, those, those
people that, that's what's constant.

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,940
The amount of layers of clothes and
blubber you have to go through after the

79
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:58,190
lightning strikes him to even like,
you know,

80
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:01,580
rattle a few fillings loose of the
average person in Wisconsin. These are,

81
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:05,030
these are, these are wholesome
people up there. Okay.

82
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,150
They get that ll bean catalog and
to those people that is formal,

83
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:14,780
where do you understand that? You know,
when you get married in Wisconsin,

84
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,800
you can actually show up, you
know, you know like everybody,

85
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,840
you're going to wear
tails with your Tuxedo.

86
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,290
They ask him if they're going to wear
those fucking, you know, his rubber pants.

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,490
It was fucking with the suspenders.
When you go trout fishing,

88
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,180
somebody was saying there was some
fucking guy, he walked out into the ocean.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,460
I don't know why the fuck he was in a
river, some sort of water, a watery area,

90
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:42,461
and he walked in there and this wave
came in and washed into his fucking pants

91
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,201
at telecom,

92
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:49,880
tipped him over and he couldn't get up
because the combination of the weight of

93
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:53,780
his ass and his legs, those rubber
pants and all the water in it,

94
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:58,700
it just fucking a heat drought.
I don't know if that's true.

95
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,150
That sounds like something a
fucking old lady with Tyson.

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,760
All this fucking old lady. When
I was a kid, you know back when,

97
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,200
you know parents didn't watch their kids
like parenting back in the day you woke

98
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,990
up, you gave him fucking, you
know the multicolored cereal.

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,010
He opened the door and they went outside
and they just met other kids and with

100
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,600
your kid brains, you figured out what
you were going to do that day. Well,

101
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:23,210
there was this old lady who lived around
the corner and she still always tell us

102
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:25,160
all these crazy fucking stories.

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,300
She had terrible candy to where you'd
still show up. I don't know why.

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,390
And she used to be a one time
now. I mean, she may know,

105
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,130
and Jamie and we gauge guy any,

106
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,050
he tried to stomp his foot down on the
brakes to stop so he wouldn't go to their

107
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,200
job shining. She said that his leg when
all the way up until his body and his,

108
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,030
and it was like six inches shorter
in front of the rest of his life.

109
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,540
He walked around and he couldn't get him.
You know,

110
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,770
I used to come home and I'd repeat the
stories to my mother. Right. I'd be like,

111
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:59,390
mom, he key it. Yeah. You know, one
tiny, I was a guy, his leg went,

112
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,170
been to his body and she, one day she
just finally, I think was listened to me.

113
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,560
She just looked at me. She goes, who
told you that? And I was like, oh,

114
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,530
the lady down this cheat. She goes,
don't listen to her. She's crazy.

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,920
I don't know why my mother talk like that.
I needed to do a different voice.

116
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,590
She doesn't smoke.
I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about.

117
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,900
But what would you expect from
someone who forgot it was Thursday.

118
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,620
That's how awesome my life is.
I forgot it was Thursday.

119
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,250
Now sometimes you can forget it's Thursday
because your life is fucking terrible,

120
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,460
right? Your roundup, right?

121
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,180
You're on a fucking bender or you're,
you're like,

122
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:38,420
I don't know what you're fucking,
um,

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,310
I dunno. You fucking,
you're a political prisoner.

124
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,250
You forget what date is your in Shawshank.
All right.

125
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,170
Sometimes you fight them off.
Sometimes you don't.

126
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,540
You're marking off the days he
got Rita Hayworth on the wall.

127
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,890
You don't know what fucking date is.

128
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,340
Not even if you're Andy do frain and
you're good with numbers, you lose track.

129
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,230
And the only other people
that lose track of that,

130
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:01,070
of people who work for themselves, which
I don't, I work for Netflix now, I guess.

131
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,460
I don't know. I just, you
know, after awhile you just
said, what fucking day is it?

132
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,920
I Dunno. Another day.
Living the dream day. Um,

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,660
anyways. Okay. Football, Sundays
coming up. What a bomb booty booty.

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,940
I'm going to start doing my
gambling pick of the week,

135
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,500
my gambling pick of the week.
All right.

136
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,850
I'm guaranteeing you that
if you gamble on this game,

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,530
money is going to change hands either
out of your pocket or into your pocket or

138
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,580
it might be a push.

139
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm guaranteeing that he called me up
at one 800 freckles, fat, fat, fat.

140
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,570
Um,
the giants getting three and Tampa Bay,

141
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,390
that giants, the O in three
giants. Everybody looking
at him like that, washed up,

142
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,420
forgetting that Eli Manning has won two
super bowls against the reigning super

143
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:56,800
bowl champions. They beat
bill Bellacheck two times. Um,

144
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,760
you guys got two rings, you know
he's got, he's got two rings,

145
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,940
he's got no respect and he's
got half an offensive line,

146
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:06,900
but I think this week to get
in three there under dogs,

147
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,280
they did fine. Fine against Philly
last week. That came back late.

148
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,590
But who gives a shit?
They still scored 20 something points.

149
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:18,510
I didn't really pay attention. Right?
And then they lost on a 61 fucking year,

150
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,523
right?

151
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,480
Some fucking dude from nine oh
two one o came walking in. Right.

152
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:32,140
They just fucking kicked the God damn
thing like the end of a Hollywood movie.

153
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,930
All right.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,730
Ain't going to happen. They're going to
go down to Tampa. Okay. First of all,

155
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,340
nobody respects the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
You know why?

156
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:46,341
Because they have a giant pirates of
the Caribbean ship inside their stadium.

157
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,330
I don't know what they're trying to do.

158
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:52,950
I don't understand how
the Oakland Raiders, okay.

159
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,990
Who have like a pirate on the side of
their helmet are able to achieve the

160
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:02,460
baddest, baddest fucking uniform in all
the sports. As far as I'm concerned.

161
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,910
They, when they moved to Vegas and
they have the white home jerseys,

162
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,740
they better go back to the silver numbers
or I'm or my name isn't Billy fat tits.

163
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,920
Alright.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers,

164
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,120
I don't understand is what is
a buccaneer. Exactly. Okay,

165
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,670
let's look this up because
judging by their colors,

166
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:25,440
I feel like it's more like the
musical theater sort of pirate.

167
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,210
It's much more,

168
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:31,500
let's just go out and have an adventure
rather than raping and pillaging.

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,660
What do we got here? All right, and
then fucking Buccaneers loss last week,

171
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:40,470
34 to 17 so they're coming off a big loss.
That's always a concern.

172
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:45,400
What the fuck is a buccaneer? Buccaneer.
All right. Buccaneers were a kind.

173
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,553
Okay.

174
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:54,120
A privater or pirate. What's
a privater? Private tier.

175
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,720
Okay.

176
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,580
A private tier was a private person.
Also, they keep to themselves. Well,

177
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,290
that's not really good
in a team sport is it?

178
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,610
Or a ship that engaged in
maritime warfare. Okay.

179
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:08,350
Under a commission of war.

180
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah.

181
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,280
All right. Well, they did it
very officially. All right.

182
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,520
Okay.

183
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,850
Particularly to the Caribbean Sea. Yeah.
Pirates of the Caribbean. That's right.

184
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,930
Originally the name applied to the
landless hunters of wild boars and cattle,

185
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,520
and they largely uninhabited areas of Tor,

186
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,860
Toga and Hispaniola.
The mic caught.

187
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:35,460
They smoked over a slow fire. Where
the fire, what are we talking about?

188
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,910
Something about jerk me or Jerky.

189
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,020
Why should we fear these people?
Do you know what?

190
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:48,680
This is just a whole bunch of reading
that I don't want to do it when caught by

191
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:51,700
anti pirate English authorities. Seventh
all right. You know what I need to do?

192
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,410
What's the dose screen? A pirate in a
buccaneer. Oh, what's the difference?

193
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,730
What's the difference
between a or and O'quinn read

194
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,900
in a buccaneer I would say
about 30 pounds, judge.

195
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:13,790
I've been, well, I've never
been to the Tampa stadium.

196
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,450
Might be there in a few weeks. So, okay.

197
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,840
Buccaneer verse rate or
what's The difference?

198
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,280
This is why you got to love the Internet.

199
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,610
I'm not saying they have a right answer,
but they always have an answer.

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,140
What's the difference?

201
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,170
A buccaneer is a synonym
of radar as nouns.

202
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:37,661
The difference between a buccaneer in a
raider is that buccaneer is an UN is not

203
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,120
a goal.
Any of a group of semen.

204
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,800
TJ's no.

205
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,830
See men who cruised on their own account
on the Spanish main and in the Pacific

206
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,990
in the 17th century,
similar to pirates,

207
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:55,991
but did not pray on ships of their own
nation while a raid is one who gauges,

208
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:02,570
engages in a raid, colon,
semicolon, a plunderer.

209
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,120
Okay,

210
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,290
well what the fuck is a raid and
what is a plunderer? See this,

211
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,820
this is what you do.
You have fucking,

212
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,600
okay.

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,470
Plunderer.

214
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,080
Okay.

215
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,640
The plunderer is a fictional character,
so they, they don't even exist.

216
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,970
I don't want this fucking,

217
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:23,960
yeah,

218
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,240
that was actually a superhero.
Dare Devil fought the plover.

219
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,720
Okay.

220
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,300
Plunderer come on man. Come
on. Give me something. Give
me something. Hey, your cons.

221
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,370
Plunder.
Wikipedia is just such a one trick pony.

222
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:40,830
Sometimes they just keep guiding
you back to the same fucking

223
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,033
okay.

224
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,790
To plunder the public treasury to take
wrongfully as pillage. Yeah. Okay.

225
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,880
All right. You know what? I don't even
give a shit anymore. How about that?

226
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:55,881
All I know is whoever fucking drew the
Raiders logo did not draw the Buccaneers

227
00:13:56,371 --> 00:14:00,930
logo. That first one at least
and less. He was a rate of fence.

228
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,900
It was like these for these fucking
guys saying that kind of like us.

229
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,000
We already took this name.
Let me see. Tampa Bay

230
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,180
fucking ears speed.
Like a porno logo.

231
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,510
What do we got here? That's sort
of a pirate. Oh, the day, you know,

232
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,110
they kind of ripped off.
They're trying to rip off the old fucking

233
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,640
oh find to rip off the Raiders here.
Well, let's see. They're fucking original.

234
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:32,310
Their original logo was just like,
I think it was Tom Selleck.

235
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,950
I don't know what it was. Nah, man,

236
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,810
I'm really Tom Selleck
sort of winking at you.

237
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,290
Okay.

238
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,060
Tiniest of knives in his fucking mouth.
There's the one I remember right there.

239
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,890
The creamsicle.

240
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,750
Okay.

241
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,580
Yeah, I don't what that was. He
looked like a three musketeer.

242
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,560
You look like a good guy.
I think that that was the problem.

243
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,380
Was there a point to any of that? I
don't think there was. Um, anyways,

244
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:58,950
this is one of the,

245
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,410
this is one of the greatest times of the
year in United States sports and who's

246
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,170
kitty? Our sports are the
best. If you don't believe it,

247
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,720
if you don't believe our athletes
are the best, I'm telling you,

248
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,630
you need to watch the Olympics.
Okay.

249
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,470
All of our white athletes
dominating all of those games.

250
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,140
Well, maybe we do. We do well in the
Winter Olympics though, we now we don't,

251
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:25,820
we lose to the fucking Canadians.
We beat the Canadians in like the juniors.

252
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,630
We always beat them because anybody like
our age is already made it up to the

253
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:33,260
fucking Nhl, you know? But you got
to give those Canadian something

254
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,840
hockey. They got [inaudible]
you got to let him have hockey.

255
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,630
Even though the Russians are kind
of slowly taken away from them.

256
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,460
A lot of European players,

257
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
the game is slowly being taken away from
their sticky served fingers up there.

258
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,650
Okay. We all understand this. All right.

259
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,280
And they're going to hang on for
dear fucking life. Cause if Canada,

260
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,210
God forbid ever was to lose hockey,
what would they be left with?

261
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,390
[inaudible]
what would they be left with

262
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,450
that shuffleboard on ice that they play?
What do they call it?

263
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,950
What do they call that? Uh, what
the fuck is it? And you slide.

264
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,000
He just let that fucker go right.
That big

265
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,630
sort of a wheel, isn't it? It's a rim.

266
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,940
Kind of looks like a rim off of a jeep
that they turned into a giant hockey puck.

267
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,960
That's what it says. An obese hockey
puck. What the fuck do you call it? Curly.

268
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,560
I don't know why they call it curly.
There's no hooking.

269
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:39,170
There's nothing like that, you
know, fucking, I have no idea. Um,

270
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,730
anyways,
so you have playoff baseball's coming up.

271
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,220
Who is going to start hockey's going to
start college and pro football's going.

272
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,480
The CFL is getting close to the Grey Cup.
All right.

273
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,020
I mean just what else could you want?
Okay.

274
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,920
The Formula One in Moto GP are going to
be wrapping up here in the next 40 days.

275
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,540
Mrs. Exciting fucking times. Let's check
out the baseball standing. Shall We?

276
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,490
Everybody. Who Do, we got here,

277
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,800
those Boston red sox
hanging on for dear life,

278
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,090
three games ahead of the New York,
the New York Yankees.

279
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,110
Um,
Tampa Bay devil rays,

280
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,720
soon to be Montreal Expos.

281
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,740
Spoiler alert. Um, I've been
telling you guys that story.

282
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,170
I must have told this story at the time.

283
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,630
I went to the Montreal
Expos game by myself.

284
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,890
I was doing this Gig in upstate
New York and um, you know,

285
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:41,180
I was trying to go to all the fucking
stadiums. So I was like, all right, well,

286
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,890
you know, let's see
this Montreal, the end,

287
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,830
they got a fucking game and the game the
next day. So I went up, I did this Gig,

288
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,830
I think I did the Lake Ontario playhouse.
I know I've told this story before,

289
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,370
but what maybe I've got a few listeners
maybe from something from checking. Yeah.

290
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,350
Is Listening. Maybe
somebody from Romania. Um,

291
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,110
anyways,
so there was a game the next day,

292
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:05,970
so I ended up trying to cross the border
into Canada. Uh, this is pre nine 11,

293
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:08,880
by the way,
in a very weird spot by myself.

294
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,140
So I get stopped at the border and the
guy tells you, guy asked me, he was like,

295
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,440
oh, it's well, what are you doing there
fella? He's Canadian dude. And I said,

296
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm going to an expo game now. The Expos
had lost probably about, I don't know,

297
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:25,490
like 120 games at that
point during the season.

298
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,310
And he goes off, you're making some
friends up there. And I was like,

299
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,400
nope. Going by myself. And he was like,

300
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,990
Oh hey Paul, would you mind pulling
over right there for a second?

301
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,710
So he asked me, pull over and like two
more of these fucking guys come out

302
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,420
and they start ripping apart my car and
they send me inside and I'm like, what?

303
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:51,080
The Pfizer is some sort of random
drug search and I'm just sitting there

304
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,600
watching them and they're ripping
it apart and ripping her apart.

305
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:57,670
And then it suddenly fucking dawns on me
like,

306
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,680
what kind of a fucking loser? I
mean, I was like two hours away.

307
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:05,310
It was a drive two hours out of my way
to go up there to go to Montreal Expos,

308
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,330
game by myself.

309
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,710
This guy could not fathom
that any human being,

310
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,210
even one that looked like me would have
that much of a pathetic moment in their

311
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:19,590
life. He was convinced I was some
sort of drug mule or whatever,

312
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,500
I guess drug meals.
It was that when you have it up your ass,

313
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,030
but they never checked my ass.
They just check the fucking car.

314
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,900
So it suddenly dawned on me that they
thought there was no way that I was that

315
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:36,290
pathetic, but I knew the real
answer was yes. I was apathetic.

316
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,280
So it just struck me as funny and I
started laughing and I couldn't stop.

317
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:44,480
And I remember the cop looking over at
me and he saw me laughing and I think he

318
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:46,550
thought I was laughing,
like he couldn't find the drug,

319
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,010
so they were out there for
like a fucking half hour. Okay.

320
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,560
And then once I knew that
they thought I had drugs,

321
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:55,320
then I was just kind of acting like a
dick and I had a shitty and grin on my

322
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:59,970
face as I came walking up smiling. Okay.
And they will, the guy was getting mad,

323
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:04,040
like I was smiling,
like he didn't find it or whatever.

324
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,240
And uh,

325
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,750
then I went up there and went up there
and this fucking French con acted like he

326
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:11,960
didn't understand what I said when I
asked him to take my picture because I

327
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,080
didn't have anybody to take my picture
because I was by myself and one of those

328
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:18,410
disposable cameras and it just that the
story just keeps getting worse and worse.

329
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,960
Um, when I called him a conti
laughed and walked away. Um,

330
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,270
so anyways, I was sitting out
in like fucking left field

331
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,530
and uh,

332
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,700
it was such an old stadium. I
don't know, just under budget.

333
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,320
I think it's socialism up there,
you know,

334
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:38,890
and they just don't step on the
poor the way we do up here. Um,

335
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,970
out in the outfield. Your seat only had
one arm rest. That's what I remember.

336
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,130
Even on the left or on the right,
I can't remember what,

337
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,460
and I was sitting out there and all the
fans not paying attention to the game,

338
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:52,300
the fans had showed up and they would
just sing in Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole,

339
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,120
that soccer fucking song. And
I was watching, I swear to God,

340
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,590
I saw this guy and I'm like,

341
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,770
I watched this guy steal home plate
and I'm way out in left field.

342
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,770
So I jumped up. I was like, yeah,

343
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,690
when he stole home plate
and nobody else jumped up,

344
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:09,550
Whitney and it was really quiet in
the stadium. So then I was like,

345
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,560
oh fuck. Maybe that was
something else. Maybe, I don't
know. Maybe it's a pass ball.

346
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,380
Maybe a, it was a Bach.
I didn't know what.

347
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,980
So I fucking sat back down and felt
stupid cause everyone was looking at me.

348
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,200
And then later on that night,

349
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:27,190
I was back at the fucking
hotel and I was watching TSN.

350
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,260
That's their ESPN up there. And
they're like, they're like, oh,

351
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,730
it's something you don't see every day.

352
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:35,660
And they showed a guy stealing home
plate and I was like, fuck it. You know,

353
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,720
that's my expo story. Matt.
Riveting, but not boring. All right.

354
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:45,040
Then he got the Cleveland
Indians crushing it, crushing it,

355
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,260
one 22 winters of 22 in a row. Um, I
feel like they've won like maybe what,

356
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:54,750
like, like 25 of they last 30, not 27. Um,

357
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,440
they're in. And who else?
The Houston Astros. Ah,

358
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:02,110
wow. Well, look who's finally
in the American league.

359
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:05,050
Finally put on your big boy pants
and he gets stopped playing.

360
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:09,280
Hit and run and get yourself nice and Roy
it up and try to hit it over the fence.

361
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,680
Uh, uh, the Washington
senators in first place,

362
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:19,681
I didn't fucking know that the
cubs look into repeat the Dodgers.

363
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,730
I went to the dodger game last night.
They went fucking tend to nothing. Uh,

364
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,070
had a great time.
We sat right down on the field,

365
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,130
like terrifyingly close,

366
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,770
like I tried to make sure I watched
every damn pitch and uh, you know,

367
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm not boozing.
So you know,

368
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,320
that's also scary if you booze
and you know, you're all relaxed,

369
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,990
so your heads like fucking foam
rubber, you know what I mean? It's,

370
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:48,310
you just bounces off at one app and
whether, you know, you don't know,

371
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,940
you order another fucking
round. Right. But, um,

372
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,840
I've stone sober sitting
there, so actually realize
what the fuck it happened.

373
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:00,070
So I was staying right on it.
What a great stadium that is.

374
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,790
Just a great stadium, great fans
out there. You know what I mean?

375
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,190
As long as you don't wear a different
colored Jersey and you don't sit on the

376
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:09,970
bleachers, you know what I mean? As
long as you're not with your kids. Um,

377
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,210
it's a great stadium. It's a great, so
long as you rooting for the Dodgers.

378
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:16,120
It's a wonderful time. And I went
there. I had a pretty good time.

379
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,260
I had a great time, I should say. I
meant to say I ate pretty good eight.

380
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,680
Pretty good. I got a little off my diet
diet when I was in fucking Toronto.

381
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,930
So I think my calf is healed up.

382
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,490
We're going to try to hit the elliptical
tomorrow. Hey, guess what? Old freckles,

383
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,550
freckles. His plane. Um,

384
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,170
the Monte Carlo tomorrow in Las Vegas.
Uh,

385
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,461
it's going to be great.

386
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,130
Bunch of people from F is for family
are coming out or a bunch of writers are

387
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,620
going to be at the show. So I'm
hoping I'm going to have a good one.

388
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:49,270
I'm very excited to play that
one. That's the one from um, uh,

389
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,470
not river Phoenix.
What was the name of that fucking movie?

390
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,920
Ocean's 13 or 1215?

391
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,310
Whatever the fuck it was called where
everybody's still all those good looking

392
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,320
fellow. He stood out there,
right? Looking at the, uh,

393
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,740
the uh, what was it though? The
fonts, the font shooting off.

394
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,350
You guys saw them over? Yeah, that's
stick to casino. I'm playing that one.

395
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:10,400
I've always wanted to play that one.
And we said it was the cleanest in class.

396
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:12,870
He's looking one, at least from the
outside you walk in and the things,

397
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:16,210
they all look the same. But anyway,
so let's, let's get onto the um,

398
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,690

00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:22,290
Everybody.
Ya know when you run your own business,

460
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,760
you know that time equals money.
It's not just an old saying,

461
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:29,260
it's a fucking fact.

462
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,950
So why waste your valuable time dealing
with issues that legal zoom can help you

463
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:37,010
with?
Huh?

464
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,520
You may already know that over 2 million
people have used legal zoom to start

465
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:46,840
their businesses,
but legal zoom services do not end.

466
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:50,470
They're running a business
comes with taxes, contracts,

467
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,270
hiring employees, changing the filter
and the air conditioning system.

468
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,910
Basically a lot of fine print.

469
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,210
That's why legal zoom built a network
of independent attorneys licensed in all

470
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,690
50 states.

471
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:09,430
They can provide the advice you need to
get through the daily grind of running

472
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:10,264
your business.

473
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,950

hours since legal zoom is not a law

474
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:15,784

All right, there you go. There you go. Um,

481
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,160
somebody asked me do a bent benefit today

482
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,260
way

483
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,350
they'll Rico, those poor bastards are
still without power door. You know,

484
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,900
after you have to getting hit by that
hurricane and everybody's over here

485
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:55,370
talking about somebody taking a knee.

486
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,910
I actually think taking a knee is more
respectful than standing up, isn't it?

487
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,020
Christ the guys on his fucking knees.
Um,

488
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,610
so hopefully I'll be able to do that.

489
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,910
Hopefully people stops focusing on the
song and start focusing more on the

490
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:15,790
heroin epidemic,
right arm on my soap box.

491
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,050
The fact that we're feeding cows to
other cows and cutting the beaks off of

492
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,860
birds that I walked around doing face
plants because their breasts are too

493
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:24,760
fucking big.

494
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,893
You know,

495
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,740
he can't even give them a big to
fucking land on. That's like dent.

496
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:35,100
Mack said gets smart episode where they
put them in the Gurney and they strapped

497
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:39,540
him in and then there was only one of
those fucking rotary doors and they stood

498
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,590
him up.
You ever seen that one?

499
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,670
They push them through and
he does the fucking face
plant. Oh, that bit killed me.

500
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,230
I loved it back in the day.
Can you tell them a huge me TV fan?

501
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,660
I've been taping the twilight zones over
there and not only is the twilight some

502
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:57,600
great. What's awesome about it
is afterwards I then get to do,

503
00:30:57,601 --> 00:31:02,601
my favorite thing is Google to see
how much of the cast is dead and I was

504
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,241
surprised.

505
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:08,241
I watched the one that was the bewitched
pool and the both of the little kids is

506
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:12,660
still alive. They're in their
sixties the mother is still alive,

507
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,170
still alive and kicking like 89 years old.
However,

508
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:21,171
the dad fucking dropped like less than
10 years later in the early seventies had

509
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:25,050
a heart attack. You know what I mean?
That was a big thing back in the day,

510
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:30,051
guys died of heart attacks in women
died of accidental overdose overdoses.

511
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,480
You know, cause anytime they
got air quote hysterical,

512
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:36,840
they would give them black beauties
and only case a Holly itself, you know,

513
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,530
they'd get slapped around and the
doctor's office and then, you know,

514
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,940
to make sure the swelling went down,

515
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,940
they would give him these relax of fires
for their cheeks in their, in their,

516
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:47,430
in the rest of their body. Something
like that. And I forget how it goes,

517
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,563
but that's what I do.

518
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,100
Like I watch Hawaii five o just about
every night and the other night they had

519
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:58,870
this episode called to hell with
Babe Ruth. And that was a big rumor,

520
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,960
right? That back in the day, back
in the day when that was young,

521
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,690
I'm not acute anymore. They used to, um,

522
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,650
hello,

523
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,070
but come on in,
turn the KNOB.

524
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,540
Oh, I thought you were coming
in. So back in the day,

525
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,260
uh Oh, it's still lovely. Nia.

526
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,130
I can't,

527
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,030
I can't stay though. Well, get out.

528
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,260
Why'd you come in there?
Oh yeah.

529
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:39,740

know, Middle Eastern food,

531
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,160

thing. Lamin right. All right.

532
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,770
Well and I already ate for the evening.

533
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,310
I and another two bullies salad with
chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,760
It's fascinating. So I'm
gonna go order dinner. Hi.

535
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,960
I haven't seen you in so long. We were
supposed to have a date night tonight.

536
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,700
Yeah. And you blew me off. Not that blew
me off. I didn't blow you off. I just

537
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,850
papa, Papa. All right. To
hell with Babe Ruth. Okay.

538
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:17,440
This is alleged allegedly,

539
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,410
is it over officially done?

540
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,000
Yes. You're being dismissed. You
know what, Nia, you're fired.

541
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,690
No Am I am at the end of the podcast
here and I was telling them about that to

542
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:28,710
hell with Babe Ruth thing.

543
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,010
Remember the Hawaii five o I was showing
you when they had the white guy playing

544
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,730
the Japanese guy? Yes. But then
the lady, he was with boost.

545
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,840
I don't know if she was Japanese,
but she was definitely Asian. Yes.

546
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,480
And so she's got to sit there and look
at him with this fucking white guy,

547
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,960
stupid thing. And then they put
this awful makeup around his eyes.

548
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,370
This is 50 years ago.

549
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,023
Yep.

550
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,040
There you go. I don't want to say
about it. I'm just bringing it up.

551
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,410
That was terrible. Well, it's true. If
it was half a century ago, and he said,

552
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,010
come on the podcast again.
Okay. No. [inaudible] dokie.

553
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,440
So anyways,
um,

554
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,323
okay.

555
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,860
Allegedly during the World War II,

556
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:12,530
when the Japanese soldiers
would do a bunch I charge,

557
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,540
which just was fucking as suicidal
charge I guess, or whatever.

558
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,540
Like Japan was not fucking around.
There was no quitting.

559
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,940
Okay. There was no, everybody
gets a ribbon. All right?

560
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,140
They would just,
if you fucking did,

561
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:34,010
there was no surrendering to your
fucking enemy. So during those Buns,

562
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:36,830
I charges allegedly,
I don't know if this is propaganda,

563
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,210
they would yell either to hell with
Babe Ruth or fuck babe Ruth is what they

564
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,890
would yell.
Right.

565
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,050
So Babe Ruth got wind of it and
there's a quote in the New York Times,

566
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,950
I got to get this right. I don't
want to misquote the sultan of Swat.

567
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,560
The only man who ever had a ballpark
built around it is fucking abilities. Um,

568
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,630
let me see if I can find this. Uh, you
can't. I can't find it. He basically said,

569
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,980
he goes, any JAP that says that
I hope they, I hope he get shot.

570
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,640
He goes,
and while we're at it,

571
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:14,270
it goes to hell with all the jabs that
was written in the New York Times.

572
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,403
You know,

573
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,470
you could never do that in 1969 by the
time that episode of Hawaii five o came

574
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:22,651
out,

575
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:27,090
but what you could do was have a white
guy with the worst makeup ever around.

576
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm going to fucking,
I'm going to post the picture.

577
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,470
I got to post a picture I, which I, I
don't know if I'm going to do it either.

578
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:38,220
I just want to make sure. Oh, I just
got a picture of John Daly in a fucking,

579
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,450
in his sweatpants

580
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,953
fucking

581
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,590
making a chocolate shake from self in
a glass that had the Arkansas razorback

582
00:35:47,591 --> 00:35:51,220
thing on it. Is there anything
about John Daly? That is an awesome

583
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,830
anything.
Um,

584
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,620
so anyways,
I was watching this episode and this guy,

585
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:03,390
I'm watching the whole time going, that
guy is not Japanese. What the fuck?

586
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,110
I was looking, there's something
wrong with his eyes or whatever.

587
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:08,200
And I finally looked up the actor.
I don't know what he was,

588
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,420
he was first generation something
or other, but it was not cheap.

589
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,630
You should just see the seats face his
whole face, his fucking white features.

590
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,200
Then he had his, like, he was
sort of squinting his eyes.

591
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,180
All I was just was horrific. Felt
bad for the lady across from, I

592
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,810
can't imagine what she said when
she came home and just playing.

593
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:25,090
He gave the didn't even look good.

594
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:32,100
So anyways, I guess what I'm saying, it's,

595
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,840
it's about time we make a
World War Two movie, you know,

596
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,500
we actually have Japanese
people play Japanese soldiers.
Can we at least do that?

597
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,550
Hasn't been done. I don't
know. I watch sports, okay?

598
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,060
And there is no fact checking
whatsoever when it comes to a,

599
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,510
when it comes to this podcast,
guys,

600
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:56,280
I audit the greatest fucking motherfucking
cock sucking fucking whiskey glass

601
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,430
you will ever own in your fucking life
and it's so awesome that I know when you

602
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,800
see it, you're going
to want it. All right?

603
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,960
This guy's got a small operation,

604
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:10,680
so I'm not going to tell you who it is
until I ordered some more and get my

605
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:15,681
order in and then I'm going
to let you know on Monday,

606
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,840
Monday, Monday. I can't be that much
of a cunt. This is a great gift.

607
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:22,340
If you have a fucking person who loves,
hang on a second,

608
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,980
loves to drink with me,

609
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,330
and the holidays are coming up. Please
tell me he says the guy's name on it.

610
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,530
Hang on a second. God dammit. I
got to give you the name. Ethan,

611
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,030
the greatest fucking whiskey glasses ever.

612
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,470
This guy, he a and is this,
does this sound right? This
sounds kind of perverted.

613
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:50,140
He blows his own glass.

614
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,910
It was a bad time to pause and that
how he blows his own three, two,

615
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:59,350
one glass. Um, Nate Cotterman, n a t.

616
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,600
E C o. T. T. E r m.

617
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:06,250
A N Nate Cotterman Dotcom,
um,

618
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,240
can make you all kinds of things.
I actually fucked up my order.

619
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:14,860
I called the number up and he, the
guy just picked up, he's like, hello?

620
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:18,520
I'm like, ah, yes. Night there. He's,
I guess. And I, I'm like, yeah, dude.

621
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:21,820
I ordered the Riaa put an order for
eight glasses. I ordered the wrong ones.

622
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,690
I wanted the ones with the square cube.
And he goes, Hey, I saw that. All right,

623
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:28,360
I'll take care of that.
How'd you hear about us?

624
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:31,030
I was just looking at Wiki
whiskey glasses. This is
what the guy does. All right,

625
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,490
for all you guys out there and you
drink the top shelf boots. All right.

626
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,380
You're a self made man or you were
born into it. Give a fuck. Right?

627
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,190
You got you a woman in line.
No. Um, and you've got to,

628
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,590
you got to top shelf,
bottle of booze and you respect the booze.

629
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:52,270
He respect the artists,

630
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,860
artists who fucking whatever the fuck
did whatever he did to make it as smooth

631
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,130
and is and is and his tasty God.

632
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:04,070
This is going to make me go right off
the wagon and it's tasty as it is in and

633
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,380
you, but you want it cold, you know?

634
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,240
So there's all these different things.

635
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:14,620
There's these giant ice cubes you can
put in there, these big square ones,

636
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,540
but eventually towards the end,
you know the,

637
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,590
the water's going to start
leaking into the booze.

638
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:23,560
You get me talking tap water
here. Okay? Like beavers,

639
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,740
shit in this stuff it is is mixing
in with your God Damn Booze.

640
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:27,640
You can't have that.

641
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,150
Okay.

642
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,340
The, the aroma of duck feet is, is,

643
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:35,600
is coming in Dt or pristine
firewater here. Right?

644
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,220
So then they also have, they
got these metal cubes or
whatever, but then you know,

645
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:42,200
no matter what,
there's going to be some sort of metallic,

646
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:45,140
maybe Blahblahblahblahblah.
This guy Nate,

647
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,630
all hail Nate,

648
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,180
he makes a whiskey glass
and then he makes a,

649
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,500
a square glass fucking ice cube
and marries that to the glow.

650
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,770
It becomes part of the glass.
Then you take the whole fucking glass,

651
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,210
you stick it in the fridge, the freezer
or whatever, and then everything's called.

652
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:09,320
Okay. And then you pour it in there.
Okay. The Bose has nowhere to hide.

653
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,070
It's surrounded on all
sides by nice chilled,

654
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,210
frigid glass.
But none of it leaks into the boots.

655
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,720
So you can drink it neat
and have it ice cold.

656
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,630
You can have your fucking cake
and eat it with these glasses.

657
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,040
I cannot say enough about them.

658
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,360
I absolutely love these fucking glasses
and I haven't even used them yet.

659
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:32,210
They got a little way to them too. So if
you, if your limp wristed and you know,

660
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:34,820
if you're, you know, I
don't know if you, you know,

661
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,150
back in the day you got an old
roller blading injury and you're,

662
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,180
you're broke both your wrists.
These might not be for you. Okay.

663
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,420
But I fucking love these glasses that
Janet and the coolest Shit, Nick Carter,

664
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:49,580
man with a c. All right.
That's it. Enjoy the music.

665
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,021
And,
uh,

666
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:54,500
we've got another half hour shit coming
up from a Thursday afternoon just before

667
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:58,600
Monday morning podcasts and
a Thursday gone by, you know,

668
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,850
possibly earlier share. Maybe it was from
a three years ago. I don't fucking know.

669
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,750
I don't pick them. All
right. Have a great weekend.

670
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,140
I'll see you in Vegas
and uh, that's it, right?

671
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,273
Yeah.

672
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,163
Yay.

673
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,473
Oh,

674
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,723
this way.

675
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,860
Well, you know what, I didn't
even get to the fucking,

676
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:03,360
you see that reporter that died?

677
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,370
Let me get to where the
hell is that story here.

678
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,780
This writer for rolling stone,
which I have a subscription to.

679
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,160
Okay.

680
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,030
One of the magazines, few magazines
that I actually read every episode,

681
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,920
every installment. Um, Michael Hastings,

682
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,700
uh,
he had a horrible death.

683
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,480
He fucking was going down,
I believe it was Highland,

684
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:35,130
just south of Melrose is Mercedes
was traveling at ridiculous speeds.

685
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,330
He hit a fucking tree and
the whole thing exploded,

686
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:43,710
burst into flames and they had to
identify him by his dental records and uh,

687
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,110
allegedly this guy knew,

688
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,820
okay.

689
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,480
I guess he wrote some fucking article
in rolling stone where he was over in

690
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:54,860
Afghanistan talking to some higher ups
in the military and they were saying some

691
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:59,180
shit that they thought was off the record
and he put it all in the article and

692
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:04,210
there's people conspiracy there is
trying to say that his car was cyber

693
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:08,570
attacked.
Now I'm not even going to get into that,

694
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,880
but dude,

695
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,700
how fucked up is the world getting if
like that's actually something that

696
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:20,150
somebody could do. I'm not saying
whether it was done by this guy or not.

697
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,380
I have no fucking idea. He might've
been hammered. I have no idea.

698
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,540
I have no fucking clue.
I don't know anything about it,

699
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,670
but I'm just saying that the fact

700
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,350
that somebody could hack into your
computer and cause your car to speed up.

701
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,370
Okay,

702
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,950
and there's nothing you can,
you can't shut the car off.

703
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:41,690
Okay.

704
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,500
This is why I don't know that I don't
believe that it's just like his evil is

705
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:47,450
that is we got to eliminate this guy.

706
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:51,770
Isn't there a zillion other ways to
kill them without doing that? Like,

707
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:56,160
what if he slammed into like
a fucking minivan with the F,

708
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,020
you know, a married couple
in their three, four kids.

709
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,400
Okay.

710
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,700
You know, it's gotta be, you know,
can't they just spray some mist on him?

711
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,690
Okay.

712
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,420
You know, just walk up to
them in a mall like, Hi sir,

713
00:44:09,421 --> 00:44:10,800
would you like to try this fragrance?

714
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:14,610
You just spray it on him and
then the guy like, you know,

715
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,540
10 minutes later and he's trying
on some slacks, he just keels over.

716
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:22,050
You can't just do it that way.
But anyways, is this true?

717
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:25,290
Is can they actually do that shit?
And this makes me feel glad that you know,

718
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,790
half my time out here, I drive
around in a classic car, you know,

719
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,110
because now like I'm many sort of a
threat. But what I'm saying is if that,

720
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:38,370
if I just would think if you
had the ability to do that,

721
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:43,350
some fucking nerds would just do it
just to do it. Cause it would be funny,

722
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:46,590
just speed you up for a second and
slow you down just to freak you out.

723
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:48,140
Okay.

724
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,340
You know,
like,

725
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:53,240
do you remember back in the day
when this is like pre Internet fun?

726
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,930
What you would do is you'd
take your garage door opener.

727
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:57,880
Yeah.

728
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,241
Right.

729
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:02,200
And you would drive around
the neighborhood and he'd
pointed at every garage

730
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,690
until you found somebody
that had the same one as you.

731
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,830
And back in the day they just had
a, like, it wasn't sophisticated.

732
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,030
So not only yours open, not only
yours, it opened the other ones too.

733
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,400
So you'd,

734
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,220
you'd eventually find somebody that had
the same garage door brand is you and

735
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:26,830
you could open and close the garage
so at least you could my fucking

736
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:30,160
neighborhood. So you just find,
you use drive one person nuts.

737
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,290
Okay.

738
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,970
You just drive by and you just fuck it.

739
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,740
And every once in a while
would just open it and it,

740
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,390
and I don't know why we would do it.
We were assholes, but so using that,

741
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:43,640
if you could fucking do that,
um,

742
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:49,450
with cars, wouldn't, wouldn't
like these people like, you know,

743
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,510
hack into steel, like credit
card numbers and shit. I mean,

744
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,320
wouldn't that be somebody just doing that?
Just to do it like you're bored.

745
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,720
It was this, the, was this the
dumbest part of the podcast?

746
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:06,721
Everybody did I stick the landing starting
off with ignorance and then a well,

747
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,510
why wouldn't they? Well, fuck,
you know what the reality,

748
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,670
if I ever book a commercial,
I'm going to be, you know,

749
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:16,000
that commercial where the adults sits
there with all the kids and they go,

750
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:16,750
you know,
what would you,

751
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,990
what would you do if you had a zillion
dollars and then the kids that I could

752
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,350
buy an island made out
of candy. Yeah, we get,

753
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:27,460
have hot fudge waterfalls and shit.
I would be sitting there right with,

754
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,930
except it wouldn't be like
the basketball one way.

755
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:32,620
They were like making fun of the fact,
like I would be like,

756
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,900
you don't want to say I'm saying I'm okay

757
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,143
buddy.

758
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,490
I'm all right for the birds.
Hey Bill,

759
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,350
I got these two parakeets. My problem is
that these little dudes don't like me.

760
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,510
Uh, I've tried whistling,
petting them. I don't know.

761
00:47:33,511 --> 00:47:36,600
You can pet a bird and
squirting them with water.

762
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,300
Okay.

763
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,120
Uh, do they like water? I'm
guessing that that's a good thing.

764
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:43,120
Parakeets like water.
I don't know.

765
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:46,250
Why don't we ask the fucking Jimmy's
guy to write a fucking nine pages on it?

766
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,730
I love all them upset with that guy
because he actually did the research as

767
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:53,960
opposed to me who were like, oh yeah,
I overheard this in a bar. So anyways,

768
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:57,920
this guy's petting his birds.
He's fucking, he getting
them with the water hose.

769
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,560
He's Westlawn Adam.
Whoo.

770
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,760
I'm all to no avail.
I know they're only birds,

771
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:11,390
but I feel they hold a deep resentment
towards me where you clip their wings and

772
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:12,380
you stuck them in a cage.

773
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:14,930
How would you feel if somebody cut
your fucking nuts off, came by,

774
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:16,760
started whistling at you
and throwing water at you?

775
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,693
You know,

776
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,420
I got an idea. Why don't you leave
him alone? She opened the cage,

777
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,413
right?

778
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,360
Why don't you take them
to one of those car dash?

779
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,870
She had doctors and I get a little botox
in their fucking wings and let them fly

780
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:30,704
away.

781
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,700
Okay.

782
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,430
Would that be annoying to you?
If you are in a cage,

783
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,450
your arm's cut off at the FEC and elbows
and somebody came up and rather than

784
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,690
whistle and they started speaking English.
Yeah. You speak in English at you.

785
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,120
He goes, I think it's because I yelled
at them. Oh, here we go. He goes,

786
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:50,370
I think they resent me
because I yelled at them.

787
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:51,960
Yeah.

788
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,610
What did you, what, what, what were
they doing a, I said, no, we're fine.

789
00:48:56,611 --> 00:48:58,670
During my shows,
uh,

790
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,010
basically I had to scold them
for pooping in their water dish,

791
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,040
but I had their best interest in mind.

792
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,510
So do you understand how fucking insane
you are that you feel like you can talk

793
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:14,770
to a bird?
You know,

794
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:17,440
why don't you like not
stick the water dish,

795
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,303
you know,

796
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,060
underwear that that was
it underneath the swing.

797
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,620
Or what I would do is I just get a
bigger cage. I get a bigger fucking cage.

798
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,730
I put the water in the center that
isn't near any of those trapeze bars and

799
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:33,640
hopefully they won't be at the top
of the cage is still shit down on it.

800
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:38,170
Or I would accept the fact
that it's a burden, a cage,

801
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,210
and that it's,
you know,

802
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,820
okay.

803
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,980
Basically anything at
the bottom of the cage.

804
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,480
Mine as well be the city of Dresden.

805
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,813
Right.

806
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,480
I would just take that as part of it.
I wouldn't yell at the birds,

807
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,290
but it was this guy. He had to scold
them for pooping in their water,

808
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,520
but I had their best interest in mind.
I heard if they drink contaminated water,

809
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:01,940
it can cause a disease that makes
all their feathers fall off.

810
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,800
While you could also read up on it,

811
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:06,890
as opposed to me who just repeats
shits that they, here he goes,

812
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:08,360
I do a lot for those little guys,

813
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:12,980
but putting jackets on nude parakeets
isn't one of them. Even if I wanted to,

814
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:17,420
I couldn't. They don't even let me
pet them, let alone dress them. Dude,

815
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:21,860
you're not a bird guy. You should
have got a dog, a, he goes,

816
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:23,090
when I originally bought them,

817
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:25,670
I imagine I would have one pair
keyed on each shoulder. Why?

818
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:28,850
Hanging out around my house,
but whenever I approached the case,

819
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:33,200
they freeze and horror every time.
They do that. I can't help her.

820
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:36,950
Remember my brother's face when he fell
through the ice. We had to pull him out.

821
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,680
I thought maybe if I bought
them more toys, they would,

822
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,900
that would somehow help to birds.
Motivation isn't more toys.

823
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,150
Their motivation is you not having energy.

824
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,800
Like I'm going to fucking twist your head
off to their wings are clipped so they

825
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:56,120
can't escape. You got him stuck in a cage
that terrified and you yelled at him.

826
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,990
I would say more than on one
occasion you yelled at them.

827
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,560
All right.
Um,

828
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,380
you need to fucking relax.

829
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,593
All right,

830
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,920
listen to this.
Would you,

831
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:15,420
would you want to be like your job
to be in a cage all day? You know,

832
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,700
and then some,
you know,

833
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:19,820
I dunno.

834
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,500
Some giant comes home and puts you on
his fucking shoulders and your whole job

835
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,630
is to enhance the giants fucking life.
You know what?

836
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:28,460
I'm having a little bit of
empathy for the fucking birds.

837
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:33,650
What I would do is I would just have a
totally relaxed energy and hope that they

838
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:38,090
forget that you're screamed at them,
treat them nicely.

839
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:40,910
Don't try to pet them, just don't fuck
with them. Every time you come over,

840
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:44,540
they'll graduate to be like, Oh, this is
the guy who feeds us. Scale brings water.

841
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,060
This guys on our side,
you know,

842
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,320
as opposed to the mixed messages
that you send to them. Um,

843
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,200
yeah. Purchase. Don't
give a fuck about toys,

844
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,003
you know,

845
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,720
do they? I don't think
they do. Um, he said,

846
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:02,660
I bought them a new toy every Friday
on my way home from work and this is a

847
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,970
ridiculous amount of toys in the cage.
And here's the kicker.

848
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:08,090
They haven't played with this
single one. Not once. We'll do,

849
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:12,100
do you look at the birds outside there?
They're not out there.

850
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,140
If you leave your toddler's toys
outside, they don't go, oh good.

851
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:18,020
They left and then they go down and they
start playing on his fucking tricycle.

852
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,310
He goes, they just stare at
me. I took them to the vet,

853
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:25,280
but he spent more time looking at
his phone and the birds. Anyways.

854
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:29,540
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Um, I think you should find a bird lover,

855
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:30,374
sir.

856
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:31,370
Okay.

857
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:36,290
And now give the birds
away and then, um, I dunno.

858
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:40,190
I think you should get your temper in
check and before and before you do that

859
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:43,490
yet, get your temper in check.
And then if you want to get a dog,

860
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,640
it seems like you want more
interaction with the pet.

861
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,880
Most people get birds because they can
have an interaction with an animal,

862
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:53,480
but they don't have to walk it down
the street. And, uh, this is very,

863
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,790
a lot less interaction with them.

864
00:52:55,791 --> 00:53:00,791
You seem like you want a bird to
act like a dog slash a little kid.

865
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:05,390
Like, Hey, daddy's home. I
bought you a fire engine. Oh boy.

866
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,990
Look at that as a bell work. You know,
somehow you want the bird to do that.

867
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,813
MMM,

868
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:16,060
yeah. Please stop yelling
at your birds. All right.

869
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:19,570
They can't help if they shit in
the water. You know, the birds,

870
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:24,790
they're not supposed to be in cages.
They fly around and they shit as they,

871
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,130
they shit when they're on branches,
when they have to go, they go,

872
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,290
they don't have any stress,

873
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,340
they don't have any shame and
there's water all over the place.

874
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,450
So then you've got him in this fucking
cage with little confined area water.

875
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,260
You know, what are, what are they
supposed to do? Well, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

876
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,300
What do I know about the restaurant?

877
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,613
Nay,

878
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,083
nay.

879
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,000
Hey,
what's going on?

880
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:51,001
It's bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

881
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,750
September 28th, 2009. Uh,

882
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,510
my voice is a little raspy
this morning cause a,

883
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:03,010
I did a lot of shows this
weekend getting ready for my, uh,

884
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,300
my next hour special that's going
to tape in December. And uh,

885
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:10,690
somebody actually sent me an
email questioning when, where,

886
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:14,470
and all that type of shit. And uh,
we're still solidifying all of that.

887
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:16,090
So the second I know,

888
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:22,050
I will let you guys know the chosen 14
listeners that I have on my podcast,

889
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:25,420
which I know at this point
it's more than that. You know,

890
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,040
I've checked out some Google trends and
saw that I think I'm up to about 17.

891
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,490
I have no fucking idea how many people
listen to this and I could give a shit.

892
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:38,140
All right. That's it. I mean, I, I give
a shit. I want people to fucking listen.

893
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,690
But, um, I don't do this
thing too. Uh, I dunno.

894
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,550
I don't know. It's weird. I don't fucking
hype this thing really. If you find it,

895
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:53,260
you find it. You fucking
cunts. Um, all right.

896
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,340
So this is my deal. It's Monday
and I'm still in Addison, Texas.

897
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:02,050
Why do you ask why bill? I
thought Monday was the day. Uh,

898
00:56:02,051 --> 00:56:06,980
you went back to Hollywood and tried to
pursue your dreams of getting into a,

899
00:56:06,981 --> 00:56:10,760
uh, a fucking movie here
or there. Well, I'm,

900
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:15,550
I'm hanging around one more day cause I'm
going to the cowboys game tonight on a

901
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,030
Monday night football cowboys playing the,
uh,

902
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,750
the fuck are they playing at Carolina
Panthers? I'm kind of out of sorts.

903
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:24,760
And you know, somebody's not
getting this podcast. Everybody.

904
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,550
You listen to it right now
and it's Tuesday morning.

905
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:32,551
And I'll tell you why he didn't fucking
get it is because he fucking assholes at

906
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:37,660
the hotel or rape and me on the Internet.
And you know,

907
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:40,960
I feel about corporations.
I don't fucking like them.

908
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,700
This is what these fucking assholes do,
right? You sign up for the Internet.

909
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:49,900
It's 13 bucks a day at this fucking
hotel, right? 13 bucks a day.

910
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:55,210
That's already ridiculous. All
right? But I'm on the road,

911
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:58,660
you know, whatever, I'm making some
money here. I'm doing all right.

912
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:03,460
And I need to fuck. I need the internet.
I lost my fucking blackberry. So I'm like,

913
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,560
all right, fuck it. I'll pay it.

914
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:11,020
So I sign up for this shit at about 10
o'clock at night after I had flown in

915
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,280
Wednesday night and the next,
you know, the next day, you know,

916
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:18,730
I signed up for it for four
fucking day. 24 hours, right?

917
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,740
My world a day is 24
hours. All right? So I,

918
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:28,240
um, you know, I wake up the next
day, I do the morning radio,

919
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:32,530
I hype my shows. I have a great fucking
time. I come back in the afternoon, I say,

920
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,030
you know what?
I think I'll go on that.

921
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,450
That their new fangled internet that
the kids are talking about, right?

922
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,120
I go to go on the Internet
and Lo and behold,

923
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:43,090
I'm not on the fucking Internet
anymore and I'm like, wait a minute.

924
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,890
Even though I went to fucking summer
school just about every goddamn year in

925
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:52,300
high school because of math, I
know how to fucking ad. All right?

926
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,650
Is that Algebra Shit and geometry and
Algebra two and trig and all that shit.

927
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:01,120
That fucked me up because I'm,
you know,

928
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,470
I'm not into shapes.

929
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,180
The second they started drawing
those triangles on the boy,

930
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,610
I just didn't give a shit.
It's just like really,

931
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,880
you know there's certain things
in life you just fucking, no,

932
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:19,570
you're never going to use it right now.
I know that you know a lot of the things.

933
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:23,440
I'm probably fucking the sitting in
this room right now because of geometry.

934
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,510
Look at all his shapes.

935
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:29,830
When I look around the wind of fucking
look out the window, that's a rectangle.

936
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,570
My doors are rectangle
with a fucking triangle.

937
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,760
Well that's a right angle on the
doorway. Hell, there's four of them,

938
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,550
right?
Is that geometry?

939
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:46,840
I don't know what the fuck it is because
I'm an Isosceles triangle over by my

940
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:50,770
phone. I don't fucking know. All right.
But I know, you know what I mean?

941
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,070
He just fucking know some stuff. You
know you're just going to suck at. So

942
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,750
whatever bill, get on comp, we're going
to have to stay on fucking track here.

943
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:01,120
Right. So anyways, so basically it was,

944
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,390
it had been about 14 hours since I
signed up for the Internet and all of a

945
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:06,130
sudden I'm not on the
fucking Internet again.

946
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,100
So I go back online to figure out what's
going on. And right after you'd sign,

947
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:11,680
you sign up for 24 hours.

948
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:16,681
It says in small print in parentheses
that it expires every day at noon time.

949
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,470
So basically I didn't sign up 24 hours.
What I signed up for was a, yeah,

950
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:25,460
14 hours.

951
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,600
I paid $13 for 14 hours
of fucking Internet,

952
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,510
eight of which I was
sleeping. Okay. So yeah,

953
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:35,470
they fucking raped me.

954
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:39,460
They came up with a new little fucky
fuck charge new little, you know,

955
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:43,690
they just sit around like these fucking
money grubbing little [inaudible] to

956
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:47,420
figure out some little fucking way,
you know,

957
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,400
that they can just somehow squeaked they,
I mean,

958
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,460
I'm sure if I sat down and
tried to figure out the map,

959
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,500
the math of like when people arrive in
a hotel and when they usually check out,

960
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:02,210
like how having it expire every day at
fucking noon gets them a little bit more

961
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:06,380
money, you know, so they can make
their yachts just a little bit bigger.

962
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:12,780
So you know what it was usual shit. What
do I do? I call the front desk, right?

963
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,040
And who do I get?

964
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:18,150
Do I get the head of the corporation that
runs this Internet scam? Of course not.

965
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:23,151
I get some fucking 25 year old person
who fucking majored in transportation or

966
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:24,480
fucking,
I dunno,

967
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,190
hotel management and now has no fucking
benefits and is working the front desk

968
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:33,750
and I'm pissed. So I say to
him, I say, hey, they're chippy.

969
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,150
This is bill Burke calling and
fucking room one zero one eight. Niner

970
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,770
I don't know why. Just wanted to get
military, their alpha red nine or

971
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,050
68 cross power trip, do whatever
the fuck you call it. Anyway,

972
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:55,980
so fucking call this guy up and I go,
look,

973
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:01,410
I just signed up for a fucking day and
now it shuts off at noon and the guy goes,

974
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:02,910
yeah and I,
um,

975
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,510
we don't have anything to do
with that here at the hotel.

976
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,230
The Internet is a
complete separate entity.

977
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,800
So even though you're in the hotel and
you're currently having their dick firmly

978
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:21,120
and your ass, we don't
have any responsibility on
that. If you'd like to see,

979
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,980
and you know how I can fucking complain,

980
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:27,981
I have to go back on the fucking Internet
and pay another 13 fucking dollars to

981
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:31,200
complain to these assholes.
So you know what? Fuck them.

982
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,650
Fuck them fucking assholes. You
know what? You dumped fucks.

983
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,180
You could have got 80 bucks out of me.

984
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:42,110
I was willing to pay 13 a day even
though that was a total fucking rip off

985
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:47,030
because you little fucking cunty attitude
now. You only get 13 bucks out of me.

986
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,093
All right.

987
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,160
Yeah.

988
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,860
I don't understand why they do
that. Why they just, I mean,

989
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:56,800
do people just give into it
trying to find the name of these assholes?

990
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:02,210
What is it? I see h or something like
that. I didn't know what the fuck it is.

991
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:03,140
Who gives a shit?
Right?

992
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,960
I'm just having one of these fucking
weeks and now I don't have any questions

993
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:07,850
because I haven't been on the
fucking internet this week,

994
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:10,880
so I'm just basically going
to have to wing this podcast.

995
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:15,080
But fortunately I have plenty of stories
from my wonderful stay out here in

996
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:20,040
Addison, Texas. Um, here's one for you.
I'm going to be on the road for the

997
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,480
next three weeks. So that's obviously
putting a strain on my relationship. Okay.

998
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,490
Something and maybe I'll do something
nice for the fucking two days.

999
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:31,140
I'm going to be home over
the next three weeks. And uh,

1000
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,430
I'm a big fan of the corvette.
Everybody. Do you like the corvette?

1001
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,820
Are you a middle aged American
man like me who never got married?

1002
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:42,450
He doesn't have kids. So now
for some, that's what ends up.

1003
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,680
That's when that's when that
car starts appealing to you.

1004
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,550
You have to start thinking that
shit. You know, maybe I'll,

1005
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,960
maybe I'll get myself a corvette.

1006
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:53,400
Maybe I'll go hang out at an Applebee's
and start hitting on somebody who's at

1007
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:56,220
least fucking born three decades after me.

1008
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,140
No, I fucking love Corvettes.
I think they're there.

1009
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,780
I just loved the look of the
car. I think it's, uh, you know,

1010
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:10,070
it's an American made car. I think it's
a great value. You know what I mean?

1011
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:12,710
I think, you know, they got a corvette
guy has like fucking 200 miles an hour.

1012
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,050
Now granted, I know, I know
that one's like six figures,

1013
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:20,240
but you can get a corvette. Can't you
get a corvette for like 65 grand? I mean,

1014
01:03:20,241 --> 01:03:25,190
all I know it's a shitload
of money. But, uh, you know,

1015
01:03:25,191 --> 01:03:27,710
I realized halfway through this,
I don't even know how much a Porsche cost.

1016
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,230
Is it Porsche or Porsche?
I don't even know how to say it.

1017
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,760
That's another car that I fucking love
that, uh, that you know, I can't afford.

1018
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,970
You know how much money I'd have to
make a fucking year to justify blowing

1019
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,470
basically a house on a
car, house, money on a car.

1020
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,090
How's money granted it in fucking
Arkansas somewhere, but still,

1021
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,180
you know what I mean? Um, so anyways,

1022
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,870
I think the way to go is rather than
fucking going out and spending all that

1023
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,660
fucking money on the car,
you just go rent one for a day.

1024
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:01,010
So one day I landed in fucking Burbank
airport and I'm driving by Hertz rental

1025
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:04,790
car. And what do I see? I see a
fucking yellow corvette sitting there.

1026
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,060
I'm not into the yellow, but it's still
a core vet. And I'm thinking, you know,

1027
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:12,380
I want, he said, why don't we just
fucking rent one for one day? You know,

1028
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,370
I'll rent one full one day. What's that
going to cost? Right? 300 400 bucks.

1029
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,750
That's a fuck load of money. But if
it's, it's way less than 70 grant,

1030
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:25,580
75 grand, what the fuck? Why
not rent? One of those things,

1031
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:27,650
you know,
I'll take my girl out,

1032
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:31,820
we'll go for a cruise up in
the fucking Hollywood hills,

1033
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,400
will tip it over,
will die.

1034
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,480
Just like that fucking dude in the 50s
who look like Fonzie, but that's not him.

1035
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,120
What is his name?
Johnny was his name.

1036
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:44,720
Johnny was in every fucking
bad boy named Johnny back then.

1037
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:49,800
Do you have notice that shit. One
of my favorite things to watch, um,

1038
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,013
is old,

1039
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:54,490
like those old black and white movies,
whenever the,

1040
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:57,730
they're doing movies about gangs,
you know,

1041
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:01,780
and it's always a bunch of white
actors and half of them are gay,

1042
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:07,390
just flaming homosexuals and they're
trying to act tough and it's fucking

1043
01:05:07,391 --> 01:05:12,100
hilarious the way they flip up their
collar and they pull up their sleeves.

1044
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:15,880
What the fuck did I watched the other
day was one of the worst fucking movies I

1045
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:17,020
ever saw in my life

1046
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,690
was a Marlon Brando movie.

1047
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:24,130
That one where he's on the motorcycle
and he stops into the town if you want to

1048
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,770
fucking, yeah. Do you ever
get embarrassed for someone?

1049
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:31,210
Like somebody is doing something so
douchey that you just fill yourself just

1050
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:35,980
wanting to crawl underneath a fucking
hotel bed and lay next to the dead hooker

1051
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:40,660
that you didn't even realize was there.
You know what I mean?

1052
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,850
There is a scene in that movie where
they are in this bar and these two guys

1053
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:49,130
start talking in this street slang and,

1054
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:53,560
and the old bartender just can't
keep up with it. And they go like,

1055
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:57,780
Hey Daddy. Oh, if I can't even
do it, it's so fine. We got an,

1056
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:02,230
I get embarrassed three even trying
to recreate it. It's fucking horrific.

1057
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,570
So, uh, the fuck am I
talking about it? Yeah.

1058
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:11,650
I want to rent this God damn car,
right? So I'm, I'll rent it for one day,

1059
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:16,060
right? A for one day. And I tell you
some right now, La, during the day,

1060
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:19,150
especially during these hotter months,
it's fucking horrible.

1061
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,700
It's like living in a city.

1062
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,650
Let's write outside of God's stove and,
and you know,

1063
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,010
that doesn't make sense or trying to,
you know,

1064
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:32,620
I was trying to say that the
joke I was trying to do is like,

1065
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:36,910
you have a heat up an oven.
Sure. We all have. Ah,

1066
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:41,110
at some point you tried to cook a fucking
Turkey. Oh, fucking remind me. I got,

1067
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:44,320
I tell you about a great youtube video.
Y'All, you know what? I'm going to forget.

1068
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:48,010
Let me get back to the stove thing.
Thanksgiving's coming up, everybody.

1069
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:51,760
I now I'm all over the place. I'm going
to fucking finish some Brando thing.

1070
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,820
I'm going to finish this stove thing and
I'm going to get back to the corvette

1071
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:55,121
story,

1072
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:57,700
but first I'm going to tell him and I'm
going to take a little break for the

1073
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:02,560
holidays. All right. Over here in America
for all you people overseas, Bu, Bu,

1074
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:05,280
Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, Bu, um,

1075
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,350
that was supposed to be ladies and
gentlemen and all the ships at sea. Um,

1076
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:09,551
we have,

1077
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:13,420
we have a holiday over here called
Thanksgiving where we give thanks for the

1078
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:15,050
fact that our founding fathers,
uh,

1079
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:18,520
committed genocide and gave us
all this beautiful land out here.

1080
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,900
Fuck you.
That's how the world works.

1081
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,490
You knew we will come and you
saw a cutlasses, you know,

1082
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,140
that's how the world works. Smash Mouth
Football, the black and blue division.

1083
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,510
That's how it fucking works.
The Norris. Um, no it is.

1084
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,640
And I don't have a Kate that shit,
but you know what, what it happened.

1085
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,630
But you know,
they got their casinos,

1086
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,530
we named a couple of golf courses after
him. You haven't noticed that shit.

1087
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:48,730
That's what I like about white people.

1088
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,720
We fucking slaughter people than we
named Shit after him. Once we feel bad.

1089
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,100
Oh,
we'll call this a one want to tuck.

1090
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:04,990
This is the one buttock grocery store
and this is the last and the Mohican.

1091
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,100
Culdesac um, anyways,
Jesus Christ bill yet.

1092
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:11,500
So I saw this youtube video
Thanksgiving's coming up or right.

1093
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:14,950
And one of the big things as a man is
you have to know how to carve a God damn

1094
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,011
okay.

1095
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:19,400
And as much as all you fucking guys out
there want to act like you know how to

1096
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:21,290
carve a Turkey most.
See you fucking don't.

1097
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:23,840
But you're too afraid to ask because
you're worried that someone's going to

1098
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:27,920
question your sexuality because that's
what it's like to be a man. Basically.

1099
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:32,780
If you don't just somehow
know shit without ever having
any explained it to you,

1100
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,430
that evidently means that you, you, you
want to have sex with another man. That's,

1101
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,640
that's the laws that I learned
growing up. Um, so anyways,

1102
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:44,300
there is a fucking youtube video out
there that of course I can't check because

1103
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:49,040
he's constant charger me $13 every
fucking and expires every noon.

1104
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,690
But there just go on,
go on to Youtube, right?

1105
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,350
And just Google how to carve a Turkey.
There is a fucking dude on there, man.

1106
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,520
I'm telling you, you, it's,

1107
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:05,420
it's unbelievable the way he takes
his bird apart. It's masterful.

1108
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,380
Okay. And don't make the mistake I made
last year because I carved the thing up

1109
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:12,410
perfectly, but the problem was my
knives, we're a little bit dull.

1110
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,880
Go get your knives professionally
sharpened this month. Okay.

1111
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:21,020
And Jesse eat spaghetti until Thanksgiving
so you don't fuck them up because I

1112
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,960
swear to God, I've tried with that
little sharpener that you get.

1113
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:27,460
A lot of people just take
out that sharpener out of
that a little knife thing.

1114
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,460
They just go week and there's a, you
have to fucking hold the thing at as a,

1115
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,860
at a certain angle and you can actually
be making the thing Duller if you don't

1116
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:40,100
know what the fuck you're doing.
Trust me, cause I did it. You know,

1117
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:44,060
I watched a couple of the three stooges
things and I saw them, I saw curly.

1118
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:50,150
Look, I can't even fucking do it. My
fucking voice is so trashed. Anyways,

1119
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,820
there's this killer youtube video man.

1120
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:56,660
And it's like literally when this
guy is done with the thing you got,

1121
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,870
you've got the drumsticks,
the wings in the dark meat,

1122
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:01,190
everything's lined up like that.

1123
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:04,400
And then you got all the white meat with
just a little bit of skin on top of it,

1124
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:09,260
lined up like a fucking deck of cards
and you come out with your serving tray.

1125
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,990
I mean, if people faint, it looks so good,

1126
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:17,480
that fucking carcass is just,
it's a maculate. All right,

1127
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:20,090
so definitely check that shit out.
If you're going to make a Turkey,

1128
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,300
and if you're one of those people too,
who wants to deep fry of fucking Turkey,

1129
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:27,530
make sure you put the Turkey
in the deep fryer first. Okay.

1130
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,680
And then fill it up with water so you
know how much fucking grease to put in

1131
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:31,514
there.

1132
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:34,580
Evidently that's what people do is they
fill it all the way up to the top and

1133
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:38,120
then they dropped the bird in there
and then it overflows. Catches flame,

1134
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,460
lights their deck on fire and
they burn down their house.

1135
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:44,810
And that's not thanksgiving.
That's not even Halloween. Anyways,

1136
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,330
let me get Ben and what if I
got it back up here? So anyways,

1137
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:53,870
this fucking podcast is a mess.
Um, to fuck died. God's oven,

1138
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,720
this is what I'm talking about. You have
a heat up, a fucking oven, you know,

1139
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,670
and then you check it on
whatever you're cooking.

1140
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:02,780
And rather than opening it and letting
the heat come out and then looking down

1141
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:03,614
with your face,

1142
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,340
you open the door with your face right
there and you get that fucking heat

1143
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:11,990
furnace blast. That's what summer
is like in La in July and August.

1144
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:16,420
But I'm gonna tell you at night, it's
absolutely gorgeous. I'm telling you,

1145
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,860
you should do it at some point. You ever
come out to la? Fuck the Hollywood sign.

1146
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,900
Fuck going on sunset.
Fuck all that.

1147
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:25,290
Go up on Mulholland drive
and drive through the hills
late at night and look at

1148
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,600
the valley and it looks like
Christmas, man. It's amazing.

1149
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,100
So that's what I wanted to do.

1150
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:33,210
I was going to get this fucking car
cruise around up there and uh, you know,

1151
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:38,070
have a couple of drinks, wrap it
around a tree, run away from the scene,

1152
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:43,200
blame it on a minority, you
know, I'm fucking with you. Um,

1153
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,570
you know, I was kind of have a good
fucking time. It's what I wanted to do.

1154
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,380
So I call these fucking
assholes up at Hertz.

1155
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:57,270
I call him up cause I wanna rent this car.
That's going to cost me 350 bucks.

1156
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,840
I'm going to throw a fucking iPod
right in the trash for one fucking day.

1157
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,060
A fucking taking some s turns
up there in the hills, right?

1158
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,170
So I call him up and I say, yeah, listen,

1159
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,200
I want to rent that corvette you got
at the Burbank airport and they got a

1160
01:12:12,201 --> 01:12:15,460
attack. Oh, first of all, I had to
fucking get through their stupid, uh,

1161
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:17,040
okay.

1162
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,520
They're stupid. Whatever the, the, the,
the computer thing. And then you know,

1163
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:22,590
of course they have this,
this automated voice,

1164
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,270
and you can tell the
person did the voice over.

1165
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:28,110
They told you to smile when she did it,
it says, this is the tone. Just goes,

1166
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,470
thank you for calling her.
It's rental car.

1167
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,220
You can actually get a better
deal if you go to here. It's dead.

1168
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:39,690
Can needs big stupid fucking grin on
her face. And it wasn't bugging me.

1169
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,840
I actually enjoyed it the first
time through because I'm like,

1170
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:46,830
I'm going to get a corvette for one
fucking day. I'm going to live the dream.

1171
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,310
Yeah,

1172
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,810
I'm going to live the fucking dream.

1173
01:12:49,811 --> 01:12:53,290
I'm going to live the American fucking
dream before they collapsed the dollar

1174
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:58,000
and combine us with fucking Canada and
Mexico and put a microchip in the middle

1175
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:01,330
of our fucking forehead. I'm going to
do it when I get this God Damn Corvette,

1176
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,750
right? So, you know,

1177
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:07,650
he wanted to fucking have a toothbrush
shoved up your ass. Press one.

1178
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:12,600
If you want to fucking do a cart wheel
press 19. So finally up, you get up to 20.

1179
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:16,350
If you want to make a reservation, I
fucking hit that button. And then it,

1180
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:20,730
then right?
Again [inaudible] right.

1181
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,310
It takes me like fucking 20 minutes,
right?

1182
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:25,130
Okay.

1183
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:29,690
Press or say can't, right? I'm going
through all that shit. So finally,

1184
01:13:29,691 --> 01:13:33,920
I'm just like screaming
operator into the phone, right?

1185
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:37,370
So finally I get someone and I say, you
know, listen, I want to rent. You know,

1186
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,080
I saw this car corvette you had at
the Burbank airport and God damn it,

1187
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:45,630
I'd like to rent it.
And they go, okay, um,

1188
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:50,820
let me give you the number for the Hertz
rental car location and they can help

1189
01:13:50,821 --> 01:13:55,560
you with that, sir. And I said,
okay, ma'am. And she gives it to me.

1190
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:58,950
All right?
So I hang up and what do I do?

1191
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:03,150
I called the hertz location out in
Burbank. And what do I get again?

1192
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,180
That same computer,

1193
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:09,210
Smiley voice you recalling here at Uva?
Anal carer.

1194
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,380
Gail picks me again,
right?

1195
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:17,170
If you know the extension of the person,
how the fuck would I know that?

1196
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:22,630
How would I know what fucking extension
would like to football players and they

1197
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:26,980
have a hall of fame career and I know
fucking Brett Farve is extension for on a

1198
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:31,170
fuck would I know that shit.
So once again,

1199
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,690
operator screaming into the phone,

1200
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,180
I want to fucking talk
to a goddamn person.

1201
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,270
But of course I can't talk to a person.
What are they doing the entire time?

1202
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,460
They keep steering me to the Internet,

1203
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:49,240
basically saying in not so many words
that this would be a whole fucking lot

1204
01:14:49,341 --> 01:14:53,390
easier if he just went on the
Internet. He Hurts Dad Cam. Right?

1205
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,720
You could just help us
eliminate more fucking jobs.

1206
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:58,720
Yeah.

1207
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,960
So we can eventually replace all of
you with fucking robots, you know?

1208
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,920
So I'm like, fuck this. I want
to talk to a goddamn person.

1209
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,080
So finally I get to the stupid,
you know,

1210
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,030
all I get is if you
want to leave a message,

1211
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,130
yeah.

1212
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,660
You know, I'm like, I don't
want to leave a message.

1213
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:14,110
Okay.

1214
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,420
Right. And then they go, well you
didn't, you know, they come on, well,

1215
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:18,840
I didn't make a decision.
I have to make a fucking decision.

1216
01:15:18,841 --> 01:15:22,080
I did make a decision. My decision is
I don't like any of the decisions you,

1217
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:26,600
you fucking gave me to make.
So if they get,

1218
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:30,090
if you want Moria change pace board,
Smiley face.

1219
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:34,740
So I press four and then basically
if I wanted to talk to a person,

1220
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:39,780
I could basically schedule a phone
call when they could call me back.

1221
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:44,040
I could leave my phone number
or I could wait a half an hour.

1222
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,980
So I hang up and I'm like,
you know what,

1223
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:48,870
I've just wasted a half
hour my fucking life.

1224
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:52,340
So I call these fucking assholes
back again at the national thank.

1225
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,710
Thank you for calling her to be anal care.
I'm back in that shit again.

1226
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:59,820
And I'm screaming operator to the phone
and I get somebody to say, listen,

1227
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,620
who do I talk to to make a complaint?
Because at this point I'm like,

1228
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,090
I'm not renting his
fucking car from there.

1229
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,660
I know there's other places where they,
they, they rent these exotic cars.

1230
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:14,310
Is it column that, um,
I was like, fuck it.

1231
01:16:14,311 --> 01:16:15,600
I'm just going to go through them,
but I'm,

1232
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:18,510
but I'm going to make sure that
I complained to somebody. Okay.

1233
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:21,900
And I'm not going on the internet
and sending a fucking email. Right.

1234
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:25,650
So actually get a person and they
go, okay, well let me transfer. Okay,

1235
01:16:25,651 --> 01:16:28,440
I'm going to transfer you.
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

1236
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,800
I'm very sorry to hear that,
sir.

1237
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,690
Let me transfer you to our complaints
department. I go, okay, thank you.

1238
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:38,200
She clicks it over, dude. Thank
you for calling her manager.

1239
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:43,090
I'm fucking back in it
again. Right. And they,

1240
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:46,250
and they just fucking tell me
if I, if I'd like, I can't get,

1241
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:50,570
I can't get to a fucking person. So
now I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm determined.

1242
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,430
I'm going to get to
somebody I call back again.

1243
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,060
[inaudible] it's go through the operator,
go through the bullshit again.

1244
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,530
I get to someone,
I say listen.

1245
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:58,740
Yeah.

1246
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,320
Okay. You sitting down person
on the other side of the phone.

1247
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,530
I would like to make a complaint.
I don't want to fill out a form.

1248
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,780
I don't want to make an email.
I want to talk to a person.

1249
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:09,810
I do not want to be transferred into
your national gang. Wriggling here.

1250
01:17:09,811 --> 01:17:13,370
It's fucking thing again. I didn't say
fuck cause I could have hung up on me.

1251
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,990
National System again. I would like to
be transferred directly to a person.

1252
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:22,220
I believe you call it a warm transfer
in the creepy corporate world.

1253
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,400
So can you do a warm transfer,

1254
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:28,580
meaning something alive
to something else alive.

1255
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,120
They can communicate with me and
she goes, yes sir. I'm sorry.

1256
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:34,400
I'm sorry you're having this
difficulty. I say, I understand lady.

1257
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:37,670
I understand you're not on the yet. You're
not on the yard. You're on the dark.

1258
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,300
Getting screamed at by guys like me every
day. That's not, I'm not yelling at you.

1259
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:46,850
All right, fucking I'm on hold
again. She can't get to anybody.

1260
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,630
Then I go back to her and then she hits
me with the form. What is your name, sir?

1261
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:55,010
What'd they did? None of your fucking
business. You don't need to know my name.

1262
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,330
What do you need to know my name for?

1263
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:00,890
So you can stick me on the hostile
collar list because I had the audacity to

1264
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:05,030
complain about your country
fucking system. I'm not
giving you my fucking name.

1265
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:09,380
I want to talk to a person. Okay.
There I just, yeah, I just, okay.

1266
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,680
Just following protocol. I understand
that ma'am. I'm not mad at you.

1267
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,380
I didn't see any that country, that
fucks stuff. That's what I was thinking.

1268
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,940
But I kept my God damn cool.

1269
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,530
I kept my cool just like fucking Steve
McQueen in that movie where he eats the

1270
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:25,700
deviled eggs, get mad at
damn eggs. So anyways,

1271
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,570
I fucking,
I fucking

1272
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:36,650
finally get to a person. All right. And
I just say really calmed me. I just say,

1273
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,810
look,
you know,

1274
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:43,280
I've been on the phone for 40 minutes
trying to give you guys 350 bucks.

1275
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,130
Okay.
And for the life of me,

1276
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:50,420
I can't do it because I keep talking to
computers and they keep sending me back

1277
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:53,660
into your national system. Now, ma'am,
I know you have nothing to do with this.

1278
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,833
All right?

1279
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,360
But I want to know what is the best way
that I can try to complain so I can get

1280
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:03,770
to the inner hive, the inner layer of
the hive here and actually get to that,

1281
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,210
that person who's sitting there and those
loafers without any socks on sunning

1282
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:11,120
himself on the deck of his yacht.
I want to get to that guy,

1283
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:15,140
the guy who made this policy. Okay?
I like talking to people, ma'am.

1284
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:19,550
I enjoy the fact that you still
have a job. Okay. That's what I,

1285
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:23,210
that's what I like. Yeah. My
phone buzzing in my phone.

1286
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:27,710
Buzz and hang on one second. Hey Paul,
let me call you right back. All right?

1287
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:33,110
So, uh, you know what? It actually worked.

1288
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:37,460
So basically what they did was,
is I got an email and they go,

1289
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:41,480
you can send an email and I go and let me
guess. No one's going to call me. Right?

1290
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,250
Someone's going to email me back and
act like it's the actual frigging person

1291
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:50,510
that I'm talking to. But really it's going
to be an intern who's being, you know,

1292
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,160
who's working there for free.

1293
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:56,480
And also parttime reads those books for
Oprah's book club so she can come on TV

1294
01:19:56,481 --> 01:20:00,410
and acts like she fucking reads a 400
page book every fucking week. Right?

1295
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,650
Is that her? You're going to give me too,
cause if that's what the deal is I want,

1296
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:04,910
I want somebody up high.

1297
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:09,911
So basically they gave me allegedly the
email of the vice president at Hertz

1298
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:18,000
reservations, Dat Cam. Um, and
I actually have the guy's name.

1299
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,790
Now, whether this is true or not, I dunno,

1300
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:25,320
but what I want to tell the guy is
that I was trying to fucking rent

1301
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,400
that fucking flaming yellow corvette
that they have out there in Burbank,

1302
01:20:31,401 --> 01:20:33,350
California. For the life
of me. I couldn't do it.

1303
01:20:33,351 --> 01:20:36,200
And now I don't want to do it and I'm
going to bring my business somewhere else

1304
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,510
and I would appreciate it if you know,

1305
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,430
just hope against hope that maybe you'd
give some human beings some jobs because

1306
01:20:43,431 --> 01:20:48,380
my experience with your company is you
may be at best have six people fucking

1307
01:20:48,381 --> 01:20:51,320
working there
because you just,

1308
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:56,390
you just keep trying to steer the herd
onto the Internet and all you dumb fucks

1309
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:01,550
out there who are just constantly
helping them to get rid of people's jobs.

1310
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:05,600
You're Outta your fucking mind because
those people are going to need jobs and

1311
01:21:05,601 --> 01:21:09,560
eventually they're going to be willing
to do your fucking job for a lot less

1312
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:10,400
fucking pay.

1313
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:15,730
And considering we've sent 90% of our
factories out of this fucking country now,

1314
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,480
so now the American worker is going to
have to fucking compete with sweatshop

1315
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:24,770
labor to make some fucking track shoes.
You know,

1316
01:21:24,771 --> 01:21:26,840
why don't we try to keep
the jobs that we have.

1317
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:31,730
I'm not going to hertz.com you try
to pay me off with better rates.

1318
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:36,680
Go Fuck Yourself. But some fucking human
beings in there the way you used to,

1319
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,670
and you know what?
You'd be $350 fucking rich,

1320
01:21:39,671 --> 01:21:42,410
or I'd be driving a corvette and
everybody would be fucking happier.

1321
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:45,830
You can put some new varnish on
your deck or your fucking boat.

1322
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,550
You fucking assholes.
So whatever.

1323
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:53,150
I know there's gotta be a private place
out there in la that I can call right up

1324
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:56,300
and they'll probably charge me
even more money. And you know what?

1325
01:21:56,301 --> 01:21:58,700
I don't give a fuck because
I'm going to go in there.

1326
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,400
They'll probably give me a little piece
of champagne or give gimme a fucking

1327
01:22:01,401 --> 01:22:05,180
foot massage. All right?
They probably won't do that,

1328
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:08,370
but I'll talk to a person and that's what
the fuck I want. That's all I wanted.

1329
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:12,800
A little fucking human interaction San
asking too. Goddamn much. All right.

1330
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:16,760
So anyways, there's that story. All right?
And I'm going to tell you another story.

1331
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:18,680
They want you to tell you guys
some stories this week, all right,

1332
01:22:18,681 --> 01:22:21,140
why don't you put your pajamas on?
All right,

1333
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:23,150
get a fire going and
you're fucking apartment.

1334
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,090
If they haven't boarded the
thing up because they're
worried about getting sued.

1335
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:32,570
Um, was that great back in the day where
if you started a fire was your fucking

1336
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:37,430
fault as opposed to the
landlords as opposed to,

1337
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:39,440
well, why did you have a
fireplace in there? Well,

1338
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:42,200
they had a fireplace in there
in case it got fucking cold out.

1339
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,720
Or maybe you want to have a romantic
evening with your girl and you want to

1340
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:48,770
light a fucking fire. That's why there's
a fireplace in there. It's a fireplace.

1341
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,910
It is a place for a fire. Now, if somehow
you burn down the fucking apartment,

1342
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:57,200
evidently you didn't understand what
place to put the fucking firing you.

1343
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:59,780
Dumb fuck.
Who does not use a fireplace?

1344
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:03,890
Evidently there's enough fucking people.
So they need to be boarded up.

1345
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,350
Boarding up a fireplace.
Jesus Christ.

1346
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:12,340
Why don't you put Santa Claus in
jail while you're at it? All right.

1347
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:16,630
That was a little big. Okay. I'm just
saying, you know, I like fireplaces.

1348
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:21,130
I like a crack of the fire. I don't like
those fucking gas ones. Those fake fires.

1349
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:25,660
Me. Technically it is a
fire. You know. I Dunno,

1350
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:28,840
what am I talking about? Let me tell you
a fantastic fucking story last night.

1351
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,560
All right, so I'm working the road
with Joe to Rosa Young Joe de Rosa,

1352
01:23:32,561 --> 01:23:36,460
the fucking teen idol from the opiate
Anthony Show who is actually going to be

1353
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:41,260
on the cover of teen beat this,
uh, this month. And it's actually,

1354
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:45,800
I saw a little bit of the photo shoot.
He's doing a tribute to a net, a fund,

1355
01:23:45,801 --> 01:23:49,840
a cello, and uh, that other
fucking guy was it Tony Curtis,

1356
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:52,750
who the fuck she used to make those
beach movies with or whatever.

1357
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,780
Joe's going to be there shirtless,
holding a surfboard and knock. He needs,

1358
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:58,180
he's never looks sexier.
Um,

1359
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:06,970
so, uh, the fuck am I
talking about? I Christ,

1360
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:10,480
I don't even know anymore. Um, yeah,
so we go out last night, right?

1361
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:14,650
We're doing the show is these two big
titted horse sitting in the front fucking

1362
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:17,020
row. All right. So we're like,
Oh wow, look at these girls.

1363
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:20,290
These girls would probably be fun,
right? And I'm going to relationship,

1364
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:24,610
but you know, I like being the wing man.
You know, I love being in the wing, man.

1365
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,910
I'd love it. I love talking shit.
The girls, I love hitting on girls.

1366
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:31,600
I fucking do it all the time and then
I try to pawn them off to wherever the

1367
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:36,040
fuck I am. And uh, you know, so I
don't have any goddamn guilt, you know.

1368
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,980
So anyways,
so long story short,

1369
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,890
we're talking to these broads and it's
clear that there's some sort of strippers.

1370
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:48,310
I don't know what the fucking deal is.
Okay. So we meet everybody from whatever.

1371
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:52,420
I'm going to stop naming names here.
Okay. So a huge group of us from the show,

1372
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,870
from the crowd and everything. We go
and we head out to this bar, right?

1373
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:01,210
So
one of the strippers is cool,

1374
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:05,920
the other one has a voice that could
literally crack a flat screen TV.

1375
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,930
All right?
So the cool one shows up.

1376
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:14,110
First she sits down, I'm like,
Hey, are you doing, you know,

1377
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:17,860
I like at the end of the week, I hang out
a buy a round for some people. You know,

1378
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:22,510
I'm in a great mood. I had a good
time. I'm on my way home, you know,

1379
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,860
up by some people, some drinks. So I say
to her, hey, what would you like to drink?

1380
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:30,690
She's like, I'll have a Faq and gag at
Google, one of those fucking chick drinks.

1381
01:25:30,691 --> 01:25:35,080
So you know, so I get her a drink. I buy
young Joe to Rosa fucking drink, right?

1382
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:36,940
Everybody's having a good time.

1383
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:42,760
And then this other person shows up who
I knew and she was a real nice person.

1384
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:45,580
I said, hey, what do you want
for a drink? And she was like,

1385
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:48,610
I'll get a vodka red bull,
right? I got my $20 bill out.

1386
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:52,990
And then the strip is like, yeah, make
it tail right. And I was like, wait,

1387
01:25:52,991 --> 01:25:55,750
what do you mean make it to you
haven't even finished your first make.

1388
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:59,590
Don't be warding off my money. You've
finished your first one there, young lady.

1389
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:03,040
All right, stand the fuck down.
You're not working right now.

1390
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,720
Not some dip shit getting a
fucking lap dance. All right,

1391
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:10,760
finish your fucking milk and
cookies first. So, needless to say,

1392
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:13,010
the conversation cooled
between the two of us.

1393
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:18,080
But I didn't give a fuck man. I was
having a good time, but whatever.

1394
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:22,130
It was still kind of, you know,
whatever he's talking shit.

1395
01:26:22,131 --> 01:26:25,250
We were talking sports, the bartender
was cool, you know, we, everything,

1396
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:26,360
everything was going great.

1397
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:30,770
So with chill and out and all
of a sudden this fucking, uh,

1398
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,770
the other fucking stripper girl
shows up out and was so fucking,

1399
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:40,400
it was just such classic female shit.
She's got a tits hanging out.

1400
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,720
She's got the fuck me pumps on
and she comes up, she goes, hey.

1401
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,770
And she sees a friend with a drink and
she knows God damn well she didn't pay

1402
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:51,230
for it. So she looks over
at me as much. It's like,

1403
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:55,220
well that must have been the
SAP who fucking bought it.
Right? So she looks at me,

1404
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:58,310
she goes, Hey Belle. And
she's like, she's like,

1405
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,900
what are you Jake can write and I
know what she's doing. I'm like,

1406
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:05,810
I'm drinking one of those
Sam Adams October fests

1407
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,550
and is leaving like that nice and awkward.
Right?

1408
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,250
Cause I know what she's trying
to get a drink out of me. Right?

1409
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,940
So she doesn't know what to
do. She's like, ah, is it good?

1410
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,750
I'm like, why? Yes.

1411
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,560
Yes it is at this point
Derosa knows what's going on.

1412
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:28,250
I don't know that he knows what's going
on. So she looks at me like, okay,

1413
01:27:28,251 --> 01:27:31,370
well evidently he's not buying any
more drinks. And then she looks at Jo,

1414
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:35,360
she's like, ah, hey Joe, what do you it?

1415
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:40,220
And Joe gets his shit eating
grin on his face. He goes, why?

1416
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:43,880
I'm drinking a bud light.
Why would you like to buy me one?

1417
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:49,460
And she didn't know what the fuck to
do. She's like, ah, I, yeah, I guess.

1418
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,510
He goes,
you know what?

1419
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,170
I think you should buy me a bud light
and you should buy my good friend bill

1420
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:57,350
burr here, another October fest.
What do you think about that?

1421
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:02,180
And at that point I'm fucking
dying laughing. The other
stripper girl next to me,

1422
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:04,490
she's laughing her ass off
cause she knows what happened.

1423
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,370
And then the fucking girl with this
screechy voice is sitting there.

1424
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:10,970
She doesn't know what the fuck to
do. We fucking nailed it. And then,

1425
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,750
and then like she's going, she didn't know
what to do. And Joe's just going, yes,

1426
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:19,810
why don't you pay it forward for all the
drinks that guys have boughten you and

1427
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:23,450
that you've drank. And then immediately
turned around and fucking walked away.

1428
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:28,100
Why don't you for once by a Goddamn by
a couple of drinks for a couple of guys

1429
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,670
and she's at high and you put
it that way. Fine. I, well I,

1430
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:35,690
well I'm by effecting Janke and
Joe's like, how bout some shots too?

1431
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,310
And she just was, I don't know what
her fucking ego is that she goes,

1432
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:41,690
final fucking do that too.

1433
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:45,170
So we actually got a stripper to
buy us two beers and two shots.

1434
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:47,240
So we're filling like
the kings of the world.

1435
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:51,590
And then all of a sudden we found out
from this waitress that on the sly she

1436
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:55,430
tried to put it on a boyfriends fucking
credit card. What a scumbag. Right?

1437
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:58,100
So we bused her and we all we,

1438
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:02,100
and when this big commotion breaks
out right before the fucking bar,

1439
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:05,490
chances are about ready to swipe the
boyfriend's credit card. We were like,

1440
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:09,510
don't chill. Joette I just like
an officer and a gentlemen.

1441
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:12,480
I got nowhere else to go.
Right.

1442
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,770
We get them to stop and they take out
her ATM and she had to fucking pay for it

1443
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,830
and it was a done deal.
We had two drinks,

1444
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:24,090
two shots from that fucking person who
you know is never paid for a drink since

1445
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:27,390
she got her fucking tits. Right.
And this was the best part.

1446
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,800
The second we got our drinks,

1447
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:31,890
we said thanks a lot and we
both got up and we walked away.

1448
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:38,430
Oh, it's tremendous. Tremendous.

1449
01:29:38,431 --> 01:29:41,610
It was the best night ever and I'm
just standing there drinking my drink.

1450
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:44,280
Like 20 minutes later I'm
milking it for all it's worth.

1451
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:47,850
This free fucking beer that a
stripper bought me was awesome.

1452
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:51,270
Brian and Joe was talking to some girl
across the way and he looked at it and

1453
01:29:51,271 --> 01:29:55,140
all of a sudden I just yelled over, I go,
Joe. And he looks over at me and I did,

1454
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:59,040
I did the Robert Deniro line from
when he was eating at Joe Peci,

1455
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:03,450
his mom right before they hacked up Billy
batts. Right. He looks up and he's like,

1456
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:05,050
what's up?
And I just pointed at the beer,

1457
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:08,310
the stripper at bought and I
just went delicious. Delicious.

1458
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:13,260
And that was my evening. And then at
that, there's another story for you.

1459
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:17,100
Would it be 35 minutes? Then you got any
more stories? As a matter of fact, I do.

1460
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,190
What else did I do this
fucking weekend? Oh, I know.

1461
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:24,090
I took a trip to the cotton bowl.
What is the cotton bowl bill? Well,

1462
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:25,980
cotton bowl is a stadium
that's been around,

1463
01:30:25,981 --> 01:30:29,340
I believe since the twenties and it's
the first place that the Dallas cowboys

1464
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:33,150
played in and the Dallas Texans
in the old AFL. And God dammit,

1465
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:37,590
I found out it's still existed. So I
wanted to go fucking take a look at it.

1466
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:41,550
So I went down there and lo and behold,
they were having their say Texas there.

1467
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:43,830
Dallas,
Texas state motherfuck unfair

1468
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,080
that they have every God damn year.
I got a new text message, I here,

1469
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:53,160
my little 16 year old phone,
call me when you wake up.

1470
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,360
I want to please you asshole. Um, anyways,

1471
01:30:58,230 --> 01:31:02,320
so I go to take a tour of this thing
means the first place Tom Landry coach,

1472
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,950
you know, the first season
of the Dallas cowboys, right?

1473
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:09,690
The Dallas Cowboys team that I love,
which was basically the Tom Landry years.

1474
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:15,140
And I never got into the Jimmy Johnson
ones because watching Tom Landry leave,

1475
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,780
I mean, it was like watching
Johnny Carson go, you know,

1476
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,190
no disrespect to the next people.
It's just, it's just not Johnny.

1477
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:27,660
It's not Tom Landry. You know what I'm
saying? So, uh, I never got into them.

1478
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:30,720
So like this, you know, it was a big
deal to go check this out. So I go to,

1479
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:34,920
you know, go to this tour and it was the
worst fucking tour ever took in my life.

1480
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:37,800
It wasn't bad. It was an awesome
tour, but just the lady was cute,

1481
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:42,080
but she just didn't fucking know anything
about the stadium. She goes, uh, oil,

1482
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:45,300
you can see on either side.
They added some thethe.

1483
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:49,260
They added thethe all the shiny
silver ones though than the new ones.

1484
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:52,440
And I was like, how many, how many people?
That place is fucking huge. You go home,

1485
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:53,940
people does this place hold.
She's like,

1486
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:59,330
I think like 20 3020 3009 all you
guys aren't sports the way I am.

1487
01:32:00,101 --> 01:32:02,200
23,000 is like a little hockey arena.

1488
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:03,170
Okay.

1489
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:06,080
You know you have a hockey game.
You sell at a hockey game.

1490
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:11,440
23,000 this is where fucking Texas
longhorns in the fucking Oklahoma sooners

1491
01:32:11,661 --> 01:32:12,560
play.
All right.

1492
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,680
College stadiums do not hold 23,000
at the Division One fucking level,

1493
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,730
especially Texas, Oklahoma. You
know what I mean? So I'm like, ah.

1494
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:24,950
I think it's a little more,
I guess like 45,000 I didn't fucking know.

1495
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:26,720
And she looks, and she goes, yeah,

1496
01:32:26,721 --> 01:32:30,140
I think it's 23,000 and then she looked
at it a little pamphlets. She goes, Oh,

1497
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:31,940
I'm sorry,
it's 97,000

1498
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:39,680
and I got to tell you right now, right
there, the stadium tour is fucking over.

1499
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:40,543
It's over.

1500
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,870
I don't want to hear another word from
you because that is the first point.

1501
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:48,740
If you're doing a tour of a stadium,
like if you want the family feud.

1502
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:49,760
Yeah.

1503
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,400
And the, and the, and the queue.
The first question was, you know,

1504
01:32:52,401 --> 01:32:55,190
you're standing there with one arm
behind your back so you can't cheat.

1505
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,830
I don't understand why you have to
do that on the family feud. Right?

1506
01:32:58,010 --> 01:32:59,510
Like what if you lunch with two hands,

1507
01:32:59,511 --> 01:33:03,790
you're quicker diving in
like fucking Pete rose. Um,

1508
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,750
anyways, if the, if the
question was, um, you know, you
taking a tour of the stadium,

1509
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:12,110
what's the first question you're going
ask? And you fucking slam your hand down.

1510
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,980
The first thing you would say is how
many people does this stadium hold?

1511
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:20,840
How many people does this stadium home?
Fucking number one answer.

1512
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:21,703
That's what it would be.

1513
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:25,460
That's just check acted like I asked
her what the fuck and consistency of the

1514
01:33:25,461 --> 01:33:28,760
concrete was for the of the stadium.
She had no fucking idea.

1515
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,220
Okay.

1516
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,320
And then she tried to say that,
that,

1517
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:33,190
okay,

1518
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:37,180
back in the day, the cotton
bowl, the cotton bowl.

1519
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:37,900
Okay.

1520
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:42,900
B O w l like a cereal bowl
was open ended on both sides.

1521
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,020
Think about that for a second.
A stadium that's called the,

1522
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:52,020
you ever seen the Rose Bowl? The rose
bowl is an open on any either side, is it?

1523
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:53,970
No,
it's shaped like a fucking bowl.

1524
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:58,590
She tried to say that the cotton bowl was
open on both ends for a while and just

1525
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,720
in 2002 they closed it off.

1526
01:34:00,721 --> 01:34:04,260
What they actually did was they put an
upper deck and as far as I could tell,

1527
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,930
they knocked down the end zone,
lower level. And they just,

1528
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,450
they rebuilt that and
they put an upper deck.

1529
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:14,040
But she was trying to say that it was
open ended until 2002 and in my head I'm

1530
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:15,510
going,
I don't think that that's right.

1531
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:16,530
Okay.

1532
01:34:16,530 --> 01:34:17,850
I don't think that that's right either.

1533
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:20,340
And then we went into the
media room and Lo and behold,

1534
01:34:20,341 --> 01:34:23,700
they have a picture of the
cotton bowl in 1958 and closed.

1535
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,760
You know, I, you know, and
I, it just, I don't know,

1536
01:34:28,761 --> 01:34:30,980
but we've got to go down staying
right down near the field.

1537
01:34:30,981 --> 01:34:34,610
Come right down where all the
players came out and uh, you know,

1538
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:40,440
it was awesome. It Len Dawson Hanks,
dram, Bob Lilly, chuck Howley,

1539
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,790
you know all that shit right up till now.
All the modern day players,

1540
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:48,320
Ricky Williams played there.
Who else played on the Longhorn?

1541
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:51,990
So many fucking guys, that
guy, Vince young, all those
fucking dudes. I don't know.

1542
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:56,370
Billy Sims, Earl Campbell, you
know, it was a fucking great time.

1543
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,440
Then I walked of there and they,
and I went to,

1544
01:34:58,450 --> 01:35:01,910
I walked around the little state
fair isn't a little state fair.

1545
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:04,400
It's actually a big state
fair that they have. And uh,

1546
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:06,980
evidently down here in
Texas what they do is,

1547
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,790
and you people overseas who hate on
Americans are going to love this shit.

1548
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:12,200
It's just this classic here.

1549
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:17,590
What they do down here in Texas is every
year they fry some, every year with fry,

1550
01:35:17,591 --> 01:35:21,610
something different.
Last year was Oreos.

1551
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,380
Year before that it was Twinkies.

1552
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:27,550
We Fried Coq one year fried pizza.
I'm not even lying.

1553
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,990
They fried all of this shit.

1554
01:35:28,991 --> 01:35:32,050
Somebody told me they fried Coca
Cola and I had the fuck you do that.

1555
01:35:32,051 --> 01:35:35,950
But they said they did it. I don't know
how to do it. What do you freeze the coke,

1556
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:41,650
Huh? And it fucking roll around in some
fly. I don't. I have no fucking idea,

1557
01:35:41,651 --> 01:35:42,484
but all I know.
You know what?

1558
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:47,110
Evidently they're out of fucking ideas
because this year, you know what?

1559
01:35:47,111 --> 01:35:49,660
They were frying.
They were frying butter.

1560
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:52,983
I swear to God,

1561
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:58,090
they were selling fried
fucking butter and I'm like,

1562
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:03,430
that is the most disgusting fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1563
01:36:03,431 --> 01:36:06,460
God dammit. I have to
try it. I got to try it.

1564
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:12,030
I have to see what it is like I
made a little fucking youtube video.

1565
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:13,930
Actually,
I got to have the kid I was with.

1566
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:15,300
Okay.

1567
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:20,100
Made a little video of me
trying that little law delicacy,

1568
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:21,780
that little Texas delicacy.
Dude,

1569
01:36:21,781 --> 01:36:24,840
it was the most disgusting fucking thing
I ever had. I've asked. The Guy said,

1570
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:25,410
all right,

1571
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:28,200
well first thing I wanted to do was get
the fried Oreo because evidently that

1572
01:36:28,201 --> 01:36:30,240
was a big hit.
That kind of made sense to me.

1573
01:36:30,241 --> 01:36:34,140
Fried Oreo is fucked up is that is
I would figure because it's fried,

1574
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:35,190
it's going to be salty,

1575
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:39,120
but then he got the sugary cookie
to kind of offset the two, you know?

1576
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:40,690
Yeah.

1577
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:43,420
It's Kinda like, you know, he did
some lines in I drinking some alcohol,

1578
01:36:43,421 --> 01:36:48,100
the even yourself out. Same fucking
thing. Just in a food way. Right. So, uh,

1579
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:52,080
I went over to that one first and I go,
yeah, let me get in. The guy's like, hi,

1580
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:55,690
don't, I'm like, yeah, let me get one
of those fried Oreos Oreo cookies.

1581
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,150
And he goes, ah, ah, I'm sorry. We can't,

1582
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:01,850
we can't cook yet until the
health inspector comes up and uh,

1583
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,180
and gives us the,
okay.

1584
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:07,960
The Hiltons Elton Health Inspector
has to inspect our booth first.

1585
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,340
So my next logical question was like,
well, how do you think you're going to do,

1586
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:17,530
I know I walked into a restaurant,
like, hang on a second,

1587
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:18,530
I'd love to have you give it sounds.

1588
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:22,000
So let's just have the health inspector
go through first. Let's just see a,

1589
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:25,090
we have an acceptable amount
of roaches. So I said, fuck it.

1590
01:37:25,091 --> 01:37:28,510
And I went straight to the fried butter
and evidently they had already been

1591
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:32,530
inspected. And I said, all right. He
goes, well, how can I help you? I go,

1592
01:37:32,531 --> 01:37:35,320
I got to get some of that fried
butter. And the guy goes, all right,

1593
01:37:35,321 --> 01:37:38,960
what do you want? You want original? You
want something else to something else?

1594
01:37:38,961 --> 01:37:42,910
And I go, let me get the original. And
he goes, all right. And he goes, uh,

1595
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,290
uh, well, he, yes, he said,
the your choice of toppings.

1596
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:50,740
I forget what the fuck they were,
but I went with the Welch's grape jelly.

1597
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,050
I know this is disgusting.

1598
01:37:53,051 --> 01:37:55,830
You know what's funny is probably as
somebody working on a treadmill right now,

1599
01:37:55,831 --> 01:37:56,190
listening

1600
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,490
to this feeling a lot better about
themselves. So they basically,

1601
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:03,120
they look like these little,
you Dunkin Munchkins a doughnut holes.

1602
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:08,040
That's what it looked like.
And then there was like the grape jelly.

1603
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:13,980
There was, there was the, uh, the grape
jelly, sorry, my phone keeps ringing.

1604
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:18,640
Um, so I dip it in the grape jelly
and I took a bite out of it. And Dude,

1605
01:38:18,641 --> 01:38:22,590
it was the most disgusting fucking
thing I've ever tasted in my life.

1606
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:24,720
It tasted like a flavor list doughnut.

1607
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:30,290
And then you know that awful gum that
has this squirting inside that was like

1608
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:35,130
the inside, except it was butter. It
was just a little nugget of like butter.

1609
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,190
It was fucking gross and
it was so disgusting.

1610
01:38:38,191 --> 01:38:40,640
I had to have another
one because you know one,

1611
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:43,110
you know one for each ventricle
or ventral cause you got,

1612
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:46,860
if you've got more than two,
maybe that's why I'm still fucking living.

1613
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:49,330
I don't know what,
but I had another one just to be like his,

1614
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:53,220
was it that bad and a yes it was.
It was a,

1615
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:54,920
yeah,

1616
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,540
it was wrong. It was just,
that's all I can say.

1617
01:38:56,541 --> 01:38:59,540
I was just fucking wrong and
should not be done. And uh,

1618
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:03,560
yeah,
I'm just gonna leave it dad.

1619
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:07,350
I think I'm gonna end the podcast right
here cause I'm out of stories and a

1620
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:10,940
Jesus Christ, my fucking phone wants
to, I got it. I have a voicemail.

1621
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:15,260
I'm going to New York next week
and I'm going to get my blackberry,

1622
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,670
but I get a new blackberry again.

1623
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:19,340
I didn't get one out in la
cause if you do it down in La,

1624
01:39:19,341 --> 01:39:21,260
they can't give you a New York number.
You know,

1625
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,020
and I want to keep that number just
because at this point I've had the number

1626
01:39:24,021 --> 01:39:28,190
forever. You know, I don't want to
have to call fucking 9,000 people.

1627
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,790
I don't know. I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. All right.

1628
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:34,820
This has been the Monday morning podcast.
I Apologize I didn't have any,

1629
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:36,610
I didn't have any questions this week.
Did I?

1630
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,330
I don't have anything cause I couldn't
get to my email. I had a couple,

1631
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:45,010
this is September 24th.
Um,

1632
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,330
all right, I'm going to read one here. Um,

1633
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:53,430
this is actually a commenting on rugby
and women. All right, here we go.

1634
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:57,560
Gala Bill. After hearing your show
this week regarding rugby, um,

1635
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:01,580
where you asked whether or not any
rugby player has played in the NFL,

1636
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:05,150
I decided to do some research on
the subject. Uh, what I found out,

1637
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:07,403
mmm.

1638
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:10,960
That there've been several rugby players
who've crossed over to play in the NFL.

1639
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:13,960
Many of their names won't ring a bell
because it appears they are all kickers

1640
01:40:13,961 --> 01:40:18,430
and punters. The two names that came
up the most often were Ben Graham,

1641
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:23,460
a kicker who I think played for the jets
and Mick Luckhurst was also a kicker

1642
01:40:24,341 --> 01:40:27,250
who played for the
Falcons from 1981 to 1987.

1643
01:40:27,251 --> 01:40:31,120
What I found funny was that the rugby
guys who attempted to try out for other

1644
01:40:31,121 --> 01:40:35,830
positions such as linebacker or running
back or often considered too small,

1645
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:41,040
too slow or too weak to do damage on
the field against a much larger NFL

1646
01:40:41,051 --> 01:40:42,980
players.
Um,

1647
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,240
now I know a lot of people in England
are going to flip out about that shit.

1648
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:50,860
Well, you know what? They say that all
the time that American football players,

1649
01:40:50,861 --> 01:40:54,160
they're a bunch of pussies because they
wear helmets, all that type of shit.

1650
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,120
Well,
I got news for you.

1651
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:59,580
There's a great article in Gq
magazine that I actually read.

1652
01:40:59,610 --> 01:41:02,520
I never read Gq because a,

1653
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:07,530
it's kind of like the male cosmo where
you just open it up and there's a ton of

1654
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:10,870
articles.
Not Articles is a ton of advertising.

1655
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:15,130
You can't find where the fucking
articles are and it smells like Cologne.

1656
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,850
I swear to God it does. It's really
a fucking, it's a really, uh,

1657
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:24,940
it's awful magazine. But I
gotta tell you this, there was,

1658
01:41:24,941 --> 01:41:27,280
there's a woman on the
cover of this magazine,

1659
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:31,780
Olivia Wilde might be the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen in my life.

1660
01:41:31,781 --> 01:41:35,110
She's just ridiculous. And I was like,
I have to read this article about this,

1661
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,880
this,
this female.

1662
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:41,110
And it turned out there was an article
in there about concussions and about

1663
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:44,770
football players going crazy
and killing themselves.

1664
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:49,300
Professional football players.
And they were talking about Mike Webster,

1665
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:54,020
the center for a, the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It's an unbelievable article. It's a uh,

1666
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,810
Olivia Wilde is on the cover.

1667
01:41:56,470 --> 01:42:00,100
And basically they were saying the helmets
cause that's the number one thing I

1668
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:01,660
hear these English guys can say that the,

1669
01:42:01,661 --> 01:42:04,690
you know American football players of
pussy cause they were like the helmets and

1670
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:09,490
the pads. Evidently all the helmet
does is it protects the skull.

1671
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:15,370
It doesn't protect the brain cause the
brain sits in like fluid and it moves

1672
01:42:15,371 --> 01:42:19,140
around. So when you get slammed in the
side of the head and not only mention,

1673
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:22,720
they was saying the way they build these
helmets is back when they had leather

1674
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:25,540
helmets. You know back in the
days, the three stooges days,

1675
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,460
if you watch the guys play football,

1676
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:31,270
they didn't lead with their heads
because you get knocked out.

1677
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,690
But now in an effort
to protect their heads,

1678
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:38,080
they were basically saying what they've
done with these helmets is they created

1679
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:42,430
a weapon. And these football players,
especially the Lyman, every play,

1680
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:45,490
if you watch them, they just slam
into each other with their heads.

1681
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:49,720
And I have a dental. He, they're doing
unbelievable amounts of brain damage.

1682
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,510
And Mike, his brain, he basically,

1683
01:42:52,511 --> 01:42:56,800
he went crazy and he couldn't
fucking remember shit. So
they, during the autopsy,

1684
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:59,140
they removed his brain,
they sliced it in half,

1685
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:03,910
and he had lists all Simon,
I don't know that this plaque,

1686
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:06,840
I don't know what they called it,
but it was like a,

1687
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,860
they said it should have been the brain
of like an 89 or 90 year old guy in this

1688
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:14,920
guy died at 50.
So A,

1689
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:17,680
I'm not saying that rugby guys
are pussies or anything like that,

1690
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:19,240
I was just giving people shit or whatever,

1691
01:43:19,241 --> 01:43:23,410
but I'm just defending American
football players saying that, you know,

1692
01:43:23,411 --> 01:43:26,020
just cause they have that fucking
helmet on. You know what I mean?

1693
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,380
I find that really interesting like you,

1694
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:30,010
cause I used to always watch guys
were riding motorcycles and my duty.

1695
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:30,940
How do you fucking mind,

1696
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:35,320
do you realize that brain damage you're
going to get if your head slams off a

1697
01:43:35,321 --> 01:43:40,090
curb like Gary Busey did?
And uh, evidently obviously,

1698
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,400
you know, if you're wearing a helmet,
you know, you protect and you know,

1699
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:47,320
from literally putting a hole in your
head so you should wear it. But you know,

1700
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:49,300
I, it never really
dawned on me, obviously,

1701
01:43:49,301 --> 01:43:53,300
because I'm a comedian and not a fucking,
that just be,

1702
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:57,620
you can have a helmet on and your
brain can, you can have just as much,

1703
01:43:57,830 --> 01:44:00,170
I think basically just
as much brain damage.

1704
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,920
I think what you would have to have
is some sort of like hard shell in the

1705
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:08,921
middle and then like 80 feet of nerf
on the outside of our spongy fucking

1706
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:10,910
material on the outside.

1707
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,910
So we would have to start to slow
your head down before it came to the,

1708
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:20,240
to the, uh, what am I trying to
say? I think beyond a certain speed,

1709
01:44:20,241 --> 01:44:23,060
it doesn't make a difference whether
you have a fucking helmet on or not,

1710
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,570
because your brain is going to slam
against the inside of your skull.

1711
01:44:26,571 --> 01:44:30,800
So fucking hard, uh, that is not
going to matter. And they go,

1712
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:34,130
that's coming from a comedian. So, you
know, it's, it's medically accurate.

1713
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:38,200
All right, let's move on here. Um,
and once again, to those people go,

1714
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:41,210
I have no disrespect. It's rugby guys
are fucking tough sons of bitches.

1715
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:45,020
I have no, but no, no.
Uh, questions about that,

1716
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:48,290
but you really have to stop saying that
American football players are pussies

1717
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:53,240
because they have pads on
those fucking guys. You know,

1718
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:57,220
you, you wouldn't want to play rugby
against him. Put it that way. All right.

1719
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:01,670
All right, let's plow ahead here.
Alright, Bill. A use also stated some,

1720
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,290
some ways you can tell when you've
won an argument with the woman. Um,

1721
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:08,580
stuff like the crying
and when they begin to,

1722
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:12,170
to switch your words to talk about pass
topics in the middle of an argument.

1723
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:16,100
Yeah. They bring up other shit that you
did because they're losing the shit that

1724
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:19,280
you're talking about right then and there.
I guess guys do that too. But anyways,

1725
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:22,640
let's plow ahead here. He said, well,
I have a better one on my way to work.

1726
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:26,840
My wife and I were arguing over me hurting
her feelings because I came home from

1727
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:31,400
a 10 hour day at work and three and a
half hours of night school just wanting to

1728
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:36,070
go to bed. So, even though my
sexy Latin woman was an, it was a,

1729
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:39,140
was ready for some action,
I simply took a shower,

1730
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:43,970
crawled into bed next to her and went to
sleep. Needless to say, she was pissed.

1731
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,360
So this morning we were
fussing about it and she says,

1732
01:45:47,361 --> 01:45:50,600
that really hurt my feelings,
um,

1733
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:55,630
because it felt like you didn't
want me. And he said, um,

1734
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:00,860
and I don't know what, what came over me,
but instead of being an angry black man,

1735
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:04,490
I simply smiled, grabbed,
grabbed her hand, kissed it,

1736
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:09,320
and commonly said in a soft voice,
now you know how I felt last week?

1737
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,590
And she said,
absolutely nothing.

1738
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:16,550
She just stared at me like she
wanted to start the waterworks,

1739
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,410
but she couldn't get a going.

1740
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:23,270
I dropped her off at the office where
she kissed me and actually apologized.

1741
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:27,170
I smiled the entire way to work.
Wow.

1742
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:31,460
I actually thought she was going to get
mad because that was kind of harsh the

1743
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:36,350
way you said it. That's like
stand up. Applause, break.
Stand up comedy. Well now,

1744
01:46:36,351 --> 01:46:40,280
you know, I felt last week
if fucking Twat, that's how
I would have delivered it.

1745
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,770
But I guess you said it nice and calmly,
but yeah,

1746
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:44,180
you know that is kind of fucked up.

1747
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:47,360
That's one of the things that I have
found like in relationship is, you know,

1748
01:46:47,361 --> 01:46:50,250
you got to watch out because
for the most I think I would,

1749
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:53,880
I would venture to guess without
doing a survey as always,

1750
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:57,270
I would venture to guess
that 92% of relationships,

1751
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:01,440
women control the sex because guys
will do it basically whenever.

1752
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:05,220
I really sound like a hacky comedian
guys, we don't give him a shit, woo woo,

1753
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:08,670
but it's seriously and then
women kind of use it as a uh,

1754
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,020
they start using. Yeah, he's still
a bit about that as a reward.

1755
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:17,160
You took out the trash here at good boy
and you get like a hand job. You know,

1756
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:21,590
you can't do that if you really
want to equalize, you know,

1757
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:24,530
the whole sex in your relationship.
You why you got to,

1758
01:47:24,531 --> 01:47:26,820
you got to continue to rub
one out every once in a while.

1759
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,390
So that way you know if they don't
want to have sex then you're like,

1760
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:33,540
alright that's cool. You
know, and then she, I keep it,

1761
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:35,490
keep it on any then you create no war

1762
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,540
cause I would say then what you do is
next time they want to have it then you

1763
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:40,470
act like you don't have it.

1764
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:43,020
That's not the way to go about doing
it because then you start playing games

1765
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:47,430
with each other. What you probably
should say is a, I don't know,

1766
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:50,340
just basically what I've said the
woman which is, Oh yeah, bell,

1767
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:52,980
we should say exactly what you said cause
you have your fucking life figured out.

1768
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:56,640
Your fucking single 40 year olds
psychopath. Yeah. Once again,

1769
01:47:56,641 --> 01:47:58,680
I want to say don't ever
listen to what I say on here.

1770
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:02,160
You know I am not a trained person and
I'm worried at some point someone's going

1771
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:03,030
to take my advice,

1772
01:48:03,031 --> 01:48:05,160
they're going to get punched in
the face and I'm going to get sued.

1773
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:08,010
So you've got to understand that you're
talking to a comedian here who's may be

1774
01:48:08,011 --> 01:48:09,480
read three books in his life.

1775
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:13,670
Two of them had pictures on every
other page. All right. That's,

1776
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:17,340
that's what you're dealing with
here. Now way she, I'm telling you,

1777
01:48:17,341 --> 01:48:21,390
the big thing with women is, if you
want to get your way, is not to get mad,

1778
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:23,520
not to play a fucking game with them.

1779
01:48:23,521 --> 01:48:28,200
You just have to tell them
how what they're doing is
making you feel they can't

1780
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:31,940
get around it. If you have a legitimate
complaint, you know, let me, if you,

1781
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:33,480
I got something ridiculous like,
Hey,

1782
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,700
I want to put it in your
ass and you won't let me.

1783
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:39,090
It's really making me feel like
you don't trust me. I mean, that's,

1784
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:48,540
I think you're going to lose
that one. All right. But um,

1785
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:54,120
oh Jesus, I'm sorry to get back on
track here. If you fucking, you know,

1786
01:48:54,121 --> 01:48:56,460
like some serious like that
we just like, look, you know,

1787
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,400
I feel like anytime you want to have sex,
I'm willing,

1788
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,940
but there's a lot of times I want to
have it and you don't want to have it.

1789
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:06,840
And that was so now I kind of feel like
this thing that we're allegedly sharing

1790
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:11,340
together, you, you totally control and uh,

1791
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,360
that doesn't make me happy.
Thoughts,

1792
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:19,560
whatever you power the fuck you said.
You said calmly without saying, fuck,

1793
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:21,630
and I'm telling you,
well, what can they do?

1794
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:27,000
They got to sit there and answer
it and I can guarantee you that'll,

1795
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:30,240
that'll work out good for you for at
least three fucking days before it slides

1796
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:33,180
back to normal again. It's a
never ending fight. All right?

1797
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:35,190
But what you gotta do is
you've got to have the fights.

1798
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:38,550
You got to have the fights and protect
your real estate. Are you going to spend,

1799
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:41,400
you're going to spend your entire
time and goal line fucking d.

1800
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:47,140
That's the worst fucking relationship
you've given up so many fucking the whole

1801
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:49,560
time.
It's fourth and goal first and Galt.

1802
01:49:49,561 --> 01:49:52,840
What am I talking about first
and fucking goal, right?

1803
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:55,720
And you just jumped off sides. So it's
half the distance to the fucking go.

1804
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:59,530
We got it built. You're in
a bad situation. All right,
that's all I'm saying. Okay,

1805
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:02,620
that's the end of the podcast. Thank
you everybody for listening. All right,

1806
01:50:02,621 --> 01:50:04,550
here's what I got coming up.
Um,

1807
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:06,760
I'm going to be at the stress
factory in New Brunswick,

1808
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:11,470
New Jersey coming up this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. Well,

1809
01:50:11,471 --> 01:50:12,700
what are the dates, bill? Well,

1810
01:50:12,701 --> 01:50:14,680
why don't you hold on a second
and I'll get them for you.

1811
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:19,270
God knows I can't go on the fucking
Internet. Um, that's going to be a Friday.

1812
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:24,790
Um, October 2nd. Oh my God.
