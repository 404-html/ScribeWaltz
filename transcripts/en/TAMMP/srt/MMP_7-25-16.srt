00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,090
Hey,

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,870
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for my, Yay. Monday,

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:11,370
July 25th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,290
How? What's going on? Um,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,530
the final Monday in July
of 2016 and a old freckles.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,130
All Billy red beard. Oh,

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,590
Fucking trying to get the weight off
cam trying to get the weight off,

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:31,170
working out during the day, eating
grade, having a beer at night,

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,830
fucking losing everything that he
worked for. It's fucking ridiculous.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,640
It's ridiculous what one beer
does. And I just, I got to do it.

11
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,430
I got a bunch of beers leftover
from the fucking 4th of July.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,090
They're taking up all this space in my
fridge and I'm not going to throw him out.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,960
Okay.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,460
I mean there's, there's children that work
in the Budweiser factory that fucking,

15
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:55,860
you know,
they sleep on piles of Hay,

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,240
right? They pay him 29 cents
a month. I don't know if
that's true. Maybe it's hops.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,540
I don't know what they sleep on now.
There's no people. There's no children.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,960
There's no children working at
Budweiser. That's but paid. Man.

19
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,110
It wouldn't invest in Budweiser.
There was children there.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,790
I'm just going to go give me a couple
birdwatcher we had protection issue.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,290
Um, my wife's on steroids. What Marie?

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,370
She blew out her shoulder.
Mike [inaudible].

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,440
Shoshi she human growth hormone. Bradshaw.
I'm going to say about that before.

24
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,750
Put my balls on somebodies head.
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,090
I believe in anonymous. In a great mood.
Um, yeah, so I've got these fucking,

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,160
I got all these bears in my fridge.
What am I gonna what am I,

27
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,130
what the fuck am I supposed to do with
them? I can't throw them out again.

28
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,210
Boddington's I got some millis
so I just have like one a night,

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,100
right? And then I have a home pour of
fucking whiskey. That's all she wrote.

30
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,970
It's all she wrote.
I barely even get buzzed off of that too.

31
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:58,190
When I wake up the next day
and I just feel like shit,

32
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:02,060
I don't know why I keep doing it.
It's a habit I have to break. I am a,

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,700
I am a one and a half drink alcoholic.

34
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,420
I have to have one and a half drinks
and get a little buzzed every night.

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,670
I want to go to a fucking AA meeting and
say like, that's my problem. You know,

36
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:18,080
I'll never forget when I started
going off the rails when I, uh, yeah,

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,040
I would have,

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,040
I'd have one on Miller lite tall in a
can and then I'd have a home poor of a

39
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,490
whiskey and a,
of course after I finished that,

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,520
I would just stop and I'd go to sleep
and the next day I'd wake up and I'd be

41
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,970
totally functional and I'd
go to work, but I, you know,

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,270
I definitely be a little grouchy
and now that's my story.

43
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:45,940
Yeah.

44
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,430
Okay.
Thank you for sharing.

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,100
Next guy comes up.

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,360
Well go rape me with the 12 pack,
but I was fine.

47
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,100
Right? They'd throw me out of
there. They'd be walking up,

48
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,270
put down him donuts. I don't know why they
all have southern accents in my world.

49
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,890
Everyone in Aa is from the south.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,070
You know why they never got over the war.
This still fighting it down there.

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,800
South's going to rise again and do what?

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
You're going to secede from the union.

53
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,700
You're going to get old stonewall
Jackson, junior, junior, junior

54
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,140
to come back and take over for you.
Yeah. You know what I say to that?

55
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:30,310
I said good luck. Die. Say
Good fucking, you know, do it.

56
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,941
Just know this.

57
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:35,830
She can't have Florida and if you
can't have Florida and you can't go to

58
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,260
California,
where are you going to take your kids?

59
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,693
Huh?

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,973
When they say,

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,970
you know when they did fucking sitting
there watching your confederate TV,

62
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,203
right?

63
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,350
And it's a small world comes on,

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,800
which is even more apropos over the fuck
you say it because you just like nine

65
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,180
fucking states down there
whenever the hell you are. Right.

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,600
It's a small world after all.
And they're like, you want want,

67
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,590
what do they call father's
down in? Uh, what are the,

68
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,320
what do they call been at Old Gym Dad.
I want to go to Disney world.

69
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,500
You can't cause you
seceded from the union.

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,020
You can't go to Disney land and
you can't go to his fucking world.

71
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,020
You know what?
You can go Talladega.

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,790
You can go see the Winston Cup series.
How'd they get a water slide out there?

73
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,860
I don't think they do.
They've got,

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,470
have a bunch of adults skipping around
and fucking outfit said scare children.

75
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,850
They do not. So let me tell you
something fucking there. Mason diction.

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,210
Yeah.

77
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,730
Mason and Dixon.
Why don't you think twice?

78
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,450
Think about everything you're going to
lose out on a few seceded from the union.

79
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,160
Huh? No more Disneyland.
No more Disney world

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,650
sea world's down there.

81
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,470
You don't get to see those fucking
fish that don't want to be there. Yeah,

82
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,950
I love people think like fish. Like don't
give a fuck that they were in the tank,

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,713
you know?

84
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,110
Just because they don't have an ability
to speak to us that therefore that means

85
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,770
they have defined fine with it.

86
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,090
We treat fish like immigrants. You know
the fish is fucking looking at you.

87
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,440
You just like English.
You got a problem with that.

88
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,680
Takes it out.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,920
Okay.

90
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,820
Fucking sit there staring at me.
But yeah,

91
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:32,540
I was on the side of your fucking
scaly head. Be happy I didn't eat you.

92
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,200
You look at me one more time.
I'll cut your fucking head off.

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll above roll you into some flour
with an egg wash and our deep fry.

94
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:44,660
You mother fucker and I'll
make your friends watch.

95
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,543
Okay.

96
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,510
Sit there and fucking stare at me like
I work for you. I don't work for you.

97
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,870
Who here is in a tank?
That's right. I didn't,

98
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,490
so I didn't think so.
Um,

99
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,920
anyways, um, Bill, why you show off
the fucking walls today? You know why?

100
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,810
Because I,
I,

101
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:13,610
we wrapped at least the script writing
part of season two of f is for family,

102
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,611
which means I get to go back to being a
fucking 14 year old who has no fucking

103
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,240
job, no responsibilities, no nothing,

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,200
just a bunch of beers in my fridge
that I'm slowly going to kill.

105
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,190
I do the elliptical in the morning and
then I give it all back with a can of

106
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:36,140
beer and that's what I do right?
While I fucking wear out my joints.

107
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,570
That's all I'm really doing right
now. I'm just maintaining. Um,

108
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,680
isn't that what a lot of people in this
digital age you're just trying to do?

109
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,870
Aren't they just trying to maintain,

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,400
just trying to keep their heads above
water and this time of change and robots?

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,640
Um, if they'd fucking this
election, has that happened yet?

112
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Jesus fucking, he can't go near
the Goddamn TV. Everybody's
so fucking scared. Ooh.

113
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,750
It's going to happen.

114
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,160
Nothing is going to continue
on the way it's supposed to go.

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,810
And whether the fucking comb over
or the clam gets in the house,

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,260
it's going to go in the direction
that the money wants it to go into.

117
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,160
And if it doesn't, okay,
they're going to Dallas,

118
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,670
right.
And then not going to be in a 10.

119
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,480
They're going to fucking roll out that
63 fucking stretched Lincoln convertible.

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,660
That's right. They're going to
get the old right there. Fred,

121
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,640
to their fucking Jesus Christ, the
two of them. You know what I mean?

122
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,280
Their heads. You know what?
If I was in secret service,

123
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,960
there would be a head size that
you could not be above, you know,

124
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,620
or, or else the president would have
to sign a waiver. Just like, you know,

125
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:59,450
both of them, Hillary and
fucking and Trump, they have,

126
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,380
they have like,

127
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,520
like if you could make sliders
out of Ted Kennedy's head,

128
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,380
that's what the fuck they have. That is
the most amazing thing about Ted Kennedy.

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
He had the biggest fucking
head out of all of them and he,

130
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,860
nobody ever took them out.
You know,

131
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,380
you would think that that
fucking guy out of all of them,

132
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,510
they all had big
squashes, right? You know,

133
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,620
it's all good looking men dough,
right? You got to have a big head,

134
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,210
big stupid head with the squared jaw
that look in your eye like everything's

135
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,450
gonna be okay. The kind of
thing that make women go, oh,

136
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,240
he can pay for all my stuff.
Right.

137
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,950
One of those heads, well, what's his face?

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,550
Ted Kennedy was ahead of his
time, no pun intended, right?

139
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,570
If you want to know how fat
people were going to get,

140
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,790
if you want to know how big
sodas were going to get,

141
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,860
if you want to know how
fucking ridiculous, you know,

142
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,450
mcmansions and all this shit and all this
stuff that we were going to by the age

143
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,780
of consumerism, right? If you will,
back in the 1950s trying to guess,

144
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,640
you had a wage of which
way is it going to go?

145
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,700
Are we going to go back to living
on dirt floors and log cabins?

146
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,230
Are we going to have kegerators in
fucking chocolate fountains in our houses?

147
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,100
All you had to do was look at Ted
Kennedy said it'd be like, there it is.

148
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,290
That right there.
That's an omen.

149
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,400
You know the interesting thing
about Ted Kennedy's head, uh,

150
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,140
it was in his entire time he was alive.
It was never backlit ever.

151
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,640
People try, they just was
never enough light. You know,

152
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,910
there's not even a picture of him
like blocking out the fucking,

153
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,460
like not even the sun could
reach around either side.

154
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,930
It just became night when
you walked outside. Hey,

155
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm saying he had a big head. You
know, um, I've got a big head.

156
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,430
Okay.

157
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,930
I gotta pick head. I do
literally and figuratively.

158
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,401
I got a giant head.

159
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:58,450
I got a fucking ego and a half
because I got the whole week off.

160
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,800
And what am I going to do?

161
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:03,430
I'm going to rest up getting
ready for my European tour,

162
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,360
like the red fucking
headed whore than I am.

163
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,780
And I'm going to fucking Tuesday night
I'm going to be at the Steve Allen

164
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,890
Theater on Hollywood Boulevard,
the boulevard of dreams.

165
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,040
Um, I'm going to be there and, uh,

166
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,870
just basically saying my shit.
So,

167
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,720
you know, I just wait. All you need to
do is just fucking say it a few times,

168
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:31,750
right? Just moderate to myself. Walk
around the block, talked to myself,

169
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:36,130
hands in my pocket, vigorously scratching
the side of my ball sack. Right.

170
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,110
Having the cops come by, having them
pull over, asking me what I'm doing.

171
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:44,780
Do I live around here?
Are you a vagrant? Um,

172
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,050
sorry. Did you guys see Rudy
Giuliani speech about the policemen?

173
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,730
That was one of the funniest fucking
things I've ever seen in my life.

174
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:55,020
The way he was trying to get that crowd
going. You know they come to your house,

175
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,243
right?

176
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,410
All right.
I wanted him to keep going.

177
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,683
You know,

178
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,070
he just basically distraught
describe police officers' jobs,

179
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:13,000
but I wanted him to keep
going and I wanted him to,

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,820
to portray how wealthy he is and,

181
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,960
and the influential friends that
he has, you know, they come to you,

182
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,200
they say you're under arrest, but you
have your lawyer made up in the driveway.

183
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,640
And I say, Ronelle turn himself. The

184
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,820
charges go away.

185
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,890
I wanted it. I wanted them to go that
far because here's the deal. You know,

186
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,200
the way the police had been paid
right now it's fucking ridiculous.

187
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:50,900
It's the same way, you
know, if one comic sucks,

188
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:54,250
then every fucking comic out there
has a lampshade on the fucking head.

189
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,270
You know what I mean?

190
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,360
There's definitely some terrible
people that are police officers,

191
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,340
but that doesn't mean that they're
all bad. Okay. Now, Rudy Giuliani,

192
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,460
you can't fucking stand there where you
exist in society with your skin color.

193
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,630
And think that you can accurately
describe police officers. You know,

194
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,370
and you need somebody a
little more mid range.

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,360
Well maybe it's good that he said that.
Okay, now we've got the high end, right.

196
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,670
Black people fucking said their rent
and then you just need somebody in the

197
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:28,320
middle. Now. He still can't do it. You
still can't do it because of racism.

198
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,200
You've got to try to balance the whole
fucking thing out. Um, I don't know.

199
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,410
Who knows? So yeah, you'd think,
you know, it'd be great with the,

200
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,560
with the fucking cell phone cameras
and then the cops filling themselves.

201
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:42,910
What would be great is if
somebody fucked up as a cop,

202
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,410
if they actually got fired,

203
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,950
if they actually fucking were
punished and went to jail,

204
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,100
they actually murdered somebody. Not like,
you know, one or two or three people.

205
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:54,730
If they actually just started
doing that. I Dunno. I don't know.

206
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:57,100
I don't know if there's any fucking
solution to it. You know what I mean?

207
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,910
It's a hell of a fucking job to have.
Well,

208
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,240
you got to walk up to a fucking car not
knowing if you're going to get shot or

209
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,150
not. That would make me a little
edgy. You know what I mean?

210
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,840
And I think a lot of cons can sit in
their fucking led living room Perth when

211
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,240
they're perfectly safe, being like,
oh, you know what I wouldn't do?

212
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,970
This is what I would've done.
Right?

213
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,870
Like when you watch your
fucking quarterback throws
an interception and then you

214
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,710
say, I would have dumped it off to
the tight end. Oh, is that what he is?

215
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,540
That's what you would've done on
your fucking couch. [inaudible]

216
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,640
I think it's an impossible job.
And I also think that's a,

217
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,670
there's an element to that job that
fucking sadistic psychopaths are attracted

218
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,990
to bouncers and all those things.

219
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:41,560
This a lot of people that just want to
beat the shit out of people that go for

220
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:44,230
that job.
Then there's other ones that go there.

221
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,480
They have their heart in the
right fucking place, you know?

222
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:49,360
But they don't really make the news.
You know what I mean?

223
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,720
It's kind of like comics.
Like every night we tell jokes,

224
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,140
nobody gets offended and then one cut
gets fucking offended and then all of us.

225
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,200
Is that what it's like bill?
Somebody getting unarmed,

226
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,440
somebody unarmed getting murdered is
like somebody getting in trouble for

227
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:07,150
Caitlyn Jenner joke. Gi Bill. Thanks for
fucking explaining that one. Oh fuck you.

228
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:11,200
It's my podcast. Okay.
I choose not to read.

229
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,970
I choose not to be informed.
That's my choice. Okay.

230
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,710
I'm like one of those feminists,

231
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,330
you know and they fucking start
yelling about that though.

232
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,840
Tell me what they do in my body.
All right.

233
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,710
Don't tell me what to do with my podcast.
All right.

234
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,470
No more podcast shaming.

235
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,300
Oh Shit. I had the fucking greatest
set I've had in fucking months.

236
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,820
Saturday night at the comedy
store in the main room.

237
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,120
There was this chunk of material
I've been trying to work out.

238
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:47,200
I finally said it the right
way and then I came home.

239
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,710
I was so confident of it.
I played it for my wife and even she left.

240
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,580
And that's the deal when you try
something new. This is, this is,

241
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,100
this is the litmus test and I mean,
what the fuck that means?

242
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:03,020
I don't even know if I'm saying it right.
Litmos lattice model.

243
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,213
Right.

244
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,120
Okay.

245
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,040
My fucking test is, I then play it for
the lovely Nia, and if she fucking laugh,

246
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,240
you can make your fucking wife get
behind the new shit that you're doing.

247
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,230
Then you know you're on to something.
You know? Because in general,

248
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,000
what they do when they first
meet you, they're like, oh
my God, you're amazing. Oh,

249
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,700
and they just fucking pump you up,
right? So you start going like, wow,

250
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:29,570
she's really cool, man. Right?
And then once they get you,

251
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,990
okay,

252
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,730
once you fucking in the relationship,

253
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,410
once you give him the
ring and you get married,

254
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:39,300
then they fucking just grabbed
the reins and Sean, whoa, Nelly.

255
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,650
Wow. Right. They start
yanking the fuck back.

256
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,400
Not because they're jerks.
It's just out of fear.

257
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,883
Hmm.

258
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,660
He's going to do something new.
He's going to find something new.

259
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,070
He's going to find somebody new.
That's what they do. Unlike guys,

260
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,040
everybody knows that men are
totally secure with who they are.

261
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,650
I'm just doing this right now for any
guy who's listening to this podcast next

262
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:11,530
to a woman just to listen to her going,
oh like God,

263
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,420
that guy is such an idiot.
Let me tell you something lady.

264
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,200
All right, and don't look at him
right now cause he's not saying this.

265
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm talking to you sweetheart, in the
background, shaking your fucking head.

266
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:29,881
It's your man who's going to die
before you let him have his left.

267
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,710
Okay? What you feel right fucking now is
what a man feels when he comes home and

268
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,670
you're walking, you're watching
those Botox squawk and fucking horse,

269
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,860
okay? Doing the recap of their
fucking season with that, eh,

270
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:48,310
Andy Cohen or whatever his name is,
that fucking genius.

271
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,280
He's like bees like the gay Byron Allen.

272
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,810
You know where they just found
a show where there was no shelf.

273
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,770
Everybody was like,

274
00:16:56,771 --> 00:17:01,440
there's no show here and the
genius of that guy to be like,

275
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:04,800
yes there is.
It's not enough.

276
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,890
Did he got a bunch of screaming hordes
yelling at each other that someone's

277
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,920
going to sit down and watch
it every fucking night.

278
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,510
The fact that he then does the recap.
It just sits there.

279
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,630
You don't have to write anything new.
They do it for you.

280
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,550
He just sits there and effortlessly
hosts the show. He's a master.

281
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,820
He just sits there already. Any yeses,
this fucking setlist like a comic.

282
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:33,990
But all it is is to get these women
yelling at each other. And he just,

283
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,920
he just,

284
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,330
just watch the brilliance of that
meant he just fucking sits there.

285
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,190
And if it's, if it's fucking simmering,
he turns up the heat, you know,

286
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,020
you know an episode for Kathy,
she,

287
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,270
she had some choice words in the warm,
that's all he has to say. Oh my God, what?

288
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:58,560
She called me a fucking cunt and then
she goes and he just fucking lays back

289
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,850
like Ali.
Right.

290
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,270
And when he was fighting George Foreman
and he just lets these women start

291
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:07,380
fucking punching each other out and they
run off set and he sits there and this

292
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:11,550
is the brilliance of this man is he sits
there and he actually has a look on his

293
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,310
face. Like he truly gives a fuck. Like,

294
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:18,390
he actually gives a shit about these
people. He's just sitting there going,

295
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,110
that's great TV,
Eh,

296
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:24,960
we go that just sold some toothpaste and
he's just fucking raking it and look at

297
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,400
the guy,
he looks like 1 million bucks.

298
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:30,270
A lot of people don't know this about
that man. He's 83 fucking years old.

299
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,150
You know,
everybody talking about Dick Clark,

300
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,700
how great he looked right
to the fucking end. Yeah.

301
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:39,900
Well close to the end that I shouldn't
have said that, but fucking, you know,

302
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,930
whatever. We all go out
like that. Right. But um,

303
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,530
he's fucking 83 a lot of people don't
know that. You'd think the guy was like,

304
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:50,910
you know, like whatever. What,
37 I have no fucking idea.

305
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,500
Does gotta be people hosting Real Shit?
That's fucking difficult going.

306
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,830
Why the fuck didn't I just do that?

307
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,123
Yeah.

308
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,200
What he is, is he's doing a
sophisticated Jerry Springer, you know,

309
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,740
everybody's sitting down, there's no
punches thrown. They scream and yell.

310
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,700
They crossed their legs.

311
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,800
This is the one thing I'll
say about the real housewives.

312
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,490
They're fucking legs are incredible.
It's fucking amazing.

313
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:18,080
Their legs are like fucking 22 year olds,
their fucking faces.

314
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,050
You know, Jesus Christ. And I got
a lot of fucking nerve saying this.

315
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:28,430
Considering the way I look,
considering the way I traveled the world,

316
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,850
looking like an albino balding
Hellboy minus the working out,

317
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,963
right?

318
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,650
I look like the thing. If it was skinny
and didn't have that skin disease,

319
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,510
you know what I mean? But yet could not
go out in the sun. That's what I am.

320
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm a middleweight thing minus whatever.
What's it made out of? Oh, come on.

321
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:54,230
Come on. Comic cons. You
know what he's made out of?

322
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:59,150
You know how he turned into that? Was
it another accident in a lab? Huh?

323
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,040
Did he come here from another planet and
then get bit by a spider and then got

324
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,360
blinded by some shit?

325
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,140
Now he's a fast aunt living
in somebody's fucking head.

326
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,150
You know,
driving a jet ski down to Middle Earth.

327
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,360
Jesus Christ.
Just when you think,

328
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,370
just when you fucking think that the
real housewives is the dumbest fucking

329
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,570
thing you're ever going to watch.

330
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:26,570
They come out with another
stupid fucking superhero movie.

331
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,520
Jesus fucking Christ.
Can somebody get the,

332
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,210
just collectively get these
nerds, some hookers, you
know, why don't they go, wait,

333
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,180
what? What did the kids go on
now? It tastes, what does that,

334
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:42,410
what does that fucking, you
know, it's one of those apps,

335
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:45,020
whatever the fuck it is,
it's not, is it Tinder?

336
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,020
One of them is like the hoary and then
the other ones like, Ooh, you know,

337
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,860
I look to Scalia to food and when
you look to hill three children,

338
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,120
you know the dose App and then you've
got the other ones. Just like, you know,

339
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,500
hey, you know, I got some bows yet.

340
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,750
Oh I got a Dana Lang.

341
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,090
I want to stick it in your
fucking fucking monkey.

342
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,570
All their whatever it is.
That's fucking amazing.

343
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,270
God blessed this generation. You know
what I mean? That's fucking great.

344
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,600
They have that, you know, it's weird.

345
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:22,480
Every year like life becomes easier.
You have to think less,

346
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,320
but it gets more expensive. It's
fucking nuts. You know what I mean?

347
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,490
Okay.

348
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,510
I can tell you right now,

349
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:32,630
if there was fucking free porn
and there was these dating sites,

350
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:35,380
you know how much easier your fucking
life would have been when you were a kid.

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,540
Just not having a fucking, Oh God, Jesus.

352
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,460
I remember having to go out
to those stupid fucking,

353
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,620
you just go on out to these fucking clubs.

354
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,690
You know I was going out there and the
fucking late eighties walking into a

355
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:54,730
nightclub, pop up, down, pop it
out, put now pow, don't talk.

356
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,980
We don't talk to top it off.
Wow. That girl is boy then

357
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,960
and everybody with their fucking
puffy as pets walking around.

358
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:06,880
We're driving gloves inside.

359
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,620
Yeah.

360
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,600
Fucking music loud as shit.
You know.

361
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,110
Now you can sit there and your fucking
underwear just scrolling through people

362
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:16,880
like you're a fucking rockstar on,

363
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,910
you know like whenever you
hear that shit like cow,

364
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:23,450
the roadies would go out and pick the
fucking women that the band was going to

365
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:25,640
fuck. And they be like, yeah,

366
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:29,730
you put your friends got to stay and
then the front can, Fran would leave.

367
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,220
She'd be like,

368
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,053
Martha.

369
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,790
Yeah. And she just fucking
walks away just for one night.

370
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,190
Yeah.

371
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,390
With to, to fuck the guy. Some
guy from deep purple, right.

372
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,110
Then years later, the two
of them mate, you know,

373
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,160
at a high school reunion and
then the fucker one that left,

374
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,780
the other one left Marcy
behind is all fucking nervous.

375
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:58,850
That Marcy's going to let her and
her now husband know that she fucked,

376
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,130
you know the Maracas player,

377
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,610
the Maracas player from deep purple,

378
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,070
he wasn't even a full member. They just
had them on for that one fucking song.

379
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,370
Cause Santana scared the fuck out of them.

380
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,540
Nick thought that was the
direction of music was going to go.

381
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,350
Then once they realized that mainstream
music was only going to accept one

382
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:21,390
Santana,
right.

383
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,140
And there wasn't going to
be another fucking type of
Santa's and tell those guys,

384
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,940
bum, bum, bum, bum layer. And then
there was Ricky Martin. How's that?

385
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,630
[inaudible] right.

386
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah.

387
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,840
And years fucking later at, they're
at the, they're at the fucking heist,

388
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,490
the high school reunion and
she's just fucking with her eyes.

389
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:46,160
She's trying to be like,
oh, it's so to see you.

390
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:49,010
She's fucking like bringing her in like,
you know,

391
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:53,440
trying to fucking sorta muffler and
choke around like don't fucking say shit

392
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:57,940
though. I heard another fucking Mirage
layer in blogging. Deep verbal. Right.

393
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,050
And then Marcy,
she's just now she's a woman.

394
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:05,800
She's just not going to come out and
say it was the fun there. Then the,

395
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:08,200
then it's over. You know, it's
like a cat playing with a mouse.

396
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:12,670
She's just got an a linger. She's
going to start talking to the husband.

397
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,830
Yeah, act it all interest. Not Looking
at fucking, you know, Marcy. Right.

398
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,400
And that she's going to kind of glance
over at her and that she's just going to

399
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:25,210
just slowly let it. Yeah.
Mya and your wife. Yeah,

400
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:26,770
we were crazy back then.

401
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:30,380
Remember all those concert we went to
and she's just going to watch there if I

402
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,780
forget it was Marcy at this point,
the fucking chicken got led.

403
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,820
We'll just say Marcy's done married one.
Right.

404
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,280
He's just going to see
her face fucking fall.

405
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,750
It's this fucking chick just twist the
fucking knife. Is she going to tell?

406
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:45,860
Is she not going to tell and then she'll
back off and change the subject and

407
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,750
then she'll gradually
come back around to it.

408
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,410
And this fucking guy's just standing
there, doesn't know a fucking thing.

409
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,300
Um, I'm sorry. I was just, you know,

410
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,790
I was just doing a table read
for a fucking screenplay.

411
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,410
I'm writing called a Marcy's a country,

412
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:03,891
you know,

413
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:07,190
and I've been shopping around Hollywood
forever and I'll tell you is great.

414
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,530
It's the script is for
whatever fucking reason,

415
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:13,700
they just cannot get past the title,
you know,

416
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,360
it's just this politically correct
age that we live in. All right,

417
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:21,670
let's get to some of the
reeds here for this week. Uh,
for Christ's sake, Bill did.

418
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:26,590
Did you even fucking did you even
fucking, no, you didn't. Yeah,

419
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,640
there we go. All right.
Here we got four reads.

420
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,540
Indochino Indochino

421
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,421
the fuck is this.

422
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:39,200
Talk about how good it feels to have a
suit that is one of kindness is uniquely

423
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:43,820
yours. Talk about how when you
look good, you feel confident

424
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,220
about. Why don't you fucking write
some shift for me to talk about

425
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,090
what is this an interview?
Talk about wearing suits.
All right, Indochina Window,

426
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:59,890
Chino. Alright, Indo Chino is
reinventing. Oh, I remember these guys.

427
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,590
All these guys, actually, I don't
know why I'm shitting on him.

428
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:07,590
These guys are fucking great. Hey, do you

571
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:10,560
and then like they were on the final lap
and it was so fucking boring out front.

572
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:15,030
They was still back. You know, watching
that Guy Zigzag. Hey Formula One fans.

573
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,790
I don't understand why they, I
like the fucking rules. Well, Bill,

574
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,220
why don't you look them up? Well,
it's easier to ask you guys.

575
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,040
It's also funny or if I talk about him
and I don't know what I'm talking about,

576
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,610
I don't get out when the guy who
cut off the front of his car, right.

577
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,210
One of the fucking fence. I did find
it funny that they were like, yeah,

578
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:34,240
people do that all the time and it doesn't
affect the performance of the car. Um,

579
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,880
it doesn't seem too anyways,
um,

580
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,180
where they saying you were
only allowed to make one move,

581
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,870
like you went to the right and then he
came back to the left and then back to

582
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:46,650
the right. And that was considered more
than one move. And I was just like,

583
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:51,640
what the fuck? He can't do that.
I thought I left this behind.

584
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:55,480
What the NFL season. Hey,
this is like, you know, he's
got to make a football move.

585
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,920
That fucking guy,
when he tried to go around,

586
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:03,490
the other dude didn't do anything that
I don't do when I'm on the highway,

587
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:06,940
when I'm behind some fucking Douche
driving too fucking slow in the left lane.

588
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,800
Right. Oh, you know what? And,
and I'm in the, I'm in the
second to left lane. Right.

589
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,670
And there's some guy driving medium
speed and then somebody during that just

590
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,310
making a wall. And I'm like, what the
fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

591
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:22,160
What the fuck? And then you go
around to the right coming around.

592
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,250
Now when I watched the race,
it was Lewis Hamilton,

593
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,180
then Rosberg and I
remember it was a red bull,

594
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,110
then a Ferrari, then a
red bull, then a Ferrari.

595
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:35,780
And then today it's saying red
bull, Ferrari, Ferrari red bull.

596
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,530
So did somebody get panelized
it's fucking unreal.

597
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,010
I don't get it. Like it's, there's
always like after the fucking Raul,

598
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:45,650
you thought you won the race. But, uh,

599
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,670
somebody said something in ta don't shift
into seventh gear. And they were like,

600
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:53,480
oh, you can't do that. Don't
tell him what he shouldn't do.

601
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,560
You know, if he's only driving a
car at 200 fucking miles an hour,

602
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,660
one guy spun up.
That was it.

603
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:06,110
There wasn't really any crashes or
anything like that, but it was funny.

604
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:09,500
I'm actually totally, until my wife can't
stand and she says when I have it on,

605
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:13,010
it sounds like a bunch of
bees flying around, but um,

606
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,460
it's still fucking cool as shit
though. Love that. I don't know.

607
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,710
That was probably my,
of all the races I've watched,

608
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:23,580
that's been my least favorite. Um, just
because there was all this, like the,

609
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,080
the,

610
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,900
the start of the race was
the most exciting and then
there was just a bunch of

611
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:30,380
people in the back trying to go around
people and they couldn't do it except for

612
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,850
Kimmy. Raikkonen the flying Finn
evidently see the flying Finn.

613
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:38,990
I have no fucking idea. Um, anyways,

614
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,630
but this is really getting me through
the fucking dog days of baseball.

615
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,420
I fucking love baseball,
but I just, you know,

616
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,040
I can't get into it in July and
August. I like it in April, you know,

617
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,331
and the May,

618
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:55,190
you start seeing what's going to happen
and then I just fucking vege out June,

619
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,280
July, August, the same way
the players too right there.

620
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:00,200
Just standing up there
like, dude, what the fuck?

621
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,370
How many fucking games do you have to
play in the regular season before we know

622
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:09,350
who deserves to win the division
hundred and 60 to five.

623
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:14,330
Isn't that, isn't that
insane? That has to be,

624
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,320
if you're going to own a professional
team, that's gotta be the sport to do it.

625
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,140
162 home games.

626
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:25,730
If your team selling out the Ballpark,
Jesus Christ.

627
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,500
Those things have to be, I got to
look this up right now. Look at this.

628
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:34,900
I'm actually going to do research
professional.

629
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,710
See,
I know franchises.

630
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,090
I should've put sports in there right now.

631
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:44,310
If something's got to be fucking
talking and being about Mcdonald's

632
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,290
worth the most.

633
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,160
Okay, well this is everything. Okay?
The Dallas cowboys for whatever reason,

634
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:59,700
are worth $4 billion.
Real Madrid,

635
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:05,510
John Guessing is some sort of football
club in Spain is worth three point $7

636
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:11,970
billion.
And then there's another one in Barcelona.

637
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,390
Is that also Spain?
3.6 billion.

638
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,600
The New York Yankees.
There you go.

639
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,210
Well that makes sense that like
a world football as we call it,

640
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:26,630
soccer would be worth that
much money cause that's,

641
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,900
that really is when you
win a world championship,
you're winning the World Cup.

642
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,600
You're playing against the fucking
world, right? It's like an Olympic medal,

643
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,140
except you get paid a
then the New York Yankees,

644
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,670
3.4 billion,
then man United 3.3 billion.

645
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,110
Oh

646
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,470
and then the new England patriots,
everybody's favorite fucking team to hate.

647
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:53,210
On 3.2 billion then the New York Knicks.

648
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,840
What?
3 billion?

649
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,130
Jesus Christ. No New York. Tell, I'll
tell you, that's a fixer upper right.

650
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:07,950
That New York Knicks or a fucking
tear down. Oh, this is weird,

651
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:11,820
man.
Then the Washington red skins 2.9 billion.

652
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,083
Hey,

653
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,740
shut up million dollars. I
hate when this happens. Yeah,

654
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,190
25%

655
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,350
now you've got to figure out where
the fuck the voice is coming from.

656
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,980
2011

657
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,510
shut up. Oh, there it is.

658
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,213
All right.

659
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,000
All right. The Redskins
are, we're 2.9 billion.

660
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,080
Then the giants are 2.8 building,

661
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,580
building billion.

662
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,170
Then the Lakers a 2.7 the Lakers
are worth less than the Knicks.

663
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,240
Okay.

664
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,840
If anything says that this state is
going to fall into the ocean one day,

665
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:55,670
it's the fact that the fucking nics
are worth more fucking money than the

666
00:40:55,671 --> 00:40:59,270
fucking Lakers. Jesus Christ.
What are the Celtics worth?

667
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,380
Oh my God.
Rappaport's gonna fucking love that.

668
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,501
Well,

669
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:10,040
you know something that actually makes
sense because you know when you move to

670
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:14,390
Manhattan, you fuck. Can you
fucking let me get to the site?

671
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,280
I hate when fucking sites do this.

672
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:18,830
They just got to suck the
fucking information outta Ya.

673
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,350
Forbes going to give you my fucking email.
What?

674
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,840
So Time magazine can start fucking
spam and me. I don't think so.

675
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,340
Why Hillary Clinton should be thankful.
Election is not today.

676
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,100
I don't know why he's her suits all in
the fucking dry cleaners. All right,

677
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:41,000
let's uh, let's, let's do swear.
Where am I? How much time have I done?

678
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,520
41 minutes.
You know,

679
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:47,860
some days it feels like work
other days that doesn't, um,

680
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,030
you know, I've become obsessed with
as of last night is, is uh, you know,

681
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:56,000
I've been doing this grip strength thing
and I've been fucking doing great man.

682
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:59,030
I can go up a peg board
now at 48 years of age.

683
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,010
I can go up a climbing rope leaving my
skinny fucking Alabaster fucking albino

684
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:08,330
legs just dangling like a fucking,
I dunno.

685
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,640
Couple of appendixes, right Jason?
I never had to make that plural.

686
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,340
Appendix. Appendix is tits. Today's okay?

687
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,113
MMM.

688
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,510
Yeah. Cause you know what? I got
those, those atomic fucking holds.

689
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,040
Those mother fuckers better send
me some free shit. I'm sick.

690
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,730
I hypen those guys up. But they're
the shit. They are the shit.

691
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,560
So now I want to be
able to do one of those.

692
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,950
Is it called a front lever or front lever?
Um,

693
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:39,850
and I watched this guy's a youtube
video. I'll, I'll repost it.

694
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,440
The six easy steps, eh, hey,

695
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:46,260
lovely Nia to being able
to do a front lever.

696
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,003
MMM.

697
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:53,410
Did you hear about Paula
Abdul? No. Was um, she's,

698
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,390
she's a singer and she was a Laker girl.

699
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,670
Oh, lab door. The National John. No,
I have to eat my cereal. Oh, okay.

700
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,950
I just brought you some of this.
Thank you. Come on to the mic. Mike.

701
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,270
Mike Baby Dude. Dude. Dude, why
did you do that? About Paula Abdul.

702
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,830
Um, cause those love Paula Abdul.
I know. I like making people laugh.

703
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,840
I had to pick somebody, you
know, if I was like, yeah, go.

704
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,010
Did you hear about Paula
Abdul? Like that's not funny.
It is funny. It is funny.

705
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,800
And you're going to sit there and
act like you're not going to do it.

706
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:34,830
To me that's true.
Who would you pick

707
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,920
one of your rock icons?
Probably, you know,

708
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:42,750
kind of helps if you pick a name.
Well,

709
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,630
I can't tell you because then it's not
going to be a surprise when I do it.

710
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,000
All right. No, it isn't because you
already told me you're going to do it.

711
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,620
See what I did there.
Oh yeah.

712
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,550
I guess what I could flip it. I
Dunno. It's, it's the morning.

713
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,780
Still drink some of your juice. I
brought it for you. Oh, thank you. Well,

714
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:03,990
I got to do a podcast. If you don't
mind just dirty right now though. No, I,

715
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,210
people give me shit because I
try not to drink on the mic,

716
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:08,800
but I have to hold the
microphone does take a sip.

717
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,960
I been talked to them like drinking.
Okay. So my snapchat last night,

718
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,790
if you guys follow me on Snapchat,

719
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:19,440
I made my fresh squeeze watermelon
juice and I'm giving it to bill,

720
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,310
who loves the wow.
It's taken it down like a champ.

721
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,180
You give him anything in this glass? I
suck it down. Just like my, my juice.

722
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:34,690
I drink at night. Daddy's Madison,
Daddy's Madison. Um, all right.

723
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:39,420
I gotta get back to the
podcast. Aniah okay. Alrighty.
Okay. What'd you talk about?

724
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,330
Um, I don't really know. This has just
been one of the stream of conscious days.

725
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,850
Um,
that's her whole podcast.

726
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,780
I talked about some lady with a basket
on her head trying to get water,

727
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,070
what she fought off a cobra.
I do remember that.

728
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,660
And I also talked about how big the
heads are of the people running for

729
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:02,610
president and our be concerned if
I was the head of security. Okay.

730
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,410
What else? That's all I
can remember. Oh, riveting.

731
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:12,600
Okay. All right, I'll see you. Hey Nanny.

732
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,340
Do you hear about Lady Gaga?

733
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,660
She had a meat dress.
All right,

734
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,960
let's get to some of the
questions here. Um, oh yeah. Yes.

735
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:29,880
I became obsessed with the uh,
that front lever and uh,

736
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,850
this guy has a six step thing on how to
do it cause I always wanted to be able

737
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,210
to do the human fucking flag.
You know,

738
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,650
that's just a great thing to be able
to do if you're not a gymnast because

739
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:43,950
people just expect you to be able to
do it. But if you just like a dad,

740
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:46,230
you got a couple of kids,
you know,

741
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,730
you fucking into roofing now that's a
physical job. Whatever you fucking build.

742
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,920
I don't know. It just be
something just funny to do that.

743
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:59,760
You could actually fucking do
that. Just weird people out. Um,

744
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:00,930
you know what that reminds me.

745
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,570
I wanted to do a bit on these
fucking crossfit people,

746
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,990
but I just feel like it's just too hacky
and every comic is going to have a bid

747
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:10,560
on it. So what, what's,

748
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,030
why do these crossfit people,

749
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:16,380
why do they have to like workout
in the gym and outside? Why is,

750
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,400
it's just so fucking, look at me.
We're working out. I work out too.

751
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:23,160
I work out my garage with
the fucking door closed.

752
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,240
It's the most narcissistic she gives
us. Even they're just like, dude,

753
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:31,380
fucking running down the street
with like a god damn fucking tire.

754
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:32,610
Buying them right.

755
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,910
Somebody show me a picture of a guy
doing that and retweeted it. Right?

756
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,770
Running down the street. Dragon a
tire. When he's just run up a hill,

757
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:43,470
you fucking moron.
You know?

758
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:48,030
Oh because tire ads more difficulty
when they'd run up the hill more times.

759
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,730
Increase your reps,
you stupid fuck

760
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,130
what?

761
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:59,070
What are you training for the standard
like I was fucking somewhere in Santa

762
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,340
Monica. These fucking jerk offs. It's
like 10 of them outside and they got,

763
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,140
you know when they got
the double fucking ropes,

764
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,410
that thing that they do that,

765
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:11,100
the only reason you really need to do
that is if you're fighting in the UFC.

766
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,530
They're the only people who
seem to need to have to do that.

767
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:18,030
Then everybody else wants to be in UFC
shape without having to actually have the

768
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:21,490
balls to get in the octagon.
Alright,

769
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,970
so fucking dumb and the,

770
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:27,480
or even when they're inside there's
like down the street. This one from me,

771
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:32,170
it's like this giant garage door and
they just have it open. Like look at us,

772
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,820
we're crossfitting. I talked to Neil
about it and she was saying like, yeah,

773
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:40,270
it was like all the rage to be on one
of those social media things and like,

774
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,870
oh I did, you know, filming yourself,

775
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,870
working out Hashtag crossfit.
It's just,

776
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:50,860
I dunno when I was,
when I was a kid,

777
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,070
if you wanted people to look at you,
you got into show business. Okay?

778
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,240
You became a male stripper. You
told jokes, you joined a band.

779
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,493
You know,

780
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,670
now these fucking assholes that they're
making a Bundt cake and they got like

781
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:08,671
fucking 80,000 fucking hits and
everybody's walking around with the same

782
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:12,880
arrogance that I have. It's,
it's not fair people I earned,

783
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,800
I earned my Eric, it's
um, I'm fucking with you.

784
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:18,790
You want to work outside.

785
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,490
You want to run down the street
with a fucking tire behind you.

786
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,633
You know what I mean?

787
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,700
I don't quite understand when to apply
the white privilege thing because I am

788
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:34,300
white and who's kitten who I am
one of the widest of all time.

789
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,583
You know what I mean?

790
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,450
I would say Hitler would not be
disappointed if I walked into his office,

791
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,760
but I think the red hair,
I think I might be out

792
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:44,990
okay.

793
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,750
Once chalk, white skin,
chuck [inaudible], all

794
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,410
this one is defective.
Alright.

795
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,260

805
00:49:30,321 --> 00:49:34,760
I wish there was a podcast network that

827
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,570
50 minutes in Professor Dick Wad.
Hey Bill,

828
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:59,340
you hemoglobin laden a recite.
I had to look all of that up.

829
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:03,630
That's basically saying I have a lot
of red in me. Let her red blood cells.

830
00:51:03,631 --> 00:51:08,380
I guess let's make this as short and
sweet as possible. Hey, all right.

831
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,390
Why don't you fucking a lecture me,
you cunt. Um, I go to a nice college.

832
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:18,250
I also manage a movie
theater in my town too. Ew.

833
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,910
Why would you say also and to,
I manage a movie theater in my town also,

834
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,190
or two to win also mean the same thing.
Right.

835
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,500
I also manage it movie theater in
my town to comma too. All right.

836
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,910
At School, I've got a film. He said, you
got to make it short and sweet at school.

837
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:35,740
I've got a,

838
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,400
I got a film studies class with one of
those pretentious fucking professors that

839
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:43,820
wears young kid close to come off
cooler than he really is. Yeah.

840
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:48,380
You know what that means? He's gonna
fuck a stone it. I love movies.

841
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:51,680
I've seen plenty of them. That's the
reason why I'm taking this class. Well,

842
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:53,870
that's great. Gravitate to
what you want, what you want.

843
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,230
Every time before we watch
a movie in this class,

844
00:51:57,231 --> 00:52:00,620
the professor asked us to raise
our hands if we've seen it before.

845
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,210
I raised my hand almost every time that
I look around to see if anyone else is

846
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:09,560
raising their hand. They rarely are. Sure
I'm a nerd. I've seen the fucking movies.

847
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,670
Maybe if he didn't play the most standard
choices like Casablanca and shit,

848
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,970
I wouldn't raise my hand every
time. Look at that. You like movies,

849
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,880
you're doing your homework,
you taken a class on it,

850
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:23,890
you're gravitating towards what
you want. Very nice. All right.

851
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,200
So anyway,
I was just recently hired,

852
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,560
I was just recently hired on an employee.

853
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:36,600
Dude, you're killing me. I just
recently hired on as an employee.

854
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:40,140
You left out the ass at my theater.
Um,

855
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:44,550
who also happens to be a student
of my film studies per se.

856
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,460
Oh, you went by an employee.
So anyway, I just recently,

857
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,040
I was just recently hired by an employee

858
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:58,110
at my theater who also happens to be a
student of my film studies professor,

859
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,000
but in a different class
at a different school.

860
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:04,210
I think I conveyed what you were
trying to say that as a joke.

861
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:05,590
One day I asked the kid,

862
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,460
so does miss to so-and-so ever
talk shit about our class?

863
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,750
The kid looks me square in the eye
and says, yeah, actually he does.

864
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:17,230
Dr So and so says there's
this one kid in your,

865
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,460
your your all's class,
you mean y'alls class?

866
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,760
Who always raises his hand when
he asks if he's seen the movie,

867
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,040
but really he probably hasn't and then
he looks around the run to make sure

868
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:32,610
everyone is looking at him to
know he's seen the movie before.

869
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,480
That's hilarious.
This guy's getting insecure.

870
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,740
You're making your teacher insecures
tonight. He's got ah, Jesus.

871
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,620
That's probably why he's wearing
the young people's clothes.

872
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,270
He's talking shit about the other
class to make himself seem cool. Ah,

873
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:52,140
this guy's a fucking, this guy's a
bitch. I don't like this teacher.

874
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,280
He goes sell. There we go.
This guy talks shit about me.

875
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:00,310
It was other classes when all I'm doing
is generally raising my hand after being

876
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:03,510
asked if I've seen the movie or not.
In any other case,

877
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,220
I'd probably just confront him about this,

878
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:08,250
but I don't want to risk failing the
class or something petty like that.

879
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:12,840
Am I overthinking this? What should I
do here? I'd walked right up to the guy.

880
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,730
I just want, who gives a fuck
this fucking insecure can't,

881
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,870
he'll probably give you a better
grade cause what does need to be like?

882
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:24,750
Just walk right up to him.
But yeah. Listen man, uh,

883
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:29,070
this seems to be some confusion on your
part that you seem to be trying to work

884
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:33,060
out with the other class as to why I
raised my hand every time I happened to

885
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,330
love movies. I work at
a movie theater. Okay.

886
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:41,280
And I've seen all these movies and I look
around just to see if anybody else has

887
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,700
seen the movies because I love movies
and I want to talk to people about movies

888
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,130
if he don't want me to keep,
you know,

889
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:51,060
raising my hand stopped
doing this paint by numbers.

890
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,790
Basic horseshit movies
that you keep picking.

891
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,500
What are you going to have next
week? Days of thunder. Huh?

892
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,640
You're giving me shit.
You're going to come in.

893
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,260
He address like you
could go into a fucking,

894
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,080
yeah. What are the young kids listened
to? I used to just go see the weekend.

895
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,170
Is that the right thing?
Who's the other guy?

896
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:16,800
Who was the rapper who won all the
fucking grammys? Kendrick Lamar.

897
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,400
I know who they are. I don't,
I know a few of their songs.

898
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,830
I know the weekends CD
starts off going right.

899
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,323
Wait,

900
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,470
you could actually play the
beginning of the weekend.

901
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:38,560
I think red next do it as much as they
probably don't like his skin color.

902
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:41,080
They probably play that when
they're out duck hunting

903
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,410
to try to get the young ducks. You
know, we're into all this fucking,

904
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,680
I'm fucking with you.
I am a fan of the weekend.

905
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,850
That wasn't [inaudible] was hired by
that last joke guy. Let Him Apollo.

906
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,120
All right. Um, a Billy calorie count.

907
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:02,650
Thoughts on Melissa McCarthy
Getting Flack for losing weight?

908
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,490
Uh, all right, my first thought, I'm
Melissa McCarthy. I did a movie with her,

909
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:11,491
a number a years ago was called the heat
directed by Paul Feig starting Melissa

910
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,210
McCarthy, Sandra Bullock. And that's
where I first met, uh, Michael Rappaport,

911
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,980
you know,
um,

912
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:24,090
dropping names all over the place and she
is truly one of the most funny fucking

913
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:29,320
hilarious human beings I have ever
met and she's an absolute sweetheart.

914
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,720
Um, so anyways, I didn't
realize people were given.

915
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,690
Why would you give somebody flack for
losing weight? Aren't you supposed to say,

916
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:39,500
hey, great job, good for you. You know.

917
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:44,240
Anyway said people are saying she's
doing it because of Hollywood pressures

918
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,470
and so fucking dumb. All right. I think
people are just add that isn't it?

919
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:52,150
That's not what it is. It's, it's, it's,

920
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,220
it's the same townie mentality when
you're, you're finally deciding that,

921
00:56:57,221 --> 00:57:01,630
you know, wearing your football jacket
and continuing to drink in the local bar,

922
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:05,150
you want more out of life and then all a

923
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,780
smart now like all of them, they don't
want to see her get her shit together.

924
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,290
You know, misery loves
fucking company. You know,

925
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:18,550
they would stay here and be out of
shape. Good. Far fucking assholes.

926
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:21,460
What kind of an asshole? When somebody
makes a positive move in their life,

927
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,840
tries to make it negative. Well me,
I'm a comedian. I do that all the time.

928
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:27,460
But besides people like me anyways,

929
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:31,090
these people who always say you should
be comfortable in your own body,

930
00:57:31,091 --> 00:57:32,410
no matter what you look like,

931
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,550
completely ignore basic information like
clogged arteries and such. Absolutely.

932
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:40,600
Maybe Melissa McCarthy doesn't want to
die of a heart attack because she wants

933
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:44,920
to meet her grandchildren's one day I
lost 30 pounds since listening to fat

934
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:49,390
shame everyone. I honestly didn't know
I was getting fat. I was never fat ever.

935
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:52,360
But then three years at an office,
job and college,

936
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:57,050
I'm 24 I put on the gross 30.
I recently lost. Yeah, dude,

937
00:57:57,051 --> 00:57:59,380
it's 24 man.
You were headed towards being,

938
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:03,610
you were going to die if you are 30
pounds overweight at 24 that is not a good

939
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:07,390
thing. So congratulations.
Uh, anyways, he said,

940
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:08,770
I feel a thousand times better.

941
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:11,860
I never looked fat because I'm
a tall guy and I carry it well.

942
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,520
So I never heard anything from anyone.
I did it on my own for myself.

943
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:18,910
These fat defenders are ignorantly
judging and assuming thoughts on this.

944
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,970
Also when the fuck did we
get to see your gym video?

945
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:26,740
I want to see your pasty legs dangling
from a pullup bar like meat hanging in a

946
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:30,220
locker. Ah, you fucking cuts. Um, no.

947
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,470
This is the thing about this business.
Uh,

948
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,440
the only pressure that is
as far as I'm concerned,

949
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:39,120
the only pressure in this
business is what you x.

950
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,910
You as an individual choose to accept.

951
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,380
All right?

952
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,130
And everybody does it to a certain point
when you first get into entertainment

953
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:50,290
because you don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

954
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:53,470
You come into this business with
your hat in hand, you're like,

955
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:56,890
I'll sweep the floors, I'll do whatever
you want. Just give me stage time. I'll,

956
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:02,130
I'll drive to another state to do five
minutes for no money for $5 gas money.

957
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:03,520
We all do that shit.

958
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:04,920
Okay.

959
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,753
Um,

960
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:10,200
but at some point you then have to put
a value on what the fuck it is you're

961
00:59:10,201 --> 00:59:12,300
doing, right? And then
you start getting paid.

962
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,650
Then what happens is you're like
going, fuck. You know, and you know,

963
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,230
you get in this business,
it takes a while to get going.

964
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:22,700
And everybody starts creeping into 30
so you start freaking out going, oh,

965
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,180
what is, what does the industry
casting? What are they looking at?

966
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:29,270
What is the blah, blah, Blah
and all that type of shit. Okay.

967
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:34,420
Now a lot of people do not ever get past
that because they don't put a value on

968
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:38,900
their talent.
And I'm not even talking monetarily.

969
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,760
This is just my own belief system.

970
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,160
You have to believe that you have
something to say that you know

971
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,060
you can't be married to the results.
You just got to do that zen thing.

972
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:52,710
Like I'm talking about this shit,

973
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,120
I'm doing this and like take me all right,

974
00:59:57,121 --> 01:00:01,650
I came in in the business or write
a fucking redheaded con male,

975
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,330
you know? So from day one, there's
not going to be a lot of roles for me.

976
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,700
There's not a lot of redheaded male
leads and shit. You know, I'm the front,

977
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,920
right? That's the deal.
That's how it works.

978
01:00:16,921 --> 01:00:21,780
The redhead and mail is not the fucking
cool guy. So to make matters worse,

979
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:24,720
I started losing my fucking
hair and I was like, oh fuck,

980
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:29,310
now what do I go out and get plugs
in? All that shit. And just one day,

981
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,960
you know, Neil is just, just bust your
fucking head down. And I was just like,

982
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,110
I just came to this epiphany
of just like, yeah, Bill,

983
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,770
why are you walking around like you
lose your fucking hair is a big deal.

984
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:45,180
Does that mean you're not funny anymore?
Does that mean you know,

985
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,530
what were you going to be the next Brad
Pitt if you kept your fucking hair right?

986
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,180
And then I just said, yeah, fuck it.

987
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,380
So then I did it and this and I ever
since I had the philosophy of basically

988
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,310
this is what I look like
and this is what I do.

989
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:04,350
If you want to book me, thank
you. If you don't, I understand.

990
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,800
The second I went into that mindset,
I never fucking stressed again.

991
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:11,040
So I really think that all that whole,
you know,

992
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,530
the pressures of fucking Hollywood is,

993
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,560
I understand that when you're young,

994
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:19,350
but as you're getting
older you have to fucking,

995
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,970
it really has nothing to
do with Hollywood. I also,

996
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,960
I think it has more to do with, you know,
why you got into this business, you know,

997
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:32,520
the self-loathing, you know,
and, and not liking yourself.

998
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:35,170
I think, and I have to tell you, uh,

999
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,490
this past weekend I watched
[inaudible] special and um,

1000
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,650
it was so fucking great.

1001
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:45,620
And I was sitting there with
my wife and I was saying like,

1002
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,890
what I loved. She went out there and
it just was, she was fucking original.

1003
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,000
All of us stuff was just, it was just
fucking, it was just a great set.

1004
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,540
It was worthy like this,
it really was a standup special.

1005
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,430
And you know, she's, she
went out there, you know,

1006
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,340
and everybody's making a big
fucking deal that it like,

1007
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,600
because she was pregnant that she did it.
Oh my God,

1008
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:13,010
they'll all these fucking questions and
I understand why they did that because

1009
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:14,180
no one's ever done that.

1010
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,530
But there should be more questions
about how great the material was.

1011
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,290
But I was saying to my wife when I
was watching this, I go, you see this?

1012
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:27,660
She had a special to do and she didn't
give a fuck that she was pregnant and she

1013
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,280
just walked out and then she owned it.

1014
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:34,430
And now what she's done is she's
established herself that now she can just

1015
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:39,030
basically do whatever the fuck she wants.
She wants to have another kid.

1016
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:44,031
She can literally go on
tour while pregnant because
she's established that this

1017
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:47,040
is who I am. This is what
I'm doing. I'm married,

1018
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,640
I'm starting to fucking family
and I'm right and kill the jokes.

1019
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,800
This is what I'm doing now.

1020
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,700
All these fucking feminist who
sit there going alien again.

1021
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,620
Hollywood won't let you be pregnant.

1022
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,730
I would argue you are giving
them way too much fucking power.

1023
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,310
Way Too much power.
Just go out.

1024
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:08,190
If every fucking woman out here just
started getting pregnant because they

1025
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:11,940
wanted to and continue to go on auditions,
the whole fucking business,

1026
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:15,780
what adjust you make it adjust to you
rather than the other fucking way around.

1027
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:20,070
And, um, if you haven't seen
her special, you know, you know,

1028
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:23,640
a lot of the hype on it is the fact
that she did it seven months pregnant,

1029
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:27,870
but I'm telling you, just as a
someone who still have, you know,

1030
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:32,290
as long as I've been doing this, a huge
fan of standup comedy, you know, um,

1031
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,570
yeah,

1032
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:39,190
it's, the jokes are fucking killer.
The subject matter, all of it.

1033
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:43,780
It was just like, you know, God knows
this a Zillion fucking specials out there,

1034
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:48,520
but you know, every once in a while,
you know, someone comes out like with,

1035
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:52,990
with that, that was, that was one of the
best ones I've seen in a while. So, um,

1036
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,780
okay.

1037
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,120
I guess I would tie all of that
back end to that. It's like,

1038
01:03:57,121 --> 01:04:00,570
I would say that she's losing
weight. Yeah. She's married,

1039
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:02,850
she's got kids and know who the
fuck doesn't want to lose weight.

1040
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:05,370
I'm trying to lose weight. No one
wants to walk around being overweight.

1041
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:09,570
It's not fun. You're life is
easier. And people who, uh,

1042
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,850
give a shit about that. I
would just say, you know,

1043
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,900
I feel bad for them because I know
they don't want to be out of shape too.

1044
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,730
You know? I mean, did used to
being proud to be out of shape.

1045
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:24,990
That's like being proud to be like a
fucking alcoholic, you know, you know,

1046
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:25,824
you got issues.
You,

1047
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,860
your fucking heart isn't fucking
excited that you're overweight.

1048
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:31,940
Like that's right. That's
right. You don't, you know,

1049
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,210
every pound of fat is five
miles of capillaries. You know,

1050
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,560
you get 20 pounds overweight,

1051
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,520
you're heart's got to fucking go and
extra hundred miles every fucking beat.

1052
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:45,000
You not stupid. It's not a, it's
not a good thing to be doing.

1053
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:48,840
So congratulations to
her. Um, and you know,

1054
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,290
I'm struggling right now to lose fucking
wait. Oh, I'll tell you it's easy.

1055
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:56,190
It's not easy. All Billy blue's
bag. Alright. Uh, Christian girls,

1056
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:59,220
sexual boundaries. Hey, Billy Bob Berman.

1057
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,180
I listened to all your specials multiple
times and really loved the advice

1058
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:05,220
segments you do on your podcast.

1059
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,180
I'm back home for the summer from my
first year of college and I'm hooking up

1060
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:12,720
with this six to 10. Chris, what?

1061
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:17,530
Oh six out of 10 Christian girl the
last couple of months of school.

1062
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,850
I barely even just retained any of that
cause I was hoping everything that I

1063
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:26,470
said came off as positive and
that last thing. Um, anyway,

1064
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:30,040
let me reread this. I've listened to all
your sanity back for the summer. Okay.

1065
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:30,850
I'm hooking up with this group,

1066
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,480
this six out of 10 Christian girl
the last couple months of school.

1067
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,450
The encounter is basically consisted
of me aggressively finger play,

1068
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,460
live g easy finger blasting her
to quench her sexual deviancy.

1069
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,800
Oh, I love how you're just fucking
innocent in all this and her giving my,

1070
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:55,910
Oh, okay. Okay. Oh this is a woman, right?

1071
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:59,350
This in a hurricane or given my carpet.
A midnight snack.

1072
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:03,810
What? Oh No, this is a guy.
Why are you saying your carpet?

1073
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,230
Give him my carpet.
A midnight snack while jerking me off.

1074
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,520
You lost me in that one.

1075
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,450
What is your carpet?
Your pubes.

1076
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,700
What does this snack,
because you come on yourself.

1077
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:24,070
I don't even know what's
going on here or anyway,

1078
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,030
she's a devout Christian so she won't
get involved with oral sex or anything

1079
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:32,740
further. Uh, the thing is her
idea of boundaries are pretty,

1080
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:37,180
uh, are more fuss. I don't
know what that means. No,

1081
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:40,570
you fucking asshole. Now I got to look.
You know what? Actually keep doing this.

1082
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:43,120
Maybe I'll get smart one day.
Amorphous,

1083
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,250
amorphous without a clear,
defined shape or form.

1084
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,900
How did I never hear that?
My whole fucking life?

1085
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:57,850
There's so many fucking words in English
language and then they always say they

1086
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:01,680
buy, we use like 19 of them. Four
of them are curse words. All right?

1087
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:06,180
She's begged me to pleasure her
with the hilt of my screwdriver.

1088
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,220
Do to you from another century. What
the fuck is a hilt? Is that the handle?

1089
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:17,790
Don't know why I even had one at college
and jerk me off onto her face when we

1090
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:21,310
took a late night sleep
over shower together.

1091
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,600
Okay.

1092
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,270
Yeah, but that's not really a
facial. When the water's right there.

1093
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:30,000
You know what it mate, that's like,
you know, you're going to run out.

1094
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:33,290
You're going to walk on some hot rocks
and you just fucking do a running leap

1095
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:36,740
and touch one for half a second. You
keep going, right? She's also into being,

1096
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:40,070
it's like picking up dog shit with the
little fucking plastic bag around your

1097
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:43,670
hand. You know, you're still touching
dog shit, but you feel the warmth of it.

1098
01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:46,160
But you know there's a boundary there.
Uh,

1099
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:48,230
she's also into being
choked and tied up to her.

1100
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,050
Jesus fucking Christ
up during dry humping.

1101
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:54,230
Apparently that stuff's still
Christian enough for her.

1102
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,590
I've had sex a few times before the cute.

1103
01:07:56,591 --> 01:08:00,620
Why are you judging this girl so harshly?
All right. This is this religion thing.

1104
01:08:00,621 --> 01:08:02,840
This is where she's at.
Just fucking relaxed.

1105
01:08:02,841 --> 01:08:05,240
It seems like you having a hell of a time.
He goes,

1106
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:10,140
I had sex a few times before this girl
and know that even protected fucking is

1107
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:14,790
infinitely more pleasurable than outsource
masturbation. My question to you is,

1108
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,220
do you think she'll ever
realize how ridiculous it is
to take a load on her face

1109
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:21,650
but not accept Kinda Linkous

1110
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:27,180
will she ever want premarital sex? I
know I should go to a gym, loses girl,

1111
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:29,970
gets some sleep,
can take advantage of the pussy coliseum.

1112
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:32,700
That is my universe
camp university campus.

1113
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,850
But I'm lazy and want to
fuck the low hanging fruit.

1114
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,690
What can I do to convince her that
college sex is natural, wholesome.

1115
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:43,110
It would make her feel incredible.
Thanks so much and go fuck yourself.

1116
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,080
I would say you should let
this girl go because a,

1117
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:49,830
you don't have any feelings for you using
as or you're using a Reza fucking blow

1118
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:53,760
up doll. It just say, you know, I know
I should go meet some other people,

1119
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:58,420
but this girl's in easy
fucking sex hook up. Um,

1120
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,440
I dunno. I mean meantime, is
she getting feelings for you?

1121
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,440
Because if he just sitting there hanging
around waiting to be able to fuck her

1122
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:13,120
so then you can then leave. Um, you're
already saying she's a six out of 10.

1123
01:09:13,121 --> 01:09:16,450
That's, that doesn't sound like you
have feelings for us. So I'd let her go.

1124
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:18,940
I'd let it go and I'd find some girl,
they just,

1125
01:09:18,941 --> 01:09:22,390
it just let them know you're young,
so I'm not judging you here.

1126
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,680
Once you got to do early on, and this
is what nobody ever tells young men,

1127
01:09:26,681 --> 01:09:29,620
it's just just out of the gate.

1128
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,290
Tell women what the deal is.
All right cause believe it or not,

1129
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,910
they can have fun. We eat, they don't
flip out when you just say, yeah I,

1130
01:09:39,911 --> 01:09:42,760
there's no way I'm going to marry you.
You know,

1131
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:46,600
if you say it right from the beginning,
the second you meet them, right,

1132
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:50,800
if you're not feeling anything
but you're just attracted to them,

1133
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:56,230
just tell them that and just
fucking let them, you know,

1134
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,460
work that out.

1135
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:02,700
And maybe they were in the same place
you are and they just want to fuck and

1136
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,180
they don't want to have a relationship.

1137
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:08,210
But if you get into that type of a
situation, you got to make sure that you,

1138
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:12,180
you got to have like,
you know,

1139
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:15,530
you fuck and then you don't call each
other or talk or do anything else.

1140
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,800
You do not hang out.

1141
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:19,840
And there's gotta be at least 10
days between the fucking hookups or,

1142
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,820
or somebody starts failing something
and then it's a fucking mess.

1143
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:26,340
Or they get jealous. Cause you
with somebody else. So whatever.

1144
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,570
You know what I mean? And this is
what you fucking say from day one.

1145
01:10:30,571 --> 01:10:34,130
You tell him that. All right,
this steel, we'll get to hook up.

1146
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:36,980
Anything you ever wanted to fucking do,
you can do with me.

1147
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:38,330
You're not going to get judged.
You know,

1148
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,170
worry about getting judged
because it is what it is. Right?

1149
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,440
And then that's it.
We don't call each other.

1150
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:49,910
This is what we just fucking
use each other for this.
Anytime you feel an Organi,

1151
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:51,290
if you're not in a fucking relationship,

1152
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:53,930
I don't give a shit if your date
other people believe it or not.

1153
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:55,520
If you come out of the
gate with that Shit,

1154
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:59,090
you would be surprised how many
women are also looking for that.

1155
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,420
It's a great fuck fuck buddy is.
It's the greatest thing ever.

1156
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:08,090
Greatest fucking thing ever. It's
like having fucking, I don't know,

1157
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:12,200
free tickets to Disney land.
You get to ride all the fucking rides.

1158
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:17,400
You know you got VIP parking. It's, it's
like ordering a pizza. It's tremendous.

1159
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:20,400
And you know what? Women also order
a pizza, if you know what I mean.

1160
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:24,060
So have fun with that. But let
this girl go, man. All right.

1161
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:26,640
First Time flying at 30 years of age.

1162
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,960
Hey there Billy,
the ginger bats.

1163
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,650
Just want to say I've been a huge fan
for over 10 years and I've loved every

1164
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:36,450
special you had.
Well thank you very much.

1165
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,810
I'm 30 I've never been on a plane and
heights kind of freaked me out to top it

1166
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:46,140
off. My flight is on nine 11 and
makes two stops in between here,

1167
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:47,370
Connecticut in Chicago.

1168
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,330
I'm going there for my job and I'd really
hate to miss out on the opportunity.

1169
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,081
Basically,

1170
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:55,590
I'm just looking for advice and how to
not freak out and look like a fucking

1171
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:59,340
idiot on the plane. Seeing as how
you've had so much experience flying,

1172
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:03,090
I'd figured you'd be a good person to
talk to. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um,

1173
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:08,550
yeah, it's no big deal. It's
completely safe and uh, you know,

1174
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,140
you're going to be fine. This is the
deal. You're going to go up there, right?

1175
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,400
This is what you do. Get on the plane
and then just say to the person,

1176
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:21,390
next g again, believe it or not, this
is the first time I've ever flown,

1177
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,320
hopefully not next to a do. If they've
seem open, just tell him that. All right,

1178
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:26,790
but do believe me?
You're not going to,

1179
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:30,060
if you ever just stomped on the gas when
you've been driving a car and you just

1180
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:31,290
get back in your seat,

1181
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:34,590
it's just sort of like that and then
you fucking up in the air and it's the

1182
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:36,690
coolest thing ever.
It's fucking great.

1183
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:41,040
And you're going to go from fucking
Connecticut to Chicago in like fucking two

1184
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:45,990
seconds. You know, he got two stops
there. Okay, well that's cool. Be Fun.

1185
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,950
Well then you'll be a veteran by the end
of it and yeah, welcome to the, uh, the,

1186
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:54,460
the fucking 21st century.
You're going to be fine. Um,

1187
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,690
what I would say is, you know, just, uh,

1188
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,690
make sure you eat well before
you go to the airport. You know,

1189
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:03,120
maybe bring some food to go
onto the plane, you know,

1190
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,160
because the food and the plane sucks,

1191
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:09,030
it's fucking overpriced and that
type of thing. And uh, you know,

1192
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,000
that's the only thing I would say.
Other than that,

1193
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:13,470
you have nothing to worry about it.
It's going to be great.

1194
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,700
Get a fucking window seat too if
you can. That's the best, you know,

1195
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,810
first time you fly, get to look down. Um,

1196
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,820
it's actually pretty incredible to be
doing that at 30 years of age because you

1197
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:24,990
can actually take it in.
You know,

1198
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,990
first time I flew I was so young that
I don't ever have that. Like, oh,

1199
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:31,380
this is what it looks like from the
fucking hair. Um, you'll be fine.

1200
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:34,530
All Right William,
I've been dating my girls.

1201
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,720
This is the last one and then I got it.

1202
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:39,690
I got to get off my day here of doing
absolutely nothing. William William,

1203
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:43,410
I've been dating my girl for a few years
now and everything started out great.

1204
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,630
However,
over the course of the past few months,

1205
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:48,600
I've noticed a sudden change in her
behavior and was wondering if you'd dealt

1206
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:50,670
with anything like this before.
Yeah.

1207
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:55,020
She's either using drugs or fucking
someone else. Um, or she's depressed.

1208
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,510
I'm fucking with you. Let me
read the rest of this. Basically,

1209
01:13:57,511 --> 01:14:01,080
when we hang out lately, she just won't
stop asking questions. She may ask,

1210
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,820
what are you listening to? I might say
the bill burr podcasts. Then she will ask,

1211
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:09,300
why? I don't know, because
I enjoy it. He says,

1212
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,070
then she will follow it up with,

1213
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,700
why don't you listen to the
radio or another podcast
and down the rabbit hole it

1214
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:20,050
goes, oh, I don't like this
person already. The thing is,

1215
01:14:20,051 --> 01:14:22,780
these questions are
nonstop and so subjective.

1216
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,440
It got to the point where I straight up
asked her if she was trolling me and she

1217
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:29,350
denied it. Everything else in
the relationship is going well,

1218
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:30,640
so I'm not sure what to do.

1219
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:33,580
I've talked to her and told her
she asked too many questions.

1220
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:38,040
She then turns around on me and says,
I never want to talk to her any.

1221
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,460
Oh,
she turns it,

1222
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,460
turns it around on me and says that
I never want to talk to her anymore.

1223
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,610
That's not talking. It's just asking
a bunch of fucking question. She'll,

1224
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:49,360
what should I do? Break up with her. Just
answer the questions. What would you do,

1225
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:54,100
Bill? Why is your name bill anyways? Why
not Dave Hoff? Why isn't it Dave? Bill,

1226
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,010
why aren't you answering me a bill?
Don't want to talk anymore.

1227
01:14:57,011 --> 01:15:01,780
Why is the podcast and hour anyways,
why not an hour? 10 or 50 minutes.

1228
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:06,730
How bill? Yeah. All right
dude. I just walked in your
shoes there. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

1229
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:10,820
I would break up with her.
I'd break up with him.

1230
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,420
Um, I give maybe a, but
if you really liked her,

1231
01:15:14,421 --> 01:15:17,120
I gave her one last chance to
just be like, just tell it.

1232
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:20,810
You're driving me fucking insane.
And um,

1233
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:26,660
yeah, it just, you driving
me fucking insane. I like
everything about you, but that,

1234
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:31,610
and if my life with you is going to
be that, I'm going to leave. Okay.

1235
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:36,020
Um, but I gotta be honest with dude,
I don't know how people change.

1236
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:40,460
Changing yourself.
Who the fuck you are is really difficult,

1237
01:15:40,461 --> 01:15:43,160
so hopefully it'll work out with you.
So that's, that's what I would do.

1238
01:15:43,161 --> 01:15:46,950
I would just say, listen,
I like everything,

1239
01:15:46,951 --> 01:15:49,980
but that everything about
you is great except for that.

1240
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:52,050
But that is so fucking horrific.

1241
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:56,220
This is going to walk out that
fucking door if you don't cut it up.

1242
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:00,570
That's it. That's it. If I
could redo my whole dating life,

1243
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:02,160
it would have been fucking communicating.

1244
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,150
Okay.

1245
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:07,510
Instead of just being like, Woo. And
then gone. I'll getting shit faced.

1246
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,670
What was wrong with you guys
today? Nothing. I'm sorry.

1247
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:12,910
And then you don't fucking working
out. Hey, work it out. Okay. All right.

1248
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:17,380
That's the podcast for this week. Go fuck
yourselves. I'll check in on Thursday.

1249
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:22,510
Uh, thank you to everybody
who's been listening to the
podcast and I'm obviously,

1250
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:26,560

this tour. Um, starting,

1251

No, it starts the 30th.

1252
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:36,640

Manchester? John Bonham's grave site.

1262
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,190
If I have time,
I'm going to pay my respects.

I'm not going to do a fucking
Selfie, like a Douche. Uh,
