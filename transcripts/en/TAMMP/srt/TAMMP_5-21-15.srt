1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,210
Hey, what's going on is Bill
Barr and, uh, just checking.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,230
Just checking in on you on Thursday. Cleo,
get over there and lay the fuck down.

3
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:17,430
You're driving me nuts today.
You're a maniac. I still love you.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,490
That's only because you're cute, if you
will. Not ugly dog like a poop. Nope.

5
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:25,470
Get over there and lay down, down, down.
Lay the fuck down. The mastery spoken.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,610
Um, what's going on? How
are you? Oh, why? Yeah.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,070
Welcome to another Thursday afternoon.
Just before Friday. Monday afternoon.

8
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,570
Fucking morning podcast,

9
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:41,070
whatever I call it that just checking
in on your podcast for short, you know,

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,660
uh Oh, what a couple
of days it's been, oh,

11
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:50,010
what a couple of nights bubble.
Jesus Christ.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,190
Unfucking believable.
All right.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,410
I've already had myself all a
hell of a Goddamn Day, right?

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,580
I finally got my God damn truck,
Beck, right? Brand new engine.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,110
Everything was going great. And then, uh,
you know, I look cool for about six hours,

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,000
six fucking hours. And then, uh, there
was something going on with the clutch.

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,870
I don't know what was going on.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,830
He's guys that take a to do
fucking phenomenal work they do.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,310
So some of the sickest fucking hot
rod trucks I've ever seen in my life.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,040
And I think what fucked me over
is one of the parts, you know,

21
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,900
they make them in China now.
You know,

22
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,810
cause they don't want to play Americans
cause they don't want to fuck with the

23
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,680
unions and then it's not
enough that they're going to
underpay some poor Chinese

24
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,990
guy over there. Cause people
always go, all the Chinese,

25
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,070
they don't fucking make them right.

26
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,500
They'd make them right if he gave
him the right fuck of materials.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,090
What's that Chinese guy supposed to do?
Fucking uh, you know, fucking, I dunno,

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,710
pull up God goddamn clutch out of his,

29
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,280
out of his stomach like a
chicken heaven aserion section.

30
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,300
Um, whatever the fuck
materials they give them,

31
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,900
that's what they're going to put
together. So anyways, he's trying to say,

32
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:55,860
maybe it's, maybe it's that thing. So I'm
back to drive in some fucking car shape.

33
00:01:55,861 --> 00:02:00,240
Look at God Damn Dinner Roll.
So why that guy got that going on right.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,440
Um, I went down, took a helicopter,
you know, fucking thing here.

35
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm getting ready to do my check. Ride
flew great. Everything was going good.

36
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,400
My auto's what great nose was dipping
down a little bit, but you know,

37
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:15,490
I recovered and then a, all of a sudden
my clutch was acting up. So I'm like,

38
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,540
Oh fuck right. It's all
freckles. Needs a hair cut.

39
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,040
Who's getting to all you
do is just buzzing. My head
takes two fucking seconds.

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,600
So driving up, I usually have this lady
do it, but she's off today. So I said,

41
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,630
you know, I need it. I'm taking
my wife out. Fuck it man.

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,250
I'm just going to get my head buzzed.
Right? So I go by, there's a barber shop,

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,000
little candy stripe fucking sign thing
going. So I pull over, I walk in,

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,810
there's one dude sit in there,
there's no barbers. Right?

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,520
And I'm looking around and they got,
they got fucking a this selling combs,

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,893
right?

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,460
They got all these fucking vintage hot
rod magazines that playing music from the

48
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:58,380
1950s all of this should have been a
warning, but it wasn't. I was just like,

49
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,880
oh, all right, that's of cool, whatever,

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,290
and then this fucking guy comes
walking out wearing this smock,

51
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,570
indicate that he was a barber
and I'm immediately thinking, I,

52
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,170
this guy next to me, he's
first, right? The guy goes,

53
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,080
he walks out, he sees me. He
goes, oh, hey, how are you?
Sorry. I say, I'm doing good.

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,770
How are you doing? He goes, great.
He goes, are you have an appointment?

55
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,890
I'm like, do I have an appointment?
What do you mean appointment? He goes,

56
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:27,760
you've got to make an appointment here.
I'm like, dude, is a barbershop. I think.

57
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:31,390
I said, what is this, a hair salon, and
he's going over to the book looking at it.

58
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,180
He goes, Oh, you know, I can get you. I
got you. I just want to get my head bust.

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,800
Take like five minutes.
There's nobody fucking ear you can be.

60
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,780
Damn this thing halfway done.
You're chark off right inside.

61
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:44,900
I was thinking that right now.
Then he's fucking look at his log book.

62
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,640
I just said, forget it.
Forget it. I'm out of here.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,510
Fucking assholes done
with that place for life.

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,220
God Damn fucking hipsters, man.
They've ruined everything. You know?

65
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:57,490
I didn't realize that wasn't a barbershop.
That was an ironic barbershop.

66
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,620
That's why they had the old magazines.

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,190
That's why they had Frankie Valli
and the four seasons playing.

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,420
Okay?

69
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,600
Rather than some old guy
come walking out this,

70
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,160
this fucking 30 year old guy walks out,
he can't cut my fucking hair.

71
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:11,994
This is what's funny.

72
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,810
I fucking drive away my truck with
the fucked up clutch now. Now,

73
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,640
now I'm really losing my shit because I
get in. Don't try to push the clutch in.

74
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,970
It won't go all the way to the floor.

75
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,180
So I've got to push it a little
harder to get some ungodly sound in my

76
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,770
transmission. So me,
and I'm like, all right,

77
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,730
I'm not going to take this back to
the place because when I'm driving it,

78
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:31,710
it's fine.
But when I would stop for whatever reason,

79
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,600
wouldn't go all the way to the floor.
So by all means,

80
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:37,380
all you fucking weekend warrior gear
heads. Please tell me what it is. Oh,

81
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:39,150
I know what it is. I know. Jackie,

82
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:42,660
why do you fly wheel dog kicked
over to quick chefs. Shut up.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,640
Sorry.
So anyways,

84
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,550
so I go to fucking drive away and uh,

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,380
who's standing out in front of the
fucking barbershop on his iPhone? Oh,

86
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:59,120
fucking the barber shop guy
checking his tweets or some shit.

87
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:01,750
Okay.

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,140
And I'll make it, I just
fucking drove away. Just like
beside myself. Just go like,

89
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,500
what the fucking God damn hipsters.
They fucking ruined.

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,080
They haven't ruined anything. It's
just a so fucking, and this is,

91
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:15,210
why can't you just be yourself?
You know,

92
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,180
why does everything
have to be like mocking?

93
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,520
So why did get my kid you just
like I sweat. You know what it is?

94
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,400
Cause he could took off their facial hair,
wear their glasses,

95
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,470
and they'll Robert Fulton fucking
God damn outfit. Yeah. You know,

96
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,540
what would you be left with? They'd
have to be themselves and you know what?

97
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,770
They're not fucking interesting.

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,500
Yeah.

99
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,940
Jesus fucking Christ. Really
build. Do you have to go this big?

100
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,470
Yes I do. It's a barbershop. Okay.
You fucking walk into a barbershop.

101
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,373
You sit down,

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,470
there's a bunch of old guys there with
their balls going down to the floor

103
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
wherein smelly fucking old awful slacks
with horrific shows and all you start

104
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:56,920
thinking is,
wow,

105
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,860
I guess that social security really
isn't going to be there for me.

106
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,210
That's what you'd think when you go
into a barbershop fucking dickheads.

107
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,870
They should have to take that fucking
signed out or at least put it in quotes,

108
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,470
barbershop. Right? Is this a dumb
thing to be mad at? Well, fuck you.

109
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,690
I don't care. This is this. You know,

110
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,880
I didn't want to be this man
coming on the fucking podcast.

111
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:20,740
I'm getting over a goddamn summer cold.
What's the world coming to,

112
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:24,160
man, you can't walk into a barbershop
to get your fucking head bust.

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,150
There's nobody there.

114
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,610
And there's one guy standing there
and he asked you if you have a fucking

115
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:31,940
appointment. It's a, is this
a Maserati dealership? What?

116
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,730
What the fuck are we doing here?
Right? Just have me sit down,

117
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:41,380
put the fucking apron around my neck
and just add,

118
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,850
what do you usually do? I usually go
down to the skin. Then the half of them,

119
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,770
one and a half on top of one day, he'd go
big bang, boom. The Allie, Allie, Allie,

120
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm done. Here's your 20
bucks. God bless Ya. Right?

121
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,800
Well, I have an appointment and he walks
over. He looks at the fucking book, Jesus,

122
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,930
because it should have been somebody
get their nails done over in the corner.

123
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,170
Can you call yourself a barbershop?
When you take appointments,

124
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:07,080
you never have appointments.
You just show up, right?

125
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,990
I went to a barbershop when I
went, I was fucking back in, uh,

126
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,000
back in Massachusetts. I
wouldn't a house, right?

127
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,420
Just fucking walked in,
sat down.

128
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,930
So fucking old guy or
door fucking shut down,

129
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,480
gave me the same hair cut.

130
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:28,650
He gives a fucking stay true in and out.

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,730
I did it on the way to the gym.
What are the great things?

132
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:35,640
One of the few great things about having
a shaved head as far as you'll never

133
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:39,630
get lice again is it takes
you two seconds, right?

134
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,120
You just go in these zoom, zoom,
zoom, you don't give a fuck.

135
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:45,750
Who does it done over and
then you fucking leave.

136
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,240
Now the great thing is whenever
you're going out, you know,

137
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,200
you can just throw a shirt on.

138
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:52,980
No one knows he didn't take a shower
because you'll never have bedhead again.

139
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,210
So I guess there's two positive six,
but you know what,

140
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,790
what are those positive things
was taking away from me today?

141
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,130
And I'm really sad about you guys.

142
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,770
I'm not Jesus Christ. So people have
told me a bunch of shit to go off on. Uh,

143
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,790
I got, one thing I want to go off on was
fucking Robert Kraft for some reason.

144
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,980
Just rolling over and tapping out,

145
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,210
okay,

146
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,760
what happened to the other owners?
Get together and just say, listen,

147
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,400
we know Jim or say is a pain in the ass,
but you know,

148
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,710
this is just going to
bring negative publicity.

149
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,340
The NFL and over the last 24
fucking months, fucking understand.

150
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,980
Now was a fan.
I have to sit back.

151
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,840
It take the fact that a league that
didn't pay taxes since 1942 this is the

152
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:41,290
first fucking year they're paying
taxes. Right? How funny is it?

153
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,510
I want to go on a rant.
I have a fucking stuffed up nose.

154
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:47,470
Hang on one second cause I have a summer
cold cause I'm a drunk who can't go

155
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:51,400
home at night. Hang on a second. I'm back.

156
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,290
The NFL did not pay taxes
from 19 two until last year.

157
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,970
2014 this is the first year
they're paying taxes. You know,

158
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,700
meanwhile, whenever the military goes
out on the field, does a display,

159
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:10,840
they have to pay the NFL and the NFL
sits back and acts like they support the

160
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,480
troops. They don't support the troops.
They charged the tropes. Right.

161
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,630
And then on top of that, according to
the Internet, so you know it's true.

162
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,190
You know it's from that
whole pink campaign.

163
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,250
The NFL keeps 97 or some 95 97% of
all the money from the pink hats,

164
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,350
the pink mugs to Pink Jersey.

165
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,590
Then they give it to the pink fucking
Aa and she keeps like 90% of that,

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,480
so they raised like a billion dollars.
The NFL keeps like 970 million,

167
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,320
gives 30 million to the pink lady,
right?

168
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,350
She keeps 90% of that and then she peels
off $2 million for breast cancer and

169
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:53,900
all these fucking scumbags is
sailing around a giant picky on.

170
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,510
These are the fucking people that
are going to judge my Tom Brady.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,900
They're going to call him a cheetah
because of fucking air pressure.

172
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,041
You know what I mean?

173
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,890
I have to sit back as I got to
sit back and take it as a fan.

174
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,680
Tom Brady's a cheater because he went
up against the colts and Andrew luck the

175
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,290
how did the colts get Andrew Luck,
by the way. Oh No, no big deal.

176
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
They just tanked an entire season.

177
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,360
Bilking every fucking NFL fan completely
against the rules. Lost on purpose.

178
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,040
They did it every fucking week for
16 games. Was there an investigation?

179
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,730
Whether it's suspensions was, they're
fine. Now they're from Indiana.

180
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,820
Those are good down home folks out there,
man.

181
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:39,320
They put their pants on one leg at a time.
They sit down with a ring.

182
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:44,321
The dinner bell like got
one of the highest clan
memberships north of the Mason

183
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,560
Dixon line. This is Indiana. They
couldn't do anything wrong up there.

184
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,040
We shouldn't even been facing Andrew Luck.
Do you know ESPN?

185
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,830
They did that study and they showed
that the deflated ball was actually a

186
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:55,550
disadvantage.

187
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,300
Espn took it down within 30 minutes
because it was going to end the story

188
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,490
because it was in their best
interest to have it be an advantage.

189
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,050
They took that fucking thing down,

190
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,620
so I got to sit here and sit back
with a guy who sits on a fucking rules

191
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:12,460
committee and changes rules for the colts
so they can finally beat the Patriots.

192
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:17,080
Win a Superbowl, no suspension, no
fine, no investigation. Right? Hey,

193
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,910
here's the funniest thing. First game,
Brady comes back. Who? Who they playing?

194
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,200
The Indianapolis Colts.
This is like this.

195
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,940
This is like promoting a
summertime blockbuster.

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,420
It's complete fucking horseshit from
top to bottom, but you know what?

197
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:35,130
Craft tapped out. So that's
it for me. I tap up, you know,

198
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,580
unless at some point I go on,

199
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:41,581
I am Rapaport and I school
that sad ass Knicks fan.

200
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,780
Yeah.

201
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,580
You listening to me Rappaport, you've
been ducking me on this podcast. Oh,

202
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:51,980
I'm talking to you Michael.
Huh?

203
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,070
Not talking to you I and DB page.
I respect the shit out of that.

204
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,150
But as far as you as a sports fan telling
you right now, you owe me an apology.

205
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,480
Alright. And I will go on. I am
Rapaport and I will get my apology. Huh?

206
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm just doing the shit.

207
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,410
Cause at some point I know I'm
going to go on his podcast.

208
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,910
That guy gets amped up. He gets, he
guys ever listen to I am Rapaport.

209
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,570
If you want to listen to the only sports
fan I know that's more uninformed than

210
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:23,320
me and talks more from his heart
than I do. He did a fucking,

211
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,530
he did this unbelievable
documentary on the early seventies,

212
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:30,790
Nixon when the garden was eating
four stars, four out of four. Right.

213
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,541
The Fun.

214
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,960
My favorite part of it other than watching
what's his face beat up the entire

215
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,260
Los Angeles Lakers, um, was uh,

216
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,770
when Rapaport was trying to get one of
the Knicks to say that Celtic fans were

217
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:46,720
animals, he goes animals. Right?
And the guys going Naba and no,

218
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:50,740
no. And you hear Rappaport off Cam and
go, come on man. Come on. Their aunts,

219
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,630
their animals up there.
Right. It was fucking great.

220
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,710
So anyways, um, so there you go. So
that's it. I know you guys was sick of it,

221
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,740
but I don't give a shit. I don't give
a shit. So you know what I dunno.

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,100
Fuck the NFL for the first
four games ain't gonna Watch.

223
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,880
I'll watch college football
instead where I know it's crooked.

224
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,390
Gimme a God damn break.

225
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,750
How long do you think the Patriots could
have a stadium like Seattle Seahawks

226
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:20,640
before the entire league demanded? We
took it down. You know what I mean?

227
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,810
Quite somebody clears their
throat in that stadium.

228
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,210
The opposing team has to go
into fucking silent count.

229
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,140
It's such a fucking ridiculous.
That whole franchise is felty.

230
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,250
Their owner was fucking their own fan
base over with the small beers and the

231
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,500
large payers.
Do you have a watch that youtube video?

232
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,450
They had a tall glass for the fucking
large one in little short fat one and

233
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,201
somebody finally,

234
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,560
they had ordered both suck down the
short one poured the tall went in.

235
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,140
There was the same amount of beer.
Oh there Phil.

236
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:48,760
That's like some dukes of Hazzard.
Shit.

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,650
You might as well be putting fake fire
hydrant next to people's cars. Right.

238
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,850
Then they got dirty, filthy, sneaky
fucking Pete Carroll is a God damn coach,

239
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:00,160
right?
Jesus Christ.

240
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,570
I loved how he rebuilt that
fucking program down there and USC.

241
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,010
That program was so fucking filthy.
They got stripped of a championship in a,

242
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,311
in a,

243
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:13,600
in a Heisman trophy and he snuck out the
back door when the wolves were at the

244
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,820
front, but now that he's at
the pro level, I'm sure he's,

245
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,610
I'm sure he's on the up and up.
By all means.

246
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:21,730
Let's just keep focusing on the patriots.
They're the only guys.

247
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,080
Lana Falcons got caught fucking pumping
sound noise and nobody's calling them

248
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:30,940
fucking cheaters. Ah, still just
the glitch. That's just blow, right?

249
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,540
That's it. Total fucking, this is a weird,

250
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,870
the fucking world is somebody just
wrote, Hey, somebody wrote me.

251
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,230
Please put today's barbershop
walkout in your next bit.

252
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,490
It's the fucking only other
guy that was in the barbershop.

253
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,230
The fucking customer. You know something?
Show me something. My phone today,

254
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:53,080
it was tracking. I had been, I
didn't even know it was on there.

255
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,980
It's called this locator thing.
If you want to shut it off,

256
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,310
I'll see if I remember how to do it.
As you go on your phone,

257
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,760
you go to the settings,
click on settings.

258
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,270
Then you go to notifications center and
then you scroll down to something that I

259
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:14,860
don't remember what it is. I don't
remember what I can get you to there.

260
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,230
Today's summary. Ah, you fucking
content notifications, views.

261
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,020
That ain't it sort by time. Oh,
fuck you, man. This is unbelievable.

262
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,880
This is why I always sucked at that game.
Simon,

263
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,740
who that Parker brothers came from? Was
it Parker brothers? I don't fucking know.

264
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,110
Government alerts, amber alerts.
What the fuck is this thing?

265
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,040
Emergency alert.
What a government alerts.

266
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,160
Cause somebody let me know why I need
to alert the government as a fucking 46

267
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:49,000
year old man. Um, oh Jesus Christ.

268
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,870
I had been fucking rag and today. Oh, let
me tell you, this guy's been pitching,

269
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:56,140
you know. Um, all right.

270
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:59,290
So here's some of the things that people
wanted me to go off on this week. Um,

271
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,810
they wanted me to talk about,
oh, I forgot to mention, hey,

272
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm going to be doing an all things
comedy live. We'll do it live. Fuck it.

273
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,270
We'll do it live. We're doing it down
at the comedy store next Wednesday,

274
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,100
May 27th. All right. I'm coming off 19
shows and I'm bringing my fucking a game.

275
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,110
All right, Mr. Um, no,
I got, I got some, uh,

276
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,420
I get sort of new bits that have
funny shit to do. Um, and a whatever.

277
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,380
We're going to go down there.
We're going to,

278
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,850
we're going to sell the fucking place out.

279
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,260
It's in the main room at the comedy store,
Louis C k just to the special there.

280
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:33,130
So,
uh,

281
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,990
the already famous room has now become
even more famous with the release of his

282
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:41,270
special. So, uh, we're riding
on his coattails down there. Um,

283
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,760
so come on down May 27th,
the all things comedy live show,

284
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:50,710
it's a sponsored by some fucking
beer. I can't remember who, whatever.

285
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:54,330
I'm the worst when it comes to this shit.
But anyways, I'll be down there. Um,

286
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,590
I'll be there. So people
wanted me to talk about, um,

287
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,210
some of these cleo get over there
and lay down. You fucking maniac.

288
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,400
Don't ever let your dog sleep in
the bed with you at that point.

289
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,310
They think they're a person and they just
look at you like they look at you like

290
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:15,730
that paying rent now, you
know, it's fucking ridiculous.

291
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,770
So anyways, um, speaking of that whole
fucking thing about like the pink lady,

292
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,710
the pink ladies, um, people
wanted me to talk about this, um,

293
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,660
to go off on this shit, but I mean,
didn't you already know that this was,

294
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,730
I don't even know if this is a legal
government says for cancer charities are

295
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:34,564
Shams.

296
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,803
MMM.

297
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,430
All right. Well in Washington are
rare. Joint Action with attorneys,

298
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,190
attorney generals from
each of the 50 states.

299
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,780
The Federal Trade Commission says
for cancer charities a shut up.

300
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,140
Oh my God. What did I do?
Why is it talking to me?

301
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,790
How do you hit mute on this
fucking thing? Oh God. I know.

302
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,680
This is just going to come
back and haunt me. Um, oh,

303
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:07,410
here it is. It's one of these fucking
commercials. You can't shut off right.

304
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,480
There you go. Well, I can't, I shut
you off. Why can't I shut you off?

305
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,920
Don't I have a say? I turned
it down right? I do mute.

306
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,250
I have the power and then I scroll
you down so I don't watch your fucking

307
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:25,210
message. Um, anyways, in a rare joint
action with attorney, blah, blah, blah,

308
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:25,431
blah.

309
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:30,431
I just said for cancer charities run by
extended members of the same family con

310
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,891
donors out of $187 million from 2008 to
2012 these guys were making like Derek

311
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,950
Jeter salary between the four of them
and spent almost nothing to help actual

312
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,910
cancer patients.

313
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,230
Each of the charities charged with
the subject of extensive reporting.

314
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,770
What we charged a word,

315
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,530
the subject of extensive reporting
by CNN in 2013 and in an instant,

316
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:59,040
CNN pat themselves on
the back and an instant,

317
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,160
none of the four charities
in each instance,

318
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:03,750
none of the four charities would comment.

319
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,070
We were ordered out of the building at
the cancer fund of America in Knoxville,

320
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:08,904
Tennessee.

321
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,220
I love Knoxville and where the object
of an obscene gesture by the CEO of the

322
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:18,420
breast cancer society in Mesa,
Arizona. How funny is that?

323
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,840
You fucking running a charity to
raise money for breast cancer.

324
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,960
You taken most of the money and then you
have no comment to the press and when

325
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:32,610
they show up, you flip him.
The bird. Good Lord. Ah,

326
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,760
it's always good to see somebody that
you know is going to be a little further

327
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,490
down and held in. You are, you know what
I mean? It gives you a little bit of hope.

328
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,780
Like I'm not that bad.

329
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,770
God can only be so mad at me when this
guy's coming down the pike. Right.

330
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,530
Then he luck. He'll die right
before me. I might sneak by. Um,

331
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,120
you know what's funny is that the level
of stealing that these guys had to do

332
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:58,560
before they got caught,
the fact that they were taking like 97%,

333
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,910
because I feel like the NFL is so fucking
big and so fucking powerful that they

334
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:07,380
can continue to do this pink shit if it's
true. This is all alleged, by the way,

335
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:08,881
you know,

336
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:13,410
if they're taking the level that people
are saying in the 90 percentile on all

337
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:18,000
their pink horse shit, um,
you know what I mean? I mean,

338
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't know that they,
they NFLs right.

339
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:22,260
Just below a bank as far
as they're not going to,

340
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,780
they're not going to take these guys down.
That's the bread and circus.

341
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,040
That's what keeps everybody fucking
occupied while these banker comes,

342
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,180
do whatever they want. Right. Um, anyway,

343
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:36,180
so I dunno.
I know saint Jude is a good one.

344
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,860
I know the Jimmy Fund is a good one.
I know Cam Neely Denis Leary,

345
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:45,330
that cancer house is a great one.
Um, I'm just sticking with those.

346
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,070
I'm just sticking with another that,
you

347
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,290
know what I mean?
If I want to fucking,

348
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,810
okay.

349
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,780
You know, give money to veterans,
have a walk up to a veteran.

350
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,200
I think that's the best way to make sure
they actually get the fucking money.

351
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,170
How about that everybody?
How about we do it that way?

352
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,290
How about rather than the fucking NFL,

353
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,830
charging these people to come out on the
field and fucking Yammer on about that

354
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:11,480
bullshit and then knowing that they're
going to take this skim out. Right.

355
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,460
They like casino, right? They get
in their taste. Charlie fucking him.

356
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,520
You may be popped your fucking
eye out for Charlie fucking up.

357
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,060
That's what they're doing, right? Skimming
off the top. Just fucking walk right up.

358
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,580
I don't know how to do this.
Gotta be a way to do it.

359
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:28,500
Can you just walk into
a veteran's hospital?

360
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,210
Okay.

361
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,390
She can walk in with a
bad catch. All right. Oh,

362
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,530
Nate said or cut out the middle man.

363
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,980
Fucking go directly to them.

364
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,340
Okay.

365
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,840
They wouldn't want that.
Wouldn't want it that way.

366
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,570
Then they can't track the fucking
money in tax the shit out of it.

367
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,760
Oh goodness. You know, it's been awhile
since I've been this negative, you know,

368
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,790
probably since the last Thursday
afternoon, just before Friday,

369
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,970
Monday morning podcast possibly.
Um,

370
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,870
that's gotta be fucking,
I mean, Jesus Christ,

371
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,830
I wonder if those people are like such
psychos that they can actually sleep at

372
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:05,890
night. You know what I mean? I've done
a lot of fucked up shit in my life,

373
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,040
but it keeps me up at night. That's
my one saving grace. I will sit down,

374
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,610
I'll talk in my sleep, I'll grind my
teeth if I fuck up. You know what I mean?

375
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,970
You know, it bugs me. These
people like they, I mean,

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,220
I can't imagine just sitting
there because if you told a few,

377
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,290
if you're raising the kind of
money that they will raise it.

378
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,280
You know what I mean? You know? And
one of them was like a father son,

379
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:28,360
combination two different fucking charity.
So he taught his son the ropes, right?

380
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:31,720
Like Marlon Brando down
to fucking, uh, help, uh,

381
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:35,770
Chino Godfather one, godfather
two. Right. You know,

382
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,880
they gotta be just sitting there going
like Jesus Christ at night after the

383
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,420
accepted yet another award or
at one of those Tom Cruise,

384
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:46,180
buck Rogers things put around
their fucking neck, you know,

385
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,740
tirelessly working against
the fight against cancer.
Then at some point, you know,

386
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,030
you got to stand up there

387
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,970
giving a speech to people
going, you know, each year,

388
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,100
hundreds of thousands of people.
I don't know how much it is.

389
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,170
I don't really research it
cause I'm keeping all the bike,

390
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,160
get diagnosed with some form of
cancer that I'm not familiar with.

391
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,500
Yeah.

392
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,420
Each year you guys give me body.

393
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,820
Okay.

394
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,950
And I go out and get a cigar boat,

395
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,250
but most of the money that's left after
I buy that bulb goes towards fighting,

396
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,250
uh,
in step cancer,

397
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,100
a very rare form of cancer that affects
a couple of feet every year in Laos that

398
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:36,500
we want to stop it. Thank you for
helping us at, uh, believe me.

399
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,740
I appreciate this for ward.
Thank you.

400
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,030
It God bless America.
Um, what the fuck I'm

401
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,260
talking about here?
Uh,

402
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,490
how far into this fucking thing am
I? This. This was just a dumb idea.

403
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,350
I should have gotten a better
mood before I did this.

404
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,910
It's probably what I should've done,
right. You know, and I was getting dope.

405
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,480
All right, so I'm back in fucking
la. I've got to tell you something.

406
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,720
You know what needs to stop?
Does Anybody Flown Virgin lately?

407
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,200
And Dude, they made like a
fucking 22 minute music video

408
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,273
about

409
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,260
putting your seatbelt on.
There's a part where they start,

410
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,420
there's singing,
and then there's wrapping,

411
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:22,750
and then there's a robot
part and then the robot goes,

412
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:26,500
this robot wrap is over and you're
thinking, Oh God, thank God it's over.

413
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,680
And then they just go and ready to go.

414
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,670
Put your fucking seat belt.
All right.

415
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,930
And there's all that Christina
Aguilera over singing,

416
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,040
doing all of that fucking
shit, pointing it notes. It's,

417
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,190
it's so fucking loud. You know,
he goes, those fucking doses.

418
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,590
We have those Bose headphones.

419
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,810
I just never could fucking
buy one of those things.

420
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:53,000
That's the first time it was like,
I really need to get a pair of those.

421
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,340
I need a pair of earplugs
and will I actually sit?

422
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,520
I fucking put my elbows on my knees and
I jammed my fingers into my ears and I

423
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:04,400
hum for five minutes
waiting for it to stop.

424
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,160
Um, yeah, I don't know.

425
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,760
You'll kills me as I was sitting
next to my wife and she loved it.

426
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,710
She thought it was great.

427
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,220
Okay.

428
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,190
And I was like, there you go.
Right there. There's the balance,

429
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,560
the balance of this relationship.
I fucking hate everything.
You know, like knee.

430
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:24,750
If she went down there,
she'd be like, oh, it's cool.

431
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:28,680
It's like a barbershop 2.0
I will make an appointment.

432
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,300
What is your name? Well,
it's very nice to meet you.

433
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,620
What do I do? I fucking store Mako.
Was this a fucking hair salon?

434
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,970
And I storm out. All right. And
in the end I still need a haircut.

435
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,110
So who won bill? Who Want to
get lost? Your temper again.

436
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,850
Who won and who lost? You think that
fuck. Oh, down the street gives a shit.

437
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,491
Sky's making these,

438
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:58,491
taking reservations down there like he's
got a fucking a pork chop to die for.

439
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,470
Right like you some fucking
unbelievable restaurant.

440
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,823
MMM.

441
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,020
All right. Whenever the fuck
you, what are you going?

442
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,790
What are you gonna fucking do, you
know? Oh, by the way, you know what I,

443
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,530
why don't I have anything here?
Hey Nia.

444
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,933
Yeah.

445
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,130
Can you grab my wallet?

446
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,620
I'm going to take a video of
this goalie mask and he just,

447
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,580
I that this kid made Jesse custom. I
know. I keep talking about them, but uh,

448
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,070
I got this right in my office
now I got to take the video of,

449
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,760
it's fucking unbelievable. I, one
of my wallet, if he didn't mind.

450
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,960
It's where we keep all the wallet
keys and stuff like that. Clear.

451
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:38,950
I'll get over here. Get over here. Clean
up. All right. Get over here and lay down.

452
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,600
Yo, you know your neck, Clara. Hi.

453
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,640
What the fuck is wrong with this
fucking dog? Cleo? Get in there. Oh,

454
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,690
this is embarrassing. What
are the podcasts? You just
fucking walked away? Pillows.

455
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,930
Cleo. So every time
we're around, she thinks

456
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,753
she wants you to last night.

457
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,730
Oh,
you just stupid excuses.

458
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,943
Four.

459
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,730
All right. See that? She just goes
off. She just wants to go outside.

460
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,980
I'm sitting there flipping out.
I don't buy it.

461
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,460
That's why she jumps up and down all over
company cause she has to take a piss.

462
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,890
Um, anyways. Oh, here's a
cadets. I mentioned this
restaurant here on broad street,

463
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,730
right? Speaking of a pork chop to
die for in Boston, Massachusetts,

464
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,360
one 31 broad street,
Boston, Massachusetts,

465
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,440
head chef and row. Go
in there, check it out.

466
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:40,650
Tell him I said tell him the Thursday
afternoon, just before Friday,

467
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:44,990
Monday morning podcast. That's just
jacket in on yet set. Yeah. All right.

468
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,990
Um, so anyways, well we're
winding down here. Uh,

469
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,990
have you guys been watching
any of the hockey playoffs?

470
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:55,920
I finally got back into them now that my,
uh, my run there in Boston finally, uh,

471
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,690
came to an end. Um, what
did I watch last night?

472
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,690
I watched Tampa versus the
rages and I turned it on in the,

473
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:09,150
uh, the, uh, halfway
through the third period,

474
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,370
and I saw Tampa score to go up five
to four, and I thought they had him.

475
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:18,270
And then the rangers came back with his
fucking goal was like a minute left.

476
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,160
Playoffs. I've been sick.
Right. And then, uh,

477
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,090
over time I fucking flipped out
when Santa scored, you know,

478
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,470
I don't know why I got to
root for somebody and I've
got to go for the underdog.

479
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,800
But I also like the rangers. I
would, might see the ranges when it,

480
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,060
although that might make Rappaport happy.
So I dunno, he doesn't watch hockey.

481
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,220
Look at rapid portraits, that
guy, you know what I mean?

482
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,630
Does that guy look like he even
remotely gives a fuck about hockey?

483
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,740
Um, he would talk shit about
though. I can imagine. Um, anyways,

484
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,770
what else? Uh, and then I've been
watching, uh, Chicago and Anaheim Dude,

485
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:56,730
if Anaheim,
Anaheim one game two,

486
00:28:56,731 --> 00:29:00,870
I say they win the Stanley Cup. That's
how big that game was. What did they hit?

487
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:04,020
Four or five posts and those,
those uh,

488
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,890
three overtimes um,
hey, you know something.

489
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,110
Did you guys see when shy
headbutted the puck in?

490
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:13,080
That's one of the few times I was
right on a controversial thing.

491
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:14,760
I was able to figure it out was like,
well wait a minute.

492
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:18,060
If he can't kick it in is the
way can use your fucking head.

493
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,640
Um, but then I'd never seen anybody use
their head other than Dominic Kaushik.

494
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,870
Um, so anyways, so I'm still
sticking with it. I think, uh,

495
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,240
I think the ducks are going to beat
Chicago only because Chicago has it been

496
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,270
scoring a bunch of goals on him.
Um,

497
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,310
the fact that they've
been hanging with them,

498
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,040
they've been close games and that type
of shit. I just, I don't know why.

499
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,560
I just feel like Chicago might be getting
a little old. Who the fuck's can do?

500
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,290
I was so busy. I barely watched any
hockey. I'm just going with my guts.

501
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:52,670
I still say the ducks and then the Cavs,
the Cavaliers are going to fucking win.

502
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,270
Cavaliers are going to win and Jason Law
head is going to cry like a baby and he

503
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:02,900
will have every field have
Cavaliers championship pajamas.

504
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,520
You know those Cleveland guys,

505
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:08,360
they'd been waiting their whole
fucking lives run for your lives.

506
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,160
All right, this is the Thursday
afternoon, Monday morning podcast,

507
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,600
whatever the fuck you call,
just checking on you on yet. Uh,

508
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:16,640
we're now going to play
a couple of classics,

509
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,890
couple of classics from a podcasting
days gone by. I want to thank you all,

510
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:23,090
you guys for listening once again,

511
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,370
thanks to everybody and then
amazing run up there in Boston.

512
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,060
Thank you to bill bloomin' Reich,
his daughter, Taylor, and uh,

513
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,060
everybody down there at the, uh,
at the Wilbur theater. Everybody,

514
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:38,780
I just had it. I had such a
fucking great time. Uh, Raul,

515
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:42,950
Johnny Ali, you guys down there. Thank
you guys for just a wonderful week.

516
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,260
And uh, I know I said I'd never do that
run again, but uh, I'm already thinking,

517
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:52,940
Hey, you know, maybe every couple of years
make it a little tradition. Who knows?

518
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,390
I would schedule a day off or two
the next time. I do it, but uh,

519
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,200
but it was still fun. All right, so I'm
sticking with it. Sticking with the ducks.

520
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,040
I'm sticking with the Cavaliers
and uh, yeah, fuck it.

521
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,560
You want to have a hipster barbershop?
We got to make appointments.

522
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:09,680
Wasn't I really just mad? Because they
wouldn't do what I want them to do.

523
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,180
I still do this. You should have a
different colored barbershop sign them.

524
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:17,690
But that little fucking red,
white and blue stripe thing going up.

525
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:20,900
It should be something diff. Something
hipstery little mustaches in there.

526
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,180
You can't. All right, you guys have a
great fucking weekend. All right. See Ya.

527
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,790
Hey, wait a second. I forgot to read a
couple of fucking advertisements here.

528
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,360
I didn't realize I had a couple of
ads I got to read here. You know,

529
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,040
it was fucking funny.
I'm just sitting there going like,

530
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:40,870
why is my day going so fucking
started off school? Good.

531
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:43,220
And that's just cause I'm
allowing everything to affect me,

532
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:47,030
so I need to fucking relax. So I was
sitting there, it's like, all right dude,

533
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:50,660
just relax. Take a deep breath and
then you know what? This fucking,

534
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,310
that's stupid fucking song. I
Dunno if it's Peter, Paul and Mary.

535
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,360
I don't know if it's fucking, uh,
Paul Simon and the guy with the hair.

536
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,920
All right. The bridge over 12
water guy. What's his fucking name?

537
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,840
Their fucking Robbie Krieger's cousin.

538
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,670
They had the same fucking hair was
like pubic hair bows on their heads.

539
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:11,670
Okay.

540
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,640
What's his name there?
Simon and Garfunkel?

541
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,543
No.

542
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,970
Yeah. Second Garfunkel and Oates.
That was fucking me up. Anyway,

543
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,890
so I'm sitting there
trying to relax and all,

544
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:29,000
I just start here in this stupid fucking
song in my head, you know, slow down.

545
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,470
You go into fast. He got
the, make that bone in line.

546
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,770
Wait.

547
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,390
See any reason why so many focus got
the fucking guitar smashed the head.

548
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,770
Maybe it just happened in animal house,

549
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:44,430
but you'd like to think that it happened
a lot. Why should it happen? Belt? Why?

550
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,350
Because your angry.
They can't be fucking baby there.

551
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,020
They're more advanced beings.
And you are.

552
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,680
Yeah,

553
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,110
I dunno.
Maybe they just ate some fucking weed.

554
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,440
Video Doorbell. Everybody. I know.
This sounds creepy. This is a new one.

555
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,740
It.
W we'll insert dinging sound.

556
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,850
This is the sound of a package. Oh, what?

557
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,990
Someone else is going to insert that
Ding Dong sound or Zeiss Ding Dong Song.

558
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:15,180
Is that what the sound I was supposed
to fucking do that video doorbell being

559
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:16,014
ball.

560
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,090
This is the sound of a package
being delivered or friends
coming over for dinner.

561
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,260
But also it's the sound of
someone planning to rob you blind.

562
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,310
Well, what kind of a cat burglar
rings the doorbell and I don't,

563
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,690
she didn't want people to not know.

564
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,090
These people aren't going to
last long in this fucking thing.

565
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Over 95% of home breakins happen during
the day after someone rings the doorbell

566
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,560
at Burglars. Almost always start by
ringing your doorbell. Oh really?

567
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,550
Isn't that convenient?

568
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:51,490
People selling doorbells to see
if anyone of someone's home.

569
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,950
Okay.

570
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,660
Oh, okay. I'm sorry. You know what?
Maybe I'm Lee is already laughing at me.

571
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,740
They had come in here and help me
save this. This is just, I'm sorry.

572
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:04,490
Doorbell people. Video
Doorbell guys, I should relate.

573
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,760
I should hear you out before I judge you.
Right?

574
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,810
Having the worst day.

575
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,910
Hang on. Hang on. This is classic.

576
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:17,910
You had burglars reading or in the
beginning you don't read it first,

577
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:18,910
so you get a handle on it.

578
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:23,110
You just start reading it and you know
you're not good at just reading cold

579
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,090
first of all.
Second of all,

580
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:25,900
yeah,

581
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,250
you have no patience.

582
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,820
So you can't even just be bothered to
know what your range to come in and help

583
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,470
me out,
not read me the riot act

584
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,760
and burglars. I didn't know if
he knew this read line by line.

585
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,890
I didn't know this at burglars.

586
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:44,300
Almost always start by ringing the
doorbell to see if someone's hope before

587
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:46,910
pillaging your possession. Just cause
you'd be come to the door. They, oh,

588
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:50,570
I'm sorry. I thought you were at
all cause I was going to rob you.

589
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,650
Lucky for you sucks for your neighbor.
Um,

590
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,440
when the ring video doorbell,
uh, with the ring video doorbell,

591
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:04,910
you can see and talk to anyone at your
door from anywhere in the world using

592
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:05,720
your smartphone.
Oh,

593
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,720
so I guess you can pretend you o
rings advanced motion detection.

594
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,280
Shut up a large shoe.
Even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell,

595
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,260
it's like caller id for your home.

596
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,240
Please share a personal story or how
this could help someone you love.

597
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,483
Well

598
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,973
yeah,

599
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,610
I a one time my uncle,
uh,

600
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,690
he was living in a shack and he
didn't have fucking dollar. Whatever.

601
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,540
Installing ring takes minutes and it
works with either your current wiring or

602
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,500
built in rechargeable

603
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,160

your home with the video doorbell Time

606
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,790
So you look at that Time magazine.

607
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,070

from your smart phone or what have you.

609
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,370
So you can just sort of, yeah, if
someone rings the doorbell, wait, when

610
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,490
you ring the doorbell.

611
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,400
Oh well,
well well yeah.

612
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,010
A cat cause kettle cow calls Kit Kat Cole,

[inaudible] how do you have peace of mind?

619
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,190
So somebody rings the doorbell and you
put it on video and he has an ax and he

620
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:41,380
just go,
I could see,

621
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,850
I see what you look like and
I'm in here calling the cops.

622
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,160
He hangs his head. It drags the
ax down the fucking walk. No,

623
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,300
I used to be. Now that makes sense
that they would reign to make sure.

624
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,760
And if nobody's home, they
like our grand. I can,

629
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,780
Well here's a really cool opportunity I
had to share with you driving with Uber.

630
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,920
Uber's that popular smart phone app
that connects riders with drivers.

631
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,730
I take Uber a bunch.
I love them by the way.

632
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:30,800
And in chatting with
the different drivers,

633
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,850
ed chatting with the diff and in
chatting with the different drivers,

634
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:35,331
swear he goes,

635
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:39,470
says that some of them have really
interesting stories as to why they,

636
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,750
they drive you Uber soda cab drivers.

637
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,700
Most of them fucking came from like war
towards places that our youth to be a

638
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:50,630

own boss. They are in great money.

639
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:53,210
It was the worst accident ever.
It's easy to stat.

640
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,800
You just need a cat and a license.
Oh my God. Catholic driving.

641
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:02,120
Uber driving with Uber is great for
anyone that needs flexibility. Parents,

642
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,640
this is really easy way to work
around your family schedule.

643
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:07,460
This is the shit right here.
Back in the day we know what this job was.

644
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:10,310
You delivered afternoon papers,
picked up a couple of hundred bucks.

645
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:13,610
This is the best way, right? You get to
meet people and out your resume students,

646
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:15,320
you can make some extra
money between classes.

You would start hurting series.
Do they really need to say that?

654
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,040
You want to be a butcher? 81 of them

That was all right.
Hey,

660
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,480
doorbell. One might might need to
do that one a couple more times,

661
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:05,010
but it was really good.

662
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,070
These kids today, they don't like
excitement. Back in the day you were like,

663
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:14,150
you're like, who is it?
I hear you breathing.

664
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,750
Who is it?
Are you trying to rob me?

665
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,750
You know what I've found, like sometimes
we get food, we get to the mic when they,

666
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,000
when we get food delivered, they'll,
they'll call from my cell phone,

667
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,040
we'll get food. What's
the limit we'll get, uh,

668
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,610
they'll call my cell phone and
be like, hi, I'm here. And I say,

669
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,260
did you rang the doorbell? And they're
like, no. And I'm like, what? Oh,

670
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:40,790
these kids today? Yeah. Just
ring the doorbell. Like that's
how you, that's how you,

671
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,380
uh, oh, that was sweet.

672
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,550
I just find it weird that they would
call and not just ring the doorbell when

673
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,180
they're here.

674
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,660
Oh yes. So much to think about it. That's
weird though, right? Yeah, it is. Well,

675
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,340
whatever I'll just do it
is making me sound old.

676
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:56,330
Do you want to sound old with me?
Oh yeah. Well that's true. Do you?

677
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,220
I went to a barbershop when
I couldn't really feel it.

678
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,180
It will be screaming
about it to get my head,

679
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:02,670
but I definitely heard you screaming.
And the guy said,

680
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,790
I didn't have a fucking appointment. And
he, he goes, you have an appointment.

681
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,550
It's a barber shop.
You don't need a fucking appointment,

682
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,950
but you know somebody is high
Falutin places they get, you know,

683
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,870
they work on appointment.
It's not like, you know

684
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,010
barbershop. You're a, you're a
hair salon, right? Yeah. I know.

685
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,760
We're a salon that does my hair.
Yeah.

686
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,180
Did you go into an actual barbershop
though? Was it just one of these?

687
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,220
It was a fucking barbershop that gay,

688
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:29,110
the little swirly sign
and it said barbershop.

689
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,570
Oh yeah. So she, you should be
able to walk in there and be like,

690
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,150
let me get a haircut. And they'd be
like, yeah, have a seat, grab a paper.

691
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,880
Nice. Justified on one. Number two
should have Tom Brady had been suspended.

692
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,220
I have no idea as it's about deflate gate.
How do you know about,

693
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:45,840
you only watch sports? Well I had deflate
gate has been all over the Internet.

694
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,743
What happened?

695
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Something about football being deflated
and that mess other people up and the

696
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,320
Patriots are being accused
of being behind it.

697
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,790
Bill Bellacheck that's good.
Yeah.

698
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,990
Oh yeah, that was great. You pretty much
had it. Why was he suspended though?

699
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,870
You Tom Brady? Yeah, cause
he's flooded. You know,

700
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:12,920
because he looks like a war hero and
astronaut and a quarterback and a movie

701
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:17,420
star all in one. That's why are
you blaming this on haters? Yeah.

702
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,460
Well I don't understand how fucking,
uh,

703
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:23,360
an organization that never fucking
paid taxes for the first fucking 60,

704
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,980
80 years of their existence.

705
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,620
All of a sudden it's gonna
start wagging their fingers.

706
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:30,980
Are People keeping all the pink cancer
money for that Goddamn yachts hire

707
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,130
the same at Tom. Brady
is suspended. You still

708
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,060
didn't answer that because Jim or stays
a fucking baby and he weighed the balls.

709
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,730
Do you have a play a
board game with somebody?

710
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,910
You have to play a board
game with somebody and then
you win and in the end they

711
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,020
got to fucking find out some reason why
that they lost and it has something to

712
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:51,190
do with you cheated and they'll
say like, oh, Tom Brady,

713
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,580
like secretly deflated the ball
beforehand. They don't know he did.

714
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,310
They just have circumstances that
maybe possibly could have known.

715
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:01,760
It was basically like, like in baseball,
some guys shaved the handle down,

716
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:04,740
some people put Pine Tar. It was
literally that level of Shit, man,

717
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,680
they lost by 38 fucking
points. Reminds me of uh, uh,

718
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,590
what's that Jim Carey movie where he
was like the liar liar? No, no. The,

719
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,330
the one ace Ventura.
Wasn't that the one where there's a no,

720
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,120
somebody kidnapped Dan Marino.
Right. And then like Sean Young,

721
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:27,500
the actress or places out lays this out.
That's what that reminds me of. Yeah.

722
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,990
That was like a fundamentally she was
claiming that it was sabotaged because

723
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,990
it's supposed to have the license you,

724
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,010
it's a fucking pony and don't
show and it's over. And the show,

725
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,220
is that what it's pony pony
and dog show dog and pony show.

726
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,860
Okay.

727
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,780
The ponies. The headliner. It's,

728
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,230
but the saying his dog
and pony not pony in dog,

729
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,250
dog and pony. Look that up.
I don't have to look it up.

730
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,300
I'm telling you it's correct. Oh,
fucking believe that. Pony and dogs.

731
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,270
Thank you. Thank you
for stopping by, by, by.

732
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,980
All right.
You guys have a great weekend.

733
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,870
[inaudible]

734
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,510
of self.
For the last five years,

735
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,920
I've been teaching guitar lessons full
time at a very large music school in

736
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,430
Chicago.
Um,

737
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,190
there are over 100 music teachers at
the school with about 5,000 students.

738
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:58,700
Every session,
half of those students are under 18.

739
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,540
The school has been around for over
50 years and is globally recognized.

740
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,480
We'll see if I could figure that out.
Was Chicago.

741
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:06,890
I don't know that one was
going to guess Berkeley.

742
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,580
Now I get an email from the new director
of the school is saying all of the

743
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:15,460
staff are required to get their thumbs
scanned by some company called bio

744
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,400
metric.

745
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,763
What

746
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,770
biometric scans your thumbs
into their watch system.

747
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,290
We all already had

748
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,250
background checks done when we were hired,

749
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,460
but now they argue we
need to have this done.

750
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,450
Apparently all of the public school
teachers in their entire city are being

751
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,010
forced to do this as well.

752
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,080
Basically anyone who is around any
younger who was around any younger,

753
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,040
please people please proofread your shit.
You make me sound dumb.

754
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,180
I'm already dumb enough.

755
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:53,570
Basically anyone who was around any
younger people for a profession is now

756
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:58,860
mandated by their employee to get
in this creepy biometric system.

757
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,580
You see this shit. You guys notice this,
all this fucking screaming and yelling.

758
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:09,990
We do during every single election that
comes around to pick the Democrat or the

759
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,010
other Republican.

760
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,840
It doesn't make a difference because when
the real shit goes down like approving,

761
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:20,310
giving biometrics the right to do this,
we don't get to vote on this.

762
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,550
They don't even tell us about it, so
just go with the law. It's mandatory.

763
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:24,450
You have to do this.

764
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,360
Okay.

765
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,970
Anyways, he says, I don't
want anything to high,

766
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:29,560
but the mental picture of all of us,

767
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,710
harmless musicians lining
up like fucking cattle.

768
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,940
Having some storm trooper assholes
scanning my thumbprint into some super

769
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:40,390
computer where it will stay
forever is really depressing.

770
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,680
Obviously this is all done in the name
of air quote, protecting the children,

771
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,350
but at what cost?
Here's my question for you.

772
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,170
I feel like this is my
moment to take a stand.

773
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,100
Should I make a deal big deal about this
and try to rally all the other teachers

774
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:58,660
to fight this or will I just look like I
have something to hide? Uh, it is really,

775
00:45:58,661 --> 00:46:02,290
really hard to get a job at this school,
so I'm scared to make waves.

776
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,830
Do you feel like this
protects kids from creeps?

777
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,690
I should mention then the schools, 50
year history, no incident of a teacher.

778
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,420
A student misconduct has been recorded.

779
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:17,600
Everyone knows that pedophiles
can't play an instrument. Lol. Uh,

780
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,520
and do you think um,
they are making priests get thumb scans?

781
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,710
I fucking bet. Not all joking aside,
I'm really bothered by this situation.

782
00:46:26,711 --> 00:46:28,540
What should I do, Bill? I don't know why.

783
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,880
The first thing I would do is
I would talk to other teachers.

784
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:31,990
Okay.

785
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,560
And see how they feel about it.
I think that's complete horseshit dude.

786
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,000
Okay.

787
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,270
They,

788
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:41,630
they have been basically working their
way towards this since they first came up

789
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:45,980
with photo id and social security
numbers and all of that shit.

790
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:50,690
It's all done under the whole guise of
organization in your own fucking safety

791
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,880
and it's complete horse shit.

792
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,050
It has to do with them eventually trying
to have a very few people be able to

793
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:04,320
make the decisions for all of us.

794
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:05,600
Yeah.

795
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,060
That's basically what's going on.
Okay.

796
00:47:08,061 --> 00:47:09,950
And the more information
they have about you,

797
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,550
the easier it is to be able to find
you. I mean, think about that shit.

798
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:14,660
They're going to have your thumbprint.

799
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:17,870
They know what you're fucking
fingerprint looks like. All right.

800
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,400
They're going to have an a visibility
to freeze your fucking bank account and

801
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:26,930
your cell phone as a God damn microchip
in it. Okay? So the second day,

802
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,020
I mean this is like of day shit and they
got these fucking robots that they'd

803
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:36,760
been working on that can outperform
human beings. I'm telling you,

804
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,100
our days are fucking number.
They are in jeopardy.

805
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:43,150
The other day they had two human beings
playing against a fucking computer.

806
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:50,990
Those two people, they're helping
human beings get phased out.

807
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,280
You should see I'm not competing,

808
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:55,970
gets a fucking computer so you can figure
out how it does against me and you can

809
00:47:55,971 --> 00:47:59,540
figure the computer's
weaknesses and strong points
so it can come back with even

810
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:02,870
more game. And you can pump it
back with more fucking information.

811
00:48:02,871 --> 00:48:07,280
So eventually I become fucking useless
unless of course I know how to build a

812
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:12,110
robot or know how to grease it's fucking
joints. Yeah, Dude. I think, yeah,

813
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:16,880
I think it would be a very uh,
noble thing if you complained about that.

814
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:19,850
I think people need to complain more.
I'm guilty of it.

815
00:48:19,851 --> 00:48:23,090
I fucking rant here on this podcast,
but I've never been to a protest,

816
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,310
but I don't think that it's right
that they, that they pass a lot.

817
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:27,740
Like whether you agree with that or not,

818
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,310
that's not something that they should
be able to pass without the voice of the

819
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:34,910
people. We should be able to
vote on something like that.
It's fucking ridiculous.

820
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,330
I just found out from my account the
other day after years of saying I'm not

821
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:42,260
doing my shit online cause I don't want
to put all that information online.

822
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,500
I now have no option.
I have to do it online.

823
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,090
You know, I don't want to put all
my fucking information online,

824
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:56,460
my tax ID numbers, my social
security numbers. You're
right at your fucking mind.

825
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,810
You're letting people in to
your entire financial history,

826
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,740
you'll let me Gigi or whole fucking God
knows what they can do with that and

827
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,670
they can ruin you. All right. I'll, I'm
doing is bitching here, but I don't know,

828
00:49:08,671 --> 00:49:11,190
that shit really stretched
fucking creepy as hell. Um,

829
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,480
I would talk to other people would
be like, dude, hey, you know what,

830
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:16,680
what do you think about this? You
know, sort of get it going. You know,

831
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:19,430
just like how they started the
revolution in this country. Hey,

832
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:23,440
what do you think about those red coats?
Yeah. Like they're kind of a yeah.

833
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:25,160
Ditch right. To kind of dicks. Yeah.

834
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,990
Sent me this email here

835
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,550
that was a inspired by the fact that I
was talking about this shit. And, uh,

836
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,840
here we go. Ask Bill Bill.
I am currently engaged,

837
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,130
but I'm kind of over it. Oh, Jesus.

838
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,940
Wow. I am glad. Let me
read that again. Let's,

839
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:14,680
let's all just take a deep breath and
let's take that a tank when it's time to

840
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:19,630
Jay age. Uh, let's take that
one. And again, uh, I am bill,

841
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:23,620
I am currently engaged
but I'm kind of over it.

842
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,550
Um, you know what, I might need
the help of a female on this one.

843
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,013
Hey Nia,

844
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:36,620
they know you want to help me on this one.
I've got a relationship question.

845
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,830
If it gets a feel and your girlfriend's
mad at you and you haven't even done

846
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:44,860
anything.
I think I just heard an exhale.

847
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,640
What's that? You can't talk cause
you voiced you making lunch. Oh okay.

848
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,273
Okay.

849
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,643
Are you

850
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,590
yeah, I'm recording right now. Yeah. And
you hit me with this attitude. I'm sorry.

851
00:50:57,591 --> 00:51:01,680
She what I want. I I just had

852
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,840
Jesus. This is getting really
awkward. Yeah. All right.

853
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:09,300
My is under the weather
and I actually forgot,

854
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,960
she told me she was under the weather
like 20 minutes ago and that's how self

855
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:17,580
absorbed I am. Cleo, get down. All
right. Just listen to this. Okay.

856
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:20,730
Cause I think I also need
like female help on this one.

857
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,460
Could you take your hands off your
hips and stop staring at me like that?

858
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,930
Come on. Do you not want to do
this if you don't want to do it?

859
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,760
Okay. Okay. Bill, I am currently engaged,

860
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:37,110
but I'm kind of over it.
She just laughed.

861
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,670
Huh? This is a female. This
is why I have you in here.

862
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,180
He just talked to the people with
your voice here. Hi. How are you?

863
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,080
Sound like Demi Moore.
I liked that.

864
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,980
You know what I already
talked about Andrew Mccartney,
right? Brought up rob Lowe.

865
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:56,070
I got the whole brat pack here. I,
why don't you, you don't trust me.

866
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,900
You got to look on your face.
Like you're not trusting me.

867
00:51:57,901 --> 00:51:59,580
Like I'm gonna make you
look stupid and I'm not.

868
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:04,170
I generally want your help on this.
It's a low budget podcast.

869
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:08,100
We only have one microphone. All
right? I'm currently engaged,

870
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:12,540
but I'm kinda over it. Um, I love him, but
our relationship isn't working anymore.

871
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,860
I keep making excuses.
Like my schedule has changed.

872
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:21,810
I'm working and going to school, so I'm
just stressed, et Cetera, et cetera.

873
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,440
But, uh, honestly the excuses
aren't working anymore.

874
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,720
I want us to get back to when we were
having fun and sex and not arguing.

875
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,070
He gets frustrated.

876
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,380
He gets frustrated with me when I don't
want to cuddle with him at night or fuck

877
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:39,780
them at 4:00 AM
when I,

878
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,790
when I have to get up at seven
in the morning to go to work, uh,

879
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,550
then come home at five and cook
him dinner and get to sleep by 11.

880
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:52,150
And then she writes, okay,
pause in the email. Um,

881
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,190
why does he want to fuck or cuddle
at 4:00 AM when I'm sleeping?

882
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,730
Is this like a guy thing?
I don't understand what he's thinking.

883
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,450
This is my argument. It's four in the
morning. Number two, he's half asleep,

884
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:06,420
which means I'll have to wake up
and get on top and do all the work.

885
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,380
What the fuck? Number three, if I don't
sleep, I'll be cranky in the morning.

886
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,730
Then I'll be mad at me because I'm being
a total bitch. And for, um, being, uh,

887
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:18,030
I like being alone.
I love sleeping by myself.

888
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,700
Granted in the beginning it
was fun to sleep next to him,

889
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:24,930
but now I want my own bed back.
I don't understand what it,

890
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,670
that he's thinking. Okay. Continuing.
I guess she was digressing here.

891
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,130
I'm almost done here. All right.
Are you enjoying this here? Okay.

892
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:34,650
Cause she's shaking it in.
She's got a very serious look on her face.

893
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,890
This is why I brought her in an expert.
This is like Oprah,

894
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,020
our relationship expert. Okay, here we go.
Uh, we are planning to move in together,

895
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,370
but it's not a good idea because I'm
not really in the relationship anymore.

896
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,260
I'd rather be alone. In addition,
is there an ax murderer or outside?

897
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:59,970
In addition,
I just really realized that that was,

898
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:05,730
yeah. All right. In addition, um, come
close to them. Like, Sweetie, here we go.

899
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:09,060
Sit down and take a load off. You're
not feeling well. Uh, in addition,

900
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,310
he's the first man I've ever had sex with.

901
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,640
Don't read this cause you read way
faster than me. Just listen to my,

902
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,620
the soothing tones of my awful voice.

903
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,970
You just snort it when you laugh.
That's adorable.

904
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,810
He's the only person she's ever had.
Yeah. Now don't, don't comment yet. Okay.

905
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,350
We're building it up. We got the
listener's riveted at this point. Okay.

906
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:32,880
Someone's being hacked to
death outside. Um, in addition,

907
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:36,900
he's the first man I've ever had
sex with. Uh, I am faithful to him,

908
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:39,750
but when we have days like these,

909
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:42,090
I think is this really as good as it gets?

910
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,330
I'm sure he's thinking the same
thing when I'm being an asshole.

911
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,770
That's the femur right there.
That's the really got to give the chain,

912
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:54,000
saw a full fucking force there. Um, oh.

913
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:58,050
Well they did taken out that tree
over there. Okay. Yeah. The sick tree.

914
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:02,430
We had a sick tree tree had aids and r
block and just keeled over. It's very sad.

915
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,360
We stood out there with candles
and had tree aids. It had treated,

916
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,720
it was HIV positive.

917
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,640
I'm not making light of AIDS making Jesus.

918
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,980
Jesus. I don't know who to get more
offended that you're trashing Jim Norton.

919
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:23,460
Are you saying that I'm ripping them off?
You do not.

920
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,840
Why is my voice cracking? You do that.
All right, let's get back this. I Dunno,

921
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,440
I could totally be seeing this
from a fucked up spot. Actually.

922
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:35,330
I think I am because he's great now.
She's going back this way.

923
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,200
She must have her period this week.
She's all over the map out.

924
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,090
Did you really have to punch me
right fucking there? All right.

925
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,140
He gives me whatever I want.
And as far as material things go,

926
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,980
typical broad, he buys
me stuff. He's gray.

927
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,380
I don't want to fuck him anymore,
but look at all this stuff. Uh,

928
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,370
um, he listens to me. Sarah says,

929
00:55:58,371 --> 00:56:01,170
I'm taking this one seriously because
I'm think girls in a serious situation

930
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:04,620
here. That's why I keep saying serious
as many times as they can in a sentence.

931
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,270
Seriously.
Um,

932
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:11,100
he listens to me whenever I wine and he
has conversations with me that show me

933
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:15,150
life from a different perspective and
he's willing to work at our relationship

934
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,680
and is committed to me. Those are
the things that I love about him.

935
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:24,920
Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh,
Duh, Duh. Right. To me,

936
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:30,730
those are the things that I love
about him. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

937
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,370
Dah, Dah, Dah. Right. I am getting
through it. I got to do fifth.

938
00:56:35,371 --> 00:56:37,680
She just gave me the same,
wrap it up. All right, fine.

939
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,080
You're speaking for the
listeners. I'm going, uh,

940
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:43,020
but I can't live like this anymore.
This girl is all over the map.

941
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,390
I told him once that I wanted some space,

942
00:56:45,391 --> 00:56:49,140
like I wanted to wake up alone some
days and he blew it out of proportion.

943
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:53,940
It says, okay, I'll give you plenty of
space. Let's break up. He did that shit.

944
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,650
Um,
and then she said,

945
00:56:55,651 --> 00:57:00,090
I asked if that's what he
wanted because that wasn't yeah,

946
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,400
because that wasn't looking like the
worst option in the world. Oh Jesus.

947
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:08,390
But his voice cracked and he
said, no, that's not what I want.

948
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,510
So long story short,
I'm still waking up to him.

949
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,290
He still asked why we can't fuck
at 4:00 AM and we're still engaged.

950
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,980
I'm willing to say if we can make a
few adjustments in our relationship,

951
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,090
I'm willing to stay. If we could, uh,

952
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,200
if we can make a few adjustments
in our relationship. Otherwise,

953
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,290
how do I get out and hurt him the least.
All right,

954
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,870
here we go. I brought in a
female for this one cause I know,

955
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:34,870
I know what you want me to tell you
what I'm thinking first. No. Okay.

956
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:42,190
No I don't. Um, she needs
to break up with him. Okay.

957
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:46,450
And why? Because she doesn't love him
anymore. She's not in love with them.

958
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,030
She recognizes all his
good traits and stuff.

959
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:53,740
But that's not a reason to
stay with someone if she
can't give him what he needs

960
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,590
because at no point did she say well no,

961
00:57:56,591 --> 00:58:00,340
she talks about him wanting to cuddle
and us know rather I think the 4:00 AM

962
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:01,240
doesn't mean anything.

963
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:04,840
I think he just wants to be close to her
and that's the one time that maybe she

964
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:09,841
slows down and is in bed and that's where
he can wrap his arms around her and do

965
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:13,720
all that sort of thing. Cause it sounds
like she's super busy all the time.

966
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,120
So he wants to spend that time with her.
So let's stay on track here. So what,

967
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,310
why do you feel like she
should break up with him? She,

968
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,140
she's not in love with him
anymore. Clearly. She's not
in love with him anymore.

969
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,240
She loves him. He's a great guy. Um, but
she's not in love with him. Yeah. No,

970
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:29,500
she is not off.
Yeah.

971
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,620
I think that she bringing up the good
traits as she's trying to convince herself

972
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:35,020
to stay in the relationship because
she doesn't want to hurt him. Yes.

973
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,530
She wants to be alone. She's not
ready to get married and that's fine.

974
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:41,680
He's going to be heartbroken no matter
what because obviously he is in love with

975
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:45,070
her. He wants to work
it out. But it's Cliche,

976
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:48,250
but it's like if she really loves him
then she will let him go so that he can

977
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:52,870
find somebody that wants to do all that
kind of stuff that she's not because

978
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:56,260
she's a bad person. Wait a minute. Wait,
before we get going, before we get going,

979
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:00,390
let's, what's the, what's the, uh, what,

980
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,680
this is a great topic for the podcast.

981
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,590
Breaking up with somebody
sucks cause you get, you know,

982
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:07,530
they're going to start whimpering,
you know,

983
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:11,770
when you're going to drive their tiers
with the dirty pages of a TV guide. And,

984
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:15,870
uh, I don't know. I was thinking about a
coffee table. What would be on the car?

985
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,020
I always break up girls near a
coffee table. Yeah. Well yeah.

986
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,750
You're not gonna be sitting on the bed.
You on the bed. You don't want to fuck no,

987
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:27,010
I'm sorry. I just, sometimes he'd
dump shit on this. Um, what did,

988
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,240
what is the best way,

989
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,720
what is the best way to break up
with someone to hurt in the least?

990
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,790
Do you have a technique?
No, there's no way. Well,

991
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:37,120
could you try to be funny on this
thing and just try to come up,

992
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:41,950
come up with the technique.
I got one for you.

993
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,500
Send an email, send it, send them a card.

994
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:45,890
Yeah,

995
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:48,230
that is actually for like a good occasion.

996
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,250
So it'll have like balloons and
like silly animals on it. Yeah,

997
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,580
yeah, exactly. You just see you
cross out all the good stuff you are.

998
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:02,840
You add words. You aren't the love of my
life, but there's going to be all this,

999
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:06,500
there's these cool pictures.
You have a new live congratulations.

1000
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,850
She could find um, a girl.
Oh, she can be like, oh,

1001
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:15,230
let's have a threesome. And find
like a really hot, sexy, funny,

1002
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,350
amazing girl. And they all
have like dinner and drinks
and all have a good time.

1003
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,070
Go back to the bedroom and they all start
doing it and she could slowly slip out

1004
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,090
and she's got her bags packed. Dot.
Right. Yeah. You know what that's like.

1005
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,240
Two of them are having
leg probably amazing.

1006
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,480
That's fucking awesome.

1007
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:45,230
Yeah. You know it's funny. You know
it's funny is he would get no sympathy.

1008
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:48,410
Went to the bars. Like, look, girlfriend
broke up with me. Oh God, Dude.

1009
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,290
How's she did it? How did
she do it? Well, she fucking,

1010
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,790
we had a threesome and I start this
unbelievably hot girl. I start banging.

1011
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:59,120
She just slipped out of the
window and be like, wait a minute.

1012
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,810
That's like, you know what that's
like? That's like as a comedian,

1013
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:05,250
if you have to cancel a Gig,
but you,

1014
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:07,770
you do the effort to give them a
replacement comedians. So there's,

1015
01:01:07,771 --> 01:01:11,360
there's no pain. That's what she
should do. Ladies and gentlemen,

1016
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,220
how about a round of applause?

1017
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:16,070
I knew there was a reason I brought
you and that was fucking awesome.

1018
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,480
Okay.

1019
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,220
Fucking Neah Bay. You Go.
Good for you. Good for you.

1020
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,030
All right. Thank you. Thank you for being
on the podcast. This is, you know what?

1021
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:29,180
This is this weird thing like when you
do panel on a talk show and no matter

1022
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:32,300
what, when the person wraps it up,
you feel you still feel slighted.

1023
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,440
Like I was just killing them. We're going
to commercial. Well listen, thanks a lot.

1024
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:37,610
Good luck on your movie.

1025
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,130
We're going to be right back
with the Monday morning podcast.

1026
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:44,720
That was fucking awesome. High Five.
There you go. Go make me a sandwich.

1027
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,270
Oh right. Huh? I'll fucking
coolest chic. Jesus Christ.

1028
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:56,030
There's no reason to even to
even try and top that one. I was,

1029
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:59,830
I thought that was going to be a new,
uh, a new segment on the podcast.

1030
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,680
Wow.

1031
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,140
If she ever breaks up with me,
she better fucking do it that way.

1032
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:05,220
Cause that would,
uh,

1033
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:11,590
I wonder how long until the three,
before you actually fucking discovered it,

1034
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:17,210
you know? And is that technically
a threesome? You know?

1035
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:21,110
Because if he didn't bang the other
person, you know what that's like?

1036
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:23,840
That's like you get a base hit, but you
fall down in the way, the first base,

1037
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:27,320
and then the right field of throws you
out. Is it bill? Is that what it's like?

1038
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,300
I don't think it is.
All right.

1039
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,520
[inaudible].
