1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,650
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:06,780
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,360
I'm just checking out on you.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,450
I'm taking time out of my day to read
advertising to make a little more scratch,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,040
just to make sure that your
week is going okay. All right?

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,090
That's all I'm trying to do here.
Jesus Christ.

7
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:30,560
If I hear one more fucking asshole, bring
up that stupid Michael Jackson video.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,600
I don't know what are they going
to dig them up and arrest them?

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,420
Okay.

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,900
You know, and I, I love what anybody did.
You see that thing on murder mountain?

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,860
Did you see the making of a murderer?
And you go in there and you listen.

12
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:49,440
You basically, you are watching,
you're watching the prosecution's case.

13
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:53,160
That's not our case works. Then
you hear the defense. All right,

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,240
and I think it's kind of fucked up that
you can have something come out about a

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:59,520
dead guy and then everybody's
just going to be like, all right,

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,630
now we know definitively
that this guy did.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,360
He should be allowed to refute
moonwalk Outta the grave would be like,

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,470
listen,

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,010
just because I talk like this and I
like castles and have a giant ice cream

20
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:15,550
machine and like 17 doors that lock on
the way to my bedroom designate in a

21
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,240
fucking a child.
He should be able to say that.

22
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,490
Yeah

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,070
and that, because I think he's innocent
a it, it's, it's for you and me. Right?

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,330
So we get the chance to do that. So some
day, you know, somebody can't just say,

25
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:33,860
Hey, I saw this guy with
this tally whacker fucking
wagon out of a zipper there.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,430
Right.

27
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,050
You have a chance to defend yourself and
what this new fucking bullshit of the

28
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:42,680
Internet where they just all do
processes thrown out the fucking window.

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,310
The amount of people that I've
seen accused of this me too shit.

30
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,340
And then people just immediately go.
Like I always knew he was a piece of shit.

31
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,790
It's just like you haven't heard
if you've heard an accusation,

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,040
but having said that,

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,630
okay,

34
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,560
having said that, it makes me feel
better about the suffering of humanity.

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,800
Right? Cause when you look
at human being suffering,

36
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,710
if you're any sort of a human
being, it bothers you. All right?

37
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,060
But when you see 90% of them on
the Internet, right? You get,

38
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,890
will you be you at that point
you're like, well maybe, maybe,

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,130
maybe they don't need that much food.

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,300
Oh, that was just me, Bill, that
was to meet for the morning.

41
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,300
I hit him a little bit of
a disappointing morning.

42
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,930
I was going to go fly a helicopter and we
couldn't get the fucking thing started.

43
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,970
It's our 22 I don't know what the deal is.
Like if,

44
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:33,900
if you try to start it before eight,
the magnetos are too cold.

45
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:37,950
It's too cold outside this time of year.
It just doesn't want to start. So we,

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,850
we brought a car up to jump it, which
we've done before and it has been fine.

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,960
It looks funny as hell.

48
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:47,961
But if you just don't look at the fact
that it's a car and it's a helicopter and

49
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,010
you just look at the
engine, you're like, oh,

50
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,800
it's the same fucking some fucking
gas combustion engine. All right.

51
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,610
Same fucking principles here.
Um,

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
I was really looking forward to flying
and I know what a lot of you guys are

53
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,900
saying, like, oh my God, I,

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,250
why there's no fucking way I want to
floats up that I had a bug, a jump shot.

55
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,870
I know,
I know.

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,810
But you'll get in your car that fucking
every time you drive over a puddle at

57
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,700
fucking Jesus in your face,
right?

58
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,360
Coming up to the rusted out
floorboards as you texting,

59
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,730
driving 90 miles an hour right down the
fucking street. We'll say 50 driving,

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,850
50 looking down at your fucking phone
and there's no guardrail in this.

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,810
Somebody driving 50 miles an hour, just
one, not even a like three feet up.

62
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,910
You haven't you ever noticed that when
you drive down the fucking street,

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,070
just on a two way street,

64
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,450
like the fact that you're going 50 and
the other guy's going 50 and it never

65
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,880
dawns on you like what does that
guy just fucking swerved over?

66
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:40,300
We'd both be fucking dead.
It's like you're doing like what the,

67
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:42,940
how the blue angels fly at each
other the last second they turn away.

68
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,890
You're doing that with complete strangers.

69
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,860
You're not on the radio talking
to each other and every day,

70
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,900
every day somebody is
on their fucking phone,

71
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,470
they drift over headlight
to front headlight, Bam.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,710
Right brain smashing on the inside
of the skull or what do people say?

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,690
What do people say? Oh my God,
it's a fucking shape. That's it.

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,270
But the next time you go to get in a
car and nobody says like, Hey, I'll go,

75
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,360
maybe you should walk. You're
going to fucking die. Sorry.

76
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm trying to preempt everybody who's
going to sit there and the end for fucking

77
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,070
say a bunch of fucking shit
here. Anyways, plowing ahead.

78
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,390
Guess who finally figured out how the
Moto GP website works. Not this guy.

79
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,890
Somebody gave me the link and show me.

80
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,070
Then I was able to put in my
password and a so thank you to the,

81
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,190
to the listener who helped me
out and I got to watch that race.

82
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,380
The first one of the Aaron [inaudible]
or a, what do they call k Tar?

83
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,660
The English guys.

84
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:38,940
Okay.

85
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,100
Like every little fucking word
they say different than us.

86
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:45,030
It's amazing that we speak the same
language over here. We say Ducati,

87
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:48,960
they see do catty Oregano or a Gyno,
tomato,

88
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,330
tomato,
Qatar,

89
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:55,150
k tar or I didn't know at the scene I,

90
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,850
Kantar Kantar is they think
how they were saying it. Um,

91
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,160
I dunno when I just hear shit like that.

92
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:06,330
I really wanted to start to understand
how difficult it is to be a spy because

93
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,380
that's, that's the shit that gets
you caught. You get the accent down,

94
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:11,651
you know,

95
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,010
you watch a little peaky blinders and he'd
go over there and next thing you know,

96
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,880
you're in Buckingham Palace and you
fucking snooping around to find out what

97
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:22,120
those balding concert do it in there
with all the goddamn money. Right?

98
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,950
And then all of a sudden, what do you
do? You let her do care. You go to a,

99
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,870
a Ducati, a Ducati, I
forgot how he said it.

100
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,340
A Ducati slip then that's it,
right? The queen pushes a button.

101
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,910
You go through the floor right
down to the royal alligators. Um,

102
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,210
there's the, I'm gonna tell
you right now, but moto GP,

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,170
this is the best fucking racing
that is out there. All right.

104
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,500
On the final lap. The two, the
two people, Andres divisio.

105
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,290
So in Mark Marquez in first and
second place they change leads,

106
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,080
the delayed change three
times in the final fucking,

107
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,600
even though I knew it would happen,

108
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,660
I was still up off the couch
and everybody was asleep.

109
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:07,580
So I was screaming quietly watching it.
I'm an amazing race.

110
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,330
Um, a little bit of
controversy though, Huh?

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,370
Yeah.

112
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,120
The Duke cattys the Ducati's,

113
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,100
they got this new little piece that
they have underneath the bike that uh,

114
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:22,700
allegedly is kicking up air to cool
off the rear tire. And these guys,

115
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,590
I guess they chew up their tires big time.

116
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,870
So if he has just a little
bit of an advantage.

117
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:31,100
So divisio so one Ducati,
one,

118
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,420
uh, the team and immediately
four teams complaint,

119
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,700
which I'm guessing is Honda Suzuki.

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,473
Okay.

121
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,780
By the way, how come there's no Harleys
are fucking Indians in the Goddamn race?

122
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,050
What, what happened? My country,

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,260
we started making real fucking
motorcycles before all of these constant,

124
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,680
constantly.
I gotta look this up.

125
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,320
Yeah.

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,340
It's so funny that like Indians in like
Honda's, it just for like fat fucks.

127
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,900
Not Honda's Harleys. Essentially.
It's for old guys want to sit down.

128
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,370
I like the pegs up nice and high.

129
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:09,630
It's my fucking air up my old fucking
ball bag as I drive down the fucking

130
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:13,590
street and all the Japanese
bikes and the Italian bikes,

131
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,620
they're all for the young guys who think
they're going to live forever. Right.

132
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,340
Having said all this, having
talked to all this shit, you know,

133
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:24,330
if I was going to get a bike,
which I would love to, um,

134
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,040
if I wasn't, you know, living for
somebody else now, but even then,

135
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,100
even before I had a kid,
like I always liked my legs.

136
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,130
Um, I like my feet pointing
in the direction they're
supposed to be rather than

137
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:45,420
turned around like I'm fucking like
daffy duck's bill. Every other cartoon.

138
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,660
Um, all right. What the
hell was I looking up?

139
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:49,830
Okay.

140
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,860
Oh,
first motorcycle

141
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,080
built. All right, let's
see who built it first. Oh,

142
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:03,070
I got the bad internet. Huh?
Sometimes you get the bad cocaine.

143
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,690
Sometimes she get the bad internet.

144
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:05,860
Okay.

145
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,180
What the fuck are you doing here?
Can we wait one first?

146
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,760
Okay.

147
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,630
Fucking

148
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,090
okay.

149
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,950
Motorcycle ever built.
It's going to bring a porno of,

150
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,480
as I said, fucking in it. Come on,
come on. You can load. You can,

151
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,100
you could load if you want to.
You can answer my fucking question.

152
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,540
What is the Jesus fucking Christ?
How much do you have to pay?

153
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:37,780
Okay.

154
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,540
How much I am fucking pay nine
grand a month for fucking night.

155
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:44,740
The first motorcycle, international
combustion petroleum field motorcycle was,

156
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,580
was the, damn, you're right.
Viagen that sounds like German.

157
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,870
It was designed and built
by the German inventors. Ah,

158
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,000
you fucking son's up.
Is there anything worse than when you,

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,380
a man did something or America did
it and you find out they didn't?

160
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,920
It's the worst. I feel like the
world smiles when that happens.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,780
A motorcycle often called a
bike or a motorbike or a cycle.

162
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,390
I know what that is. Okay. 1894

163
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Hildebrand and Wolf Mueller became the
first series production motorcycles and

164
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,990
the first to be called a motorcycle in
2014 the three top motorcycle producers

165
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,620
globally by volume or Honda?
Yamaha.

166
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,880
And they hear a motor Corp,
I don't know. It's an India.

167
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,470
All right. So we're not the only ones
making motorcycles that on in Moto GP.

168
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:36,780
Okay.

169
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,930
What is it about like Italians in,
in uh,

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,770
Japanese motorcycles that they just
make the fastest ones they got,

171
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:48,450
they got that unlocked that and look
at fucking Japan. They got Honda,

172
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,010
Suzuki and Yamaha.

173
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,330
So what I'm finding out is a
Suzuki's are the best in the corners,

174
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,720
but then the Ducati's and Honda's just
have too many horses when they go down

175
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:01,130
the straightaway, which is
fucking weird to me. You know,

176
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,620
I guess it would depend on the track
because the one they were riding,

177
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,040
riding on had like two long straightaways.

178
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,210
So when he sort of fucking ground
the dude and the Suzuki would gain,

179
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:13,750
he would just lose it every time he
would go by the grand stands over there.

180
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,620
All right. Enough motorcycle
talk. But I really enjoyed it. Uh,

181
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,510
if you want to jump on board,
there's only like 20 fucking racist.

182
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,600
They're like 22,
2124 laps.

183
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:27,340
They fly by and you're watching guys
going 200 fucking miles an hour on a

184
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:31,400
motorcycle, like an eighth of an
inch away from each other. It's done.

185
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,300
I'll tell you,
it's unfucking believable.

186
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,460
I've been given Yannis Pappas Shit,
one of my favorite comics out there.

187
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:40,540
Absolutely brilliant guy,

188
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:45,541
but he's like the classic fucking New
Yorker where he did this Instagram post,

189
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,220
right?
And uh,

190
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,660
okay.

191
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,820
He's like in Philadelphia and he goes,
look at these,

192
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,640
these go and look at the
buildings, looking at buildings,
look at the buildings.

193
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,140
And he goes, every city looks like New
New York City for a block and a half.

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,570
And then the whole thing falls
apart. You know? And I this,

195
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,970
there's something just so fucking
funny about the way New Yorkers travel.

196
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,430
Okay.

197
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,230
You know,
every place they go to,

198
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:13,470
if they can't do exactly what the
fuck they can do in New York City,

199
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:16,110
the place sucks.
It's like you're in Philadelphia.

200
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,900
Why would it look like New York
City? That's why you travel. Oh,

201
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,240
where are all the fucking bill day?

202
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,220
The tristate area is arguably the biggest
collection of meatheads in the United

203
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:36,781
States of America.
And I,

204
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:40,320
and this is saying something cause I
grew up in Greater Boston, you know,

205
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,830
and if you want to see the level of meat
had just watch a Boston sporting event

206
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,180
when they pay into the crowd.

207
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,270
Yeah.

208
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,920
All right. And I'm not talking down.
I know I'm part of the problem.

209
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:51,990
Okay.

210
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,280
So I've just been leaving
all these fucking messages.

211
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,740
How New Yorkers just think everything
sucks. This such fucking moron.

212
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,940
Oh, I went to fucking used
it, right. I mean Houston,

213
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:06,200
Texas soil linguine and it fucking,
it was fucking terrible.

214
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,310
Okay.

215
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,690
Can I get good Italian? A Houston, Texas.
Why didn't you get the barbecue? You dumb.

216
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:12,524
Fuck.

217
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,250
Okay.

218
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,690
Why did she get some Tex Mex?

219
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,520
I went to Buffalo. Right. I fucking
went to the buffalo wild wings.

220
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,710
Fucking wigs.
That good

221
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,730
fucking morons. They are fucking
morons. And you know what's funny?

222
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:34,270
I um, I went to the Brody
Memorial, right? I can't remember.

223
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:38,660
I talked about this on Monday.
I still can't get over this.

224
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:43,580
This guy was eulogizing. Is that
the right word? Brody Stevens,

225
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:47,570
and he somehow was able
to trash Boston twice.

226
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,720
It is fucking eulogy. It was one of the
high points of it cause it was, you know,

227
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:55,340
it was really uplifting,
but it was sad.

228
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,690
But it was kind of funny to see that New
York fans are that fucking annoyed that

229
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,840
we won some championships finally,

230
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,353
you know,

231
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,830
finally one oh couple,
you know,

232
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,650
and that it's bothering them so much
that they're now reduced to making fun of

233
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:13,320
our skyline.
Uh,

234
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,310
and that stupid shit that ESPN came
up with where they would like say that

235
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:21,150
Boston had an inferiority complex is one
of my favorite with New York is one of

236
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:24,150
my favorite thing ever. I don't have the
heart to tell Him New York is that like,

237
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,570
yeah, we don't even, we
didn't even know what the,

238
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,080
we didn't know what the
fuck it looked like.

239
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,640
He'd given us too much credit. Um, I,

240
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,530
I want to say I already talked
about this on Monday, but you know,

241
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:42,350
like whenever they
fucking show New England,

242
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:43,820
whenever there's a game in New England,

243
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,040
they're always showing
some sort of foliage. Uh,

244
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,290
something about the revolutionary war
and then somebody is eating a fucking

245
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,430
oyster or something and it's just like,
that's really, that's, that's not a good,

246
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,220
uh, that's not a good
indication of what's going on.

247
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,350
You know, so somebody in a dive bar with
a beer in a fucking shot that, yeah,

248
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:10,050
maybe. And they don't, they
don't go to the bull and finch,

249
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:14,280
that stupid fucking cheers thing or
whatever the hell it is. Anyways,

250
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,570
having said that to all the New York is
listening, I absolutely love your city.

251
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,090
I love the people. I just don't
like the Yankees. That's it.

252
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,600
Everything else about it.
I absolutely love having said that,

253
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:27,720
I love Philadelphia too.
I enjoy Washington DC.

254
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,980
Milwaukee's one of my favorite cities.
I don't fucking, cause when I go there,

255
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,740
I don't try it.

256
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,810
Get fucking,
don't,

257
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,420
let's get some fucking little fucking
clam chowder shut in green bay goat.

258
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,543
MMM

259
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,920
Dude. I, I fucked in. I go to, I go
to fucking Argentina, right? Dude,

260
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,980
I'm fucking down yet. And I, and
I say to the, can I get a fucking

261
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,490
Sam Adams?
He got an email he had no Sam Adams.

262
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,410
So I told this fucking place sucks.

263
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,813
MMM.

264
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,620
The anybody else.
Do you have any stories like that?

265
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,330
I shouldn't really just blame New Yorkers,

266
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,010
but does anybody else have like a cause?

267
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:12,400
I think country people are like that too.
Where they just cut off

268
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,980
to on now y'all deal. There's all these
bugs and playful out here, man. Give,

269
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,590

spice is a mild property.

270
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,710
Get me a four wheeler and a good woman.
It does.

271
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:28,711
Now the self esteem to walk
off [inaudible] she knows
I'll fucking club or over

272
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:31,840
the head and feet are numb up pigs.
I've done it before.

273
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:32,940
Okay.

274
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,773
She knows it.

275
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,120
Okay.

276
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,170
We never talk about it,

277
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:38,840
but she knows that she goes out
when she goes to feed the pig.

278
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,860
She sees a couple of thugs hanging
on a nail. She knows what that means.

279
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,020
I told her I'd been married twice
before she gets it right? MMM.

280
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,210
Yeah. The purpose of traveling is,
is, is the when in Rome, right?

281
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,090
When in Rome do as the Romans do.
That's what you do. All right.

282
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,660
You fucking go over there, you go over to
fucking, you know, uh, the U K alright.

283
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,590
Premiere League.
See,

284
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,380
get yourself a fucking pint in a
scarf and start singing some socks.

285
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,013
All right?

286
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,840
Yeah.

287
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,101
You know,

288
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,340
pull a VRC like an a Stoney and you talk
to some 90 year old woman over there,

289
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,490
you know, blazing fast
English. Go in like, Hey,

290
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:20,340
do you know where we can watch
the NFL divisional round playoffs?

291
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,960
Yeah.

292
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,940
You know what it is?
I think about New York is they've just,

293
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:31,720
they've just some too many fucking
songs about your city and then all these

294
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,940
meatheads who really didn't
do that well in school,

295
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:36,080
they think they're part of
the success rather than the,

296
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,730
they're just background in the
movie. Um, as I've always said,

297
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:42,970
Frank Sinatra was bridge and tunnel.
He was at Jersey Guy.

298
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:44,470
Okay.

299
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,140
Breaks and he lives in no work. There's
no buildings and fucking place sucks.

300
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,570
Okay.

301
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,220
Um, alright. Plowing ahead here. Uh,

302
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,510
I did some stand up the other night,
first time since Royal Albert Hall.

303
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,180
I had a good time trying out new shit.
Just like just nothing. I got nothing.

304
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:09,181
So I'm going to go down to the comedy
store possibly this weekend or maybe not

305
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:11,770
this week and maybe next weekend.
And I'm just gonna fucking,

306
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm just going to do
20 minutes of new shit.

307
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,440
I'm just going to have like four or five,

308
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:23,790
six subjects written down and I'm going
on stage and I'm just going to stand

309
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,090
there and fucking take it.
Um,

310
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,820
and it's one of my favorite
things in the world to do. Um,

311
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,710
I was just listening to a Brody special,

312
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,090
the one that he has on fucking
iTunes and uh, I just, I dunno,

313
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,370
just listening to that guy
plowing through, it's just
one of my favorite things.

314
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:45,480
Definitely going to miss that guy. Um,
but it was an incredible memorial service,

315
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,480
which I really would think that I talked
about it on Monday. I believe I did.

316
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,410
I just kept no fucking short term
memory. So anyways, Hayden was funny.

317
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,810
It was right before I started.

318
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,990
I asked my wife if she could just go
talk in the other room because she was

319
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,060
talking,
she had a phone on speaker.

320
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,470
Okay.

321
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,810
And you know, I'm just recording. Just
didn't want that shit in the background.

322
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,450
Oh my God,
the fucking look she gave me.

323
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,340
It's unbelievable.
You know,

324
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,330
like she's asking me to do shit all
the fucking time. Can you go here?

325
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:17,240
Can you pick up this? Can you do
this? Can you do that? I'll ask.

326
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:22,040
The Jewish just moved down one room
closed the door. She just looked at me,

327
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,490
cause I know what she's gonna say.
You fucking talk so fucking lad.

328
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,210
When you learn the fucking third
kick it the khaki cookie to kill you.

329
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,710
You know it's always, it always
comes back. Always come back. Hey,

330
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,830
de Rosa sent me some,

331
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,280
I guess they got this new fucking Charlie
Manson movie that's coming out with it.

332
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,980
They're trying to make the women

333
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,220
that Charlie convinced to
kill those people. Victims.

334
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,110
I don't give a fuck if
you're a victim or not.

335
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,910
If you're dumb enough that you let
some fucking psycho look in Jesus talky

336
00:18:56,911 --> 00:19:01,050
window murdering a pregnant woman
and then trying to cut the baby out.

337
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,530
Yeah, you shouldn't be
walking around in society.

338
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,950
This is the new fucking thing.

339
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,510
The new fucking thing now is to go back
in time and find a bunch of selfish

340
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,790
cunts and then somehow blame it on guys.

341
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,930
And you know what I had started with it
started with that stupid movie monster.

342
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,820
Well,
that fucking lunatic was a serial killer.

343
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,820
And I'm watching the movie and they're
trying to make me feel guilty. Like I'm,

344
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:28,370
I'm, I'm part of the problem.
I'm the reason why she became,

345
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:31,640
when I saw the Jeffrey Dahmer movie,
they didn't do that. They just like,

346
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:36,410
this guy's out of his fucking mind
and he's eating people. Um, I dunno,

347
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,140
but it's a woman.
There has to be a reason.

348
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,590
Okay.

349
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,250
Maybe she just came out of the womb
a complete fucking psycho. Right?

350
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,050
Maybe that's what it was.
I don't fucking know.

351
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,170
I think they tried to like find some
sort of trajectory in the madness of

352
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:57,070
Jeffrey Dahmer, but at no point
that they blame women. Um,

353
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,680
although in fairness to the lab,

354
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,970
they, um, who's that
guy? That Ed Geanne Guy,

355
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:09,700
the guy from fucking Wisconsin.
Uh,

356
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,990
they did try to s they did say that his
mother fucked him up. So, I don't know,

357
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:16,360
maybe I'm just being a baby,
you know,

358
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:19,810
maybe I should have moved
to a one room over. Is that,

359
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:23,350
is that what I should have done?
Um, all right. So as I mentioned,

360
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:27,700
the Bruins lost two in a row, two in a
row, hoping to get back on track here.

361
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,380
Um, I'm going to the fucking Gad
and a dreams April 2nd. Everybody.

362
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:37,330
April 2nd,
I'm doing the God and the dreams with uh,

363
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,920
John Stewart. Oh, this is in New
York City by the way. Oh my God.

364
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,180
The read is unbelievable.

365
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:47,980
It's so much nicer than a Rita's
another fucking shit cities. Um, I'm

366
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,020
doing, it's Jerry Seinfeld. Jon
Stewart. Alijah Schlesinger's or your,

367
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,740
uh,

368
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,670
who else? Who else? Who
else? I forget who else.

369
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,630
Those are the names that I remember.
Oh, and yours truly. How could I forget?

370
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:06,230
Lovely me. Lovely baldy.
None even balding balled me.

371
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,570
Um, as the name of my one show,
one man show, lovely balled me.

372
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,410
I've chosen me.

373
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,540
I've decided to ignore
all the advertising does,

374
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,870
saying that I'm not good enough and
to say that I, I am good enough.

375
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,820
How fragile is your fucking psyche
that you fucking sit there looking at

376
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,010
advertising and it,

377
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,430
and it fucks with you to that level
that you're walking out behind a fucking

378
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:41,690
Papa John's throwing up into a
handicap parking spot, right?

379
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,080
I know what you think of bill.

380
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,910
Why would you suggest that Papa John's
puts the handicap parking behind?

381
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,900
I've never eaten at Papa John's.
All right.

382
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,943
Hm?

383
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,470
I like Papa.
Ginos Nice fucking Italian.

384
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,980
I don't want some guy named John
Making my God damn pizza. All right.

385
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,410
I want someone who can get a fucking tank.

386
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,590
That's someone that Burns
in fucking April. Um,

387
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,350
what was I talking about?
The, I've just, yeah, I mean,

388
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:14,480
what the fuck is wrong with you?
First of all,

389
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:18,470
the arrogance of you that you look at
a Victoria's secret model and you feel

390
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,780
like you'd have to compete with that.
First of all,

391
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,930
you can't any more than I
can compete with a Brad Pitt.

392
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,710
So what is the fucking problem?
And the second of all,

393
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,300
once the last time you saw a Victoria's
secret model walking to the bar that

394
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:31,040
you're drinking at all,
right?

395
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,540
You fucking regular looking person.

396
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,600
You're an irregular looking person bar,

397
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,970
you know with me in the second
and eight walks in the room,

398
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:48,290
everybody fucking turns like, like Bo
Derek just k walking in and that movie 10

399
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,760
Hollywood just create season.
Possible Standard. Yes. It's a movie.

400
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,600
I don't understand. Like when they
do this reboot boot a top gun,

401
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:10,460
I'm not going to feel like I need to
learn how to fly a fucking f a teen or

402
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:13,830
wherever the fuck they're flying.
Was it [inaudible] they up to the 19.

403
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,320
What are they up to now?
Let's see.

404
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,090
Uh,

405
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:26,090
you as a top fighter jet.

406
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,070
All right,
what do we got here?

407
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,310
Don't even fucking tell me.

408
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:37,330
It's called this the Sukhoi sue
57 what is it made in Japan?

409
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,620
Do we make anything here?

410
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,591
Please tell me.

411
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:45,680
In Asian American came up with that
and they make this an Indiana please.

412
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:49,910
For the love of God. Do you guys
have fucked up? That was if,

413
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,490
if all our fighter jets are made in Japan
and then we have beef with them again

414
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,610
and it's like, hey man, can you
keep making it? Making it as jet.

415
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:59,730
So like we can get you back for
bombing the other part of Hawaii now,

416
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,400
a top 10 best fighter jets in the world.
The top seven US fighter jets.

417
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,340
I'll come. They're not, they're
not doing the, uh, the f anymore.

418
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,250
The JTTF 22.

419
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,003
Yeah,

420
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,030
dude, I'm so old. I remember,
I remember the EF 60.

421
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,560
They have 60 was the Bob and I remember
a two 40 [inaudible] before the two 80

422
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:26,120
[inaudible] before the 300.
All right.

423
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,330
I remember the f 100.
I don't,

424
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,150
who's the F-150 enough to 50.

425
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,330
I just needed another example was another
one where they just kept going up the

426
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:40,040
Mazda rx seven. What are they up to? Nine.

427
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,090
I love how they just,
they don't start it.

428
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:48,800
One like Jordan's like the sneakers,
you know, then there's the Jordan twos,

429
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,480
Jordan threes.
They started like seven.

430
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,853
Okay.

431
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,830
Or a hundred. Um, if you wonder what
the fuck I'm talking about. I don't,

432
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,850
I don't know either. All right. I have
no idea. But anyways, I'm doing the guy,

433
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,980
ah,

434
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,350
no dreams on, uh, April 2nd.

435
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,610
It's in the, uh, it's the
theater at Madison Square Garden.

436
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:16,090
As I mentioned on Monday, this is where
Eddie Murphy did, uh, the raw special.

437
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:17,230
So I always think about that.

438
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,790
So I will be there and I'm also the day
before I'm going to go try to go to a

439
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:22,840
Brooklyn Nets game.

440
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,280
Now I haven't gone to a pro game in a
minute as far as checking another one off

441
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:27,671
the list.

442
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:31,540
And I had forgotten I only need like six
more teams and I've been to a home game

443
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:34,720
of every protein in all
four fucking sports.

444
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,920
Now there's a very select few of you
that thinks that's awesome and that's who

445
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:39,970
I'm talking to right now.

446
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,840
The rest of you could just fucking zone
out because this part of the podcast,

447
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:48,060
it's not about you
any more than,

448
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,690
than an average look at woman. It has
to feel intimidated because you know,

449
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,920
there's another Cindy Crawford coming
along or daughters now going to make a

450
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,320
whole other generation of
people not feel pretty enough.

451
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,590
And I got to tell you something there,

452
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,340
there is a beauty in coming
to the realization that you,

453
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:09,770
you aren't pretty enough.
And just embracing that,

454
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,830
just being like,
you know what?

455
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm going to be the coolest six
that walks into this bar tonight.

456
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,750
It's all right being a six. Then
just add, add to it. You know,

457
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,010
tell a couple of jokes, learn how
to juggle. You know what I mean?

458
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,440
It's like you ever see
somebody when they get a three,

459
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:31,620
a Chrysler 300 and they try,
they try to make it look like a Bentley.

460
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,633
That's what you do.

461
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,320
But at no point do you actually say that
you're a fucking Bentley or do you get

462
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:42,040
mad that somebody is making a Bentley?
Does any of that makes sense?

463
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,660
I don't fucking know.
Um,

464
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,100
this is usually a point here when
I would read some advertising,

465
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,270
but I didn't get any so far.
I wonder why.

466
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,370
Probably because I shit on every
God damn one of them, you know,

467
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,560
and they fucking sensitive. I think
these women today have fucking sets it.

468
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,710
If you think these millennials
get their feelings hurt,

469
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,750
see these fucking advertising companies
get see a goddamn thing.

470
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,680
Um Oh, I do have a read. Here we go.

471
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:14,010

490
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,950
and it's now time to talk about soccer.

491
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,200
I guess Liverpool,

492
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,210
my adopted team is still down a point
to those man city cons. All right.

493
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,470
With their uh wait, where did they get
their money from? Somebody told me,

494
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,530
God damn it,
it's not Saudi Arabia,

495
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,010
is it?
Did they get it from our Air Emirates?

496
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,870
Is that when they get it from the airline?

497
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,780
Throw some of their first class fucking
ticket money at them. I don't remember.

498
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,110
Anyways, they're down a point that
down a point and they got a game.

499
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,490
Liverpool's got a game on Monday.

500
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,320
They pay full of is I would say so
they're probably full hand full.

501
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,260
You go buy Bulla Wall on Saint
Patty's Day. Oh Saint Patty's day.

502
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:08,630
You got to get out there. Where
your green plastic cat. You know,

503
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,450
where's my Hashtag on that
day where I get offended?

504
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:15,730
Everybody's going at [inaudible]
alligator. The low net goes, okay,

505
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,940
everyone's getting shit. If you
don't realize how fucked up that is,

506
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,020
you know how funny it is?
Irish people are part Irish people.

507
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,440
They go out and they'd just like,
there's no other fucking holiday.

508
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:27,790
Okay?

509
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:32,050
You know where people go out in, in
people who are, are that nationality,

510
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:37,051
literally go out and do the most like
negative stereotype of themselves.

511
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,580
You know,
black history month,

512
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:47,260
everybody's on their best
behavior, right? Jewish holidays,

513
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:50,890
everybody's fucking Shelan. Saint
Patty's day one app, it's high.

514
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,200
Everybody goes out,
gets drunk in the fucking street,

515
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:57,430
dresses like a Leprechaun and passes
out in the gutter. That's what happens,

516
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,240
right? Fucking corn, beef sandwich
fucking hanging out of the Saudi of mouth.

517
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,270
That's why I always
hated about that holiday.

518
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:09,800
It's like one of the prides of the
Irish is not only do you drink,

519
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:14,030
he can handle your fucking liquor. Don't,
but don't. Can you guys just don't,

520
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:18,800
just don't make a mess yourself.
Fucking sitting there drinking green beer

521
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,400
the fuck he you doing?
Oh Shit.

522
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,160
Odell Beckham Jr goes from the
giants to the Cleveland browns.

523
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Cleveland Brown fans beside themselves
can't believe their good fortune.

524
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,060
Now they got a, they got that
kid there. What's his face there?

525
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,650
They got the quarterback. I just
spaced on his name. Baker Mayfield.

526
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,400
Right.
He's got a little bit of a swagger.

527
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,680
He likes talking a little bit of Shit.
Right.

528
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:55,800
He likes doing something
and doing a little dance in
front of the fucking crowd.

529
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,740
Now he's got a wide
receiver. Right. So what's,

530
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,130
what's this might work if they have like
an Al Davis old school sort of thing

531
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,680
because this reminds me of
what the Raiders used to do,

532
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,390
where they would take the fucking people.

533
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,930
Everybody said don't take are the outcasts
from other teams and then they would

534
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:16,710
go in there and everybody would just be
themselves and they would have a good

535
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:17,544
time.

536
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,480
Okay.

537
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,220
I hope it works out for the browns.
My Gut says I can't say that it won't.

538
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,740
It just all depends on the coach.

539
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:27,830
Okay.

540
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,820
The personality,
like that's a good rex Ryan team.

541
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,270
Cause then he's talking shit.
Oh Dell's talkin shit.

542
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,650
Baker's doing what the fuck he does. Uh,
but it's definitely going to be exciting.

543
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:42,680
But I actually think of, I think it
was a good move from, for the giants.

544
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,480
He didn't kind of fit into their,
they have vibe,

545
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,460
defensive minded organization.
You look at Eli shows up,

546
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:55,130
he's got Khakis on, he tucks
his shirt in. I mean that's,

547
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,760
that's what the giants I guess
have become, I don't know,

548
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:02,120
you listened to some of those lt
stories. Oh, Dellschau fit right in.

549
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,140
But um, I dunno. It was a big move and I
don't, I don't think they had to give up,

550
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,610
give up too much for the guy.
And they got a lot of draft picks.

551
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:13,820
So see what they do. And A, I've
got a couple friends of mine that,

552
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:17,510
a Cleveland Brown fans and they're all
saying they're GM knows what he's doing.

553
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,280
So who knows?

554
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,093
Hmm.

555
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,700
The only thing I need are to Cleveland
plans is to stop calling you stupid city.

556
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:29,920
The land, the land. Ugh.

557
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,150
Fucking Midwest people.
The land,

558
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,380
the Berg
did they call the natty

559
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,300
get on the bus.
You're in Columbus,

560
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,650
you get it the day.
Welcome to the day.

561
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,570
So what they say in Dayton? Uh, uh,

562
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,390
all right. Sorry, I'm being a cunt, but
it's what I do. All right. That's it.

563
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:03,530
I'm going to be,
uh,

564
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,780
out and about in La doing some
spots bombing this weekend,

565
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,280
uh, probably down the store on
Friday. That's the deal. All right,

566
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,930
so go Bruins,
go Celtics baseball is starting up.

567
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,090
A interesting stat here,

568
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,450
and this is something on the
success of the New York Yankees.

569
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:26,120
Do you realize in New York
Yankees are so fucking successful?

570
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,250
That sense they got babe Ruth
all right.

571
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,790
From the 1920s to this decade,

572
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,610
they've only gone one decade
where they didn't win a war,

573
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,110
at least one world series. And
that was the 1980s. And even still,

574
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,320
they went to a world series in
[inaudible] 81 and lost. Right.

575
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,670
If they don't win this year,

576
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,150
this'll be the first time that that's
the only second time this has happened

577
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,760
since women were allowed to vote.
Okay.

578
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,420
Which was another huge,
huge fucking mistake by this country.

579
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,353
Okay.

580
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,820
You should have kept those fucking
prides in the kitchen. No. Um,

581
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,670
I think it's great that
they could talk more.

582
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,030
Um,
anyways,

583
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,410
am I the only one who's like not
looking forward to this next election,

584
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,770
presidential election? I
just, I just don't see this.

585
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,630
I just didn't see it being a repeat of a
few years ago and it's just going to be

586
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:29,100
a fucking train wreck.

587
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,283
MMM.

588
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,360
Until you get that cancer
out of the locker room.

589
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,260
I just don't know what it's
going to be. I, if I, you know,

590
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,600
if I was running for president
on the democratic side,

591
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:44,140
what I would learn how to do
is talk some shit. All right.

592
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,270
Stop trying to talk about issues.

593
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:48,780
What you need to do is you need
to go in there and you need,

594
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,550
you need to make fun of his hair.
Make Fun of that to pay.

595
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,400
Make Fun of his fucking big motherly hips.

596
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,530
You gotta you gotta go after him
like that. All right. Why is,

597
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,040
why is your face orange and
underneath your eyes, his ghost white?

598
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,870
Do you have a tanning bed?

599
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,250
Is that some sort of cream that you
put under your eyes for puffiness?

600
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,113
That's what you do.

601
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,960
Do not go up there and try to talk
policy and interrupt the shit out of him.

602
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,100
Just do what he does.
Completely ignore all the fucking rules.

603
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,090
And then when you get called on it
just act like a victim. All right?

604
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,570
That's what it's going to be. This is
what politics is fucking become. Okay.

605
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,603
MMM.

606
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,310
I mean, I'm acting like it was on
the up and up before that, but uh,

607
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,830
I don't know.
We shall see.

608
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:37,110
Although I do have to give
Trump some props grounding
that, that airplane, right?

609
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,910
He did do that. He did try to
pull the troops out of Syria.

610
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,390
You saw the Democrats and
Republican. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, whoa. Don't do that.

611
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,810
You biting the hand that
feeds bite net corporate cash.

612
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,550
I'll spill it out of their pockets.

613
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,970
And you watch all you ladies out
there loving your girl there.

614
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,150
The 29 year old checky watch you fuck it.
Well,

615
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,980
how soon before she gets a book deal,

616
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,670
how sue before she somehow
a multimillionaire only
making 150 200 grand a year.

617
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,200
But she has a vagina. So, so do you,
so you should vote for it, right?

618
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,200
That should make you feel good. All
right. That was a country way to end,

619
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,750
but that's how it's going to happen.
Enjoy the music.

620
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:20,400
And there'll be another half hour of a
greatest sets from a Thursday afternoon,

621
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:22,620
just before Monday,
just before Friday,

622
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,440
Monday morning podcast from earlier
this year or years before I, and I know,

623
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:28,410
fuck it.
All right.

624
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,070
Have a great weekend. You can go
live a pool. I'll see you on Monday.

625
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,410
Convenience street by

626
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,573
you and me.

627
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:02,060
They
give me a hard time.

628
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,543
She

629
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,770
shouldn't come around here,

630
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,550
you know, and that show
and I, Naomi Campbell,

631
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:17,500
she's like 52 and she's still affects me.

632
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,730
So it's like Tyra got a
lot of years to go day.

633
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,030
Who did we see walking away
from that hotel that day? Oh, I,

634
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,180
Cheryl t is Cheryl Tiegs. They're
looking good. That time is a bitch, man.

635
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,470
Dime is a bitch.
No,

636
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,920
I doing, I'm wasting my mental. And I
think you got a bit of a fetish. No,

637
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:44,020
you for awhile.
And older white women.

638
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,950
And he picked some bad
with Hillary Clinton. I,

639
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,640
my favorite number one is Carly Simon.

640
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,340
I will still pop Cory Simon.
I don't know why.

641
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,300
I know why everybody got
their fucking fetishes.

642
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,540
Alvin cow cover alone, which
she was on all fours, I suppose.

643
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,760
That big mouth. Yeah, that's what
I'm saying, man. That bitch is,

644
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,750
by the way, a lot of people backed us
up on that one. Wow. Yeah. Backyard.

645
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:15,420
A lot of people calling
and saying, Lord, we

646
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,580
saw moving back though. We saw Cheryl
Tiegs leaving the Donald Trump roast.

647
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah, Cheryl Tiegs. We had the great
seats from Voss. Well yeah. Alright.

648
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,430
Fairly in the buildings and thanks rich
and I cocked your checkers for the Trump

649
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,710
roast section. Oh, I'm going to be, we,

650
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,230
we were behind a monitor that was
showing the rows behind it on the second

651
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,130
floor. Dude, everyone's going in
the main ballroom and we headed,

652
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,410
our tickets I got were going
to be hobnobbing with the,

653
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,620
the top celebrities in New
York. Right. Awesome. The usher,

654
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:54,040
it looks at our tickets and
goes, Oh God, take that elevator.

655
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,390
But W and then you're thinking,
all right, well, you know,

656
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:02,840
it's an elevator you ever see a roast
with is an upstairs. It's always,

657
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:06,910
it's the, the day is and the
table upstairs that are roasted.

658
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,140
So at first we're like,
all right,

659
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:11,100
well we'll follow all the other people
that have seats in that area. No,

660
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,080
there were maybe another 20
people that had sciatic area.

661
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,990
And we sit down and then
I have my seat stunk.

662
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:20,980
I had him stand up and look over
this video screen to see anything.

663
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,940
I couldn't tell who was up at the,
they were tiny day.

664
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,670
Everybody gets in the elevators,
like holding cable and Shit. Yeah,

665
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,640
that's what it was. They
were all tech guys. Gaffers.

666
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,880
They were heading for the
fucking beat mixing board.

667
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,790
So we're heading for the walkways
high above. That's, so we leave.

668
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,280
The roasts were walking back
towards the station and uh,

669
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,320
we're right behind Cheryl Tiegs
and her white old saggy ass.

670
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,440
Like how bad does it look though?

671
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,470
I mean tears and I'm
saying for an old old lady,

672
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,970
she probably isn't that bad.

673
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,310
But when you compare her to the Cheryl
Tiegs poster that was on everybody's wall

674
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,570
with the netting that she was just
wearing a neck and her nipples were poking

675
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:07,340
through. I mean you wouldn't
fuck Sophia Loren. No,

676
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,570
cause she exists 60 something years.

677
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,510
There's got to be just a glimpse
of just young Sophia's one trial,

678
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,270
half a pussy lip, paint
enough. Believe me.

679
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,600
And when you see these people out,

680
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,770
remember they are looking
at their absolute best.

681
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,850
This is the best they can possibly look.
How old is Cheryl Tiegs?

682
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,530
50 gotta be,

683
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:41,531
she's got to be in her in her fifth
phase five and no redeeming sexuality.

684
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,100
She's not drunk.
I didn't see any redeeming sexuality.

685
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:50,900
I saw an older woman
that you look at and go,

686
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,480
all right, she's an older
woman that doesn't look like
she's ready to fall apart.

687
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,380
What do you,

688
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,380
you know the old broad women like who
continue to dye their hair like that.

689
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,770
It becomes like a fucking
birds nest right out.

690
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,910
And also like as you get into like you
get into like your sixties it's like the

691
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:17,600
smell of rotten pending death. So he
started having that old person smell.

692
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:22,601
So you see the top of their head because
it gets to what you tall it and see

693
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:24,550
right through that Kenny hair.

694
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,880
It's like that fucking white
cotton candy hair and scalp price.

695
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:33,040
Low box to the back of her hand.
And she kept jerking you off.

696
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,640
You gotta you gotta fucking old Sophia
Loren and fucking movie on the TV.

697
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,600
Trying not to look at the what happened
in that whole Rod, don't you got back up?

698
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,740
Oh Shit.
Close your eyes.

699
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Close your eyes.

700
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,380
So an open the Ark of the Covenant in
front of that Bitch. Right on man. No she,

701
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,180
she,
she looks like you know a nice older lady.

702
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,470
But you know you have a view of just
against, you're just against old bitches.

703
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:14,440
I could feel it. You know
what? I disagree with that. I,

704
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,370
I when, when it's because the
hardest old bitch you could just be,

705
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,860
cause he's compared to the
memory has been what it is. I'm,

706
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm remembering what she looked like.

707
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,020
Oh who's the hottest old bitch we knew
her was because she was a sex symbol.

708
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,580
So already there. Your old bitch. I know.

709
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,140
And and and his is,
the criteria is Diane Sawyer.

710
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,070
It's not one that became,

711
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,400
that used to be hot and super hard and
just maintain it, but like, oh wow.

712
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,240
She used to wait.
She's,

713
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,000
she used to be super hot but now she's
all bitch like Cheryl Tiegs but she,

714
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:54,200
you still like what's up? God knows.

715
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,930
I mean now motherfucker now lack then
not when she was old in 80 I remember

716
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,060
goofy makeup on my right this second.
She's a bad bitch.

717
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,210
God Damn. At least
what's, what's old enough?

718
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,610
Go back to the seventies and think who do,

719
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:20,000
who did I want to fuck back then
with China? But they were all,

720
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,730
I never wanted to pop gripe mom's back
then it was never a hot looking at arm,

721
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,250
which that you would now Pam Greer,
Pam Greer,

722
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,000
a Jessica Simpson

723
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,270
and sees all the old side,

724
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,280
the, I took the bid and went the other
way. I can write, I think I'm trying,

725
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:47,270
I'm going through like old 70s TV show
kind of things cause I'm in [inaudible]

726
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,740
80 minutes or area.

727
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:53,741
And so it seemed like a filthy lucre
Merriam mother from happy days.

728
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,190
Then I like Karen grassle
for House on the prairie.

729
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,780
The mother from little house, Mary Ross
was a bit of a whore. Well there's, yeah,

730
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,670

00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,240
No. I'll talk about my mom that
there's always ads. Mom, shut up.

732
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,080
Anthony's mother's hot.
Never talk about my mom like that

733
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,880
takes care of herself. But you
know, she's no spring chicken.

734
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,040
Awkward moment. I have with a good friend
of mine the other day he came to town,

735
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,240
I took her to a Knicks game. Right.
He's sitting there, right. And I go,

736
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:37,220
uh, and he, he, he's talking
about my little sister. He
goes, well, how, how, uh,

737
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,940
how old, how old is she now? Huh? And I'm
like, uh, he goes to see in high school,

738

it. She's graduating high school. He goes,

739
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,380

She knows beautiful girl.
And he goes, he goes, well,

741
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,840
the apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

742
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,050
Your mother was always really attractive
and it was just kind of silent,

743
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,580
so used to jerk off to my mom.
That's great to know. Yeah.

744
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,290
You got to fill in the blank.

Dad Bitch from buck Rogers
and [inaudible]. Erin Gray,

750
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,910
she was very hot during that time.

751
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,400
Now she's still a hotbed.
She dumped on my Suzanne Summers,

752
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,150
but she got that carved her
face that she is really old man.

753
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,150
Let's go to a gym in Waco.

754
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,300
I hated those fucking big
bloomer panty things. She wore

755
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,470
her out with those.

756
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,510
Now have a nice set of
Victoria's secret spy. Now

757
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,450
that big blue,
my bitch with those boots,

758
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,680
I was never into higher even as a kid,
like when she was Mondo woman,

759
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,640
she was too motherly looking.
How about Lani and too old?

760
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,330
She's just biting Ivan hot. She's just,
she's, when I was fucking married,

761
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,710
when I was 10 I was
into 10 year old girls.

762
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,690
When I was 12 I was at a 12 year
old girls, 1414 year old girls.

763
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:26,560

764
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:30,760
I was never like 14
into 38 year old women.

765
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,620
I never found them attractive.
They were like moms is your whatever.

766
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,390
My age was up until 15 and then
it was always just 15 year old,

767
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:43,840

768
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:47,800
so 14 you weren't into 28 year olds.
Nine means though,

769
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,260
so let's double it.
He's not into something double as age.

00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,000
Derek still looks good.

775
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,550
That doesn't look like she's
trying to keep yourself young.

776
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:16,850
Would fucking surgery in ship.
