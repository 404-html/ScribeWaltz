1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,620
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,350
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and I

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,330
just checking in on you. What's going on?
Whoa, whoa. Jesus. The levels, the levels.

4
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,310
What happened?
You know,

5
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:18,740
one of these days I'm actually going
to have like a little podcast room.

6
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,110
I mean they have one in the all things,
comedy studios.

7
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,820
I just never get over there.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,950
I never get over there
because I'm a working stiff.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,410
I go to work every day.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,100
I'm in a job in fucking 20 years and I'll
tell you right now, I didn't miss it.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,560
Oh, I did miss getting in the
fucking car bump up, but due do too,

12
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:44,480
right? I don't think I'll ever
get over. Oh fucking awful.

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,070
The drivers are out here.
I just,

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,340
their complete lack of sense
of where their fucking car is.

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:54,290
If one more hunt in front of me is going
to make a left and they're just sitting

16
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,470
right in the middle of the lane,

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,090
get over to the fucking left so
everyone around you can go around you.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,970
I know you've been the guy
trying to get around the person.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,350
Did you learn nothing? Obviously
you did. Obviously it didn't.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,360
I try, I play like a little game. Like
how long can I go before I lose my shit?

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,380
Like I could literally just make a
great youtube show. If I just put a,

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,281
I don't know about great,

23
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,360
but it'd be interesting if I just put
a GoPro up on the inside of my fucking

24
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:24,020
Prius Dashboard and just,
just maybe you just call the show.

25
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:28,750
How long can he go right
there be like everyday.

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,530
Okay. Bill drives from here to
here. Right? I might do this.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,870
Bill drives some here to here,
whatever you'd,

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,020
you say the distance and
then you guys can gamble.

29
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,790
It's like fantasy football without
the fucking football and you,

30
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:46,940
you the AUV 11 over under.
How many times is he going to snap?

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,050
Um, or whatnot, you know, already
forget the name of the show,

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,370
but whatever it could be.
It could be interesting to me.

33
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,170
I don't know if it's interesting
to Yo, hey, you know,

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,540
carbon seen lately that I'm actually,
I like,

35
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,060
is that Volkswagen Gti?

36
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:08,570
They brought the thing back and every
time I peek in creepily into the fucking

37
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:11,420
cars as I walked by and see that
they still have to stick shift,

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,710
there's not a lot of those left. That's
a great car. Could Bang for the buck.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,910
Right. All Frugal freckles, Eh,

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,220
God forbid he buys himself
something flashy. Um,

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,740
I swear to God you'd think
that I lived in the depression.

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,140
I always hear like my parents are
fucking frugal. Their grandparents. Well,

43
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:35,150
I think it rubbed off on
them and then it's on to me.

44
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,750
I'll buy my fucking wife anything but I,
I won't buy myself shit.

45
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,930
I just won't do it. I always get Dale,
I'm going to buy it, I'm going to do it.

46
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,380
And I go, oh, what the
fuck am I going to do?

47
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:46,010
And then I'm going to have it and then
what that 1:00 AM I going to do with it.

48
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:47,360
Then it's just going to be sitting there.

49
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,840
It's either going to get dust on it or
someone's going to drive into the fucking

50
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:54,380
side of it. What's the point? You know,

51
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:59,060
a very wise man once told me, you know
what true wealth is walking into a mall,

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,420
being able to buy anything
and then you don't,

53
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,380
and he goes into your walkout and you
have the freedom of that lack of debt.

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,370
And I'll tell you, it's fucking
addicting. It really is.

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,430
Although recently somebody just gave
me a fucking wireless baker and I was

56
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,070
freaking out about the thing.
I actually synced up my phone to it.

57
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,090
I couldn't believe how great it sounded
and I was going to add it into my gym

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,050
course until uh, the lovely Nia heard
how good at sound. She was like,

59
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:31,030
that should be in the house.
We should both use that. So I,

60
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,360
you know, I got fucked
out of that thing, but um,

61
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,900
so I'm like an asshole. I think it might
have even told the story on Monday.

62
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:42,070
I was actually texting people, telling
them, you got to get a wireless speaker.

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,390
This thing is fucking incredible in every
one of my friends wrote me back. Like,

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,100
uh, yeah, I kind of bought one of those
like five years ago and I was like, oh,

65
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,880
you know, just, you know,
case shad. You know,

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,670
I just figured it out.
You know what?

67
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,420
I'm actually recording cause my wife still
sleeping and it's her birthday Bateau

68
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,840
doodle doodle, right. So I don't want to
wake her up, which I probably already did.

69
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,070
So, um, um, in this uh,

70
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,640
Homina Homina I'm in this room and I have,

Most of these are VHS I bought.

72
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:21,520
I bought like every instructional
fucking video you could the classic,

73
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:26,521
I got the Tommy Aldridge rock drums
soloing and double bass workout.

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,970
I got another one, double bass
drumming. I don't even know who that is.

75
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,400
I don't even play double bass.

78
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,160
I get Steve Gadd up close.

79
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,580

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,600
Jesus Christ. Look at all these fucking
things. Modern drama. What year is that?

88
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,040
One, 2008. That's not bad. John
Blackwell. Greg Bissonette. I got,

89
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,070
I got them all. I got 'em off. Dave Weckl.

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,230
Yeah.

91
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,690
Victor Wooten and Carter Beauford.
Zoro I got,

92
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,920
I got them all. Got them all. God knows
it didn't help, but you know what?

93
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:44,690
I bought them off. Oh, I
bought 'em all. Um, by the way.

94
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,830
So recently I said, oh, buddy of
mine. Um, I was like, you know what?

95
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,450
I think the best guitar sound,

96
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,830
my favorite guitar sound I ever
heard on an ACDC album was the,

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,930
for those about to rock album.
And he was like,

98
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,470
I never listened to that fucking
thing and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And, uh,

99
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,420
that was the album that came out right
after the back in black album, which sold,

100
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,960
you know, like fucking 90
zillion copies. So they,

101
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,510
there's nowhere to go after that. Right.
There is no fucking way to go after that.

102
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,240
So no matter what you come up with
people who are going to say it's a flop.

103
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,660
But I fucking love that album.
And um,

104
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,570
and it just so happened Dean del Rey from,
um,

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,291
oh Jesus,

106
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:29,150
I just spaced on the name of his
fuck podcast for those about to talk.

107
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,040
No, let there be talk. And it
was one of the AACD Salem's.

108
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,930
Um, he, uh,

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,620
he sent me this great article on the
making of the back in black album and I

110
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,120
wrote, I was so crazy to me because
I was old enough when that came out.

111
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,070
Like I remember when
back in black came out,

112
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:52,670
I was 12 years old and
then dirty deeds came out,

113
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,080
which was actually a bond, Scott,
and he was already dead obviously.

114
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:01,310
And then they release that
for whatever fucking reason.

115
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,410
Now looking at it,
um,

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,570
which is crazy because bond Scott dies
right after the highway to hell album and

117
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,950
ACDC gets Brian Johnson
and it's literally like,

118
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,010
if this guy doesn't make it,
they go right back to playing pubs.

119
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,230
Who knows what the fuck happens?

120
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,650
The band's over and they end
up having one of the, you know,

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,500
this basically eight
back in black album sold

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,010
more copies than anything probably other
than like Michael Jackson thriller or

123
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,940
Pink Floyd, the wall, not the
wall, the dark side of the
moon. Whatever. Jesus. Bill,

124
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,960
get to the point here.

125
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,000
So you think the last thing you would
fucking do is after you've established a

126
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:46,001
new fucking singer is then put out some
old shit by the last guy who's now dead.

127
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,900
So the, the fucking new guy has to
reestablish himself all over again. Um,

128
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,890
I never really even thought about that
because I just loved everything that they

129
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,580
did. And I remember, um,

130
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,420
being confused of why back in black,
the back,

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,530
the guy on back in black sounded so
different on dirty deeds because there was

132
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:08,180
no fucking information back then.

133
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:12,420
There was no internet shit just came out
and you're like, oh, another ACDC, I'm,

134
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:16,040
and then you'd put it on yet no
fucking idea. Especially at 12.

135
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,960
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

136
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,870
And then for those about the
rock came out after that.

137
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,950
So this is great article talking about
all of that and how that was Atlantic

138
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:25,371
records,

139
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,840
they thought ACDC was a flash in the
pan and they thought the back in black

140
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,450
album, I don't know how the fuck
you make an album as great as that,

141
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,580
you don't think that they have
anything else left in the tank.

142
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,100
So they were like going,

143
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,850
well let's strike while the iron is hot
and they fucking put out dirty deeds and

144
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,750
the band didn't want them to. It had
been released, I believe in Australia.

145
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,020
And then also in, uh, in um,

146
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,780
England under a different fucking name.
I forget.

147
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,920
I used to know all this shit when
I was super fucking ACDC nerd. Um,

148
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,080
and also I hadn't talked on a cell phone
for 20 years, so I had a memory. Um,

149
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,370
but then for those about to rock came out
and I remember this fucking kid in gym

150
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:06,330
class going, look, you, you wish you
shell goes both rock. I was like,

151
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:10,080
I haven't heard of yet to go fucking
socks. I remember thinking like,

152
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,170
what do you mean? I don't think it
sucks. I liked that album. You know,

153
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,680
I like the first song and I find I never
bought the album because he told me

154
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:21,330
that it sucked until years
later I found just like,

155
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,750
fuck this man, I'm going
to buy this album. And um,

156
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,970
to this day I still listen to that and
like when I go downstairs, you know,

157
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:34,800
walked right into my garage with my
fucking gym. Right. Which is so awesome.

158
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,720
That's what I play. That's what
I've been playing lately. And uh,

159
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,060
it's fucking hilarious. Like I
literally, when I go to my gym now,

160
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,380
which is just like back in the day when
I lived in my parents house and I just

161
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,800
would go down to the basement and I would
play either appetite for destruction,

162
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,430
the whole fucking album, I used to
play that whole album lift to it.

163
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,150
And then I would go play drums to
it or whatever album I was into.

164
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,840
I would lift weights to the entire album
and then I would play drums to it or

165
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:07,860
try to, so I'm in the middle
of doing that yet. Uh,

166
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:12,540
yesterday it was fucking,
uh, you know, bench and day,

167
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,770
your favorite fucking day,

168
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,400
the only only fucking exercise you really
keep track of what weight you put in

169
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:22,260
up. And I had a flashback. I
fucking, I was half asleep,

170
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,880
you know, right. All Day.

171
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,760
And I tried to get to workout in before
I go into the writer's room so I don't

172
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,300
become a fucking fat pasty fuck.
And um,

173
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,670
so I had the 40 fives on either side.
Right. I do a set and then I was going,

174
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,810
I thought I'd grab tents,

175
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,970
right to just do one 55 and
I wasn't paying attention.

176
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,920
And I picked it up off the bars. Like,
wow, this feels really fucking heavy.

177
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,760
And I just brought it down to my chest
and I was like, I couldn't lift it back.

178
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:55,260
I grab 25. So I went up to one 85
which, you know, I mean, when you get,

179
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,920
that's a lot of weight for me.
I mean that's more than what I waste.

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,210
So I'm sitting there,

181
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,690
I got it on my chest and knee is asleep
and I'm going Neah Bay and I can't get

182
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:06,540
it off.

183
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,530
It took me back to the days when I was
living at home with my parents and I'd be

184
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:14,460
going, mom, mom, and she'd be going,
I'll be down there in a minute.

185
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,240
And I'd be down there like with
fucking like, you know what?

186
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,360
85 one 90 sitting on my fuck pacey chest,

187
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,150
trying to get it off 200 pounds.
It was always like,

188
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,060
I was always trying to get up to that,
but I was just, I'm a middleweight man,

189
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,850
like serious.
Like if I wasn't such a fucking booze bag,

190
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,150
like I probably should wait like
between one 61 65 instead of a buck aid,

191
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,480
but that lasts 15 pounds up telling you
it's nothing but Scotch and pizza. Right.

192
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,200
So I got this shit sitting on my
chest that I'm like, holy fuck.

193
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,740
I know I didn't have the clips on it,
but I didn't want to fucking,

194
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
I didn't want to dump it off to one side.

195
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:52,550
You know when you do that and then you
get fucking whipped around because a,

196
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,780
I was worried was going to
fly into the mirror. Right.

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,250
So I ended up having to roll the
thing down like back in the day.

198
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,960
And there's that brutal part where it
gets right on your fucking hip bones and

199
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:09,961
then you got to do the little up and over
your junk before all the weight rests

200
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:14,140
on your fucking thighs.
Oh, it's the worst.

201
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,400
I hadn't done it so long and the closer
it gets to your knee caps and then

202
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,500
finally you got to do that
fucking thing where it just,

203
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:25,270
it just scraped your knee bones and
then boom hits the floor. And uh, yeah,

204
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:28,600
I did that as a 47 soon
to be 48 year old man.

205
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,500
That was my fucking yesterday morning.
I love the whole in this wall.

206
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,100
Isn't that great?

207
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
You know why I like the hole in the wall
and I'm looking at right now is I can

208
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,810
see the copper fucking pipe
that I had put in there.

209
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,400
Finally going to get this fixed, get this
fucking room painted. Then that's it.

210
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,240
Then all I need to do is Redo the
kitchen and then it's a brand new fucking

211
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:51,070
house. It's the house said it should
have been that it used to be, you know,

212
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,310
then I'll probably put
it on the market and uh,

213
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,860
I'll take it for like a $400,000 loss.

214
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,800
Buy a house. People, it's a great
investment. I'm such a fucking Weirdo.

215
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,800
Even though I'm going to lose money
on this fucking house. I actually,

216
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,280
well I guess, uh, I guess I might
never sell it. I won't write. Um,

217
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:17,770
what I like about it,
what I did to the house is I actually,

218
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,040
this is going to be weird.
I feel like a sense of responsibility.

219
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,120
When you own a fucking house,

220
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,660
you know that the next person should
get it and they should be like,

221
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,870
you know what and appreciate the lien of
the last guy. He fucking did this right.

222
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
He kept it nice.
You know,

223
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,730
you ever seen an old guy with
an old car but he kept it nice,

224
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,560
still get it nice and fucking waxed and
all of that shit. And everybody goes,

225
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:42,190
oh look at that guy. That guy was
raised fucking right. You know,

226
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,270
that's what I'm hoping the next people
are gonna think. But I know they're not,

227
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,130
they're just gonna come in here and do
fucking blow and fuck hookers and you

228
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,080
have some goddamned kid running around
with a fucking crayon and ruined all his

229
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,850
shit.
Not even appreciate that.

230
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:59,050
I got the fucking door locks fixed and
there's a little skeleton key in there

231
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:02,020
and you can lock all the
doors like it's 1923 again,

232
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,340
you know when you're going to have
Charlie Chaplin over for some fucking non

233
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:10,030
genetically altered fucking horse meat
burgers or whatever the fuck they used to

234
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:14,470
eat back then. Um, anyways, uh,

235
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,750
I need to get glasses by the
way. I got to do that. Um,

236
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,020
I got to get my physical here so I can,
uh,

237
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,440
I told you what the pilot's
license every two years. I got it.

238
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:26,770
I don't think I'm going to
pass the eye exam and, um,

239
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,890
I was actually thinking about it like a,
I could probably get away with it.

240
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,110
You know, I could probably
do one more time, get away
with it. And it's like, Bill,

241
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,450
do you really want to be like
1300 feet off the ground?

242
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:38,410
Getting Away with something?
What are we doing here?

243
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,300
Why don't we try to get a fucking
priorities straight, you know,

244
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,250
and make it fucking happen. Um,
so I'm going to go get some, and

245
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,840
I know I'm going to look
like a fucking sex offender.

246
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:54,080
So already going to be funny to me.
Um, actually, you know something,

247
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,200
you know who did a joke
like that was a Ari Shaffir.

248
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,030
So I gotta give him credit
even though that's, um,

249
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,890
that might even like lifting a joke that
that's exactly what I would look like.

250
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:07,700
But then it just made me flash back when
he shaved his head and he was talking

251
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,350
about, hey, he couldn't have his
glasses on cause if he put him on,

252
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,540
he looked like a sex offender.
See that.

253
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,270
And that right there is why I don't like
watching other people's acts because

254
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,540
the shit just rolls around in your head
and all of a sudden it just puts one in

255
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,450
the chamber. Um, anyways,

256
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,210
plowing ahead here.
Did anybody,

257
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,710
anybody listened to the Michael
Rappaport podcasts? I am Rapaport.

258
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:36,711
I called in to his podcast and
we talked some sports and uh,

259
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,640
you know, he ended up wanting to
put money on game seven. All right.

260
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,790
Bet a steak dinner.
And um,

261
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,490
I took OKC and he took a, the
warriors, I forget what the spread was,

262
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,590
but I just didn't feel
like it was enough points.

263
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,890
I didn't feel comfortable with the bed.
It was like seven or something like that.

264
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,400
I just said, do you know what? Bump it
up to eight, you bump it up to eight,

265
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:04,290
you give me eight points, I'll take OKC.
And he goes, all right, you know, bet.

266
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,970
And you know what, Bam right
there, Fred fucking eight points.

267
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,750
It's exactly what the spread
was, dude, I fucking called it.

268
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,160
So we didn't work out what a what a what
a push would be like, who would when.

269
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,650
So now we're, uh, we've bet the NBA
finals. I took the Cleveland Cavaliers,

270
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,010
he took a, the Golden
State Warriors. So it's a,

271
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,820
can't even say double or nothing because
nobody wanted the first one. So, um,

272
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,640
I don't know. That's always a great
bet. You know, a steak dinner.

273
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,830
It's not gonna break the bank and
then you get to go out and, uh,

274
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,100
even though it's costing you money,
you get a steak out of it, right?

275
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,570
It's not bad when you say, all
right, let's plow ahead here.

276
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:47,920
Let's do a little bit of a read some
advertising here for this lovely Thursday

277
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:52,290
afternoon. Ruby, the receptionist, okay,

278
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,620
this has to be some fucking robot

279

the baseball kid. We'll pitch to you.

281
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,120
And it was literally like the,
for the only child.

282
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,300
Everybody always said it's for
the kid with no friends. It's no,

283
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:13,010
it's for the kid with no siblings. Cause
even the kid with no siblings. I mean,

284
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,360
no friends still had, still had a brother
or a sister. It'd be like, Hey, could you,

285
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:22,280
uh, everybody kind of hates me at
school. Could you, uh, throw the barber?

286
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,510
Is there anything worse than that?
How mean kids are to each other?

287
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,360
It's fucking brutal. But
I'll tell you, you know what?

288
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,200
It ends up producing some great comedians.
You know,

289
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,000

business phone number to Ruby's friendly

298
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:12,000
receptionist in Portland, Oregon.

stomach rumbling? Best of all,

find its precise location with the tap

335
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,230

easy. Lose your phone,

336
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,820
press the button on track and your
phone rings. Even when it's on silent.

337
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,630

important than the others.

352
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:34,870
His chest at some point someone has to
bring up the rear. Look at it this way,

353
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,750
you're batting cleanup, Boll and branch.
Everybody sounds like a steakhouse,

354

day to help you be your best in every

356
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:52,060
situation. And that's getting a good
night's sleep. Isn't that the truth?

357
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,860
Boll and branch delivers the rest you

358

luxury linens and they do it right there.

359
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,350
First bedding company to be there,

360
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:05,710
the first bedding company
to be fair trade certified,

361
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:09,220
which means that your sheets come
from the work of happy hands,

362
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,940

I wish more companies did this man,

363
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,943
you know,

364
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,880
considering everything I made I'm wearing
was fucking sewn together at three in

365
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,340
the morning.
But God knows who um,

366

made entirely from recycled and

367
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,830
sustainable materials.
Look at this company.

368
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:29,560
They've got their head screwed
on straight. Do you know what?

369
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:33,700
Everybody's got a weakness. I wonder
what they're doing. I wonder what it is.

370
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,330
It's probably smoking meth.
Um, next please mention that.

371
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm going to mention it if you give it

Alright,

388
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,720
mine. The only one who kind of looked
at Ruby, the receptionist. I, you know,

389
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,580
just the way they were that

391
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,270
I like a fucking receptionist.
I mean, you know,

392
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:53,570
I might be old school, I
might be sexiest, sexiest,

393
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:57,960
a sexy sexist is what I'm trying to say.
I liked the reception.

394
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:00,260
The hoary are the better
signs they get the job done.

395
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,670
It's not that better when you walked
in, right. And there was some fucking,

396
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:10,050
you know, chick walking around
with fucking fuck me pumps on,

397
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,230
you know,

398
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,540
she looks good and all these
goddamn feminists out there
that sit there and they

399
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:19,380
flip out and they act like every fucking
beautiful woman out there would be a

400
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:21,960
chemist if it wasn't for men.
Like make you know,

401
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:26,490
some of them they're putting their
best foot forward. Jesus Christ.

402
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,400
What do you think we
have remote controls for?

403
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,340
Because no one wants to get up
off the couch and God damn it.

404
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:35,460
If a woman is born beautiful and now she's
got to do is walk around with the Ras,

405
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:37,860
jacked up and attach jiggling
around a fucking office.

406
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,580
And next thing you know she's got a
beautiful home to go home too, right?

407
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,490
Cause some rich guy goes in there and go,
you know what?

408
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:47,920
I'd like to stick my billionaire
Dick between those tits. Hey,

409
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,870
what's wrong with that? And then
meanwhile, so fucking, you know,

410
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,280
half a Leprechaun jerk off like me
can come in and I got some to look,

411
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,350
look at while I'm waiting for the fucking
doctor to finally come in and figuring

412
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,270
out what's wrong with my spinal cord.
What is wrong with dad?

413
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,030
What is wrong with debt? You homely
fucking haters of beautiful women.

414
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,480
God bless him. God bless him for just
showing up and looking good. You know,

415
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,740
given you some to rub one out to, you
know, everything serves a purpose in life.

416
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:23,340
Like right now,
if you some broad and you listening to me,

417
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:27,720
I'm probably motivate you to go write
some paper maybe in Portland, you know,

418
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,080
we all serve a fucking purpose.

419
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,340
Can't we just let the horse be whores?
You know,

420
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,570
there's a reason the word exists.
All right. And I, you know,

421
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,960
I guess because men are running
shit that sometimes there's,

422
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,020
there's fewer options, but give me a
fucking break. You know what I mean?

423
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,450
It would be great if everything was
like even, you know what I mean?

424
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,100
Everything was just fair and the
best got the fucking job right.

425
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,550
But that's never going to happen because
we're human beings and that includes

426
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:04,330
those feminists who don't want it equal.
They just want it better for them. Right.

427
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,010
That's why they're only
talking about women.

428
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,330
They're not talking about the poor kids
that's so together. Their bedsheets,

429
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,420
unless they go to boll and branch. Oh,
that little call back to the advertising.

430
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,080
All right, let's just say
it was free, not free.

431
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,850
Let's just say everything
was fucking even,

432
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,030
are you really going to tell me that
they wouldn't still be that chick running

433
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:26,200
around just fucking blow with people
because she enjoys it. Why can't she just,

434
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:30,880
you know, why can't she have a good time?
Don't you judging her? Oh, you home.

435
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,090
We hate her. Of a cock. Gobbler Huh?

436
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,620
I don't even want, I'm talking about,
I'm just filling up time here. Oh,

437
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:43,621
would you look at it at 26 minutes in 26
minutes in and I'm waiting for my lady

438
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:48,750
to wake up. I've got a couple of
nice gifts. Couple of right there.

439
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:49,930
Fred's Huh?

440
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,110
I'm a big fan of buying your wife
like something that she wears,

441
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,480
you know, cause the more shit that
you buy her that she wears clothes,

442
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,920
necklace, jewelry, any of that bullshit,
the more that shit that you buy her,

443
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,530
the bigger chance she's
going to be wearing it.

444
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,430
When she's bitching at you about something
and all you do is you just put your

445
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:15,170
eyebrows up and as she's rare, where you
just point to whatever you bought her,

446
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,070
you know, stops him right
in their tracks. Well what,

447
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,650
say you got some money Arista,
what is that?

448
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,800
And then the first they're looking at
what did I, did I put my arm in something?

449
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,120
No, no, no. Right there on your wrist.

450
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,540
And then they just look down and they
realize what you're doing and they just go

451
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:35,310
out and then you laugh and it's over.
You laugh and then it's over, right?

452
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,850
And you go over, you do a couple of
Jaeger bombs over at your fucking bar.

453
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,090
And you'd be like, what? When
you're drinking too much.

454
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,780
And then you point to the airings,
what is,

455
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,180
there's something on the side
of my face. Oh yeah, it's great.

456
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:53,181
And then you get another round telling
you all you assholes who are hiding your

457
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:57,660
booze in the back of your fucking toilet.
Just ease off on the booze.

458
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,170
Buy Your wife a couple of things
that she's going to be wearing.

459
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:01,980
And then you can drink
in public like a man.

460
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,590
You know Jesus fucking Christ Jesus.
You know,

461
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:10,080
you imagine being that big of a
drunk that you're actually like,

462
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:14,520
cause that's so fucking cliched.
You know it's also brilliant too.

463
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,810
You know the first guy who did it
cause he keeping it nice and chilled,

464
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,370
right?
Taking it up the back.

465
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,730
Oh God. What a fucking, how
unhappy is that God damn life.

466
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,020
Your wife's just sitting there fucking
yammering at you and you're going,

467
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:36,750
oh my God, this, I don't think I
can get through this. You know,

468
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:40,610
and she thinks she got some sort of weak
bladder. You just keep going in there,

469
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:44,470
you know,
taking the little cork out,

470
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,200
taking a swig like a fucking pirate.

471
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,650
Then you got to flush the toilet,
like it dropped another dose.

472
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,993
Oh my God.

473
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,770
I guess if you're an alcoholic
you probably eat better. Right?

474
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:59,600
You just keep eating veggies all the time.

475
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,290
So no one would get wise to the fact
he had a little bottle back there.

476
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,540
I really don't even know what
I'm talking about right now.

477
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,710
All I know is that the
Pittsburgh Penguins,

478
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,850
the knee breakers, they're
up, uh, two games to none.

479
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,510
What a fucking story that's going to
be if they win. I'm tell you right now,

480
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,850
I don't know what the fucking odds were,
but nobody,

481
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:23,330
people even in Pittsburgh then even
put money down and if they did,

482
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:24,890
they just did it because
they love their team.

483
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:26,540
But nobody at the
beginning of this season,

484
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,420
there's no Pittsburgh penguin
fan that said, you know what,

485
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:32,690
the penguins are going to make
the fucking Stanley Cup final.

486
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,220
They're gonna make the finals, they're
gonna make the Stanley Cup final and uh,

487
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,320
they're going to go up two games to none.

488
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,130
There's not person that one
parameter, Panini, whatever the fuck.

489
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:48,070
And that place is called where they stick
the French fries and like fucking your

490
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:51,670
breakfast and your dinner in
between those buns. Right?

491
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,310
There's nobody standing down there,
right.

492
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:58,450
With the giant fucking back roll.
You know,

493
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,430
Pittsburgh's big on that man.

494
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:05,410
People guys sit down at bars and then you
just got like those just softball size

495
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,660
chunk of fucking Lard, you know,
just protect. It's like the,

496
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:11,450
the kidney airbag,
right?

497
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,770
It's sitting there. Right. And
you know, that's not a set,

498
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,620
it's a fucking trifecta.
Cause once you got those,

499
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,380
then you've got the fucking butt crack.
And that's what you got.

500
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,280
That's what you see when you go into
those fucking places. And you know,

501
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,060
Pittsburgh's not the only
place that goes, hey, you know,

502
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,370
we all like burgers and fries. You
know, we all like a sandwich with fries,

503
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:39,340
but it isn't an annoying that,
you know,

504
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,090
you got to hold the sandwich in one
hand and then pick up the fries with the

505
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,360
other. Wouldn't it be great if he could
just have them all between the sandwich?

506
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,840
You know what I mean? So you can just
shove it down your fucking throat.

507
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:54,790
I should dial in another fucking
pizza. You know, calling up Domino's,

508
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,240
some shit. They're not the only
ones who do that. There's a,

509
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,350
there's a bunch of fucking places around
the country that do it and I'm telling

510
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:05,590
you, whenever you go into those
places, it's, I'm telling you,

511
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,090
you see the kidney airbags,

512
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,610
those giant fucking Ham
hocks just hanging. I mean
literally like, I swear to God,

513
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:16,000
people in Pittsburgh,
I'm telling you like 40% of them,

514
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,230
you could literally take an aluminum
bat and just fucking whack them in the

515
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,320
right net back fat and it would take them
like probably a good 30 seconds before

516
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:29,650
they turned around you. They felt it in
eight seconds, but they got to get all,

517
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:34,651
they got to get the momentum to turn
that torso around and all you gotta do is

518
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,740
just stay outside of their meat hooks.
But it's Kinda, I'm telling you,

519
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:41,800
if anybody from Pittsburgh gets their
hands on you, it's fucking over.

520
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,830
They're going to pull you into that
mass and you're just going to be

521
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:48,130
claustrophobic like word just yet.
You're going to,

522
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:51,820
they're going to drown you and they're
fucking man tits. I'm telling you,

523
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,320
the Ami tourists die a
year just accidentally.

524
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,950
They go to Pittsburgh for a fucking pirate
game when the most beautiful stadiums

525
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,030
ever,
right?

526
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,750
One of those fucking ham hock Pittsburgh
fatties gets a little too drunk.

527
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,650
They lose their fucking equilibrium
and they just fall. You know,

528
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:11,470
you ever see like when they go to detonate
a building, it doesn't fall right?

529
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,830
Or some jerk off goes to cut down a
tree in and lands on his own house.

530
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:19,420
That's what happens except the house
as a tourist in the trees of fatty from

531
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:22,270
Pittsburgh. All right. I don't what
I'm saying. All right. That's it.

532
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,910
That's the podcast. Uh, just checking in
on you, right? There's some music. Uh,

533
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,930
enjoy this.
I don't know what the fuck is going to be.

534
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:30,580
I don't handle this aspect of it.

535
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,640
And then we then you can
listen to the last half hour,

536
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,650
be some podcasts from a year ago and
buy from the same Douche that you're

537
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:42,410
listening to now. You have been
listening to the Thursday afternoon,

538
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,910
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
I hope y'all have a wonderful weekend.

539
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:50,780
You cunts and um,
I hope San Jose once,

540
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,720
not the whole series. I just,
I just need seven games.

541
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,240
This is nothing against Pittsburgh.
I was just breaking your balls.

542
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,310
It's just that this is when like the
panic, my sports panic starts settling in.

543
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,750
Like, Oh my God, the hockey
season's over and bas over.

544
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,620
It's just baseball, baseball, baseball.

545
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:13,610
The dog days of fucking baseball and
the red sox are in first place too.

546
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,510
I love to get into it. Oh
by the way, month of May,

547
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,410
the cigar count all freckles.
I only had one,

548
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,950
only had one last three months and I
said I'd have two a month this year.

549
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:27,620
I had two in January,
two in February,

550
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:29,900
two and a half because one wasn't lit
right, but I don't count that one.

551
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:34,820
Fuck that too. To had one in March, one
in April, one in May, so that's one, two,

552
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:38,510
three, four, five, six, seven.
I like that. That's not bad.

553
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,340
Now we're not going to discuss my drinking
though because I'll tell you it's off

554
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:44,174
the fucking

555
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,470
see you.

556
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,470
[inaudible]

557
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,273
castle.

558
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,853
Hey,

559
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,290
Monday morning podcast on a
Tuesday at 1120 in the morning,

560
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,080
east coast time. Like a,
there was let me slipping,

561
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,400
you know? No, it looks cute.
Actually. I do have excuse.

562
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,840
It was my girlfriend's
birthday yesterday, so, uh,

563
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,750
it's been a great boyfriend
paying attention to her
and someone had to suffer.

564
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,060
You know what I mean?
It's like a threesome.

565
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:24,170
Someone always feel left out man,
or how much you try to pay attention.

566
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,170
My kid and I never had a threesome before.
I couldn't get one once. I think twice.

567
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,580
The first time I didn't
realize that it was going down.

568
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:39,540
I was so young and stupid. I was actually
sitting there and I was thinking,

569
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:44,040
why won't her roommate
leave? You know, the fuck.

570
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,570
And it wasn't until like literally seven
years later I went, oh, wait a minute.

571
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:51,780
She wasn't leaving because fuck.

572
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,390
And then the other time,
uh,

573
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:59,391
it was right there on the table and a
one girl was absolutely gorgeous and the

574
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:05,100
other one, uh, was not gorgeous.

575
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,420
Let's put it that way,

576
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,310
was so not gorgeous that she
eclipse the beauty of the other one,

577
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,110
you know, so, so they, you'd go, hey,

578
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,620
you learn something about me
right off the damn bat. Okay,

579
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,850
well this is what we're going
to do this week on the podcast.

580
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,600
If you guys are new to this
shit, you know, my page. Um,

581
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,250
I didn't want to use every God damn week
and people ask me questions and I tried

582
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,600
to answer them. And other
than that, I babble.

583
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,670
I give you information
about my life and uh,

584
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:48,600
and that's it. I'm fucking out of it
or right. I drank last night. Okay.

585
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:52,980
I was celebrating and actually went to
this gut them in restaurant in New York

586
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:57,690
and went to Bible.
And I'm a big fan of Mario Batali,

587
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:00,750
but I like Uber better.
Baba was just too,

588
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,590
it was too, uh, uh,

589
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,530
my palate was not sophisticated enough.
All right,

590
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:10,410
I'll take the blame chooses Christ.

591
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,240
It was like regular dishes
was shit you've never read.

592
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,880
I had beef cheek, Ravioli. Yeah.

593
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,810
Once you fucking take that in for a
minute. All right. And they had, you know,

594
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,750
they had like pheasants
face fucking Lasagna.

595
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,560
It was always like half of what you
had heard of. But a goose liver,

596
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:39,360
a fucking souffle.
So I dunno,

597
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,460
it was good.
But a Lupa is the shift.

598
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,910
That's the one that I liked that's
got like a fucking, you know,

599
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,690
regular animal's body parts that you
eat mixed in with fucking a Rigatoni.

600
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,670
Oh, what the fuck are you going
to do? You know, if you try shit,

601
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,970
you know, she wanted to go
there. I fucking took her there.

602
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:10,250
And that's what happened
to cupcakes for breakfast.

603
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,084
What do think about that?

604
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,880
It was sitting there left over
from the party and I said,

605
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:16,230
that's a great way to start my day.

606
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:20,100
Let me get myself 9,000
calories of straight sugar.

607
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,520
It was unreal. It was like I did
an eight ball. That's where, eight,

608
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,390
the two cupcakes for 20 minutes.
I was just sitting there thinking,

609
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,760
how fucking great I wasn't.
I'm fucking awesome.

610
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,733
I could do anything.

611
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,920
20 minutes later when the sugar
started wearing off, oh my God.

612
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:43,240
I started pulling the drapes closed
laying in here like,

613
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,030
I dunno,
I dunno.

614
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,900
Don't ever start your day with
fucking two, two cupcakes.

615
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,900
FTE had a beef cheek.

616
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,270
Fucking Ravioli. Beef cheek. I was like,
cheek like the ass. You being cute.

617
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:02,230
They're like, no, they actually know what,

618
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:04,450
I didn't have the fucking balls
to ask him. I didn't want to know.

619
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:08,080
I was eating somebodies face
meeting. A Yak face. Yeah.

620
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,050
Let me get the Yak taint a rag.
Rag Goon.

621
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,310
All right, let's continue with the, uh,

622
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,500
the continuing story of American
Airlines. If you listened to my, uh,

623
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,370
my podcast last week, uh, these cheap
ass motherfuckers at American Airlines,

624
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,270
uh, you know, the alligator arm,
the fucking food up in first class,

625
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,950
you know what I mean? There are 20
people in first class and they made five.

626
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,250
What's the next thing you know?
I was eating a bowl of total

627
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,210
over Nebraska. Actually, no,
that's not what happened.

628
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,560
Just to give you the quick synopsis, I
said, Fuck you and your honeycomb cereal.

629
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,440
This is first class and I don't get a
Goddamn Mama. I don't want anything.

630
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,110
I said all of that with a
little less anger and no curses.

631
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,520
So a few seconds later the guy came back.
All of a sudden he magically,

632
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,920
he has an Omelet and I'm like,
where did you get that?

633
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,610
And he informed me that the pilots
said he already ate so I could have his

634
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:05,050
omelet. And I was like, I don't want
his fucking Omelet. I want my omelet.

635
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,650
All right, I don't want
to starve pilot. You know,

636
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,600
passing out up there, seeing bogeys
Lena poured on the Goddamn Yoke,

637
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,550
whatever you call it.
All right.

638
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,170
So I sent them a letter and this is
the letter that they sent back to me.

639
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,740
And I swear to God,
you know,

640
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:28,741
back in the day if something like this
ever happened and you actually wrote a

641
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:32,680
letter, at the very least, they give
you a free airline ticket. And I'm,

642
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,820
when I say back in the day,
I mean like 2005, 2006.

643
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,390
Now they don't give a shit.
They just keep apologizing profusely.

644
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,910
This is the dumb ass letter
they sent back to me.

645
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,570
I'm only going to read you part of it
because they just keep saying the same

646
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:49,510
thing over and over again.
Okay. I think I got the hiccups.

647
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,560
I think I have sugar hiccups
from stuffing down to cupcakes.

648
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,710
Hang on a second. This
room service. Hello? Yeah,

649
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:02,350
I'm going to check out
about like 15 minutes. Okay.

650
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:08,140
Thank you Jesus. They didn't
say anything. She said hello?

651
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,330
I said, yeah, I'm going
to check out 15 minutes.

652
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:15,330
At which point she could have said
okay or overlay, you know. But no,

653
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,730
she just closes the door. All
right. Okay. Here's the fucking,

654
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,000
uh, what have we got here?
This is okay. This is,

655
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,430
this is the letter that American
Airlines sent me. Okay, dear Mr Burr,

656
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,890
thank you for contacting
American Airlines.

657
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,130
It's our privilege to respond to
your message. Okay. First of all,

658
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,790
right there. They already
pissed me off. Okay. Don't,

659
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:41,450
don't start with off with
your fucking stock line.

660
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,730
Okay.

661
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,580
Like your Jackie Gleason, you know,
thank you for writing as in a way we go,

662
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,940
you know, a little Shevon
off the buffalo. Uh, okay.

663
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,870
I'm very sorry to hear of
your disappointment with
us and regret that you did

664
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:58,440
not receive your preferred Andre when
you traveled with us in the first class

665
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:01,200
cabin, uh, cl solar stasis.

666
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:05,460
Because we want your travel experience
or improving premium cabins to be truly

667
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:06,450
something special.

668
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:11,870
We do our best to cater our
entree selections so that
we can serve each customer

669
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:16,530
the entree they prefer. This is the
part which is just complete bullshit.

670
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,250
Okay. They want to make sure that they
serve the entree that I prefer. You know,

671
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:24,030
and yeah, you can do that. Bringing
up fucking eggs on the flight.

672
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,410
This is what they right to do.

673
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,700
So we determined which entrees
are selected most often.

674
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,560
It's often and provision accordingly.

675
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,340
That's fucking bullshit.

676
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,970
They watched Jurassic Park when Jeff
Goldbloom did his little rant about chaos

677
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:44,804
theory.

678
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,910
Okay.

679
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,280
You think cause you take 10 flights or
a hundred flights and you figure it out.

680
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,240
Oh, you know, seven people want the Omelet

681
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,310
and and you know, nine people want
something else. That's such bullshit.

682
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,380
First of all,
nobody wants to fucking cereal.

683
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,890
No one wants cereal at first class.
Okay,

684
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,920
you fucking dropped $1,500 or whatever
the hell is 800 $1,500 on tickets.

685
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:12,130
You want something of substance of
stick a pitch in about this. Oh,

686
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,400
I know it was in the end of it.
I ended up flying fucking a middle seat.

687
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:18,370
The fucking Dallas and all
I got was $150 voucher.

688
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,050
She'll pay for one third. They
didn't give me anything. Mr Barrow,

689
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:27,320
we are not unmindful of the
inconvenience of you. Well,

690
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:29,900
how the fuck would you be on mindful?
I wrote you a God goddamn letter.

691
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,460
As hard as we are trying to deliver on
respecting your time by operating our

692
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:38,450
flight is scheduled. It just
wasn't possible this time. Again,

693
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:43,430
we apologize for the disruption of your
travel plans. We're not giving you shit.

694
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,530
Please sly with us again soon.

695
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,840
We'll do our best to get you
to your destination as plant.

696
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,660
Really, you're going to do your
best. That's what you can give me.

697
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,470
American Airlines. Well, Gee,
you know, we're going to try.

698
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,060
That's a comforting attitude to have when
they're going to be flying it fucking

699
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:06,800
36,000 feet off the goddamn ground.
Oh, do I sound like a camp this week?

700
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,000
So that's basically it.
That's, that's the, uh,

701
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:14,360
the next level that they've taken it
to where it used to be like, okay,

702
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:18,260
we fuck you over. And the stewardess
gives you a hand job. You know,

703
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,820
that was 1975. Then in
the 80s, it was, you know,

704
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:27,440
we'll give you a free ticket and a skinny
Michael J. Fox tie, but those things,

705
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,370
you know, and you had the little
spiked out mullet. And uh,

706
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,620
that lasted for a good 20 years.
And uh,

707
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,560
somewhere in the last four
or five years it became a,

708
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,850
we're going to fuck you over red back.
Go Fuck Yourself. We think about that.

709
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,703
Go Fuck Yourself.

710
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,780
It was

711
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,960
299 other people on the plane
that didn't fit in complaint.

712
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,820
What are you gonna do?
Take the train.

713
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,630
It's going to take him nine days to get
to New York. Go Fuck Yourself. You know,

714
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:56,710
you're coming back. It's
just eggs. Get over yourself.

715
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,580
You know what? They got me over.
God Damn barrel sounds a bit just,

716
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:04,650
what am I gonna do? Flight
APA. You know Nina fucking,

717
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,980
yeah,
I don't know what in a God damn chicken,

718
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,610
actually I think Ata recently
went out of business.

719
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,120
You have a flying an airline and then
you know, you're like, Eh, you know,

720
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,640
it was kinda weird flight. You
know, there was a crack in the uh,

721
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,780
inner window actually that happened to
be on Ata. One of the windows, you know,

722
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:24,720
they got like, they got the,
the double pane of glass,

723
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,340
they got the one on the outside,

724
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,930
the outside of the plane and then
they have the one on the inside,

725
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,180
the extra level one.
And that one was cracked.

726
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,470
And I believe it was a little bit of
water in there. And I said to the, uh,

727
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,470
to the stewardess, I was like, a woman.

728
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,560
There's a fucking crack of
the goddamn window over here.

729
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:47,670
I'm afraid I'm going to get sucked out
once we get above 6,000 feet. She said,

730
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:50,220
it's like I felt kind of like class.

731
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,323
Yeah.

732
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,030
You know, so I didn't feel bad
when they went out of business.

733
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:57,730
Now I kind of felt bad because now
there's no, there's no other option.

734
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,680
I guess that's my other option.
You do.

735
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:03,700
I sit there and I take it on American
Airlines and they go, go fuck yourself.

736
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,610
All right,
we're going to give you a bran muffin.

737
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,300
I hope you brought some water
or I fly another airline window.

738
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,930
Inner window was cracked and
no one thinks it's a concern.

739
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:20,580
Tanner winters crack. Well, that's, that's
why they got two of them. All right,

740
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,060
this, this, this podcast
is just a cluster. Fuck.

741
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,750
Let's get to some podcast
questions that I didn't even,

742
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,840
I didn't even have the time to
fucking look at this week. Actually.

743
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:34,360
That's not true.
I went to look at them and somebody,

744
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:36,310
I don't know what's going
on with my myspace page.

745
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,610
I don't know if anybody else
has had this problem, but, uh,

746
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,290
I have not been able to really add
anybody for about a year. You know,

747
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,600
every couple of days they'll get
about 45 requests, I'll accept them.

748
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,580
And then a day later I have
47 people taken off my page.

749
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:54,220
And it's like, really? We're
all those people spammers.

750
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,510
I don't know what's going on. So, uh, I'm
having somebody looking at my account.

751
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,460
The only question I can remember,
I can't even remember us.

752
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,370
It was something about
fucking, uh, you know,

753
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:11,690
what movies do I find scary?
Um, well, you know what,

754
00:47:11,691 --> 00:47:14,450
if you turned my flight on
American Airlines into a movie,

755
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:19,010
I would've found that fucking scary.
Um, what movies do I find scary?

756
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:22,820
Anything that involves a crazy woman?
Um,

757
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,340
I think the scariest movies,

758
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:30,341
one of my first got cable in the early
eighties when I had a tight jeans and a

759
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:36,730
pony high tops that just met the bottom
of my jeans and no one complained

760
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,260
because somehow you could get
away with that back then. Um,

761
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,820
I remember the first Friday, the 13th
when Jason came up out of the lake,

762
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,610
that scared the shit out of me. And there
was another one. His, here's one for you.

763
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,070
Okay.
I got a podcast question for you guys.

764
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
There was a movie I saw late night cable
and I can't remember what the fuck it

765
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:02,944
was,

766
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,340
but it's somehow there was
somebody skating across the
pond in slow motion with

767
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:14,170
an ax.
And I believe for some reason the,

768
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:18,730
uh, the monster I'm
picturing is, is from that.

769
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,410
I know this isn't it,

770
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:25,411
but the picture of my mind is what does
that monster book where the wild things

771
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,890
are? You remember what those
monsters look like? In my memory,

772
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:34,720
that's what the monster look like.
Skating across the fucking lake. Uh,

773
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,410
and I know it isn't that, but I know
somebody. What are you, what am I,

774
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:43,330
14 listeners out there has to be
a fucking horror, horror film. Uh,

775
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,250
whatever the four, what do
you call someone's really
into horror films. Like Geek.

776
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,780
Yeah, exactly. A horror film.
Fucking deek. There was that one.

777
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:53,614
And uh,

778
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,490
there was another one I was just
thinking of and I just sat up and I can't

779
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:59,680
remember it.
I'm getting fucking age.

780
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,740
I literally just moved my brain a
little bit. The thought just went away.

781
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,630
Wait a second. What the fuck was I
just thinking? Let me lay back down.

782
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:10,130
Let me see it. It'll come back to
me. Okay. I was talking about, God,

783
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,630
we got to go back in time. You
know, I was talking. Okay. The lake,

784
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:19,020
while things are,
see this side of my brain works,

785
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,450
it works linear. Once I go past
the moment, I can't go back.

786
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,350
It's like a fucking traffic jam.
What the fuck was I trying to think of?

787
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,860
Ah, Shit. I don't know. Oh,
I got it. Bam. There we go.

788
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,760
Um,
dark night of the scarecrow.

789
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,680
I like the old horror movies.
Okay. This is what, you know what?

790
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:46,450
I don't like about new horror movies bid.
They would that CGI shit.

791
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,160
They,

792
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,160
they can do so much insane stuff with
computers that they forgot how to build

793
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,690
suspense. The old ones they
used, they used to build it up.

794
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,430
They used to build up the moment where
the monster was going to jump out at you

795
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,850
because they had to because it was
just a guy in a rubber fucking soup,

796
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:13,450
you know what I mean? But now
that they can, they can, you know,

797
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,300
they can make it look like
Godzilla is stepping on New York.

798
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,900
They forgot how to build to Spence.

799
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,800
That's what I don't like about fucking
horror movies now. And that's a,

800
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,580
I think Japanese,

801
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,760
I don't know everybody over in seems
to know how to fucking do that,

802
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:32,330
but nobody over here. It does even
like the like, like thrillers,

803
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,050
whatever the fuck, whatever a goddamn
thriller it's might take that,

804
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,470
that movie a perfect storm.
They had that goddamn big wave.

805
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,090
That's all they showed in the trailer.

806
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:47,900
So everybody goes out to run out and see
it and then they don't develop any of

807
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:52,310
the goddamn characters to the point that
I don't give a fuck about anybody in

808
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:55,010
the movie. So by the,
by the end of the movie,

809
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,070
I'm actually praying for the wave.

810
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,500
I can't wait for them to kill George
Clooney and Mark Walberg and all those

811
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:06,320
other guys because I don't give a fuck
about their characters because if they

812
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:08,240
haven't done anything
to make me give a fuck,

813
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,830
they just had a couple people speak in
Boston accent and you stick them on a

814
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:14,420
tugboat and I'm supposed to give a shit.

815
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,400
They're going to die trying
to get lots of stuff.

816
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,810
I'm just in a bad mood.

817
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,590
I'm going to bad fucking mode today
and let you know what it is is to God.

818
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,410
And don't ever start your day
with two fucking cupcakes.

819
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,850
It seems like such a great, you know,
such a great idea. You know, like, Oh,

820
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,200
I'm eight years old.
This is what you'd want to do,

821
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:40,970
but your parents never let you, you
know? And now I'm 39 and 51 weeks.

822
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,620
Finally the dream that I
thought was going to happen,

823
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:51,500
you know? Oh, it did happen and it
doesn't play out right. Oh my God.

824
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:52,550
How did I forget this shit?

825
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,670
I know why I forgot it because I have
fucking two cupcakes with the sugar.

826
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,320
My brain. I actually got a crazy
week. How crazy was it bill?

827
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,550
Um, I flew into New York on Wednesday.
I did opie and Anthony Opening,

828
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,900
Anthony Opie and Anthony
show Thursday morning.

829
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,950
Then I did my show at Carolines
in New York Thursday night.

830
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,730
I got up Friday morning, got
on a plane, flew back to la.

831
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,410
I did the guys choice awards on Spike TV,

832
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,210
met all these famous people. They
were all cool. I had a great time.

833
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,680
I met Nikki Sixx.

834
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,920
I was way more thrilled and the after
party was at the fucking playboy mansion

835
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:38,130
and I know what you're thinking.
Oh my God, playboy fucking mansion.

836
00:52:38,131 --> 00:52:41,630
That must have been unbelievable.
I quickly realized when I got there,

837
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:43,940
there's two kinds of parties
at the playboy mansion.

838
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
There's the your famous and you can
come by Wednesday afternoon and actually

839
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:50,990
meet the broads that are in the magazine.

840
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,550
And then there's the one that I
went to where it's like, yeah,

841
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:58,280
why don't you guys all just stand on my,
in my backyard?

842
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,240
I literally thought I was going
to show up to the mansion, right.

843
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:08,480
It was going to be like me and eight
other people and just, you know,

844
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:12,380
for playboy bunnies eats just rubbing
on my chest. Hey, you're a big boy.

845
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:18,500
I heard you're a comedian now.
They just had, they had the,

846
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:23,180
it was definitely the beat
team, a playboy bunny, you know,

847
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,410
they had a little bunny
suits on and the rabbit ears,

848
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,330
but let me tell you
something. And they were, uh,

849
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,550
they were grade a hooter girls and he
could tell there was three of them who

850
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:35,100
were clearly being paid
to frolic in the pool.

851
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:40,580
And any girl with bunny ears had like
nine guys around her was a fucking sausage

852
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:45,000
fest. And this is the funny
thing, nobody was hitting on them.

853
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,510
They was standing there with
their fucking cameras out,

854
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,360
taking pictures like,
uh,

855
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,930
like they were at Disneyland and they
ran into Donald Duck or something.

856
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:59,750
It was pathetic. And uh, you know,

857
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,140
Hugh Hefner was roped off with his three
fucking girlfriends, 83 years old, man.

858
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,900
Got, I think it was the shit that
was the only thing I wanted to do.

859
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:11,820
I just want to go in there and shake his
hand and then immediately stick my hand

860
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:16,821
in bleach to get the unbelievable smell
of 50 years of pussy off of my hand and

861
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,350
then fly back. But he
was busy. I understand.

862
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,120
He had to meet a famous fucking people.
So, uh, but still, it's still a shit.

863
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,140
And then I flew back the next day,
six in the fucking morning.

864
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,830
I landed in New York at about four 30.
I got my bag,

865
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,940
I went over to Caroline's and I
did three fucking shows, you know,

866
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,920
and then I went out drinking afterwards.

867
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,970
And that's the kind of thing that leads
you to be in a country mood on a Tuesday

868
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:49,170
morning. You know, I did all of that
and then I ate two cupcakes. All right,

869
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:53,850
so don't even question my
fucking move. All right. So, um,

870
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,680
so there you go. That was my week.
Went to a party at the playboy mansion.

871
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:02,280
I could stand up on my first award show.
When is it going to be at you ask why.

872
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:06,960
I'll tell you it's going
to be on not June 22nd. Um,

873
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,450
and I had a great time doing the set,
even though

874
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,600
most of the crowd was a pay crowd,
you know, good looking people,

875
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:19,040
hot chicks texting each other and I god,
what kind of,

876
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,620
when this is going to be our bar.

877
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,230
And I said [inaudible] I want
to blow Jeremy Pippin. Um,

878
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,250
it's going to be on June 22nd.
And this week coming up this week,

879
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:34,251
I'm going to be at a good
night's comedy club in Raleigh,

880
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,070
North Carolina.

881
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:39,420
You can go to [inaudible] dot com and
get all the fucking information. And uh,

882
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,830
later on this month, I'm going to be
the punchline in Atlanta, Atlanta,

883
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,840

884
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:49,230
I think that date is June 19th or
something like that. I don't fucking know.

885
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,000
I can't get on this hotel internet and I
have to check out in 19 fucking minutes.

I'm going to blame it on the
sugar from the two cupcakes.

889
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,460
What a fucking half a fag, Huh?
