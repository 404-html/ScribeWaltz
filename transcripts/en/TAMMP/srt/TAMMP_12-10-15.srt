1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,670
All right.
So here's the recordings.

2
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:05,310
I'm doing this on my iPhone before
I go to the airport. And yeah,

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:09,150
I realize they fucked up and I,
I recorded that thing in mono.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,130
I didn't realize it. My, uh, Andrew Andrew
realized itself, so sorry about that.

5
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:18,540
I fucked up again. Anyways, I do want to
thank everybody for all the donations.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,430
Um, if you haven't already
heard, we were almost at $10,000.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,260
Uh, we raised for, uh, those,
uh, sick children I was
telling you about on Monday.

8
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,840
We did it in just three days.
Uh,

9
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,380
you guys came through in a huge way and a,

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,950
you really left some great
messages and you know what, you,

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,670

people's lives for the better.

12
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,500
So thank you very much.
Um,

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,440
I can't believe I had a podcast for this
long and I've never done anything like

14
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:50,130
that. I'm serious. Who Manage,
even if you donated just a dollar,

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,030
um, you know, you helped
some people not be homeless.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,360
There was another family that didn't
have, you know, a hot water heater.

17
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,300
They had no hot water and they're dealing
with their kid who has bone marrow

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:04,800
cancer. So, uh, um, thank
you. So anyways, with that,

19
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,630

of the year you don't even like
him. Um, I did some more Christmas.

64
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,370
I did some more Christmas shopping today.
I think I pretty much got it done.

65
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,590
Um, as far as my wife, I'm
done with that shit. You know,

66
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,250
I got enough shit to put on it.
I got the one main gift.

67
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,550
Then you have enough other shit to fill
up the fucking area under the tree.

68
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,920
It's so stupid.
Um,

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,060
I got to get her like one more
thing and um, and then that's it.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,510
But other than that, I'm getting
ready to go back east. Uh,

71
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,450
I got to do some press here to
hype. F is for family. What is that?

72
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,550
You might ask if you've
been under a fucking rock,

73
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:34,840
not listening to my podcast for the last,
I don't know how year it's coming out.

74
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,130
December 18th six motherfucking episodes
on Netflix. You can watch all six.

75
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,960
It took me four years

76
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,510
to go through this whole journey and you
can devour all of it and to two hours

77
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,210
and 40, 45 minutes maybe. And
then you could send me a tweet.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,950
What's an extra six coming out? Hopefully
within a year or maybe a little more.

79
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,020
Who knows who the fuck knows?

80
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,900
Who knows if enough people watch
it and get a second season.

81
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:02,080
I don't know what that means.
10 12 I have no idea.

82
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,700
Which is why if you go to my website,

83
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,730
I only have one date for next year
because I have to see if this thing,

84
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,870
you know, tanks, if it makes it
a what, you know, what are you,

85
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,120
what are you gonna do, you know,
this guy's looking this way,

86
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:18,580
that guys are going that way and this
gaze, they, what do you want from me?

87
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,890
So anyways,
I'm sitting here in the end,

88
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:25,891
the DFT finally finished basement of
my fucking house and I am on my second

89
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,440
attempt at smoking ribs and the big
green egg is going down right now.

90
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,910
And uh,

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,580
so I am almost an hour and 55 minutes
into a four hour smoke on these things.

92
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,210
My temperature is still right at two 50.
It got a little high in the,

93
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,320
in the first hour.

94
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,790
I get impatient before I lock it in
and it went up as high as three, three,

95
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,780
10 and uh,
it stayed there for a good 10,

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,960
15 minutes and I was able to bring it
down to two 74. While now I'm at two 50.

97
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,850
So I don't know what
they're going to taste like,

98
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:58,920
but I'm already doing better
than I did the last, uh,

99
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,480
the last time I tried this,

100
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,560
my fire went out in an hour and a half,

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,890
so an hour and a 55 minutes in.
I'm still at two 50,

102
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,580
so I went a little too high.
But you know what's killing me is I,

103
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:15,990
it's not smoking anymore. And the
way the big green egg is, is set up.

104
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,360
I can't like open it up and do
all of that shit. It's not as,

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,260
I should just get a fucking smoker,
but it was smoking like a motherfucker.

106
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,900
Yeah,

107
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,733
no,
it's fucked.

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,680
Okay. You're old freckles up.
Just [inaudible] a boy. Yeah.

109
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,760
He came down every gay one thing or
smoke rib thought he could do and she,

110
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,970
you gotta be, you gotta be born down here.
You gotta be born in the swamp, right?

111
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,600
Your mother put on her back,
maybe face down in that fucking swamp.

112
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,710
Impregnating and you come out the same
stank hole and, uh, that, you know,

113
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:54,400
I smoke yourself some ribs.
Um, yes, I am a novice and,

114
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:58,720
um, I was disgusting and everything
I Just said was absolutely disgusting

115
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,640
considering I'm talking about food,
you know,

116
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,150
and the fact that it's so close to
mother's Day, you know what I mean?

117
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,220
Okay.

118
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,870
That's right. It's only
five months away. Um,

119
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,390
so I dunno what happens this time I had,

120
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,050
I had the blocks of Victor Hickory and
that I also soaked a bunch of chips and I

121
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:19,620
thought I put a zillion of
them in there and uh, it will,

122
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:22,320
they'll look at fucking house fire
for the first 40 minutes and then,

123
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:26,130
and now just nothing. So,
um, I don't know what to do.

124
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm thinking to open it up and throw
in some more chips in there. Uh,

125
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,950
I don't know how I'm going to do
it cause I got the plates center.

126
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,690
I don't fucking know.
But they,

127
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,150
okay.

128
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,080
I Dunno who the fuck knows. You know
what it is the worst case scenario.

129
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:42,860
I just fuck up a rack of ribs,
you know, worst case scenario,

130
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:47,240
fucking pig died for nothing. Well not
for nothing, just one side of it's ribs.

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,280
I don't want,

132
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,250
I'm talking about I believe it or not
actually have the Celtics game on in the

133
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,084
background.

134
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,810
I thought for some reason it was
Thursday and the Bruins and playing the

135
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,710
Canadians and uh, I went on the center
ice thing and there was nothing on there.

136
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,780
And then I checked ESPN and Lo and behold,

137
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,680
the Boston Celtics have played the Chicago
Bulls and I got to tell you something.

138
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:10,700
I don't know the name of one
player on the Boston Celtics.

139
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,060
Ah, right. The Guy, he's got the ball,
he's going in towards the painted area.

140
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,350
The shot guy,

141
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:20,490
a white guy and he kicked it
back out to the black guy.

147
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:44,520
The white guy files him cause what
else is he going to do? Stop illegally.

148
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,300
Okay.

149
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,210
White guy walks back to the bed,
shaking his head as if he's not used to.

150
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:50,044
That happening.

shaking his head, no. Is he going?

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,830
He's going back to Europe.

155
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,790
He knows that he can already

A black guy with dreads looking like a
quarterback, but he's playing basketball.

159
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,980
The black eye goes to the paint.
There's a white guy,

160
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:24,000
he does not let me file some of course,
and then acts like he didn't do anything.

161
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,370
The big white guy with the ponytail,

162
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,650
he still has his arms over his
head as if he didn't do it.

163
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,980
He wanted to charge better.
I'm sorry. I like college.

164
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,960
Super fucking pro hoops. A way
too long. See, here's the replay.

165
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,560
That's the guy comes in. Yeah,
dude, you're completely fouled them.

166
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:43,800
You fucking dope. You
jumped right into them. Um,

167
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,990
so anyways, I got to fucking
travel and uh, promote this thing.

168
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,350
I'm going to be true this week. If you're
in New York City, I will be trying to,

169
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:56,890
uh, do some stand up in
and around the city and uh,

170
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,080
I will be doing the oop,

171
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,730
oop and Jimmy show among some other things
and I'll try to keep you guys posted.

172
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,700
Everything's getting
filled in right now and uh,

173
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,830
I'm site to get back there during the
holiday season, you know what I mean?

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,010
Get back there and walked down
fifth avenue, you know what I mean?

175
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,040
Go by Rockefeller Center. Go,
hey, you want to go skating?

176
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,890
And then you see that fucking line that's
like nine miles long and you're like,

177
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,020
hey,
you want to just not do that?

178
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,640
You want to just start fucking drinking
instead. Um, oh, by the way, I did,

179
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,220
I mentioned I'm recording
this on a Wednesday. I didn't
think I told you there.

180
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,460
I said, you're probably wondering why
I'm watching a fucking Celtics game. Um,

181
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,350
but, uh, you know, I realize I
have nothing to fucking talk about.

182
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,280
I have absolutely nothing to talk
about and I am only seven minutes said,

183
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,390
this is, this is what it's like
the bomb on stage people, you know,

184
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,570
when you just fucking burn through your
entire act for seven minutes and you got

185
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:49,590
to do a half hour,
you're like,

186
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:53,100
now what the fuck now at the fuck am I
going to talk about when I read a text

187
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,910
here. I mean it was like, oh
Jesus Christ, he's fucking,

188
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:58,830
you just ain't never fucking
it. You don't, I'm trying to,

189
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:02,520
I'm trying to do what I have
a flight tomorrow, you know,

190
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,100
and I always wait to
the last second to pack.

191
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,100
I wait to the last second to
do the podcast to do the mail.

192
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,590
I wait for the entire morning,
see tire fucking morning.

193
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm running around like an
asshole and right as I sit down,

194
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,040
it's time to go to the airport.

195
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:22,020
So I decided that this was going to be
the first time that I was going to behave

196
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:24,690
like my wife and be
totally fucking prepared.

197
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,970
I'm going to have all or any banking I
got to do, done my Christmas shopping,

198
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:34,200
done I fucking mail done
podcast, done packing, done.

199
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,490
Uh,

200
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,520
but I fucked up cause I decided to smoke
some ribs in the middle of the fucking

201
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:42,000
thing, which was dumb. But
I'm, all I gotta do is this.

202
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,110
And then I got a pack and
then I'm fucking done.

203
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,820
So, uh, you know what that means then
I gotta I gotta start drinking. Right.

204
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,010
They'll tell you guys,
my wife bought me one.

205
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,790
Those little fucking rubber looks like
a tennis balls and you fill it up with

206
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,770
water and makes those
round fucking ice cubes.

207
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,350
Like that guy from that movie where they,
they,

208
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:06,000
the black guys robbed the bank and uh,
Terrence Howard,

209
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,250
the fuck was the name of that movie,
not clockers dead presidents.

210
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,360
That was a great fucking movie, wasn't
it? That was a really good movie. I will,

211
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,500
that was that that day she was brothers.
You know what kills me?

212
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:22,700
That movie seemed like it came out
six years ago to me. And now I'm,

213
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,760
when I'm thinking about that, was that
20 years ago or 20 years ago? Tomorrow.

214
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,010
Not Tomorrow. Next year. Yeah. 96,

215
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,170
no, 95, 95. I moved down to
New York City and I remember,

216
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:40,170
uh, that Halloween everyone
was, was going out as those,

217
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:42,720
the people from that movie putting
a white shit on their face.

218
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,640
You know what I mean? Black people
were not white people, you know,

219
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,871
hey, actually, you know,

220
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,090
when you look about black people were
actually going out and white face.

221
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,953
You know,

222
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,350
Donald Trump was kind of go
fucking complain about that. Um,

223
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,500
I did. Uh, oh, not too, I got
to, this is why I have nothing
to talk about. I already,

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,800
I did Kevin and being this morning and
then I did fucking Mark Marin's what the

225

227
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,990
I just said fucking pause right now.

228
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,550
Should I just hit pause and just fucking
tank this entire podcast? I can't,

229
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:26,580
I have to keep fucking going.
What the Hell is my laptop?

230
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:29,130
Is there anything to look up
the fuck did I do with my law?

231
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:32,580
How do you lose a laptop?
I just had the fucking thing.

232
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,660
I swear to God, if I ever
get Alzheimer's, I'm not,

233
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm not even going to fucking notice
the affiliate a different, no,

234
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:45,570
I don't grab my keys. All right,
here we go. Let's open up here.

235
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,280
Let's get on you. Let's see if there's
anything on the fucking, you know what?

236
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,540
I'm literally going to hit pause. I
look up a few things, so this is just,

237
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,440
this is not even,
this is not even a podcast.

238
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,840
This is just listening
to somebody babbling.

239
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,210
You don't like you sitting
in the fucking waiting room,

240
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,080
something you don't want to go. Yeah, but
we know. Go look something up. All right.

241
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:04,710
Hang on a second. Hang on. All
right, I'm back. Sorry about that.

242
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,170
I apologize for the first 10 and a
half minutes to this fucking thing.

243
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,740
White Guy with the fucking left
hand floater does not go in.

244
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,340
Maybe this is why I don't watch Hulu,
but it just, it makes you feel bad.

245
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,953
You know what I mean?

246
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,200
Okay.

247
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,033
Is a white dude

248
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,170
over the white guy off the glass
and then it's fucking unbelievable.

249
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,700
And he's wearing one of those fucking
windshield masks, you know what I mean?

250
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,660
Like he wanted to be an ax murderer,
but he couldn't commit to it. You know,

251
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,690
he wants to get caught. I forgot
that. I actually, I saw a movie.

252
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,410
I saw a fucking face.

253
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,190
Yeah.

254
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,610
Starring Brad Pitt, uh, Steve Carell,

255
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,870
the guy from drive. What is his fucking
name? He's in everything. Jake. Jaylen.

256
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,360
Oh,

257
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,660
is it Jake Gyllenhaal Miley Cyrus.
Wait a minute.

258
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,780
Wait a minute. I just saw the
fucking movie. You know what it was?

259
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:06,650
I didn't know it was him. He dyed
his hair and, and a Christian Bale.

260
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,940
I saw that movie, the big short. And, uh,

261
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,510
okay.

262
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,740
A buddy of mine got a screener of it and,
um,

263
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,600
I was watching it with my wife and,
uh,

264
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,570
she kept voice spring over to me.
Go and try to explain this.

265
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,530
You're going to explain this. I don't
know what it was basically about the, uh,

266
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,960
all the shit that led up to the,
uh,

267
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,600
okay.

268
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,300
The big fucking what I would've fucked,

269
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,480
whatever the fuck happened in
2007 it was called the big short,

270
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,600
who is basically these
guys bet against the banks.

271
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,220
They basically bet that what was going
to happen in 2007 was going to happen.

272
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,220
They did it in like 2005 and
all the bankers would just like,

273
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,160
what are you out of your fucking mind?
That could never happen. You know,

274
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:53,720
that's basically what it is. And
um, I actually, by watching it,

275
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,340
I ended up having a great
conversation with my wife, um,

276
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,341
about that.

277
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:02,940
Cause I remember when that whole housing
markets scandals and all that fucking

278
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,150
subprime shit happened.
Um,

279
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,070
there was like two schools,
there was either people that 100% blame.

280
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:15,570
The bankers are people 100% blaming
the fucking jerk off set. Got Houses,

281
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,160
you know, like I remember this,
the guy live like below me, right?

282
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,940
This old fucking crazy guy,
he blamed people,

283
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,010
didn't have any money that got houses.
Like he was flipping,

284
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:29,620
I called those people,
had no business tech knows houses there,

285
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,870
had no business getting those loans. And I
was just like, well yeah, that's, that's,

286
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,510
that's kind of what you have
a loan officer for, isn't it?

287
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,760
I mean anybody could walk into a bank
and be like, could I have $1 million?

288
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,920
Right. You're, you're totally within
your right to fucking do it. He just,

289
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,030
you don't give it to them.

290
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,113
Yeah,

291
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,300
you're fucking do a little bit of
research. But I, I'm one of those,

292
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,540
I don't have any sympathy for the
bankers or for the fucking jerk offs to

293
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,260
fucking bought like a,

294
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:05,730
a four bedroom house in their mortgage
was like 80 bucks and they didn't read

295
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:08,010
the fine print that like,
you know, within whatever,

296
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:12,900
seven months it was that good one crease
up to like fucking eight grand a month

297
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:17,040
or something. Nuts. And they look, well
what happened? I'm shit out of luck. Yeah,

298
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:21,150
you're a fucking dope.
You know why I say that?

299
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,480
Because I flunked everything in fucking
pretty much everything in high school.

300
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,300
I sucked it fucking math.
I had to go to summer school.

301
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,310
Like I should've gone every single year.

302
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,560
I went after my freshman year
and I went after my junior year,

303
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,540
my sophomore year,

304
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,260
my teacher hooked me up and gave
me the d minus in my senior year.

305
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,950
I didn't give a fuck cause I
already screwed up for three years.

306
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,320
Was I going to go to summer
school and get into Brown?

307
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,460
It wasn't happening at that point.
I was actually getting into construction,

308
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,880
you know,
I don't even know why.

309
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,460
Cause I knew I was going to have to
get a fucking job and I didn't want to

310
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:57,570
really have a boss.

311
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,440
Like I never wanted to have a job with
like the boss was like fucking right

312
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:05,970
there. Or I had a place to be
like, sit right here at your desk.

313
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,860
You, you, you come in here by eight 30
and you stay put until lunchtime. Right.

314
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:13,170
And then you'd come back,
you'd better be there by fucking whatever.

315
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,760
What time is lunch? One to two, two a
one. The guy's fucking coming around.

316
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,150
I didn't like that. So I always try. I
worked in a little bit in construction.

317
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:26,100
I worked in warehousing. You know, he just
had to be a general giant fucking area.

318
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,740
You now there's places to hide.

319
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,970
Not like I didn't do the job, I just
didn't like people fucking, you know, I,

320
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:38,700
I don't, I don't like people telling
me what the fuck do you know? So, um,

321
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,750
anyways, yeah. So by my senior year I was
like, I, you know, I don't give a fuck,

322
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,070
but I sucked at math and I
was able to figure out, um,

323
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
mortgages enough to at least figure out
how I was getting fucked and to reduce

324
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:57,580
the fuck over as much as I
could. And, um, the first time I,

325
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:02,580
I went and I bought, I bought
a, I bought a, that was it,

326
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:06,650
a fucking 83 Ford ranger
for like three grand.

327
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,710
I had like 500 bucks to my name or
something. So I take all 500 bucks.

328
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:12,630
I put it down in the fucking
car or something like that.

329
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,800
I can't remember the numbers.

330
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,000
And I took out a three year loan and I,

331
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,900
it took me all three years,
you know,

332
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,200
I had like 36 payments and
it took me 36 payments.

333
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,200
I made all of them on time and the bank
got 100% of the amount of interest that

334
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,250
they wanted to get off a dope like me,

335
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,860
the entire three years
that I had the car loan,

336
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,040
it never dawned on me to maybe not go
out drink and fucking a bunch of beers at

337
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:44,040
night and actually take it some of that
money and throwing it at the principal

338
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,170
of the loan. I didn't know that you
could fucking do that. I had no idea.

339
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,810
And I ended up paying a ton
of fucking money in interest.

340
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:55,290
So fortunately somebody talked
to me about it. You know,

341
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,070
when I went to going to get a mortgage
and I still fucked up when I first got a

342
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:03,460
mortgage,
I bought an apartment in New York and uh,

343
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
I bought something that I
could afford and I could,

344
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,000
if I could afford the mortgage payment
plus a little bit more. So what?

345
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,690
So the very first
payment,

346
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,750
I made the mortgage payment
plus a little bit more.

347
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,990
But the thing was I
didn't put it in on the,

348
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,070
I didn't fill in the right area on the
mortgage statement where it says, uh,

349
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,940
uh, basically mortgage and
then it says principal.

350
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,050
I didn't know that the principal
was the actual like whatever,

351
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,820
say I want a hundred grant,
you know,

352
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,460
I didn't know that that was called
the principal. I had no fucking idea.

353
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,310
So I kept putting everything into the
mortgage. So within like four months,

354
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,730
you know, all of a sudden I didn't
get, I didn't get a statement

355
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,260
for the fifth month. So I was
like, what the fuck? What the fuck?

356
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,050
I'm calling the bank. Oh, I knew
I didn't get a statement. Oh,

357
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:52,570
it's good on what's the color?
And they were like, oh, you're,

358
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,460
you're a month ahead on your payments.

359
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,010
Okay.

360
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,730
And I go, what do you mean I'm a month
ahead. I still get like a hundred grand.

361
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:01,960
It's like, no, blah, blah,
blah. And by them talking to
me, I realized, I went back,

362
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,170
look at the statements.
I'm like, wait a minute,

363
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,360
I've been paying like an extra 400 bucks.

364
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay

365
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,550
a month here. And none of it has
come off the principals cause I do.

366
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:13,630
I wasn't putting that towards the
principal and that's when I figured out,

367
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,630
oh Ah,
this is what I want to fucking do.

368
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,980
I want to pay the mortgage
and then take the other money.

369
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,230
You put it at the fucking principle.

370
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,300
Now a lot of you are
rolling your fucking eyes,

371
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,880
but the amount of people that
go in and get a fucking house,

372
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:27,160
it never realize that,
okay,

373
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,720
okay.

374
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,940
Oh realize that they did they front
end load the fucking interests.

375
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:35,200
Like even I think, I think,
isn't it like if you, if you, uh,

376
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,650
even if you're 10 years into
your mortgage, at that point,

377
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:42,310
you've already given the bag 80% interest,

378
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,520
80% of the interests that they're going
to earn on the money that they loaned

379
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,180
you. Because basically when you buy a
house, if you take 30 years to pay it off,

380
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,480
whenever you took out, you're going to
give the bank two and a half times that.

381
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,640
So just to make it easy be
took out to a hundred grand.

382
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:58,240
You're going to pay back
$250,000 all right. Now

383
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,090
for as much as the banks are not fucking
regulated for as much as they got the

384
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:08,770
fucking houses back and they're going
to do it all over again, you know,

385
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,830
make complete fucking shitheads
qualified for mortgages,

386
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,270
right? As long as you, if everybody,

387
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,330
if they could just educate everybody
to that stuff, that whole fucking game,

388
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,130
then people wouldn't get suckered into
those things and then banks could try to

389
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:31,720
do whatever the fuck they want it to
do. Listen, if you're a dope like me,

390
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,760
if you get a fucking mortgage like it,

391
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,450
but isn't there a lawyer
there to walk you through it?

392
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,460
I remember when I closed, I had a
lawyer, right? He said I did in New York.

393
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,150
Okay.

394
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,020
I don't fucking look.

395
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,390
All I'm saying is watch that movie and
then don't get all freaked while you

396
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,270
should get freaked out because
there's a bunch of mouse.

397
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:53,060
Breathe in fucking morons out there.

398
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,760
Okay.

399
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,610
Ah, Christ. Why did I watch that movie?
It's so fucking depressing. Like,

400
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,221
but what am I gonna do?

401
00:22:58,221 --> 00:23:01,380
Am My tells 50 people are going to
do what I'm going to say right now.

402
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,050
Okay.

403
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,010
Nobody gives a fuck. Right?
He'll go on, you know,

404
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:09,410
I'd go out and put $50 down on $1 million
house and enjoy it and do some cannon

405
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:12,560
balls into the fucking tool before
they throw you out in eight months.

406
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,210
That's what everybody's
going to be doing again.

407
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,220
Do I ever had anything optimistic
to say about the future?

408
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,590
It's really ridiculous.
You would, you would,

409
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:25,650
you would think during this time a year,

410
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:28,710
the holiday season that I would
think some shit like that. But um,

411
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,630
for whatever reason I don't.
Um,

412
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,980
that was one thing that it got out
of that and that movie, by the way,

413
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,990
is fucking phenomenal. Steve
Corral is, is amazing. Uh,

414
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,540
the dude from drive,
why can't I remember his fucking name?

415
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,720
I think he's obviously phenomenal.
Act. What the is wrong with me.

416
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,700
All right. Brad Pitt. I'll get three
and a four year and a Christian Bale.

417
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,090
All amazing. The whole
thing is great. And, uh,

418
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,000
I guess I'm depressed after watching
it because in the, you know,

419
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,610
you know the deal, you know, whenever
you fucking watch something like that,

420
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,950
I don't want to ruin the end of the blue.
But she,

421
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:11,460
you know how those fucking
movies in those kinds of movies,

422
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,470
movies that are deemed a powerful, you
know, what do they predict? They always,

423
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,170
you know, if they did and made a
movie about fucking those dolphins,

424
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:22,830
getting to fucking shit kicked out of
him over in Japan. I never watched that.

425
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,830
I didn't watch that fucking thing
cause I didn't want to watch a bunch of

426
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,570
dolphins getting beaten to death.
It's just like,

427
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:32,310
can you just tell me the address I need
to send the money to so the opportunists

428
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:36,150
can keep most of it in and get in fucking
buy a yacht that he calls the dolphin

429
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:38,760
or some shit. And then maybe a
couple of it goes to a porpoise.

430
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,700
A couple of bucks goes over there. Can
you just tell me what the fuck that is?

431
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:45,120
Do I really have to watch the footage?
You know,

432
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,550
the horror of that. Can you just fucking
tell me that's what they do and I'll,

433
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:54,260
I'll, I'll be fine. Do you ever see like
the trailer for that fucking Oh yeah.

434
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,540
You know, all these fucking people that
love watching gory movies, you know,

435
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,230
saw it's fucking Frankenstein and
Friday the third Tate's and fuck it,

436
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,330
Jason goes to Freddy's camp versus the
Predator or whatever the fuck it's called.

437
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,600
You know, all you gotta do if you
really want to see, fuck. You know,

438
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,800
if that's not enough for you.

439
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,840
Cause I would think if you're
watching a horror films,

440
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,660
it's gotta be like porn
off, right? Where at first,

441
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,660
the first time you watch a porn for
the first time you see a, you see it,

442
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:24,440
you're like, oh my God. And then that's
it. It's over. It's over like 30 seconds.

443
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:28,010
You might as well just spending like
in a peep show or just hand crank and a

444
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,200
fucking of view master.
Yeah, you'd be fine.

445
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,760
Be Somehow take it to your head so you
can hand crank it while fucking Yank and

446
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,950
you're fucking the ball
joint down there. Right. Um,

447
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,640
okay.

448
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,910
Did after a while, you know, it's,

449
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,990
you build up a little stamina like
cardio because at the jerk it off,

450
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,970
you know what I mean?
So I would think,

451
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,260
I would think that watching a horror
movies would be the same thing.

452
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,370
Like when you were a kid, you'd watch, uh,

453
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,430
I don't know what the fuck you'd watch.
You'd watch big bird fucking, uh,

454
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,920
try to walk out. He hit himself
on that Chin up bar and that,

455
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,940
that made you feel bad for birds.
I don't fight.

456
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm trying to think of I'll lame
horror movie. What's a bad one?

457
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,871
I don't fucking know.

458
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:16,871
Whatever where they would like the fifth
installment of the killer bees number

459
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:17,690
that,

460
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,170
and they went all over that guy's Vw
bug and he drove into the super dome and

461
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:23,330
they turned on the air conditioner
and then they all died.

462
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,380
It's kind of ironic that they're all
dying now because it's getting too hot.

463
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,030
Right. Um, once again, bill,

464
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:36,200
going back to fucking dude's Day gold
back to doomsday, just shut the fuck up.

465
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,760
Just enjoy, enjoy the
holidays. Um, oh, by the way,

466
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,020
that the pipe Piper's video
should be out any day. Uh,

467
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,720
I'm going to talk to Andrew tonight and
I figured out exactly when that's coming

468
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:51,580
out. I know he put out
the fucking tray. Um,

469
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,560
can you guys will get to
see my ugly ass kitchen? Uh,

470
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,470
if you wondering what those cupboards
are, it's called knotty pine. Not Naughty,

471
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:03,760
not like it's bad, bad pine. It
doesn't mean that it's naughty,

472
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,970
like it has knots in it.

473
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:09,971
And evidently that was all the rage at
some point in the late eighties and early

474
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,210
nineties. But uh, it has
since fallen out of favor,

475
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:17,870
much like a z cavalry cheese
and fingerless gloves.

476
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,210
But my kitchen is a, my kitchen
is an old modge. Aw, Jesus Christ.

477
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:27,500
That guy fell on his fucking ass and
he shook it off. Good man. Black Guy,

478
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:31,400
black guy with the ball. Good deal.
Good deal. He's just Celtic. He's black.

479
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,310
He's got the ball. I liked this. Don't
pass the white guy. Tall. Pass it off.

480
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,160
Eddie messed it. They must of course
he fucking missed it. Of course he did.

481
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,320
Okay.

482
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,850
The Fun. I mean, you know what I mean?

483
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,010
Okay.

484
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,760
Jesus fucking credit. Yeah. Right there.
Right there. Right down the other end.

485
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,040
The court? Yes. Chicago just scored
Chicago. Just go there to have their,

486
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,470
a prob known who to pass too.

487
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,810
I'm like literally reverse racist when I
watched shoot now the white guy give it

488
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:05,050
to the white guy again. Do you know one?
Oh, well, so my were up by eight though.

489
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,340
Yeah.

490
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,910
I'm going to shut the fuck up then.
Maybe.

491
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,030
And maybe my white guys
are doing all right.

492
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,460
Okay.

493
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,280
This has to be our second team in there.

494
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,570
Yeah.

495
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:15,841
All right.

496
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,780
A white guy just faked out another white
guy and then took a shot at the top of

497
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,740
the kid.
Didn't go with it.

498
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,320
Okay.

499
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,490
Is this like a charity game?

500
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,250
I've never seen so many white guys out
on a fucking court and basketball is,

501
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,750
this should be like black and white.

502
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,140
Yeah.

503
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,130
You know what the dribbling with
the hand on top of the ball. Ooh.

504
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,240
Um, was it talking about, oh,

505
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:40,330
it's talking about the end of the world
jerking off and fucking horror movies.

506
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,130
Um, okay. Yeah, I was going to
say, if you really want to see, uh,

507
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,503
okay.

508
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,530
Yeah. If you want to see something
terrifying. Yeah, I would just watch,

509
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,150
just turn on the nature
channel. What else? Fucking
channel it is. Do you remember,

510
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,750
remember these discoveries to fucking
sit there talking about, you know,

511
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,890
they always talking about
the, uh, the animals, right?

512
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,710
And all of a sudden they're not talking
about animals anymore. Isn't that weird?

513
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,150
That was their whole bread and butter.
That's all they talked about was animals.

514
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:12,390
Hey, today we're doing the
cheetahs. It's fucking big cat week.

515
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:15,480
They got that coming up, but
it was dead. It was all it was,

516
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:20,460
was about pretty much nature, nature.
Right? That's all it was about.

517
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:24,210
But you know, it was, I mean, I'm gonna
base it on, on a guy, somebody like me.

518
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,410
I stopped watching that fucking
channel because I love animals.

519
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,813
Right?

520
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,920
And the first fucking three quarters
of every one of those episodes was

521
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:39,570
tremendous. And then the last
third would be like, you know,

522
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:42,220
this is what they would all be adorable.
Look what they do. Look at them,

523
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,100
their natural habitat.
They do the damn dishes.

524
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:48,250
Things I'll look at just killed another
animal. That's how they survive.

525
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:49,300
That's fucking amazing.

526
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,580
And then in the end it was just like
an a and then man came and fucking

527
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:57,070
completely screwed up
their entire environment.

528
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,280
And then you'd sadly watched them dying
next to an empty fucking plastic milk

529
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,760
carton.
You know what I mean?

530
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,543
Container

531
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,540
does carton say that it's cardboard,
one of the giant gallon. Thanks.

532
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:15,320
You know what I mean? That's
plastic fucker. Thanks. Right.

533
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,920
Well you never had milk before.
Fucking look at me like that.

534
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,610
They'll look at your car radio
like that. You asshole. Um,

535
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,520
so I kinda stopped watching it but if
people stop watching it because we came to

536
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:27,660
fucking depressing because at this point
they used to just do shit about bees.

537
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:31,690
You know, in the human interaction be
some guy would put bees on his face,

538
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,740
right and have a beard.

539
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,490
He have a bee beard right now they're
going to talk about how they're dying off

540
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:41,200
in an a photosynthesis. Does it
happen? I was like, no more potatoes.

541
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,380
I Dunno.
Wants to watch that.

542
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,840
Yeah.

543
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,540
My favorite thing now is that people
still go in the fucking ocean and there's

544
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,610
no fish left in.
There's more and more shark attacks,

545
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:53,730
and I think it's going to continue. When
you watch how they vilified the sharks,

546
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,170
you know, those somehow connect
them to isis. You know what I mean?

547
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,740
It's just going to be going to become all
of that. Hey, when the sharks die off,

548
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,270
are we going to make manmade once?

549
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,570
I think that's what's going to happen
in the future because if we're going to

550
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:08,460
start making salmon,
you know,

551
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,010
if you could make one in one of those
in a little mixer, you know what I mean?

552
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:14,880
Take out your kitchen aid. Just get
that DNA swirling around in there.

553
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,093
You know?

554
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,200
That's what we should be doing.

555
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,290
We should be taking the DNA
of all of them just like a,

556
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,040
just like a in Jurassic Park where
they were running out of beat.

557
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:30,930
So I will fucking make some relax, you
know, custom order, how many you need.

558
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,050
Okay.

559
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,160
Oh, you let them loose. Just keep
making the bees so it, you know,

560
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,130
and then maybe they, they die a little
quicker. We just keep making, but then,

561
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,680
you know, whatever made the piece,
whatever that fucking machine was,

562
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:45,370
would cause even more global warming. I
think we're fucked. You know what I mean?

563
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,650
You know,
the more I think about that,

564
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:51,190
that's fucking lunatic that got everybody
to drink the fucking grape juice,

565
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,380
you know,
down there in South America.

566
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:56,530
I think he was onto something
that maybe he wasn't a nut.

567
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:01,420
Maybe he was just an environmentalist
and he was walking around a mall one day

568
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:05,110
and he was just like, you know what
you're saying? Right. You know,

569
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:08,260
and he went to a ball game. He's like,
yeah, you know, I'm still not feeling it.

570
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,860
You want the white neighborhoods, black
neighbor, Asian needs you, you know,

571
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,830
if you saw the people that you've
constraints to kill themselves.

572
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,540
Okay.

573
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,160
All colors, all creeds, all
ages. This guy, Dee Dee,

574
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:23,070
did a nice cleansing.

575
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,183
You know,

576
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,780
I'll tell you right now, you know,
next time, one of those guys who,

577
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,810
one of those Waco Texas guy goes a
little fucking sideways or you know,

578
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:35,440
they went live. See what happens.
Let's see where it goes with this.

579
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,050
All you gotta do is just surround them
and then he'll do the dirty work, right?

580
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,540
Hi Is, this is what you do. This is how
you solve the population problem, okay?

581
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:48,930
Instead of let nuts go on
the fucking street, you know,

582
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,200
you don't just take them out of the insane
asylum because you don't want to pay

583
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:56,100
for them anymore. What you do as
you get him a suit, all right?

584
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,720
And I don't know, you get them to start
a religion or something. I don't know.

585
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,570
I don't know what to do. Okay. As far
as I can, I can know what this plant is.

586
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:06,900
You'd let people out of insane asylums
and he'd give them a brand new suit and

587
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,470
like a briefcase, maybe like an
iPad or some shit like that. Right.

588
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,950
And then they get a fucking job.
And uh, well, you know what,

589
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,290
let's just start over again.
Good.

590
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,780
Looking and saint people regular
in saint people, you just,

591
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:22,140
you just put them out on the street the
way that we do. You know what I mean?

592
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,430
And then he'd get mad going, why is this
fucking asshole not obeying the, the,

593
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,990
the Jay walking in the street,
he go, oh my God, they're nuts.

594
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,450
They're fucking crazy. You know?
You know, look at that fucking,

595
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,850
if a person's out of the fucking mine
and you're literally in your car talking

596
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:38,280
to yourself too, and he's
not thinking it, you know,

597
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,780
is that how I'm going to end up?
I mean,

598
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:44,210
I might can be that person
just talking to myself,

599
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,720
doing that violent head
shake every fucking 10 feet,

600
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,890
walking up the street with a cart
full of God knows what deal is.

601
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:55,970
A Guy who sleeps on the sidewalk, um,
it's fucking like, I was going to say,

602
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:59,180
it's fucking, it's fucking hilarious
that his face is so wind burned.

603
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:03,470
Every time I look at them, it's like,
wow, the giants finally fired Tom Claflin.

604
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,720
And evidently he was not smart
with his money. Sorry. Whatever.

605
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:12,110
The Guy, he fucking leap
booze. Is it up? You know,

606
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:16,700
so it's a way to sync because you go
down there and my dog always looks at it,

607
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,310
the dude with like this,
but then there's concerned,

608
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,790
I get Doug knows when somebody is not a
threat and is actually in trouble. So I,

609
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,510
I've tried to talk to the person,
but it never seems to work out.

610
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,750
They just sort of looks at me like I
always feel like I'm freaking him out

611
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,870
because he's sleeping on the street. Like
I went, he thinks I'm gonna rob them, uh,

612
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,750
do something bad.
But what kills me about the Guy,

613
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,170
he always sleeps on the same side.

614
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,910
He sleeps on his left side right
on his fucking shoulder. Okay.

615
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,570
And what kills me is his head
never touches the ground.

616
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,550
He doesn't have a pillow. His head just
goes straight out. You know what I mean?

617
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,900
Like he got knocked out,
you know,

618
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:55,610
like we see a wide receiver
getting knocked down.

619
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:59,240
His fucking arms are sticking up. That's
what he looks like, but with his head,

620
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,570
and, uh, I always take how
sore his fucking neck is.

621
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,410
So I'm thinking about
getting him a pillow,

622
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,090
but I never know when
he's going to be there.

623
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,510
And I'm not going to walk my dog carrying
a fucking pill every day waiting to

624
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:12,291
see this guy.
And you know,

625
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,300
for all I know I'm going to
come walking up with a pillow.

626
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,660
He's going to think that I'm going
to try to smother them. Well,

627
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:20,240
maybe he's too crazy to accept the pill.
He starts eating it.

628
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,850
Chokes on the fucking feathers. I don't
know. But that's good for the bees.

629
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:26,450
So that's good for the bees. All
right. And I don't mean the Bruins,

630
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,403
right?

631
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,590
Maybe it's still positive way to look at
the future as more and more people get

632
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,690
fucking, you know, you just
started looking at it. It's
a good thing, you know,

633
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,640
didn't Carl and talk about shit like that?

634
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:42,340
That guy was so fucking far ahead of
his time. I think he talked about that.

635
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:47,140
And like the nineties like a joint
disasters rooting for him to happen.

636
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:48,880
You know,

637
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,850
it's weird enough that I think that way
when you actually have a kid that's,

638
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,270
that's, you know, that's a whole
other level of fucked up that I,

639
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,090
that I actually have to respect on some
level. Is that a half hour, 32 minutes?

640
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,420
I right.
I did it.

641
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,560
Okay.

642
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,250
Jesus Christ. And now,
right now it's 91 88 Boston,

643
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,970
there's only two minutes. 32
seconds left. So an NBA time,

644
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,980
it's at least 45 minutes over to the
white guy from at first light up.

645
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,850
There you go.
Black.

646
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:19,290
I points that I'm like finally
should have like 20 more assist you.

647
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:23,250
Bearded fuck. 'Em All right.
That's the Thursday afternoon.

648
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:28,100
Just before Friday, a Monday morning
podcast yet checking in on, you know,

649
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,020
if you guys have been a nice holiday
season, you get the time to uh,

650
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,300
and out with your friends.
And uh,

651
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,030
even though they don't advertise with
me anymore because I brought up the

652
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,580
possibly they could have sex
offenders driving their cars,

653
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,380
I think that was the final nail
in that advertising coffin. Um,

654
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,660
they are a great thing. You know, you
know what's great. If you had called it,

655
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,970
get there at two seconds
and then you can go out.

656
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,900
You can get blind drunk at a Christmas
party. Hit on your boss's wife, fair dies.

657
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:54,420
Say something fucked up to the chicken,

658
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,530
accounting it and call it a night and
not kill anybody and actually live long

659
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:00,840
enough to get reprimanded on Monday.

660
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,503
You know,

661
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,110
actually, I bet bees don't like
Uber. Do they? Oh, look at, Hey,

662
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,920
I'm Alexis Uber when you think about
it. All right, go fuck yourselves.

705
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,200

that's 365 days a year. Rain or shine.

706
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,690
So you know what?
You needed it to be an IX.

707
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,430
You need it to be extraordinary without
an insane price. Tag me, he's young,

708
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,330
he's understands this.
We get it. We get it.

709
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,170
That you get it through and that's why
they've created, you just said this shit.

710
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,780
Uh, when you look good, you feel great.
It's a cliche because it's true. Uh,

711
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,690
beyond these understands this. Once
again, they understand, they understand.

712
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:44,490
A lot of shit,

713
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,500
and that's why they've
discovered underwear that
makes you look good and feel

714
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,180
fantastic.
Uh,

715
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:54,181
note Medallia's pronounced modelle
modal beyond these is made from modal,

716
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:58,120
my grandma, the Alma mobile mobile of
ferric. That's twice as soft as cotton.

717
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,120
That's twice the softest. Whatever's
up against your balls right now,

718
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,610
unless you're wearing me on these
beyond says tons of different colors and

719
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:07,630
styles and the only place to get
matching pairs from men and women.

720
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,260
Plus he whipped, they even
release a new design every month.

721
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,920
I wear whatever free ones they give me
a god damn on my balls have never felt

722
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:17,800
better. Plus we all know that
paying for shipping sucks,

723
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:21,040
so me undies was nice enough to roll it
into the price and say that there isn't

724
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:26,020
any in us or Canada.
Me undies even has a money back guarantee.

725
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,690
If you don't love your first pair,
you got to keep it for free.

726
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,090
You literally have nothing to lose.
To sweeten the deal.

732
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,710

All right.
It

749
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,720
gets me Jesus Christ with it. Okay. I
want to ask you some questions. Ask it.

750
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:55,780
I'm 25 years old and had been married
for two years to a great woman.

751
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,430
No kids yet. Uh, we live very close to
all of her family, parents, grandparents,

752
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:04,930
cousins, all of them. Oh
Jesus. Yeah, absolutely. That
can be a fucking nightmare.

753
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,460
All right. You better. You better
have the ground rules down. All right.

754
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,390
It'd be like, listen, I know your family
fucking lives right around the corner,

755
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,960
but this is my fucking house.
All right?

756
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,420
It's my fucking house.
They only come around on the holidays

757
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,620
for not just show up
like Kramer on Seinfeld.

758
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,110
It's nothing to be be none of that 20th.
Anyways,

759
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,250
her is planning this big three day
long family reunion this summer.

760
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,230
And as much as I love my wife,

761
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,250
I would rather take a shit on a hooker's
toilet then go to this thing. Yeah,

762
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,440
absolutely. Dude, you surrounded by them.

763
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,230
I spend far too much time with their
family as it is. And worst of all,

764
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,760
I think it might conflict with when
you come to do a show in my hometown,

765
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,640
I told her today that have for you reunion
is the same weekend that you come to

766
00:43:57,641 --> 00:44:02,530
town. That I will just have to
skip the reunion. Good man. Uh,

767
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:05,920
she let me have it for about
how important it is to her.

768
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,220
This is what they do.
This is what they do. Um,

769
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,810
how her family comes first.
And if I was a good person,

770
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,950
I would go to the reunion and
then she started to cry. Oh Dude,

771
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:22,750
she hit you with both
barrels, both barrels. Dude,

772
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,290
this is all fucked up.
I'm actually going to whisper in,

773
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:31,060
my lovely woman is fucking four states
away. I had this fucking argument.

774
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,680
I had this argument fucking
a week ago. All right. Uh,

775
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,570
oh my God,
he got to get to the post.

776
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,750
You got to get to the mailbox first
and look for those fucking wedding

777
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,430
invitations,
all right?

778
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:50,090
And you get that and you just rip it
up and fire it over the fucking fence.

779
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,560
All right. I didn't do
that. All right. I saw it.

780
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,190
I knew it was an invitation is she
gets his fucking invitation to go to a

781
00:44:58,191 --> 00:44:59,210
goddamn wedding.

782
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,710
Okay?

783
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:05,480
All right. In the middle of
fucking nowhere. All right.

784
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,660
And I said, I'm not going. I'm not going.

785
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,920
And then she starts telling
me how important these people
are to her. And I said,

786
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,470
give me a fucking break.
They're important to you.

787
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:18,920
I've never heard you say their names.
I don't even recognize these names.

788
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,760
How can this be important?
How can they, and then she,

789
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,570
and then she starts faith.
She just did the exact fucking same thing.

790
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,140
Short of the crime,
you know,

791
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,800
I would think that you would want to go
with this to me is important and blah,

792
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:38,580
blah, blah. It's like, sweetheart, I
spend my life in airports, on airplanes.

793
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,360
I don't want to go to one
extra fucking thing. Okay.

794
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,230
Tell him to put it on Skype and I'll
sit there and watch it with you.

795
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,110
I don't want to fucking go to it.
Right.

796
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,770
Let me ask you to do we
ask them to go to any shit.

797
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,240
Like I would never drag my
girl to a football game. She
hates it. But I sit there.

798
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:00,810
This is really important to me.
Then you are a good person.

799
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,630
You go until gang get truck with me.
It's fucking ridiculous.

800
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,470
I don't want to go.
So anyways,

801
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,010
and then she started to cry.
He said,

802
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:15,430
I have got a lot of a lot of this
shit since they got married. Yeah,

803
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,260
I could tell you that too. Cause
you're 25, you know, you're 25.

804
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:22,060
If you're 25,
when you get fucking married,

805
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:26,920
a woman is going to be 10 years beyond
you just knowing how to fucking roll over

806
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:31,570
you in a relationship. But not
all is not lost. All is not lost.

807
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,370
Let me finish this. Um, if
anything happens in her family,

808
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,600
I have to be there.

809
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,260
Even if it's as small as their cousin
graduating from the third grade.

810
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,620
I'm sick of it. I mean, I really
hate doing stuff like this.

811
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,490
She knows I don't like it, but if I
was just a flat out teller, I hate it.

812
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:51,610
It would break her heart. All
right, so you're a decent guy. Okay.

813
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,180
I would hate to do that because she's my
wife and I love her. All right. See you.

814
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:58,450
Good guy. Thinking about her. Okay. Oh,

815
00:46:58,451 --> 00:47:02,350
and I see my family and I see my family
about once a year since they live on the

816
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:03,340
other side of the country.

817
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,540
She just doesn't understand that I did
not grow up in a family where we spend a

818
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,740
ton of time together. So Shit, shit, life,

819
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:15,370
family reunions, uh, doesn't
mean that much to me.

820
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,840
I feel like those ladies should understand
that if I miss one weekend with them

821
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:24,010
to see my favorite comedian who I might
not get a chance to see again in a very

822
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,780
long time,
then that's all right.

823
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,880
How do I let her know how I feel and get
to give me some space and not crush my

824
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,500
balls about going to all of her
family stuff. Um, all right. Do,

825
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,280
this is what you do. Your head, your
heart, your heart's in the right place.

826
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,350
You don't want to hurt her,
okay?

827
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:43,150
Okay.

828
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,060
And I'm going to kind of side with
your wife on this one in that,

829
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,400
not really sagging with her, but you pick
the wrong one to put your foot down on.

830
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,530
All right? What she had to do is
put your foot down on, you know,

831
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,880
little Mikey just made his first
fucking popsicle stick house.

832
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:04,840
We all have to go over and look at it.
That's something that you could blow off,

833
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:08,280
like a major family reunion.
You kinda got to go to that.

834
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:13,180
You gotta be by his side. Okay?
So that she can prove that. See,

835
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:18,070
I got one. He loves me. Right? So this
is what you, what you are right now,

836
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,250
you're in a great position to barter,
okay?

837
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,610
Because you're going to make the
sacrifice and not seeing my shell.

838
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,170
Okay? So this is what you
tell him. Just say, listen,

839
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,580
my favorite comedian is coming to town.
Just like you said,

840
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,170
I might not get another chance to see him,

841
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,550
but because this is so important to you,
I want to be there for you. So I will go.

842
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,680
Okay. And she'll say, great, thank
you. And then you say however.

843
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:46,550
Okay.

844
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,340
All right. This is when you
barter and just say all this.

845
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,240
I don't know how to say this eloquently
cause I just have to get to the point.

846
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:57,290
All this fucking bullshit. These conti
little stupid ass fucking things.

847
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:01,370
I don't give a fuck about you. I
don't want to go to him anymore. Okay.

848
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,990
I work all day. I come home. I want to
chill out. I don't know your family.

849
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,690
I don't know. I married you.
Okay. You want to go to the,

850
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:14,330
you know the Oscars or your family
reunion. I will go to that shit. Okay.

851
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,870
You dad gets a new colostomy bag.
I'm not showing up to that.

852
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,260
I am not going to all of them.

853
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,420
I will go to some major ones.
I will go to Christmas time.

854
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,360
I'll put on the sweater.
Alright,

855
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,230
but this fucking 24 seven
all the fucking time Susie.

856
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,130
Fuck face is having a birthday party.
I'm not going to it.

857
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:39,290
I'm staying home and I'm
watching the game. Okay.

858
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,520
Because it's making me miserable and I
want to be happy with you. All right?

859
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,540
And this is the thing, she might give
you shit about that, but no, you got it.

860
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,700
You got to put your foot down and
let her cry about it. All right.

861
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:55,520
And just say this isn't fair to me.
This isn't fair to me,

862
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:59,270
that all of my free time
involves being with your family.

863
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,720
All right? I don't know
how you say it, dude.

864
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:04,850
You got to figure out how
to say it's fucking boring.

865
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,100
Good Lord going over there.
I don't like the smell of their house.

866
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,680
I don't like their food.
I don't like the color of their plates.

867
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:15,050
I just want to get the fuck out of there.
I'm not comfortable.

868
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,930
You are go over there.
They're prompt.

869
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,760
They probably don't even
like you go on over there.

870
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,420
You know they want their girl over
there so fucking go over there.

871
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:27,380
So that's what I would do.
Um, just, just play game.

872
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,280
All right? My show is important to you,
is that fucking thing. So why don't you,

873
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:35,180
why don't you cry? No, I can't do
that. But you know what I'm saying?

874
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,280
Just flip it around and just
be like, all right, well,

875
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,820
I want you to know that I'm missing my
favorite fucking comedian to go to this

876
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,880
thing. Okay? And I will go to this
thing, okay? But from here on out,

877
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,620
I am only going to the major ones,
okay? Because I love you. I support you.

878
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,850
But this ticky tack fucking Horse
Shit. That's all you. I'm not,

879
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,860
I'm not doing that,
okay?

880
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,110
Because I need a life outside of this,
outside of your family.

881
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,270
All right? Go for it. Self love you.

882
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,550
Love you buttons. I'll see you
later. How's that? Does that work?

883
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,540
They're built.

884
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,080
Well, I met you after show in Pittsburgh,
the black guy with the hot. Let Tina,

885
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:55,480
we laughed about my shoes,
matching my outfit.

886
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,630
Well,

887
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:03,680
my beautiful girlfriend for the past
three years as a little bit of insecurity,

888
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,780
insecurity issues. Uh, a lot of
those are absolutely gorgeous women.

889
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:10,730
Do you know why it is?

890
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,820
It's because their level
without even reading this shit,

891
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:17,870
the reason why I think a lot of them
are fucking insecure is because,

892
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,860
because of beautiful and
that goes away after a while.

893
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:24,530
So the clock is just fucking ticking.
You know,

894
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,920
if you would just some
regular douche bag like me,

895
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,120
there's no pressure going back to
your fucking high school reunion.

896
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,780
I mean the expectations is so fucking low,
you know,

897
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:40,400
it's easy to just surpass him. Like, oh
Geez, he didn't get fat. Sky's awesome.

898
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:47,900
But if you're a fucking hot chick, it
could just, it could only go downhill.

899
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,290
And I also think that they have the same
insecurity a rich guy has what a rich

900
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:56,490
guys like. This woman's just
with me because of my money,
not because of who I am.

901
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,380
I think that they have the insecurity.

902
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,590
This person is just with me
because of my ass today. Hayes.

903
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,190
Hi. All right. For summary. Odd Reason.

904
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:09,180
She feels the need for me to prove to
her that I love her whenever we're in a

905
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:13,470
public setting. So recently
during some Christmas shopping,

906
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,060
uh, she got upset that I wouldn't hold
her hand as we walked through the mall.

907
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,040
She proceeded to catch one of the,
one of her spicy Latin attitudes with me.

908
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,350
Um, see now if you were white and you
said that, and you said that on TV,

909
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:31,050
you would have to apologize for
nine weeks when you lose your job,

910
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,920
why does it have to be spicy? Are
you saying that lat to, you know,

911
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:38,810
people are like their
peppers. Um, all right,

912
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,910
I'm gonna stop commenting and just
plow through this. Okay. So I handle,

913
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,940
handle the situation like a g parenthesis
gentlemen and completely ignored her

914
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:53,490
ass, um, until we got into the car.

915
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:57,690
And I finally had enough of her telling
me how I don't love her and how she

916
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:01,530
wants me to love her.
Oh, I don't love her.

917
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:05,250
How she wants me to love her and
are unaffected unit of a man. I am.

918
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,131
And you know what,
dude?

919
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:11,160
That right there is probably how you got
this hot girl because you weren't the

920
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,590
first guy. He's sitting there with
your tongue hanging out of your mouth.

921
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,300
You acted like you
didn't even give a fuck,

922
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,560
which fed into her and security of like,
oh my God, is the expiration date hit?

923
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:24,330
Am I not hot anymore? Um, look at
me commenting again. All right.

924
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:28,950
I swear these bitches
are so unappreciative.
Unappreciative as, it's funny.

925
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:30,630
You call them pictures.
What?

926
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:35,340
Can't these bitches understand how much I
appreciate this. Uh, every weekend bill,

927
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:38,670
we do something, dinner,
movies, plays, et Cetera.

928
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,050
But because she has a vantage, she has
to find something to complain about.

929
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,240
I think it's because women have this
trait where they feel a strong need to be

930
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:52,200
miserable. No, dude, you know what's
going on is you're spoiling her.

931
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,490
You're taking her to dinner. Movies
plays every fucking weekend. She,

932
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,970
now she's come to expect it.
You know what I mean?

933
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,630
It's just become part of a routine.
It's not special anymore.

934
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:07,230
So now you have to do something extra
special. Cause special. Is it special?

935
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:13,470
You know, that's what I, I, you know
what? I'm gonna have to whisper this shit.

936
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,220
We were up in San Francisco, right? I
lit up. My credit card says Christmas.

937
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,990
All right. My girl had a
great fucking Christmas. All
right, it's three days later,

938
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,980
we're up in fucking San Francisco. She
wants to go shopping. I'm like, for what?

939
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,290
You didn't get enough, you know, so she
knows him. Right? So what does she do?

940
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,450
She tells me she wants a goddamned
candle. Okay. Because it's not expensive,

941
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,510
but she'll still feel like she got
something because I don't know what it is.

942
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,780
They always get a fee.
They always got to get stuff is there.

943
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:44,580
He's got to be some sort of a goody bag.
And you know what? I wouldn't get it for,

944
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,630
I wouldn't get it for like a,
you'd done? No, I'm not. It's over.

945
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,090
My credit cards are still glowing. I'm
not getting you shit. And you know,

946
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,411
she's cool as hell.

947
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:59,850
So she just kept laughing because I was
being unbelievably rude and I was being

948
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:04,830
really loud. I was just joking
around and uh, but still,

949
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,990
that's the thing. And I just kept
saying, I spoil you. Um, you know,

950
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,350
we're shutting it down for a while.

951
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,640
You're not getting anything
until Valentine's Day. You know,

952
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,620
you want something now I'll
get you a little bag of Fritos.

953
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,690
What do you think about death?
Maybe something to wash it down with.

954
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:26,880
And then what they do is they immediately
get mad and then all you do is you

955
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:29,850
don't take the bait.
They want you to get mad.

956
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:32,850
So then they can turn it into a fight
about something else because they know

957
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:37,200
you're fucking right. All
right? So let it be met.

958
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,560
All you gotta do what? You just
got to stay fucking comp. Well,

959
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:44,550
let's see what this guy does.
Uh, so anyways, he goes,

960
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:48,450
so we are driving along the highway,
leaving the mall and she's still bitching.

961
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,130
And finally I tell, uh, you know what,

962
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:55,350
if you don't like the way I express
my love for you, then step off, uh,

963
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,490
got to read that quote like a black man.
I can't, I'm not even going to try to, uh,

964
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:01,690
so immediately I actually read that.

965
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,910
I read that like a Douchey east coast
white guy. That fucking step off.

966
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:11,730
Uh,
how did you fuck off bitch?

967
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:16,300
I was at, was that good? I know it wasn't
well that don't ask me to do it. Alright,

968
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,590
plowing ahead. You know what? I might
have like a fucking substitute black guy.

969
00:57:19,591 --> 00:57:20,401
Four black guys.

970
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:23,310
Write some shit in here so you guys can
read it the way you supposed to say it.

971
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:26,180
Other than that, you're getting
fucking a crack, harass, read,

972
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:27,960
and you're going to have to live with it.
All right?

973
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:29,730
So immediately after that I said,

974
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:34,500
after I said that this bitch starts
throwing these accurate and quick ass.

975
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:39,660
Paki Oh, combos. She's
punching you. Mind you,

976
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,630
I'm doing 65 miles per
hour down the highway,

977
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,760
trying not to hit the guardrail while at
the same time getting this crazy bitch

978
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:48,594
off me.

979
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:53,190
Luckily I didn't crash
my year old Mercedes.

980
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,380
This guy's hilarious. Come on
dude. Do you love this girl?

981
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,210
She just another accessory.
Um,

982
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,100
my year old Mercedes with
the Corinthian leather, uh,

983
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,780
I get pulled over, I get pulled over
or God forbid, seriously injure us.

984
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,430
I mushed the hell out of her and held
her face against the passenger window.

985
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:19,260
Totally acceptable. Totally.
The Mush is the gentleman move.

986
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:23,220
You can't punch her. You just hold their
head up against the glass, you know,

987
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,940
so the people on the other side gets to
see what her face looks at a fun House

988
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:27,774
Mirror

989
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,400
in order to decrease her reach while
steering the car on the highway and

990
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:39,290
absorbing her manly combos. Got to
give it to her. The bitch had a mean.

991
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:43,520
Right. Um, so if you
can picture me driving,

992
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,170
I can totally picture this
dude. I've lived this. Um,

993
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,750
so you can picture me driving down the
highway in a bright red Mercedes. Okay.

994
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,370
Not, I didn't have a, had a Mercedes.

995
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,570
It was more than a 83 Ford
ranger with black vinyl seats.

996
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,230
Swerving like some drunk
in and out of lanes,

997
00:59:04,231 --> 00:59:08,610
steering with one hand and stiff arming
the shit out of my girls if I'm posing

998
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:12,210
for the Heisman trophy.
After she stopped beating my face in,

999
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:15,120
she had the nerve to say I hit her.

1000
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,630
It hurt her worse by pressing
her face against the glass.

1001
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,670
Are you fucking kidding me?
This bitch took both of our lives.

1002
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,680
Long story short. As soon as I was able
to come to a safe and complete stop,

1003
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,880
I kicked a bitch out and haven't heard
from her since. This was three weeks ago,

1004
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,960
and it's all for the best.
That type of girl can never be satisfied,

1005
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:39,230
which is something I've learned the
hard way over the past three years.

1006
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,170
But this was the straw that did it.
So my question for you is,

1007
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:46,730
was I wrong in this situation
and do I owe her an apology?

1008
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,870
No and no.
All right?

1009
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,400
All you can do is break down
your game plan. All right?

1010
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:01,070
This is where you fucked up.
You took the bait, all right?

1011
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:05,840
She kept pitching and pitching
and pitching and pitching,
trying to make you mad.

1012
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:10,370
She was torn. She got you to do
exactly what she wanted you to do.

1013
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,880
So that gave her an a,
an excuse to do what she wanted to do,

1014
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,360
which was fucking flip out and yell,
all right?

1015
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,310
That's what they do when they know they
don't have a fucking leg to stand on and

1016
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:26,090
they know they're wrong. What
they then try to do, you know,

1017
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,180
not all of them and
not in every situation,

1018
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,900
but when then they're not going to be
an adult and just say, you know what?

1019
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:38,390
You're right. I'm being fucking
crazy right now. I apologize. Okay.

1020
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,150
When they're not going
to take that adult route,

1021
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,020
what they then do is they just push your
buttons and they just try to make you

1022
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:48,590
mad and they just keep pushing you and
pushing it and pushing it and pushing it

1023
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:53,210
until you then flip out and say
something fucking crazy like, well,

1024
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:57,860
if you don't like it, then why don't you
get the fuck out? And then they flip out.

1025
01:00:59,180 --> 01:00:59,570
All right?

1026
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:04,570
So what you got to do is in the future
is you just don't take the bait.

1027
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,150
You've got to recognize,
you know they're doing,

1028
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:10,280
they're doing the fucking
Dennis Rodman thing to you,

1029
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,820
the Beighton you into a penalty.
That's all they're doing. Okay.

1030
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,210
And the ref always sees the retaliation.
That's basically,

1031
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:21,620
it's the same fucking thing.
So when the future just don't get mad,

1032
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,980
it will drive them up the fucking wall
and you won't believe the amount of

1033
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:29,210
argument she can to start winning
because in their effort to piss you off,

1034
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:32,570
they're going to cross like
10 of the lights. All right?

1035
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,870
Now when they cross 10 other lines,

1036
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,530
if you take the bait and then
go even further down the road,

1037
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,420
that's all that's remembered in the end.

1038
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,890
As you then try and piece together
who said what when, but if they go,

1039
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,710
if they cross 10 lines and
you don't take the bait,

1040
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,790
they attend lines beyond where the fuck
they should be and you got him dead to

1041
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:55,820
rights and you just have to
maintain your fucking cool.

1042
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,430
Now getting back to this other shit

1043
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,620
is you do not own her fucking apology.

1044
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,660
All right?
It's absolutely fucking ridiculous.

1045
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:13,810
It's absolutely childish and you can't
as an adult expect somebody to not hit

1046
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:19,220
you if you're hitting them all right?
She's basically asking you to,

1047
01:02:19,221 --> 01:02:24,221
we can extend a common human to human
courtesy that she's not extending to you

1048
01:02:24,561 --> 01:02:27,680
so she can go fuck herself.
You definitely,

1049
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,960
I don't know if you made the right move.

1050
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,230
I don't know if you walk around calling
her a bitch and that type of thing.

1051
01:02:33,231 --> 01:02:36,320
This is you just trying to
be a tough guy going in.

1052
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:40,490
This bitch said this and this, you
know, this bitch said that. Uh,

1053
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,100
that's another thing. Don't go around
calling a bitches cause that Dee Dee,

1054
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:49,190
that just kills your og. Don't have
a call of bad names. All right?

1055
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,410
Just hold your ground.

1056
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:55,250
Don't lose your fucking cool and let them
go through their whole little fucking

1057
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:58,580
history. Onyx trying to get you to
take the fucking bait. All right?

1058
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:00,320
And as long as in the relationship,

1059
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:03,050
you admit when you're wrong
and you sincerely apologize,

1060
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,960
they don't have a fucking leg to stand
on when you're right and you're going to

1061
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:10,610
start winning arguments and you're going
to be happier. There you go. Alright.

1062
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,640
And other than that, I
dunno. Stopped dating site.

1063
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:27,973
Take it easy

1064
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:35,110
for the break of day

1065
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,610
that swim up the window

1066
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:47,110
crying. It won't do no good. Oh,

1067
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,003
come back.

1068
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:54,110
Hi Vic.
How to help myself.

1069
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,700
I won't mistreat chew.
We have no one now

1070
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,410
tell me Barry,
but once you're trying to do,

1071
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,720
I didn't have a fucking party
for a new place. You don't.

1072
01:04:16,721 --> 01:04:17,830
You think that was my idea.

1073
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,980
Do you think it was my idea to have a
bunch of strangers come into the fucking

1074
01:04:20,981 --> 01:04:23,950
house? I'll have people
over. That's what I do. Hey,

1075
01:04:23,951 --> 01:04:28,420
you want to come over and watch the
game? Nine people that I know, right?

1076
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:33,460
Have all your fucking phone numbers.
You don't. Nia is a more open person.

1077
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:38,130
So she's like, let's tell him a party.
All right, so we still, she goes,

1078
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,190
invite your friends. So I'm
all right. So you know I got,
you know, I'm a, I'm a guy,

1079
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:45,520
I don't have a bunch of friends.
Okay.

1080
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:51,580
I got six good friends for that I could
really trust, you know, it's about it,

1081
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:56,110
at least out here.
Then over here in Nia,

1082
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,920
talking to her mom about all excited
about the party and she's like, yeah,

1083
01:04:59,921 --> 01:05:03,490
I sent it on a Facebook and
I was just like, oh my God,

1084
01:05:03,491 --> 01:05:08,200
did I just invite 110 people?
And my heart literally sank going,

1085
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:13,180
please tell me you didn't just invite
110 fucking people. She's like,

1086
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:15,760
don't worry, they're not all
going to show up. It's like, yeah,

1087
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:16,840
but like a third wheel.

1088
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,810
And then they're going to bring people
that you don't even fucking know.

1089
01:05:19,811 --> 01:05:23,380
And that's exactly what happened.
It was a fucking great party.

1090
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,550
I'm not going to lie to you,

1091
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,720
but I got to admit like I
got to learn how to and be.

1092
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:30,130
I thought I was going to be a good host.
I was and I wasn't.

1093
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,920
I was all right with the people I
knew. But the people I didn't know, uh,

1094
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,600
they actually, most of them are all
right, but there were a couple of them.

1095
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:40,450
I just find it just sends you something
fucking annoying about somebody you

1096
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:44,650
don't know. Sitting on your
God damn couch, you know,

1097
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:50,140
eating your food, drinking your booze.
He like Hula Food of fuck are you,

1098
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:54,550
it's somebody else was laying down on
the floor. I felt like the kids' Dad,

1099
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,340
I want to make, get them get a
fucking job, right? It's over.

1100
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,480
You're 26 she fucking pump. So
anyways, so the party is going great.

1101
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,820
And uh, I'm basically the whole time,
you know, not drink it too much,

1102
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:11,080
but I'm standing by the front door
cause that's the only way up. All right?

1103
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:13,990
And nobody's walking out
with any of my shit, right?

1104
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:18,250
I'm acting basically like psycho
in fucking stripes. It's how I am.

1105
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,900
It's how I'm wired.
All right?

1106
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,390
So a fucking three quarters
the way through the party,
everything's going great.

1107
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,840
And I'm like, wow, this is
I, you know what? I forgot.
I forgot. I'm not 21 anymore.

1108
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,370
I'm fucking 43.

1109
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:34,300
All my friends are adults and everybody's
drinking responsibly and no one's

1110
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:37,210
really hammered. Nothing got
broken, everything's cool.

1111
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:41,120
So start just as I was starting to relax,
some kid comes up to me, he's like, Eh,

1112
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:45,220
Eh, you own the house. And I'm
like, well, the bank owns it.

1113
01:06:45,221 --> 01:06:50,040
I'm fucking painted it off. What
can I do for you? And he's like, uh,

1114
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:54,720
yeah, it's kind of embarrassing. But a,
I used the bathroom downstairs and uh,

1115
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:57,550
it's clogged now.
And I was wondering if he had a plunger.

1116
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:03,370
And I was like, yeah, I do have a plunger.

1117
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:07,090
I got a plunger right here, the upstairs
bathroom. So I give it to the guy and I,

1118
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:10,390
and I say, man, I appreciate your honesty.
He goes, no problem. He goes downstairs,

1119
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:14,860
he takes care of it, comes back,
he wants again. He goes, he goes,

1120
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:19,600
sorry about that. I said, not at all, not
at all. What the fuck to toilet, you know,

1121
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,690
clogs up every once in a while. But I
appreciate it. I appreciate your honesty.

1122
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:28,120
You know, cause that would have been
nasty. Good for you. Right. So, uh,

1123
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,970
now the couple of hours goes by,

1124
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:34,370
the party ends and there's
like one straggler left. And
I tell the story to knee.

1125
01:07:34,371 --> 01:07:37,690
I'm like, yeah, I want to go. What a good
guy. What a good shit. No Pun intended.

1126
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,180
You know,
he could have left it in there.

1127
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,180
And then the other party I come walking
in my fucking bathroom looks like a

1128
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:47,590
Goddamn Port Authority bus station,
toilet, you know, so I was psyched.

1129
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,980
So, so one of the strategies of
the party goes, yeah, he goes,

1130
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:53,860
I saw that whole thing go down.
That's not exactly how it went down.

1131
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,560
Like what he talking
about. He goes, he goes,

1132
01:07:56,561 --> 01:08:00,910
it wasn't him that was in the bathroom.
And I go, who was it? He goes,

1133
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,170
it was his girlfriend

1134
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,293
some way,

1135
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:14,040
took a dump of a magnitude that
it wouldn't go down the toilet.

1136
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:19,660
So now she's in there panicking and this
is what today's technology kicks in.

1137
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,060
She could back in the day,

1138
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:25,510
she would have had to crawl out the
fucking window and hope nobody saw her and

1139
01:08:25,511 --> 01:08:29,080
just left the door locked. Everybody
would have panicked. Holy Fuck.

1140
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:33,190
Who's in there? Did somebody pass out? If
somebody, if somebody committed suicide,

1141
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:36,100
someone woulda kicked in the door,
alright,

1142
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:39,310
knocked it off the fucking goddamn
hinges and you go in there,

1143
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:42,580
that'd be nobody in there.
You'd feel the air from outside.

1144
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:45,470
And then look down and everyone
would see a giant shit and be like,

1145
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:50,380
as a party would be over and the owner
of the house would be walking around

1146
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:51,214
going,
okay,

1147
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,040
you better drive away. Right.
That's how it would have ended.

1148
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,570
But because of today's technology,
not saying she didn't panic,

1149
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,030
you know it's even worse.
There's a lady,

1150
01:09:07,031 --> 01:09:09,400
cause they're not even supposed
to do stuff like that. Right.

1151
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:15,150
And she was able to text her boyfriend
and I would fucking pay at least $400 to

1152
01:09:15,371 --> 01:09:18,460
read those texts,
the panic in those texts.

1153
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:25,030
And to his credit, he
fucking, he stepped it up.

1154
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,860
He took the hit, he
came up to me, VH ones.

1155
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,880
I love the eighties own Belper and said,

1156
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:37,450
I took a dump when your toilet to
a magnitude, it didn't go down.

1157
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,200
And I need the tools required
to alleviate this situation.

1158
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:49,540
So Anti Douche bag of the week,
that guy right there.

1159
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:52,360
So taking a fucking
bullet for the team that,

1160
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,980
that right there is the
reverse Peyton manning award.

1161
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:01,870
He didn't fucking go, we had protection
issue, right? No, he took one.

1162
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,730
He took one for the fucking tape,

1163
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:08,950
went upstairs like a Goddamn gentlemen
asked for a plunger, gave it to him,

1164
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:13,270
and it was all fine. And I went
down there at the end of the party,

1165
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:16,660
you never would've known anything,
anything happened. You know what I mean?

1166
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:22,930
Like, uh, you know, three hours after
the Kennedy assassination. I bet it was.

1167
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,220
It was all, I'm say it, you know,

1168
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,730
marked it all up and everything was all
figured out it, but it was a nice road.

1169
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:31,500
Again,
mopped up the brain.

1170
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:32,443
What am I talking about?

1171
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:42,740
[inaudible].
