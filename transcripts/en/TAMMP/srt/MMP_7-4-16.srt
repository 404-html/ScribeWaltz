16
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,780
You guys would defect from your country
just to get over here to get a pair of

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,060
button. Fly fucking five oh one blues.
Remember that shit all of a sudden,

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,300
couple of fucking wars and everybody
forgets how much you love dark jeans.

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,630
That's, you know what, that's just
typical. That is just fucking typical.

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,920
You know,

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,920

they're doing something,

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,330
redoing the fucking music from
the people that we didn't accept.

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,730
Fuck are you guys do it? Um, anyways,

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,440
um,
I'm having a great three day weekend.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,390
I'm not doing shit. I am, uh,

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm back in the workout mode so the
needle is pointed in the right direction.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,880
Oh, freckles is going, Dad, Dad,

30
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,590
dad fucking looked in
the mirror last night.

31
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,200
I could tell I was starting
to lose weight, maybe feel
good. You know what I mean?

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,600
That's, it's a fucking tough
thing being a redhead, you know,

33
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:10,740
use a really small window that you have
to exist in or else the beating start

34
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:14,880
again and it's really something
you can understand. Um,

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,110
all right, I'm all over the fucking
place. I got a bunch of Shit I have to do.

36
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm having some family over
today for a fucking cookout.

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm going easy this year rather than
trying to smoke something and blah, blah,

38
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,850
Blah and do all that shit.
I'm just fucking go on burgers and dogs,

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,130
burgers and dogs the way it used to be
before the fucking food network showed up

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,260
and everybody's got to be like a top chef.
You know? Remember you were growing up.

41
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:40,831
That's what it was.

42
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:45,580
It was burgers and dogs and everybody
was fucking happy right till the booze

43
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,120
started coming around and then,
yeah, and it got a little sideways.

44
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,720
But I mean it happens.
So, uh, yesterday, um,

45
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,090
had some friends over, we had
some cigars, right? And uh,

46
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,710
you know the deal, it's like, all
right, your buddies are coming over,

47
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,450
you're wife's going to be like,
how are they going to bat? Um,

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,190
even if they're cool,
like my wife's cool,

49
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:09,660
but there's always going to be in
element of, Hey, are you going to bear?

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,730
They're going to be loud. They're
going to be upstairs and as, Huh?

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,500
It's like, yeah, I'm having
people over. Do I do that?

52
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,920
When you have a little twice,
do I?

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,260
You have them over for the fucking wines
and you're all sitting there laughing

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,180
with your high pitch fucking voices.

55
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,550
You don't think that that's put
in cracks in the walls? I don't,

56
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,990
I don't fucking bitch about it. I go
down to the old fucking hardware store.

57
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:40,090
I get out to spackle. Right? Okay.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,830
Well with Debbie little cat,
go write another fucking line in the wall.

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,100
You don't hear me complain and got my
putty knife out. Oh, you have a good time,

60
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,110
ladies. Right. Um,

61
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,620
anyways, uh, so we have, we were, uh,

62
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,700
hanging out with actually
fucking hilarious because
I'd gone out and I bought,

63
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,070
you know, got some Cuban cigars. I want to
fuck it. I cleaned everything up. Right.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,680
The thing that,
what you want to do,

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,420
this is what I've realized when you live
in with a woman, which you want to do,

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,890
is you just go all out. Right? You
fuck, I cleaned the fucking place up.

67
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,810
Okay. I even like, like
the deck on the back,

68
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,000
like I fucking hosted off.

69
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,300
So they wouldn't be traipsing dirt in
and out of the house or whatever. Right?

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,270
And she's sitting there going like,
wow, you're really going all out. Yeah.

71
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:32,710
There's a reason Sam Kinison,
there's a fucking reason.

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,450
There's a fucking reason why.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,350
Because what you want to do is what you're
doing is you just put yourself into a

74
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,430
position where you did
absolutely nothing rock.

75
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,950
So when they complain,
cause there's still going to complain.

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,020
You got all of this fucking Amall right?
I cleaned this whole fucking place up,

77
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,790
right? Cleaned out the back porch down
the backyard, the whole fucking thing,

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,220
cleaned it up.
And we're having family over here today,

79
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,460
which was another great one to be like,
well I'm also doing it for your family,

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,400
right? So, um,

81
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm doing all of this shit.
I got,

82
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,100
I got the boots,
I got the fucking thought,

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,000
the outdoor patio furniture.
I got everything all cleaned up.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,180
I got an ash tray upstairs.
I've got one downstairs.

85
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,010
I got the backyard lights on. I got the
whole fucking thing, I got the music,

86
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:27,970
I got the whole thing.

87
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:32,320
And then it like six o'clock at
night I realized I didn't get cigars.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,690
I bought cigars,
but I don't have a humor door.

89
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,990
And I said I was going to pick them
up and I had this fucking panic attack

90
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,740
because it was Sunday before the fourth
that they were going to close and it was

91
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,230
six excruciating rings
before they picked up.

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,570
And I was able to run down there
and get them right. And um,

93
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,600
they showed up, I ordered some
pizzas and all that fucking shit.

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,620
And here's the best part,
right here was the best part.

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,970
I, my wife went to
sleep, right? We smoking,

96
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,650
we're telling fucking stories, you know,
I got all these orange sodas for myself,

97
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:06,950
right?

98
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,330
And I turns out everybody there wanted
one because it had the real sugar and it

99
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,920
went great with the cigar.
I'm telling you,

100
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,820
Cuban Cigar in the fantail
orange soda is the Shit, right?

101
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,230
They drank all my orange soda.

102
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:23,210
So I had to drink grape soda like a
fucking six fucking year old, right? So,

103
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,830
um, anyways, the end
of the night it own it.

104
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,970
I fucking cleaned up everything. You
wouldn't, you wouldn't even fucking know.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,300
You wouldn't know a guide
that you wouldn't know that
a fucking soul was here.

106
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,430
And that's what you do. All these fucking
married guys who sit there, you know,

107
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,990
it's that back and worth it. It
is fucking worth it. It just,

108
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,890
you just have to do it
perfectly, right? You go all out,

109
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,980
you clean up the fucking place,
they come over,

110
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,500
you have a great fucking time.
When you leave,

111
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,290
you fucking cleaned the whole
place up against what can she say?

112
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,060
What is she going to say to you?
You're not allowed to have friends.

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,870
Um,
little things like that,

114
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:05,330
cause I've had buddies in my coming
over here like on dude, you fucking,

115
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:09,710
what are you doing? You did all that and
you're fucking wash the dishes. It's,

116
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:13,940
there's a, there's a genius behind
what I do. I'm talking shit here.

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,790
I'm drinking throat coat
tea and I'm talking shit.

118
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,270
What can they fucking say? Then what it
is is if you do everything perfectly,

119
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,250
then they're leaving
themselves totally exposed.

120
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:32,110
If they start complaining that they're
all that basically can complain about it

121
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:36,020
at that point is that you have friends
and you invited them over to the house.

122
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,310
All right? And they know they don't
have a fucking leg to stand on.

123
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,260
So the bitch and goes down by like 90%
now if you have your fucking friends over

124
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,890
and you leave the fucking ash tray out
and there's footprints all over the

125
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:53,660
fucking place, they can make it
about that when the real thing is,

126
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,960
is they don't want you to have friends,
right?

127
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,340
But they can hide behind the other shit.

128
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:02,510
But then the real thing is they don't
want you to have friends and they want to

129
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:06,710
slowly kill you so that they can, you
know, have the house to themselves.

130
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,560
And if you, you know,
go to the obituaries,

131
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,090
there's a bunch of guys dropping
around 58 59 60 and that,

132
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:14,924
that's what happened.

133
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,710
What really happened was they had
friends over and they didn't clean up,

134
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,440
you know, which gave their wives the
window to bitch them into an early grave.

135
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,860
And now they're sitting there in the
fucking house having a hell of a time,

136
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,420
right?
Getting to play the victim,

137
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,570
getting all the sympathy cards
and eating all the poundcake.

138
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,540
And that's a fact, you know, come in
with the truth here in the 4th of July.

139
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,170
Hannah at the fuck I'm talking
about anyways, so afterwards, right?

140
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:47,090
So we're drinking sodas.
I'm stone sober, right? And

141
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,060
everybody leaves except for one of my
other buddies. And um, he wasn't an AA.

142
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,460
Right? The older you get, the more
your friends fucking, they quit.

143
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,410
You know what I mean?
They just fucking quit.

144
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,310
It's like being a lifer in the military.
Everybody doesn't sign back up.

145
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,650
All of a sudden you're the old guy,
you know,

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,710
fucking walking around where it out. Fuck
all my friends go. Right. Walking around.

147
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,840
All Sad.
But you fucking smokey the bear hat.

148
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,270
All right. Hey you. Um,

149
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,340
so he still drinks so they leave.
So I get out to giant fucking ice cubes.

150
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,900
A poor couple of Johnny blue,

151
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,963
right.

152
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,910
And uh, you know, he has to drive. So
He's, he's doing a little sippy cup shit.

153
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:35,320
And I live here, so I'm doing the
home porch, right. Thousand 1000,

154
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:39,100
2003 seat, right. One of those ports.

155
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,500
So I have a couple, two, three of those.
I'm feeling good. And, uh, you know,

156
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,430
but I'm not, I cleaned the whole fucking
dude when I say I cleaned the whole, the,

157
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:48,670
all the leftover pizza.

158
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,380
I wrapped each slice individually and
foil and then I put a letter on it.

159
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,530
Pay for Pepperoni,
s facade sausage m for fuck in.

160
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,180
Margaret took the pizza boxes out,

161
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:05,410
put them in the recycle Bin,
took out the fucking chemicals,

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,210
fucking spray down the counters.
You wouldn't fucking do that.

163
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,220
God Damn forensic team of forensic cards
with their fucking dusters would come

164
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,690
in, would have no fucking
idea anything happened. Right?

165
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,150
So now I'm feeling all proud of myself.

166
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,990
I got my little fucking sippy drink
there and I put on the TV cause I'm not

167
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:27,400
ready to go to bed yet. And what do
I see? Time life books or whatever.

168
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,690
Time-Life records presents. Easy
listening. Love songs. Right?

169
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:35,110
And I'm sitting there watching
it, right? I'm not in love.

170
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,050
Don't fuck it. Asked me a pitch.
Put Your picture on the wall,

171
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:44,080
cause it to stay there. Right. I'm like,

172
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:48,730
I remember that fucking song and
we'll can forget this one angle.

173
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,720
Bird Hopper,
Dick,

174
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,330
please roll.

175
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,260
Geez. Do you ever listen to the lyrics
of that song? It's like, for fuck's sake,

176
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:03,000
just break up with her. He goes, says
something like, I've talking about,

177
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:07,560
I found a new love.
Her lips are warm and yours is so cold.

178
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:11,070
It's like angled park.
Just enough with the fucking details.

179
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,960
Just break up with you. Your just say,
look, I'm not in love with you anymore.

180
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,900
You know, going to bring up the
other fucking broad down the street.

181
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:23,850
Just got your heart racing. You
fucking cunt. It's such a country song.

182
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,700
But you know,
I heard it when I was younger,

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,580
so I'm listening to all
of these fucking songs.

184
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,950
God doesn't make little green apples
and fucking something, something babble.

185
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,270
And next thing you know,

186
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:41,271
I'm on the phone calling one
800 gimme those fucking cds.

187
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,030
So the guy picks up the phone and he goes,
Hey,

188
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:49,380
this is rob from time live records. Who
Am I speaking too? Let's see, I'm blank.

189
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:54,100
You speaking of Bell, rob, how you
doing buddy? Got Abdu it. Great.

190
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,540
Uh, what, what, uh, what can I do
you for? I'm like, well, you know,

191
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,990
I'm watching ankle bearcomm predict
given this broad too much information.

192
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:06,380
But uh, you know, I like the sound
of it. I want to order the CDS.

193
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,030
And he goes, great, great. Can I
get a phone number? I'm like, no,

194
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,910
you can't not giving you my phone number.
He goes,

195
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:16,230
well then I can't complete this order.
Just like that.

196
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,700
Like I was the 90th
person in a row that said,

197
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm not giving you my phone number.

198
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,520
Okay.

199
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,710
Right. And he was tired of hearing. He
just went, he gave me the old right there,

200
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,180
Fred. Well they're like,
can't do the order.

201
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,280
Is there anything else I can help
you with? And I'm like, Whoa Way Rob.

202
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,760
Well what's going on?
We just went from zero to 200 here.

203
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,140
Why do I have to give you my phone number?
And he's like,

204
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,820
oh you have to get phone numbers so
we can complete the order. It's like,

205
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,720
I understand you're saying that but
I'm asking you why. And he goes,

206
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:47,840
oh it's cause it's company policy.
And I'm like,

207
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,810
why is it company policy if he goes,

208
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,720
because I need the phone number in
order to complete the order. I go, okay.

209
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:56,600
See what we just did there? We
just drove in a circle. Okay,

210
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm trying to get out of the centrifical
fucking force here and get over to the

211
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,440
reason the fucking racing.
Right.

212
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,043
Okay.

213
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,580
And he finally just goes, well, you know,

214
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,870
the reason is that if it's a problem
with your order, we need to to call you.

215
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,830
And it's just like, well, if
there's a problem with the order,

216
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,940
meaning you charging my card in the
cds, don't ever come. You don't think,

217
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:24,730
I'm not going to call you. You get
literally had, when I called up,

218
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,340
if there's a problem with your order,
press two.

219
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,780
So he just, can we just keep
going round and round? I go,

220
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:36,530
you just want the phone number and I go,
not you personally, but time life does.

221
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,650
So they can sell it to other people.
Next thing you know, I'm walking,

222
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,340
my dog had some Qantas calling
me up going, congratulations,

223
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,890
you're the lucky business
winter of whatever, right?

224
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,380
So it fucking escalates to
a really hostile, you have
a good night, sir. I'm like,

225
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,500
Yo, I have a good night
to rob, right? Hang Up.

226
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,800
And I'm sitting there for a second,
right? Doing the whisper, yelling,

227
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,220
fucking cocksuckers they can fucking
stupid enough to give you my phone number,

228
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,750
right? All by myself. Look like
a complete lunatic, you know?

229
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,010
And in the background, the fucking
commercial still on Muskrat, the

230
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,200
amps in that fucking cock
sucking mother fuckers. Right?

231
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,860
Just fucking send me the fucking shit.
I bought this before.

232
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,300
I never had to give you my phone number.

233
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,580
Three easy payments of 29 95.
Right? You get my fucking money.

234
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,920
You gonna call me up page.
It's this rob who time, life,

235
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:33,860
just calling to check to see
if he got those cds, right?

236
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,100
So anyways, um, I really
want these fucking cds.

237
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:43,550
So I called back again and for some
reason I just started to just go into a

238
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,790
southern accent.
And I was like,

239
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,030
when they asked me for their phone number,
I'm just for my phone number,

240
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:53,870
I'm just going to give them their
number. See if they, they notice like,

241
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:57,770
can I get your phone number? Sure. What
800. Right. I was going to do that shit.

242
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,910
But uh, what happened was by the
time the lady picked up there,

243
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,700
it was the end of the infomercial, it
went on to something else. You know,

244
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,970
something that me then makes you skinny
or fucking helps clean up after you

245
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,740
goddamn kids. I forget what it was. Right?
So she, she answers the phone. She's like,

246
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,470
Hey, this is so blah, blah blah blah blah
from fucking time. I'm like, I don't,

247
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,060
I liked the order them a easy listening.
Uh,

248
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,320
Sadie's five easy payments of 29,
nine to five. She's like, okay,

249
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,270
can I get a name? Who Am I speaking
to? Unlock Bill. Bill Burr,

250
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,760
right. Just totally, it does
not sound like a southern name.

251
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,260
Whatever southern and Joe, Bill Burr. Um,

252
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,590
okay.

253
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,810
And uh, she goes, can
I get a phone number?

254
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,860
I just decided I was just going to
give her area coach. I was like,

255
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:46,120
my phone number is eight one eight
three two, three, two, one, two,

256
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,580
five [inaudible]. And she goes, okay,

257
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:54,230
that number is a 183-TWO-THREE-2125.

258
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm like, yes it is. Yes ma'am.
Just lied. I got my tapes.

259
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,710
They're going to fucking show up,
right my cds. No fucking problem.

260
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,630
Okay.

261
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,040
I gave them a fake email,
like I said,

262
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:14,210
too damn tall@aol.com
and you're what that means.

263
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,110
Can I get an email arts?

264
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,140
It's a two the number two
number two and d a m n tall.

265
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,030
Like I didn't say damn like I was trying
to be polite so then she had to read it

266
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:27,864
back.

267
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,990
So that email is number two
d a m n tall@aol.com I like,

268
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:36,010
that's right.
Yes it is.

269
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,940
And I got him common five fucking cds,

270
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,410
five CDs for 30 bucks. Three
payments. I don't know what the fuck.

271
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,020
What is this going to be? A lot
of cds. You know what's funny?

272
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:51,580
My Prius still has a CD holder.

273
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
What my new car gets here at won't
and then what the fuck do I do? Well,

274
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:59,880
I know and I do. I sell them for one easy
payment of nine 95 on Ebay, you know,

275
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,540
and no phone numbers required.

276
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,440
Just give me a fucking address and I'll
send it to you when you think about that.

277
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,670
All right, come on bill. Type in your
fucking pass without Jesus Christ.

278
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,500
So rumor has it,

279
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:16,680
the Kevin Durant is going to go to
the fucking Golden State Warriors.

280
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,060
Okay.

281
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,140
And as a sports fan, I cannot think
of a more boring fucking move.

282
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,953
You know what I mean?

283
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:24,820
Okay.

284
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,790
I fucking hate how ESPN and
all these sports places,

285
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,560
they just don't call him out on it.

286
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,700
Like how bad that is for sports fans.

287
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,570
Okay.

288
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,720
I wanted to see if Oklahoma City, now
he hasn't done it yet, but you know,

289
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:44,190
sources say rumors and all that shit. I
wanted to see if you know, what the fuck

290
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,030
can Oklahoma City get by
golden state next year. Good.

291
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,310
Golden state redeemed themselves and
when a fucking championship, you know

292
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,740
it was such a great series,
exciting series.

293
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,690
Oklahoma had a beat,

294
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:04,230
they had their foot on the neck and then
fucking golden state comes roaring back.

295
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,950
And this is like, this is great. I
want to see this again next year.

296
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,130
Like when the 76 has tried
to get past the Celtics,

297
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,160
Dr Jay didn't just sign with the Celtics.

298
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Granted they got Moses Malone.
I guess it's been going on for awhile.

299
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,180
I just don't fucking get it. Still fucking
get it. It's like, all right, these,

300
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:27,720
this is a great rivalry.
They're evenly matched.

301
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,760
It went seven games.
Hey,

302
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,330
let's take the best player
or one of the best players,

303
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,420
depending on if you like Westbrook prayer
and we'll just stick them on the other

304
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:40,200
fucking team.
And now that rivalry is null and void.

305
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,770
Now it goes from wow seven game,
great series to fucking, you know,

306
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,360
four or five game series.
Who gives a shit?

307
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't fucking get it. It's
fucking Jerry West going, you know,

308
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,700
if he, if you sign here, you're, you're
rebounding is going to be modus more.

309
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
Your blurb of blood can be a chair.
You don't give a fuck.

310
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,180
You don't give a fuck if it's all the
best players in the league are all on one

311
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:09,750
fucking team. It's, it's the worst
fucking thing ever. You know,

312
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,260
this is coming from a Celtic fan. And
I watched us do that. What that Kevin,

313
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,460
Kevin Durant, Kevin Durant, Kevin
Garnett team. You know, they,

314
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,190
we just bought that we went from
literally last place to winning the

315
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,160
championship and one fucking year.
And I realized that there's a skill to it,

316
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,930
but as a crabby old
fucking curmudgeon, um, I,

317
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:32,050
I just don't, I just, what is
exciting about that? If he go,

318
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:34,870
if he signs with the Golden State
Warriors, well that's great.

319
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,040
Why don't you have Lebron jump on that
one to remember those great Miami Heat

320
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:43,990
teams. Remember how exciting
that was if you lived in Miami?

321
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:46,360
Everybody else.
So it was a fucking snooze fest.

322
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,520
They'll sit on a fucking yacht.
Hey,

323
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:55,800
y'all want to be on the same team
will win three in a row and we'll,

324
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,310
we'll be like, we'll be a dynasty. Like
the fucking the bulls. We'd be like them.

325
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,090
Yeah. Except they didn't
pile on. Oh, I'm in a mode.

326
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,070
I hope that moved doesn't happen. You
know, it's going to happen. I just, uh,

327
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,470
you know, whatever, it's his fucking
career. But just saying as a sports fan,

328
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,440
as a guy who fucking watches sports but
doesn't really pick up on anything and

329
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,390
then runs his fucking
mouth than a podcast,

330
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,650
I am not in favor of that fucking move.
That would suck,

331
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,350
you know? Yeah. It just, what,
what, what are you gonna do?

332
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,900
Well, that's what they, that's what these
kids do nowadays. I mean, we're actually,

333
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:35,180
it's been going on for 30
fucking years. Biggest, um,

334
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,430
I guess free agent signing or trade or
whatever of my life of my life was a

335
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,980
Wayne Gretzky.

336
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,350
Yeah.

337
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,500
Go into the kinks.
If ever there wasn't an unmovable guy,

338
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:55,450
like there's no fucking way this
franchises ever getting rid of this player

339
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,130
unless we just completely, I dunno, went
out of business folded and had to move.

340
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,480
Or if our, uh, I don't know,

341
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,260
our owner's son fucking, uh, finance,

342
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:12,610
the Michael Jackson victory tour,
you know, so now daddy has to sign,

343
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,500
sell the fucking team because
Michael Jackson stage was so big at,

344
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:20,290
ate up all these fucking seats that
they were losing money every night.

345
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:25,000
And then racist Massachusetts said
that they couldn't do the show out in

346
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,070
Foxborough,
you know,

347
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,970
cause they didn't want a bunch of black
people coming out to Foxborough mass

348
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:35,110
going, hey, for fucking three hours.
Evidently that was going to be a problem.

349
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,490
I could see then making the fucking move.
All right. Do you know that I promoted,

350
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,340
told me that that's how I always used
to think that when Billy Sullivan,

351
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:47,710
the original owner of the Patriots,
his son Patrick,

352
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:52,430
somehow was the promoter for the Michael
Jackson victory tour. And I remember, um,

353
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,800
at the last second, you know, it was
supposed to be at Sullivan Stadium,

354
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:00,090
which is what's a Patriot's old stadium.
And um,

355
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,880
at the last second Foxborough
was just like, yeah, no,

356
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,350
you're not having that concert out here.

357
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,990
And it was just because it was gonna be
a bunch of black people out there. Right.

358
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,280
And, uh, but Michael Jackson had in his
contract that, you know, once you sign it,

359
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,410
whether the show happens and not,
you gotta pay me.

360
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,220
And I used to think that that
one show fucked him over.

361
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,740
But this promoter in Boston told me,
no,

362
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:25,741
he had this giant ass fucking stage and
the Sullivan's didn't take into account.

363
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,720
This is all alleged here of the amount
of seats that that was going to take up

364
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:35,320
in the arena, you know, and uh,

365
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,660
and they didn't realize that
when they were making the deal,

366
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,730
they were calculating a certain number
of seats versus what they would play in

367
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:43,780
the Jacksons and it all worked out.

368
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,890
And then when they saw the behemoth of a
fucking stage, they will let go. My God.

369
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,390
So they go to Michael, they're like,
Michael, he was like, yes. They were like,

370
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:56,380
can you make your stage a little smaller?
We're going to lose our shirts here.

371
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,490
And Michael Jackson was like,
no, I, if, if I have it smaller,

372
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,650
prince is going to outdo me.
Like he had like, you know,

373
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,380
that rivalry with Tim going on.
I don't know if that's fucking true.

374
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,820
Somebody told me this story and then I
just repeated it as fact. I mean this,

375
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,210
this is what I do on the podcast.

376
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,840
I'm just running my up
here. Uh, did anybody watch,

377
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:19,570
did you watch the Austrian Grand Prix?

378
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,760
If that didn't make you a
fucking formula one racing fan?

379
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,460
Holy Shit.
That was like fucking days of

380
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,200
actually tweeted that yesterday,
dude. It's like, okay,

381
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:38,500
this is the deal. The German
team, the Mercedes Benz, right?

382
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,890
They got Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.
All right.

383
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:45,950
Nico Rosberg is a German,
right?

384
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,720
Lewis Hamilton is, uh, he's
from England, right? And uh,

385
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,850
evidently from the isle of Man,

386
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,700
from what people were texting
tweeting me the other day.

387
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,140
So Nico is ahead.
He's,

388
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,050
he's beaten everybody in
the points in the standings.

389
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,460
And Louis is like the fucking
upstart guy, I guess. I Dunno. Right?

390
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,300
He wears the big fucking diamond
chain, you know what I mean? He's from,

391
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,020
he's from England. I don't know what is,
is, is racist. I don't know if he's mixed.

392
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:19,190
I don't know what his deal is. And he's
got the bling going on and all this shit.

393
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,190
So all the old fucking,
um,

394
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,200
traditional fans of the
sport, traditional wink, wink.

395
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,950
I like the Old School Formula
One, wink, wink. Right.

396
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:33,410
You know what that fucking means?
They don't like this guy.

397
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,990
Evidently they don't like is blamed.
They don't like his,

398
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,010
you know his whole item. Boise, I dunno,

399
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,290
I don't want to fucking
throw the ugliness in there,

400
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:46,070
but it seems like there's a little
issue there. Right. So anyways,

401
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:48,950
earlier this year I guess to the Spanish
Grand Prix, I didn't see that one.

402
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,770
They both fucking,
they banged into each other.

403
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,830
Nico was coming around the corner and
he's pushing buttons on that playstation

404
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,650
steering wheel, whatever the
fuck that thing is. You just,

405
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,630
you just have a fucking stairwell. Then
it was a steering wheel with the paddles.

406
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,370
Now it looks like a little game boy and
they're pushing shit to fucking conserve

407
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,650
energy and I don't,
I don't know what the fuck it is.

408
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,420
But they somehow do this going like 180
miles an hour, which is amazing to me.

409
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,280
Hundred 20 miles an hour and a fucking
turn as if did dealing with the g forces

410
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:21,980
of slowing down and taking a turn.
Well over a hundred miles an hour.

411
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,130
This sitting there on a fucking
pushing buttons, you know,

412
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,590
like texting while driving
fucking doing this shit.

413
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,690
So earlier in the year
they had one, uh, you know,

414
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,890
Hamilton tried to pass him on the
inside and then Nico was defending his

415
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:41,450
position or whatever the fuck he said.
He came over, he put Lewis on the fucking

416
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,160
grass, he spun out, he clipped
the back end Nico's car,

417
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:50,600
they slammed into each other and uh, they
both got the old, the old right there,

418
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:53,150
Fred the DNC, right. Did
not complete the race,

419
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,850
which caused a Mercedes a
bunch of fucking points.

420
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,120
So evidently they probably sat them
down and was like, Hey, fuck heads,

421
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:00,720
you're on the same team here.
What?

422
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:04,040
Say you don't knock each other
out of the race. So whatever.

423
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:09,041
They got this whole rivalry going and it
seems like Nico thinks he's the fucking

424
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:13,370
guy. And Louis is this like, well, I know,
you know, I respect that you're the guy,

425
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,620
but I'm trying to be the guy too,
so go fuck yourself.

426
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:20,420
So yesterday they're
fucking racing and uh,

427
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,420
uh, you know, I don't
know much about the sport,

428
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:27,950
but evidently there's soft tires and
if the soft tires aren't soft enough,

429
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,540
they got super soft tires.

430
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,560
And I guess the softer your tires are
depending on the weather condition,

431
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,060
the faster your car goes.

432
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,560
So whatever fucking reason they give
Nico the super soft ones and they give

433
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:44,490
Lewis just to soft ones so they're fucking
them over with each lap. All right.

434
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,410
So Nico's obviously the golden child
that the corporate guys like and Louis is

435
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:53,130
the fucking upstart, right?
He's the Tom Cruise. Okay.

436
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:56,880
The other guys to fucking established
Kahn who's winning. Right.

437
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,620
I'm just guessing all of this
shit. So, um, I dunno it,

438
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,650
something about the pitstop
Lewis was slower than Nico's.

439
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,820
They gave all the fucking, its advantage
to Nico Cause Nico's went in the points.

440
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,490
I think that they want him to win the
fucking race cause they want to win the

441
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,920
championship and Louis
wasn't fucking having it.

442
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,210
So he's driving like a fucking maniac
on soft tires when Nico's got this super

443
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:21,420
soft and next thing you know
he's right on his fucking ass.

444
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,330
It's the last lap of the fucking race

445
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,590
and Louis goes to pass him
on the outside of the turn,

446
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:33,270
taking the long way around. He's on,
he's fucking ties or on the white line,

447
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:36,040
he can't get over any father
if he's going to pass.

448
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,550
If you see he's going to
overtake them on the final lap,

449
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,530
the fucking announcers are going nuts. It
fucking, Nico just drove right into him.

450
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,170
He said he had a breaking
problem. It's like, Oh yeah,

451
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,510
did you have a staring problem to you?

452
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:51,540
Fucking drove right into him
and it's like, oh my God,

453
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,550
they're going to knock each
other out of the race again.

454
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,040
And they get out of it and then they
came back together and then fucking I,

455
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:02,520
I think the back of Hamilton's car clipped
the front of a Rosberg's and took us

456
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,230
little fin fin things off the front.

457
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,510
So now he can't drive fast and when your
car's damaged like that and you'll blow

458
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,740
and debris all over the track.
I didn't realize this.

459
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,610
Evidently you're supposed to pull over.
He supposed to hit the old rest area.

460
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,271
Just be like,
well,

461
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:18,540
I guess we're going to call it a day
because all that shit that you're putting

462
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,330
in the track and blow out
somebody's tire caused him to crash.

463
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,880
They could get injured and they're
not going to fucking finish.

464
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,060
And it's not their fault that you
fucking drove into your teammate.

465
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,150
But this con keeps driving his car,

466
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,470
shrapnel all over the track. And
he finished, he got penalized.

467
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,020
Long story short was Lewis Hamilton and
then went in the fucking race and uh,

468
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,490
they were cutting to the,
uh,

469
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,560
whatever the owners of the Mercedes
team and they're all fucking pissed.

470
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,650
And uh, one of the guys on the Mercedes
teams is the guy that, you know,

471
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
went for that movie rush.
I should really have the guy's name here.

472
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,980
I'm new to this sport,
so forgive me for not knowing his name.

473
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,880
The Guy who had that horrific crash on
the Ferrari team in 1976 and he had the

474
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:03,960
fire, they showed it in a, that movie
rush. She was absolutely terrifying.

475
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,250
And what's more terrifying, they'd
being alive on fire, you know?

476
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,133
Okay.

477
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:15,470
What would you rather be alive on fire
or in the ocean watching a great white

478
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,820
shark approaching. Yeah. No, no one.

479
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:21,620
It's going to fucking take you leg off.
I mean,

480
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,220
I actually think you got
to go with the shark.

481
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Just fucking bite my leg off.
Does a major artery right there.

482
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,680
I'm going to fucking be like,
ha.

483
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,240
And then the dopamine is going to come
out and I'm having that goofy smile on my

484
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,720
face is the hammer head comes
into, finish me off. Right?

485
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,420
So anyways, they would to me afterwards,
Nico said that he had a break in problem.

486
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,490
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

487
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,730
So now there's all these conspiracy
theorists out there going like, well,

488
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,050
you know, it's the German team.
Nico's a German. All right,

489
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,270
fucking Hamilton's,
uh,

490
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,970
you know,

491
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,920
from England and he doesn't look like
you're fucking English guy being made.

492
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:08,460
And he's not a white dude. Maybe there's
some racism going on there. I don't know,

493
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:12,430
but I just became a hit Lewis
Hamilton fan. I still like Ross spark,

494
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,960
you know he's racing, he's out there,
you know, you can't fucking handle it.

495
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,681
He's one of those,

496
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,180
he seems like one of those guys you ever
to go out and you play like pickup who

497
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:23,220
per pick up hockey and it's just some
fucking nice guy and all of a sudden the

498
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,620
game starts and they get that
fucking look in their face.

499
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:30,090
Like they'll blow out a knee just to
score a goal. You know those lunatics,

500
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,310
you just sitting there going like,
all right,

501
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:37,630
I'm going to fucking steer clear slash
try to annoy the shit out of this person.

502
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,720
Going to try to make sure this guy
doesn't fall on my fucking leg. You know,

503
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,730
I had a buddy of mine, right? Fucking
nicest guy ever. He's a psychiatrist.

504
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,600
He works with troubled inner city youth
who just gone through all kinds of

505
00:30:55,601 --> 00:31:00,280
fucking horrific shit. He has the
patience to sit there, you know,

506
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,510
and work with these kids that are acting
out because of all this horrible stuff

507
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,160
that's happened to them in their home
life and he sits there and he handles it

508
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:13,990
and he loves it. You fucking get that guy
out on the ice. He's a fucking lunatic.

509
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,380
One time I took the,
we mean the other guy,

510
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,990
we'd fucking taking the
puck away from him and he,

511
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:24,520
I heard his breathing change and he just
fucking brought his stick up and I'm

512
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:27,910
telling you about, this is why I
wear the full birdcage, right dude,

513
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,780
45 degree angle across my whole face.
It just Bam.

514
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:35,560
It hit my fucking cage and I looked
at it. I was just like, dude,

515
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,340
what the fuck up for whatever dumb reason,
I was one of those people,

516
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:43,180
you know that comes out, please
pick up hockey only wearing a visor.

517
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,330
Those guys alluded six,
especially when,

518
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,410
because there's always the person
out there that can't skate,

519
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,990
which is usually me,
and you start doing that run in place.

520
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,250
I'm going to fall forward. I'm going to
fall back. I'm going to fall forward.

521
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:55,000
And you've got like the stick in
your hand that's coming up and taking

522
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:59,960
somebody's teeth out. So, um,
oh my God, what a lunar, I mean,

523
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:04,170
I literally would have needed like fucking
plastic surgery that was kicking off

524
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,570
fucking face like mine. You just ride it
out. Oh, there's this name right there.

525
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,930
I got it right there and I'm sorry. Uh,
Nikki, I'm going to say it wrong. Lau Da.

526
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,900
I don't know how to say Lotta I sweat.
So he was,

527
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,160
they talked to him and I'm looking at
this guy looking like the old race and guy

528
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:24,040
like one of his ears. It's like, you
know, mostly burned off and shit.

529
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,710
He's got the scars on the side of
his face. I gotta be honest with you.

530
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,100
He looked pretty fucking bad ass,
you know what I mean?

531
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,220
And another guy named, I swear
to God, Toto Wolff total,

532
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,040
like the band I went up.
That's on the CDS.

533
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,940
[inaudible] in a way. It could
be in the moment. It is the,

534
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,430
um, all right, let's do a
couple of reads here. Oh, Jesus.

535
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:54,230
It was 32 fucking minutes.
It just running my Yap or simple faith.

536
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,840
We have somebody new here.
Everybody's simple faith.

537
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,730
Thousands of people seeking home security
get ripped off every day at the home

538
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,490
security industry and,

539
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:07,790
and the home security industry wants
you to believe it's your only option.

540
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,163
They got hold

541
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,680
of salesmen out there trying to scare
you into signing one of their longterm

542
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,523
contracts.

543
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,840
You get stuck writing huge checks
month after month with capital letters.

544
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,250
No way out.

545
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,750
Okay?

546
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,690
It's robbery by contract and
it can cost you thousands,

547
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,690
but there's a better way to
protect your home. Simple faith,

548
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,060
home security.
Wait,

549
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,710
what the fuck are they talking about
with these contracts at home security as

550
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:35,700
you didn't want you to believe,

551
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,830
okay?

552
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,600
It's your only option.
What do they do?

553
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,920
They sign you a contract to do
what? Simple. Safe has no contracts.

554
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:50,200
None. You'll get award winning 24 seven
protection named best in the industry.

555
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,960
Oh, I see. Security
professionals watching,

556
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,470
ready to instantly send the
police and it's just fun.

557
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,990
They're not going to
go in and do something.

558
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,040
Jesus fucking Christ. I could do that.
There's gotta be another re Oh, I know.

559
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:12,780
They sit in the van. All right. My fault.
Sorry. Simple faith. Um, I just simple,

560
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,790
safe. I thought they were going
to tell you to have a home safe.

561
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,970
It's just 1499 per month.

562
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,990
That's less than half of what most

supplies,
a supplier's family run farms,

575
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,660
fisheries and ranches,
whether it's Japanese ramen noodles,

576
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,290
wild caught Alaskan salmon
or heirloom tomatoes.

577
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,430
Blue Apron is bringing you the best. None
of that shit existed when I was a kid.

578
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,410
It's all because of the food network.

579
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,980
Like the level of options you now have
as a person to eat. You know what I mean?

580
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:30,780
It was fucking chipped beef on toast,
chicken noodle soup. Tuna casserole.

581
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,050
Yeah,

582
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,270
right. Cube steaks. These fucking
kids today, this is what they can eat.

583
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,830
These are kids in their struggling.

584
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,660
They can actually have so great blue
apron is you go from that horse shit to

585
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:46,560
Japanese ramen noodles,
wild caught Alaskan Salmon,

586
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,850
heirloom tomatoes.

587
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:52,620
There was one kid for less
than 10 bucks per meal.

588
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,940

you can cook her some meals.

596
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,620
If she fucking leaves you,
you can go right back to fucking eaten.

597
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,970
What the fuck did we used to have
steak ups? Oh, I'd love to stay calm.

598
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,120
I swear to God the last nine
periods of my school day,

599
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,880
I would be sitting there thinking about
the steak am I was going to make when I

600
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:37,260
got home.
Right?

601
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,860
Fry it up in the pan like someone in
those horse with the high heels and the

602
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:44,850
lipstick, right? And then you'd put it
on the white bread and watch the grease.

603
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:49,830
Turning to Greg, a little bit of ketchup
and some cheese, fucking phenomenal.

604
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,670
But anyways, back to blue apron.

611
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,460
What do we got left here? We've got two
more left. Let's break it up. Okay, let's,

612
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:27,750
let's give you a break from my reading
out loud or my attempt at reading.

613
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,760
Uh, we'll go back to the fucking
podcast here. Uh, where did I go?

614
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,990
Where did I go? Where the fuck is the,
uh, the shit up? But uh, did it ed.

615
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:43,350
Um, all right. So should we get into the
reeds here for this week? Why don't we,

616
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,480
all right. Governor Gary
Jackson. Gary Johnson, sorry.

617
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,410
Governor Gary Johnson.
Hey Billy Shatner.

618
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,810
Billy fucking shit.
I'm not a libertarian.

619
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,190
I never said you were. I had never
been affiliated with any party.

620
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,630
I voted both parties and
for elections I voted in.

621
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,110
I've been eligible for six.
You sound like a blogger.

622
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,450
When you're going to criticize
a comedian going like,

623
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:17,210
I have a great sense of humor.
You know, I find this funny, I've,

624
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,480
I love this and blah, blah, blah. But
when I saw last night in a comedy club,

625
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,370
all right, so this guy has established
himself that he's open minded. All right?

626
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,260
Because he says,

627
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:32,850
so I'm not into the fringe candidates
and I don't buy into conspiracies.

628
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,720
I guess what I'm saying is I'm
not the typical Gary Johnson Fan.

629
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,090
Now what? Because you say so. I
guess what I'm saying is, well,

630
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:46,060
why don't you figure out what the fuck
you saying so you don't have to write x

631
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:49,840
to words in a sentence. Giving me more
opportunity to trip myself up, please.

632
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,120
All right. However, I am a fan of his,

633
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,480
and I think he could actually win
if he got on the, on the debates.

634
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,060
He's basically Bernie who I supported
for the most part. They just,

635
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,030
but I'm not a libertarian. Well, he
was a Democrat, right? Well, he was,

636
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:06,820
and then he became a libertarian, then
became a democrat. Is that how it worked?

637
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,370
I don't know.
I love Bernie Sanders.

638
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,873
Whoa.

639
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,330
Loved it. They align on 80% of
the issues. His running mate,

640
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:21,000
his former Massachusetts Governor,
Bill Weld,

641
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:26,190
Bill weld still in the game like
fucking Gordie Howe rested piece. Uh,

642
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:30,300
wondering what your thoughts on Gary
Johnson and also bill weld having lived in

643
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,750
the state, uh, when he was in office.

644
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,480
Below is a short campaign video
of the two of them. Well, I,

645
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,240
well what the fuck? I don't, I don't
know. I thought you were going to be,

646
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:45,300
tell me about them. I guess I was
supposed to watch this before.

647
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,390
Okay.

648
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,530
You Dude, you just gave
me homework. All right,

649
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:54,640
let's put this fucking thing in here
and we're going to try and watch it.

650
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,850
Oh Shit.
I'm running for Paris in it.

651
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,650
I'm running.
I'm running with them.

652
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,300
Jazzy music.
As the governor of New Mexico,

653
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:12,120
I vetoed wasteful spending 750 times,

654
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:15,840
cut taxes 14 times and left the snow.
Why is he so breathy

655
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,520
and $1 billion surplus
without raising taxes?

656
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,330
Massachusetts. How would I know
that? You just said that you did it.

657
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:30,010
Now how do I fuck? Can't fact check
all of that? I don't know. I mean,

658
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,070
it's exciting. We're going to
move the country forward. Music,

659
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,600
but a deep [inaudible].
Hi. Hi. I'm Jerry Johnson.

660
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,280
Um, I'm sure he's a great guy.
I'll look into it. I mean,

661
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:45,490
I like that you're giving me other options
because there's no fucking way I can

662
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:50,140
vote for Trump or for
Hillary, you know? Oh,

663
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:52,070
we all know the old bag's going to win it.

664
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,310
She's going to show up lipstick on her
teeth and that fucking maniacal wide eyed

665
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,230
fucking smile as she does.

666
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,580
Ah, she's going to carve this country
up even more. They are fucking evil.

667
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,990
I swear to God,

668
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,800
if Trump wasn't such a fucking dope,

669
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,730
if he wasn't such a dope, I actually
think he would be the lesser of two evils.

670
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,710
But I have to be honest with you,

671
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,600
there's no way to listen to Donald Trump
and not think about Martin Sheen in the

672
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:27,434
dead zone.

673
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,360
Can Somebody please Photoshop Trump
holding up the baby, you know,

674
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:39,640
and fucking what's his face?
Um,

675
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,010
Oh, Jesus Christ went walking up in the
balcony there or the dead fucking earth.

676
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,730
The birds are away, gentlemen.
Um, I have no idea, sir. I,

677
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,580
I commend you for,
uh,

678
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,470
being smart enough to not vote for
Trump or for Hillary. It's a, uh,

679
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,600
it's a really low point and
I wasn't a big Obama Fan,

680
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:07,520
but at least Obama, at least,
you know, the guy could speak
intelligently, you know,

681
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,500
after fucking eight years of
George Bush when that guy was,

682
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,520
that guy was like the presidential
version of me reading out loud.

683
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,700
All right.
Oh God.

684
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,910
There has to be so many other fucking
women out there that would meet,

685
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,030
make such great, honest
presidents. Do we really have?

686
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,290
Why does it have to be the one
with 52 pending felony counts?

687
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,900
All those Clinton's are
filter. Oh, Hillary Clinton,

688
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:41,660
she's dirtier than our husbands
Dick. Ah, right. Here we go.

689
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:44,140
Facial hair and little lady.

690
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,030
Hi, what's going on? I
forgot to do two weeks.

691
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:53,620
I'm actually in my garage
right now. All right. Score

692
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,890
score. Mickey. I dog.

693
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,770
Amazing. And yet, all right. Score.

694
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,680
You're paying too much for tickets
between all the mock ups and last minute

695
00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:10,630
convenience judges, even friends at home
fees. What are you fucking kidding me?

696
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,410
You ended up paying courtside
prices for nosebleed seats.

697
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,150
Score big is here to change that.

698
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,930
Did you know that 40% of all
live event tickets go unsold?

699
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,930
And did you know that there's a place
to get these seats? A huge savings.

700
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:27,160
It's called score big scored big works
directly with your favorite teams and ad

701
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:32,010
is to get their unsold seats at
unpublished prices only with ScoreBig.

702
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,980
Can you name a ticket price
and be guaranteed to pay
below box office up to 60%

703
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,890

she'll stop yard. Oh yeah,

can do one on the 4th of July.

726
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,550
All right, me undies, whether
you're wearing a suit or sweats,

727
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:07,200
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your
underwear unless you're a fucking animal.

728
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,470
But instead of making a statement like
Superman's pike under his everyday

729
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:13,080
clothes you're on the
way is probably boring.

730
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,970

me on these, but once you try them on,

734

a deer,
big belly that Billy,

746
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,800
I'm a 17 year old guy who will be
starting college in the fall in the great

747
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,670
state of Massachusetts. Um,
Jesus starting at seven,

748
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,810
you must be turning 18 later on in the
year. Um, I'm always jealous of that.

749
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:22,160
I started,
I started college when I was 19.

750
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:26,710
I was already 19 and then I fucked up
my first four years and I was like a 23

751
00:46:26,711 --> 00:46:29,290
year old sophomore, uh, my high schools.

752
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,430
Yeah.

753
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:35,430
A dress code allows guys to grow facial
hair and the last semester of senior

754
00:46:36,101 --> 00:46:41,030
year, what, what foot
fucking school you going to?

755
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,130
So a few months ago I said, what
the hell? I'll give it a try.

756
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:47,920
Okay.

757
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,150
But you're only 17.

758
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,370
The last semester of your senior year,

759
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,160
you're getting giving yourself a hell of
a lot of time to grow. This shit said,

760
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,800
I ended up growing up growing a nice dark
full beard that seems to suit me well.

761
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,100
I got a lot of compliments for it.
Mostly from other guys,

762
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:07,140
but some from the ladies.

763
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,740
I remain single as I have
always been during this time.

764
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,090
I still have the beard now,

765
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,510
but I don't know whether I should keep
the beard or ditch it and arrive at

766
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:16,680
college.
Clean Shaven.

767
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,150
Do you think it's a good or bad idea to
make my first impression while sporting

768
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,370
a beer in terms of the ladies,

769
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,550
is the beard assign of manliness
and strength or more of a turnoff?

770
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,670
I don't fucking, I got to ask Nia. Hang
on a second. Jesus Christ. How that,

771
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,440
why the fuck would I know?
You know, I always thought
Dan Fouts was sexy. Hang on.

772
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,310
All right. You happy she was sleeping? I
just, I didn't know if she was sleeping.

773
00:47:43,311 --> 00:47:47,090
I was fucking, I've never happened
there. All right, well there you go.

774
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:51,400
So you fucked the whole thing up and
cleaned up and then I woke her up. Um,

775
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,020
anyway, I do it. I don't fucking know.
But you're saying that you're not,

776
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:58,940
you're not allowed to have facial
hairs at this fucking school. You Go.

777
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:03,710
Was that like a type Typo or something?
My, all, my high school's not college.

778
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:09,670
My high school's dress code allows guys
to grow facial hair in the last semester

779
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:14,870
of senior year. Oh, okay. I thought
it was a scene at college. Um,

780
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,080
we'll look to when I was a kid,

781
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:21,740
the only reason to grow a beard was so
you could buy booze or get served when

782
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:24,890
you were still under rage. You
know, whether women like it or not,

783
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:27,590
I have no fucking idea.
Um,

784
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,813
okay.

785
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:30,810
I don't,
I don't know.

786
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:31,840
Yeah,

787
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,080
go there fucking clean shaven
and then, uh, you know,

788
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,920
get a little scruff going.
Assumption. I don't know this,

789
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:41,710
this is like a cosmo question.
I have no fucking, do they,

790
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:46,000
is it a sign of manliness?
I have no idea. I mean,

791
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,020
if you grow it too quickly,

792
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:50,200
it might be a sign of a hairy back and
that might take you out of the game.

793
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,360
Some women might be like,
Oh,

794
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,340
my dad had a beard in the subconsciously
that gets into them, you know? Oh yeah.

795
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,290
That reminds me of feeling safe with
my dad. And next thing you know,

796
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,650
they're blowing. Yeah. Then they're like,
what the fuck? That just what happened?

797
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,230
Right.
I don't know.

798
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,210
Let's move on to the next question. That
was a hard one. I had no fucking idea.

799
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:14,870
All right. Cheating Bitch,
girlfriend out g is there.

800
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,940
Hey you red face.
Fuck.

801
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:27,040
I Dunno why I find that
shit's so endearing. Um,

802
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,520
showed you what the fuck's wrong with me.
All right.

803
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:31,970
About a month ago I
started dating this lady.

804
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:37,220
She seemed really quiet in pretty
innocent. After about a week I realized,

805
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:42,030
I just pictured that woman in that Vince
Vaughn movie, the a wedding crashers. Um,

806
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,440
whoever that actress was fucking
hilarious and that will be. Anyways,

807
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:49,910
after about a week I realized that
her last boyfriend was a total freak,

808
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,100
like Jean shorts and shit.

809
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:00,720
Fuck you mean freak like a Weirdo.
What was fucking, you know,

810
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,450
having threesomes with this chick
anyways, like Jean shorts and shit. Fuck.

811
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,980
So I did my best to just ignore that and
have fun together. I was, in my opinion,

812
00:50:10,981 --> 00:50:12,150
a great boyfriend to her.

813
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,990
I took her on a lot of dates and it
seemed like everything was perfect.

814
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,710
And this was my first girlfriend.
I'm only 16 and pretty introverted.

815
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,370
So having a girlfriend was a big step for
me. Yeah, that's huge. Good fuel, man.

816
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:28,040
Anyways, after a few weeks, she
started acting weird. One day at lunch,

817
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:32,630
she told me that her old weird boyfriend
and her had sex before school that day

818
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,100
and they also had sex a couple of
other times while we were going out.

819
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,190
I didn't know what to say
and it really fucked me up.

820
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,540
She even said it wasn't her fault and
I shouldn't be mad. Oh, you know what?

821
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:49,541
I was actually going to give this girl
props for being mature enough to own up

822
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,870
to what the fuck she did.

823
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,180
And then she said that don't be mad at me.
Um,

824
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,150
after a fight,
I told her to fuck.

825
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,080
I told her to fuck and left. I think
fuck off. That's what you meant,

826
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,330
because she's already fucking,
dude. You don't need to tell her.

827
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,710
You should have told him to to less
fuck two x ne on the [inaudible].

828
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,490
Um, she then started saying
that it was my fault.

829
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,200
I don't know what I did wrong. Oh, you
poor bastard and you're only 16 years old,

830
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,500
right? So you didn't, you didn't
have your deflector shields up.

831
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:29,130
Is that what it is? Did you say you were
16 right? The fuck was that? I'm only 16.

832
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:33,630
Okay. So now everyone knows that
school because high school is bullshit.

833
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:38,100
Um, I know I, I'm now known by everyone,

834
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:41,460
including my family as the guy
who got cheated on this pitch.

835
00:51:41,461 --> 00:51:42,990
Not only made me feel like shit,

836
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:46,290
but also kind of ruined the whole
aspect of finding a nice girl.

837
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,640
I don't trust them and feel as
if I will never move on. Yeah.

838
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:55,050
These are the catastrophic thoughts
you have when you're 60, uh,

839
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,830
because your world is small. You still
living at home with your parents.

840
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:01,770
You go to school,
you see the same fucking cunts every day,

841
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,110
and you feel like the
walls are closing in.

842
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,950
All of these feelings are
100% normal. Um, how do you,

843
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,650
how do you move on after
being fucked over like that?

844
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,520
The only things I've done is got
a job and started lifting weights.

845
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,010
Maybe then when school starts again,

846
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:21,660
I can show up shredded and do better
next year. There you go. I like it.

847
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:26,520
Turn a negative into a positive. Um,
here's the thing. You're a nice guy,

848
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:30,090
right? You're a nice
guy. Uh, well, you know,

849
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:35,070
so that means there's the Nice woman
out there that balances you out,

850
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:38,010
right? If you're a dick, there's
plenty of clients out there,

851
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:41,720
but you're a nice guy. So
what I would do is, uh,

852
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:48,300
I would thank my lucky stars that that
fucking woman is out of your life.

853
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,770
You know, she's totally
fucked up. All right.

854
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:56,160
She's going to go back to the Jean Short
guy and they're going to fuck before

855
00:52:56,161 --> 00:53:00,250
school and they're going to do
all of this other shit. And, um,

856
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,050
who gives a fuck? I don't
understand how, like,

857
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,910
I don't know how, there's no reason
for you just me listening to this,

858
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,400
why you should feel bad about yourself.
I get, you know, I got cheated on,

859
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:19,550
you know,
it's happened to everybody and uh,

860
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,780
it makes you just more feel stupid
is what it is. You know what I mean?

861
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:29,170
So I'm trying to count the amount
of times that's happening to me.

862
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,730
The first girl I was with was
like fucking way older than me.

863
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,270
I went from like zero to 90
miles an hour in fucking,

864
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:45,670
yeah. She ended up cheating on me and
breaking up a fucking marriage. And,

865
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,700
uh, I did, I, oh,

866
00:53:49,701 --> 00:53:51,380
I remember how I didn't even know.

867
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,410
I ended up running into the wife of the
guy that she cheated with and then they

868
00:53:58,731 --> 00:54:02,090
were broken up and she told me,
and

869
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,740
I just, my judgment, my thought
was I just went like, Huh.

870
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,970
You know?
And there was a lot in that

871
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,790
because it just let me
know that, uh, you know,

872
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,580
I just thought guys did shit like that,
you know,

873
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:23,370
I thought we would just the fucking
animals. And it was just like, wow.

874
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,300
So she was doing that and then
come home and smile. Yeah.

875
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:29,460
And that fucked me up for
a long fucking time. Yeah.

876
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:33,630
You know what an I didn't trust women,
you know, and I started lifting weights.

877
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:38,250
Did I write this thing 20 years ago?
What the fuck now? Um, yeah dude,

878
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,080
this is the deal. You know, it's
going to take time to get over it,

879
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,690
but you know you're going to meet
somebody nice. And I think, yeah,

880
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,870
you're in the prime of your life.
You throw the weights around a little bit,

881
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,360
you show up fucking shredded,
right?

882
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:49,910
Yeah.

883
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:50,611
And then you show you,

884
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:53,270
I show up in September and just
start chatting up the women.

885
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,520
And this is the thing too. Women
love a fucking, they love a project,

886
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:03,350
you know, so you can use the fact that
this woman cheated on you, that Oh,

887
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:07,390
you know, I have problems,
trust and fucking women and
now they'll just, they'll,

888
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:11,930
they'll be coming at Ya. He beat them
off with a fucking stick. All right.

889
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,760
Yeah Dude. Fuck that. This is the
thing. You don't have a letter.

890
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,020
Anytime anything bad happens in life,
you don't have it. You don't let it,

891
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,080
you know, there's two things you
can do. You can either just fucking,

892
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,070
I don't know. I, I, I view like that
those types of thoughts. Like, you know,

893
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,340
when you watch like bugs bunny and
they would have like that, wait,

894
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:34,600
that just said one ton on it. I view
like that. That's what that thought is.

895
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,040
All right. And you're standing
next to a fucking pool.

896
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:40,241
All right?

897
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:43,870
And the thing's got a chain around it
and either just fucking let it go to the

898
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,280
bottom of the pool itself.

899
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,820
Or you stick your head in the chain and
wrap it around your neck and you let it

900
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:53,200
take it down. And then you just down
there in the bottom of the pool. You know,

901
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:59,120
why would you do that? Fuck
it. Fuck you. Fuck her.

902
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,370
Just let that whole thing,
I'm not saying don't deal with it,

903
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:04,710
but you got to turn it into a positive,

904
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:09,120
which is what you seem to be doing fucking
workout and chat up a bunch of women.

905
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:11,280
This is think maybe, uh, you know,

906
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,610
start your list of fucking requirements.
You test,

907
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:20,390
you lock the door test to maybe to
try to get a good one. Uh, you know,

908
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,370
women always say, find a good finding
a good, a good man's hard to find.

909
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,570
Soza good woman.

910
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:30,571
So what this woman did is a help
you start early on a checklist,

911
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,860
because I didn't start a checklist
for a long fucking time, you know,

912
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,430
I was well into my thirties and I was
still just like, hey, you want to fuck

913
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,190
every thought, every thing
you do, everything on my list
is checked off, you know?

914
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,670
All right, here we go. All time
underrated quarterbacks. You'll be fine.

915
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,570
You'll be fine. Shake it off. It's
fucking your fault. That's Atlanta.

916
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,950
That poor woman, she's got a lot of issues
and a bit, she's has a terrible father,

917
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,610
you know? So in a way you can look
at it like that because you know,

918
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,270
she is young and immature, but if she
continues to live her life that way,

919
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:08,530
that is, that is a bad fucking
road to go on. You know,

920
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,700
that's fucking white symphony.
Dale's of the red wine,

921
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:16,270
gray teeth with the fucking and tramp
stamp. She's going to go down that one

922
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,870
and the piece of shit,
guys,

923
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,260
she's going to meet Jean shorts
will be the least of our problems.

924
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:25,810
I hope that doesn't happen to her
either. But, uh, anyways, here we go.

925
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,770
All time underrated.
Qbs dear Billy White shoes.

926
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,920
Very nice reference.
Billy White shoes,

927
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:37,900
Johns of the Houston Oilers and
the Atlanta Falcons. Alright,

928
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,920
bye friends.

929
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:43,420
Tear me apart from being a
huge Vinny Testaverde fan.

930
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:49,180
I truly love the man and feely flies under
the radar as an all time quarterback.

931
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,190
Maybe not hall of fame caliber,

932
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,090
but someone who could have won a super
bowl if he didn't have to face Elway.

933
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:58,990
Tarell Davis in the 1998
Denver Bronco Machine.

934
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,750
Well,
you realize what you're saying,

935
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:04,840
that he could have been a championship
if he didn't have to play the best team

936
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:08,560
in the league. Well, I
mean, yeah, well shit.

937
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,780
San Diego Padres could be
a fucking dynasty if it
wasn't for all the other fee.

938
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,520
The fucking 1998 Yankees
or the late nineties Yankees.

939
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,440
Right? I don't know. Anyways,

940
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,960
he played 22 seasons and in his final
season with season with the Carolina

941
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,530
Panthers,

942
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:30,880
he won his first game after only being
on the team for three fucking days at the

943
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:33,490
age of 43.
He was definitely a bad ass.

944
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:38,320
Nobody could be in that backyard playing
horseshoes with this son and then out

945
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:42,700
of football in two days later be under
under center and fucking winning a game.

946
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,810
Like he did that like I think three times
in his career. He was sort of like a,

947
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,620
maybe it just happened once.
I Dunno,

948
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,250
but I just feel like he was officially
retired at least once, if not twice.

949
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,770
And he was in the back yard
eating a fucking Burger,

950
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:56,980
having a course light and all of a sudden,
Hey Bernie,

951
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,060
this is the fucking whatever
Seattle Seahawks calling or Tampa.

952
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:04,930
But where did he play
Tampa. The jets. Carolina.

953
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,110
That's a great one. Cleveland.
And he played with Cleveland.

954
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,510
It was at Bernie Coza again, I get
confused my older age. Let's look up.

955
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:17,080
Oh Vinny Testaverde Vinay.
Then he had the fucking veal.

956
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,190
All right, you guys want
to hear a great, uh,

957
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,910
you guys wanna hear a
great fucking La Story.

958
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,730
I went out to an Italian
restaurant the other day, right?

959
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:31,020
And we sitting up front near the bar and
it was too loud and one of the guys I

960
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:32,580
was eating with us,
cause this is too fucking loud,

961
00:59:32,581 --> 00:59:33,840
let's try to get a table in the back.

962
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:38,520
So they end up hooking us up with a table
in the back and as I'm going to walk,

963
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,800
you know to the back, one of the
guys there up to bar, he goes, yeah,

964
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:44,561
go in the back.
You know,

965
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:47,910
you can barely hear yourself
thinking just the way he said it.

966
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:51,130
I can't remember what he said.
He said something along those lines.

967
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,330
Super Italian guy and the way he said
it and the fact that I was moving as I

968
00:59:55,331 --> 00:59:56,164
went past him,

969
00:59:56,350 --> 01:00:00,250
I felt like I was in that tracking scene
in Goodfellas when they were showing

970
01:00:00,251 --> 01:00:03,550
all those characters, you know, get
the papers, get the papers, a guy,

971
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,200
it guy took care of that thing,
right?

972
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,070
Literally it gave me like
a shock the way he said it.

973
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,730
So I said to one of the guys that we
were, I was having dinner with. I said,

974
01:00:12,731 --> 01:00:15,610
Hey Michael, Jesus Christ.
Go. That guy just made me
feel like I was in Goodfellas.

975
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:21,210
Classic La Story and why it's
so amazing to live out here.

976
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,130
He goes, do you know who that
is? And I said, no. He goes,

977
01:00:24,131 --> 01:00:26,110
that's the guy who
played Johnny roast beef

978
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,700
and then I fucking looked at him
again. I was like, oh my God,

979
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,593
it's Johnny Roast beef.

980
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:37,030
One of the greatest pieces fucking acting
I've ever seen is when he's trying to

981
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:41,950
explain a way that pink Cadillac and he
starts to stop and then then he starts

982
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:44,630
to talk and then he
stops and actually had,

983
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:49,330
I talked to him about it for a second
and he just laughed. He said, one said,

984
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:53,980
basically said, when a man is scary
as Jimmy, the gent is yelling at you.

985
01:00:53,981 --> 01:00:57,250
He goes, you don't say a fucking
word. Remember that? No, it, it's,

986
01:00:57,251 --> 01:01:01,540
it's in my grandmother's name. What's
the matter with me? It's a matter of me.

987
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,720
You're going to get us all fucking pinch.
That's why some matter with you,

988
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,780
what's the matter with you?
Take it back,

989
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:12,120
take it back at the fuck that look
on his fucking face and he goes to,

990
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,080
he just keeps going. I'm sorry. I,

991
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,553
yeah,

992
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:21,100
I'm sorry.
What did I tell you?

993
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:25,750
What the fuck? What did I tell? I
fucking love that seat. So anyways,

994
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,620
um, Vinny Testaverde, here we go.

995
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,520
Be any folk in test of early Ovi.
Um,

996
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,400
here we go. Vinny Testaverde. Let's
see. It was him with the panthers.

997
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:44,320
He's 52 years old. I swear to God. I bet
he's still in shape. And if you fucking,

998
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,010
if you, you know, if you call
them up right now, if you
called them up right now,

999
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:52,040
he could give you a decent audit.
What the fuck?

1000
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,220
87 to 92 we played for
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

1001
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:04,120
93 to 95 he played for the
Cleveland browns 96 97,

1002
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:09,230
the Baltimore Ravens 98 to 2003,
the New York jets,

1003
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:14,720
which is how I remember him as a jet.
2000 for the Dallas cowboys.

1004
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,830
2005, he goes back to the jets.
2006, he played for my patriots.

1005
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:20,940
I don't even remember that.

1006
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,900
2007 he played for the panthers.

1007
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,510
20 year fucking career. 21
seasons. Wow. Two time pro bowler.

1008
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:35,750
96 98 Heisman trophy,
86,

1009
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:40,560
uh,
Davy O'Brien bump up a buzz Sammy Bar,

1010
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:44,870
trophy sportsman of the year,
86 let's see,

1011
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,970
tds verse,
interceptions.

1012
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:51,740
This is what fucked him
over the 275 touchdowns,

1013
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,890
267 interceptions.

1014
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:59,570
Wasn't somebody wrapped like that
in incomplete, like Testaverde. Uh,

1015
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:00,680
but he didn't say intercepted,

1016
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:05,780
but he threw for 46,233 yards
back in the day, you know,

1017
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,130
for the most part when you actually,

1018
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:11,300
they could cover receivers before Jim say
changed all the fucking rules cause he

1019
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:12,980
couldn't beat the Patriots,
but that's okay.

1020
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,670
I know the ball was underinflated
let's kick them out of football.

1021
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:21,890
Passing rating. Passive Passer Rating,
75.0 all right. Well yeah. Okay.

1022
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,980
Those are great. Fuck. You
know, do you play 20 seasons?

1023
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,840
But he did throw a lot
of pics. So anyways, um,

1024
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,210
where he's the oldest
quarterback to ever start.

1025
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:36,440
And when a pro football game
older than George Blanda.

1026
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,250
Well, I thought George Blend, maybe
he was just kicking at that point.

1027
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:44,600
Everybody always reverts back to the days,
his days in Tampa and Cleveland.

1028
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:49,400
But I'd argue that those Tampa years
where some of the worst pro squads ever to

1029
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:52,070
try it on a football onto a
football field. Yeah, absolutely.

1030
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,340
You can't blame somebody for that.
You know, it's like Joey Harrington,

1031
01:03:55,910 --> 01:04:00,890
he goes and he fucking plays
for uh, the lions, you know,

1032
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,850
odd. Right out of the gate. There's no
way as bad. He's as bad as he looked.

1033
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:06,590
Those lion teams were fucking horrible.

1034
01:04:06,591 --> 01:04:09,020
I'm not saying that the guy would
have played in the league or whatever,

1035
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:10,520
but you know,

1036
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,680
for the longest time if you got
drafted by the lions or the browns as,

1037
01:04:15,681 --> 01:04:18,440
as a quarterback,
that was a fucking death sentence,

1038
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,820
which is another brilliant
move that John Elway made.

1039
01:04:21,821 --> 01:04:24,350
Cause when he got drafted by
the Baltimore Colts, he's like,

1040
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:25,430
I'm not fucking going there,

1041
01:04:25,431 --> 01:04:28,280
getting the shit kicked out of
me and I'll be out of football.

1042
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,980
I mean that almost
happened to Troy Aikman.

1043
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,090
Okay.

1044
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,940
Troy Aikman when he got
drafted by the fucking cowboys.

1045
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,900
So got the living shit kicked out of him
his first few years. If that continued,

1046
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,180
I mean, that guy, he would
have been out of football.

1047
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,550
But fortunately the Herschel Walker trade
went down with Jimmy Johnson App boys.

1048
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,040
Right. They got that fucking, uh,

1049
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,150
all those 300 pounders in front
of them. I Dunno. Anyways,

1050
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:00,750
let's plow ahead here. Uh,
he said as a patriots fan,

1051
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:02,940
I'd like your thoughts on him.
Are My friends right?

1052
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,840
Saying he was just an average
quarterback at best? No fucking way.

1053
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,470
No way though. He was, he was w uh,

1054
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,680
well you don't play for 20
fucking years. Okay. He was,

1055
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,640
he was above way above average,
I think. I think he was a,

1056
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:24,790
he's not a, I wouldn't say he's one of
the greats, but he was definitely a, uh,

1057
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,470
he was a really good quarterback.
You know, he wasn't like, um,

1058
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,070
what does he, if he was, if
he was an average Qb at best,

1059
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,570
you don't play for 20 years,

1060
01:05:36,571 --> 01:05:40,830
be an average unless you Steve
to Berg and just some out.

1061
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:43,590
You just look so great with
a headset and a clipboard.

1062
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:48,720
People just wanted you around. He was
like the David Hasselhoff, you know,

1063
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,000
a fucking quarterbacks.
It just,

1064
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:53,670
I think you sold more tickets
because he never had his helmet on.

1065
01:05:53,671 --> 01:05:57,330
The ladies could come down and look
at them. Look up Steve to Berg here.

1066
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,380
Steve to Berg.
All right.

1067
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:07,050
Oh yeah, the David Hasselhoff.
He looks like he's looked like,

1068
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,381
you know,

1069
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,760
whenever they had those coming of age
movies and you got the nerd who wants to

1070
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,290
date the fucking cheerleader,

1071
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,580
but she's dating the guy who was
just a complete fucking Dick. Uh,

1072
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:22,400
he had those, those
level good looks, dude.

1073
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:25,550
I'm telling you right now. Look this
guy up. That's fucking hilarious.

1074
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:30,320
He looks like he saw
Baywatch played number 17 on.

1075
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,970
Now we got this, this, you know what?

1076
01:06:31,971 --> 01:06:35,720
This is actually morphed into the
degraded NFLs greatest journeyman.

1077
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,370
I'm going to look this up.

1078
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:39,000
Okay,

1079
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,400
great. Is God, I love the Internet.

1080
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:47,930
I love that somebody made a page
about this shit. Best Nfl journeymen,

1081
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,410
the seven most unkillable
journeyman quarterbacks.

1082
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,200
I love the Internet because of shit
like this and all the fucking free porn.

1083
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,750
All right, here we go. Um,

1084
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,010
there's a good chance that
at one time or another,

1085
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:08,720
your team's hopes were riding on
Ryan Fitzpatrick, Brian Hoyer,

1086
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,140
or one of the NFLs other well
traveled signal call is, Oh,

1087
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:16,280
don't be all just new guys. Come
on. All right. Ryan Fitzpatrick,

1088
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,490
Brian Fitzpatrick, a played for
the Texans, the titans, the rams,

1089
01:07:22,491 --> 01:07:26,330
the bangles, the jets,
and the bills. All right.

1090
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:31,590
Josh mccown. Uh, I've, uh, Brian Hoyer.

1091
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,140
Matt Cassel.

1092
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:34,700
Okay.

1093
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:39,680
A castle. Matt Flynn, the perennial
backups. I'll come on, man.

1094
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:44,310
Tim Tebow. Now this, this
was done by some youngster.

1095
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,600
You got to have Steve to Bergen.
Then you've got Vinny Testaverde

1096
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,310
journeymen NFL players
who just won't go away.

1097
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:00,450
Do I have to type in all time?
Is that what I have to do?

1098
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,330
I think I got to type in all
time. Come on, man. You've
got to, if, if the, if Steve,

1099
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,900
the burst not on your fucking list.

1100
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,553
Yeah.

1101
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,420
These not on your fucking list.
Journeymen quarterback. All right,

1102
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:17,570
we'll just go Wikipedia.
Oh, this is depressing. I
thought it was gonna be great.

1103
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:24,290
Jt O'sullivan played for 12
professional teams during his career.

1104
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,430
You know what? I bet in his
man cave, he should, they,

1105
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:30,860
the NFL should give them
all 12 of those helmets.

1106
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:33,050
All 12 of those fucking helmets.

1107
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,520
Why am I all wrapped up in the
fucking court here? What's going on?

1108
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:39,580
All right,
here we go.

1109
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:44,320
This is what happens when you fucking lay
down on a couch and there's why is, um,

1110
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:50,640
JT O'sullivan,
he played on no less than 11 to NFL teams.

1111
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,910
Oh, professionals. Okay. So,

1112
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:57,710
and then he also played
for the Saskatchewan rough
riders and the Frankfurt

1113
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,543
Galaxy.

1114
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:02,870
Chris Chandler holds the record for
starting a game for the highest number of

1115
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:07,400
different NFL teams with
eight. Oh, so he started, okay.

1116
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,140
There's no accepted definition
or threshold at which a
person is regarded as a

1117
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:16,490
journeyman quarterback. Um, the term
is descriptive rather than definitive.

1118
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:21,491
David Craig enjoyed 11 s stable careers
with the Seahawks before leaving.

1119
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:27,020
Let's see, Mark Rypien notable
examples. Here we go. Here we go.

1120
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:32,190
Trent Dilfer, Brad Johnson, rich Gannon.

1121
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:37,270
Where the fuck is Steve debarge
notable journeymen quarterbacks?

1122
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,390
Come on,
come on.

1123
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,330
All right. You know, I'm trying to
look up Steve debarge. I'm sorry guys.

1124
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:51,620
This whole podcast just you just listened
to me surf the fucking Internet now to

1125
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:55,560
people still say surf the internet or
was that from the 90 [inaudible] I'm old

1126
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,480
already.
He's 62 years old.

1127
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:03,740
He played for the San Francisco 40 niners
from 1977 to 1980 the Broncos from 81

1128
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:10,281
to 83 the Buccaneers from 84 to 87
the chiefs from 88 to 91 back to the

1129
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:15,060
Buccaneers.
92 93 the Miami Dolphins,

1130
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,480
1993 he was out of fucking football in
94 he was out of football in 95 out of

1131
01:10:23,161 --> 01:10:27,270
football, 96 out of football,
97 and then what the fuck?

1132
01:10:27,271 --> 01:10:31,640
1998 he's back. What? The dirty birds,

1133
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:36,110
the Atlanta Falcons who upset
the 15 and one Minnesota Vikings.

1134
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:40,220
Right.
And then went to the fucking super bowl,

1135
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:43,100
one of the most forgettable
super bowls of all fucking time.

1136
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:50,020
And the Denver Broncos repeated or
that was the last fucking game of John

1137
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,280
Elway's career. All right.
TDS, two interceptions.

1138
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:58,540
He had a 196 touchdowns
versus 204 interceptions.

1139
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:03,040
He threw for 34,000, 241 yards.
And as a higher QB rating,

1140
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:08,110
did Vinny Testaverde it's
74.2, right? Or was he 75?

1141
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:12,280
I don't fucking remember.
Steven Lee. Roy De Berg.

1142
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,850
There you go. That's, that's my, um,

1143
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,003
yeah,

1144
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,590
that's my vote.
You know,

1145
01:11:18,591 --> 01:11:22,040
it's funny like I bet he doesn't have a
lot of problems walking or anything like

1146
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:23,180
that cause he's got,

1147
01:11:23,181 --> 01:11:28,181
so he has a low miles on that odometer
as far as like actually playing in the

1148
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,290
phone.
I'm not trying to insult the guy here.

1149
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:33,140
I'm just saying like if he was a car,
you know,

1150
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,820
it'd be like those all original
miles. It'd be a, yeah. Yeah.

1151
01:11:37,821 --> 01:11:40,820
He sat in a garage with a fucking
clipboard for all those years. All right.

1152
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,270
That's the podcast for
this, uh, this 4th of July.

1153
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:49,390
I hope you guys all have a happy and a
safe one. All right. You fucking drunks.

1154
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,150
I know it's a fireworks and
it's supposed to be fun,

1155
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:56,870
but yet all day our explosives
don't be that person.

1156
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:03,400
And one of those youtube fucking videos
of like top 10 stupidest fucking moose

1157
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,350
done with fireworks.
Did you see that fucking guy?

1158
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:10,130
He actually took like a mortar
or some shit, put it on his head.

1159
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,050
I don't know if he thought
it was going to take off.

1160
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,100
He literally blew himself up. His
friends go. You don't understand.

1161
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:20,600
There was nothing left of him.
It was nothing left to help.

1162
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:25,080
You know?
They just showed up and there was,

1163
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,580
there was like a belt buckle and
like a shoelace. He was gone.

1164
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:33,970
So please don't do that to yourself.
All right. All right, clay out.

1165
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,160
Um, all right, that's the podcast.
