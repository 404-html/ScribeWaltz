1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,530
Hey, what's going on is bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,560
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,533
mmm,

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,580
check Indian on you.
And I woke up this morning,

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,580
but I do have a dual boot and a,

6
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:20,700
that stupid fucking song was in my head
and you might want to fast forward or

7
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,080
it's going to be in your head. I'll give
you three seconds. Three, two, one. Right?

8
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:29,520
I fucking wake up and this stupid ass
song. I hate this fucking coach got.

9
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:33,240
Damn it. You don't just, how do
you make a couch uncomfortable?

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,380
It's the whole fucking point is,
that's the whole fucking job of a couch.

11
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:41,740
He said it's comfortable.
It's better than standing anyway.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,990
So I wake up in the morning,

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,400
well let's the shape of a couch.

14
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,940
I thought that's all you
needed for the record.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,690
It's not my couch. All
right. It's not my house.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,430
I'm out of my fucking house.

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,240
And they, you know, you know the whole
fuck. You know the whole thing. Oh,

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,870
we're going to do this.
We're going to do that.

19
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,670
We'll be in and out in
two fucking seconds.

20
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,590
I've gone over my house like
three days and wrote a workout.

21
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,580
There's nobody there.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Oh,
the guy who at the door,

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,240
he got tied up at another job guy

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,090
I know, I know. I know. Been
down this road before. Um,

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,330
anyways,
so song that was in my fucking head.

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,810
Remember that fucking song?
Whoa. Buddha, Buddha, Davy d, uh,

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,770
something jumped in and I showed
him then to blah, blah, blah, blah,

28
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:34,600
blue, blah, blah. Blue.
We had joy, we had fun.

29
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,930
We had seasons in the sun,

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,030
but the salmon that's
been in my fucking head,

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,410
Data Dda Bada but it's such a creepy
fucking sock or still don't really know

32
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:47,980
what it's about.
Every time I hear the song,

33
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:50,980
like once every 15 years and then I
really listened to the lyrics. I'm like,

34
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:52,810
what the fuck?
You don't want me to look it up right now.

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,510
Got The guy just sings real creepy.
Like, Oh mother, dear. Why did you die?

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,460
And I'm sure he doesn't say that,
but yeah,

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,300
the fuck we had joy. We
had fun lyrics. All right,

38
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,134
here we go.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,650
Goodbye to you. My trusted
friend. I knew it was creepy.

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,710
We've known each other since
we were nine or 10 together.

41
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:18,570
We've climbed hills and trees,
learned of love and abcs.

42
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,680
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.
Okay,

43
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,600
so he's got the creepy
childhood out of the way.

44
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,580
Yeah.

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,540
Goodbye my friend.

46
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:29,010
It's hard to die when all the
birds are singing in the sky.

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,400
Now that spring is in the air.
Pretty girls are everywhere.

48
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,530
Think of me and I'll be there.

49
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,190
Would they both gay and now
they're trying to like, you know,

50
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,180
they weren't accepted.

51
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,230
Yeah.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,180
So like,
you know,

53
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,520
they're feeling the pressures to try to
live a straight life or did this person

54
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:49,800
die and if he's dead,
how the fuck is he singing this shit?

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,893
Yeah,

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,380
we had joy. We had fun. We had seasons in
the sun, but the hills that we climbed,

57
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,310
we're just seasons.

58
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,690
Hi, good pot. Goodbye
Papa. Please pray for me.

59
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,890
I was the black sheep of the family.
I was a drug user.

60
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,390
He tried to teach me right from wrong.
Too much wine and too much song. Oh yeah,

61
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,400
he's partying. I wonder how I got
along. Good bipap. It's hard to die out.

62
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,230
Jesus Christ shut the fuck you
know, at. This guy's not dying.

63
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,670
He just wants attention. You're not fuck
that song. And I'm sorry, I brought it up.

64
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,110
How are you everybody?

65
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,960
How's it going on this
Thursday afternoon? Oh, Jesus.

66
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,700
What happened last night?
Well, the, uh, the,

67
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,030
the national hockey league
started their season.

68
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,570
Not [inaudible]

69
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,080
do what? A fucking game. Austin
Matthews, Austin Matthews,

70
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,810
Austin Matthews,
one more time,

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,320
but the amount of goals he scored Austin
fucking Matthews for goals and his

72
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:57,350
debut in the NHL was so fucking cool
as his parents were in the crowd.

73
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,400
It's a mother started crying after
the hat trick. And, uh, you know,

74
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,160
no one knows who he is.
Nobody's paying attention.

75
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,110
Then all of a sudden it was just
like, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hey. Right.

76
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,290
Next thing you know,
you guys got four fucking goals.

77
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,680
So immediately after the game,
of course, they going like,

78
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:15,860
do you feel a pressure now that you're
going to have to score four goals every

79
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:20,780
game? Um, you know what it
is? It's his second goal.

80
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,920
Okay.

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,430
There was just too many moves to many
people's fucking legs. He went around,

82
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,770
it's put the puck through,
lifted the fucking stick,

83
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,260
and then there was like half an inch
between the goalie and the post.

84
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,880
He somehow found it. I mean, it
was just fucking amazing game.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,300
So I bet everybody Toronto has
to be really excited about that.

86
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:43,250
And my Boston Bruins start tonight.
See what they got. I don't even know.

87
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,200
I just know they start tonight. Boston
Bruins. Hey, we go, bro Wins. Here we go.

88
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,010
Jesus the Columbus Blue Jackets.

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,830
Why does Columbus have a team and why
did they name it the blue jackets? Well,

90
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,730
you know, it's named after the union
soldiers is civil war. Oh, is it? Is?

91
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,460
Is that what it is?
You know,

92
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,980
I believe a long time ago
you guys had a fucking team.

93
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,310
Then they had a fucking team
and the Cleveland something
or others and then they

94
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,140
fucking ice.
I know that name.

95
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:18,290
But Cleveland barons of something
and the whole fucking thing. Uh,

96
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,563
okay.

97
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,800
It like, it didn't even move
to another city. It just died.

98
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,523
Alright.

99
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,340
Cleveland Barons yet the Cleveland Barons
were professional hockey team in the

100
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,930
National Hockey League from 1976
to 1978 that's all. That's all.

101
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,370
That's all the love.
Click.

102
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:41,740
Cleveland's a big 10 fucking state and
then professional sports. All right.

103
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,840
How state's been around longer than
any of those people? All right.

104
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:48,380
There was a relocation of the California,
all the Real California golden seals.

105
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,750
That's right. Moved. Um,

106
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,580
which you played in Oakland
since 1967 then they moved.

107
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:58,540
They basically can't blame Ohio for
that. They died in California. Man.

108
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,680
Talk about it.
Out of the frying pan into the fire,

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,220
they moved from Oakland to Cleveland.

110
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,490
Had the owner of that team ever watched
hockey and kind of got it's, I mean,

111
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:14,950
I guess it is a cold weather state,
but Jesus Christ,

112
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,260
after only two s two seasons,

113
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:22,090
the team merged with the Minnesota north
stars. Now Dallas Stars. Oh, they merged.

114
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,840
I thought they just thought they just
folded as a result. The NHL field,

115
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:30,841
it only 17 stirring 17 teams during
the 78 79 season as a 2016 the barons

116
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:36,811
remained the last franchise in the four
major North American sports leagues to

117
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:37,940
cease

118
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,773
variation.

119
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,400
Ohio did not have another NHL team
until the Columbus blue jackets join the

120
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:47,660
league in the,
in the year 2000.

121
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,860
Um, so there's that,
there you go. Now. Now,

122
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,870
now you know what that's
about. Um, all right, so I am
chomping at the fucking bit.

123
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,720
Everybody. You probably wondering
why. Bill, what, what, what's,

124
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:04,280
what's different about this day
than any other day in your life? Um,

125
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,050
I'm taping my next standup special
standup special number five,

126
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:13,400
I believe. Right? Why do I do this?
Let it go. You people are all the same.

127
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I don't have a name for this one yet.

128
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,020
How about old freckles? You've done
it again. Oh, Magoo. You've done. Oh,

129
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:28,820
freckles. He have done it again. Um, yeah,

130
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:32,060
but I am a, I've been doing some
spots around town last night.

131
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,440
I have not been drinking. I've
been fucking working out, you know,

132
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,690
trying to get fucking into HD shape.
You know what I mean?

133
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,300
That's the thing about all these broads
bitching about here in Hollywood.

134
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:47,510
Hollywood creates these body images.
It happens to everybody.

135
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,280
Nobody wants to be a fat fuck on
television. Forget about this. The,

136
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:57,020
the new HD shit, we can literally see
the cartilage and somebody fucking nose.

137
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:01,340
I mean, you can't go. You can't be boozy.
You can't be anything. Everybody though.

138
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,890
What the fuck happened to you,
right?

139
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,810
You gotta go out there and shape. All
right ladies. So put your fucking whining,

140
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,400
get on the God damn treadmill
like everybody else. Um,

141
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,130
it's just hard. It's harder for
women to lose weight again. Yeah.

142
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,700
It is definitely harder for women to
lose weight with all those free fucking

143
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,534
drink she gets.

144
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,420
Okay.

145
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,930
You know, those are empty
calories. You know what I mean?

146
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,200
Think about being a manager.

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,460
You have to pay for your empty calories
and the fucking person you brought in a

148
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:37,270
lot of the times. Um, or who knows?
Maybe these new, the millennials now,

149
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,110
now that they're,
they're more progressive than I've,

150
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,200
I've just sort of left the herd now and
now I'm the old guy spouting crazy shit

151
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,900
from yesteryear.
Maybe the ladies go in now

152
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,370
and they just walk up and
they say, hey, good looking.

153
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,930
I like your stubble and your
suspenders. Uh, would you like a, what'd

154
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,620
you do? What do they call a micro brew?
What do they call it? Do they call?

155
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,150
Those fucking things does ridiculously
stupid fucking beers that all tastes the

156
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:08,070
goddamn same. They all have way
too many hops in them. You know,

157
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:12,810
they're heavy as shit. Every fucking
wonderful brewed right down the street.

158
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,400
Yeah. It tastes like it. To
do it in your bathtub. Um,

159
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,620
Mike, not micro brewery. They call those
fucking does. Not Micro Bruce. It is that,

160
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:26,220
but they got a new name for
it. Ah, you know, it's amazing.

161
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:30,210
I know this is going to surprise you,
but, but the name escapes me. So anyways,

162
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm going to be warming up for my,
uh,

163
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,620
my special starting Saturday night in
Washington DC, our nation's capitol.

164
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,660
Okay.
Um,

165
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,340
I'm just going to walk around to
anybody who's in government, right.

166
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,270
And I'm just going to scream
really in their face. That's,

167
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,520
that's my goal during the wickets,
walked down the street,

168
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,780
just saying that to everybody.

169
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,650
I'm just blaming them because my choices
are Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.

170
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,920
That's,
that's just what I'm doing.

171
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,480
Anybody with the fucking blue
blazer and a red or a blue tie,

172
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:06,610
I'm grabbing them by the shoulders.
You're not going to do that.

173
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:10,270
But I would love to do it. I
would like to do it, but you know,

174
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,730
post nine 11,

175
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,590
you can't walk around doing shit like
that and he and I don't want to get no

176
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,910
fight. I'm an old man, you know,

177
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,480
I going to tell you that time I went
down and I looked at the Pentagon like a

178
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,910
couple,
about six months after nine 11.

179
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,770
I must've told you that story. Right?
By the way, I met the national theater.

180
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:30,690
I forgot to say that.
Uh,

181
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,480
there are still tickets left cause I'm
kind of doing this weird run in this

182
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:38,530
theater that usually has
like the lion king. Um,

183
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
and I'm also doing like a Monday,
Tuesday,

184
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,580
Wednesday and there Saturday and a
Wednesday. So it's kind of weird.

185
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:46,270
A lot of school nights
shit. So, uh, you know,

186
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,210
she want to come down to
watch me fucking do the,

187
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,550
my pregame analysis on
my fucking standup set.

188
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,170
I'm going crazy cause I got to tape
this fucking thing because, uh,

189
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,770
I have all this other new shift that wants
to come out and I feel like I'm stuck

190
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:03,850
in time here so it has to
happen. Um, but anyways,

191
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:06,040
post nine 11.
All right.

192
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,420
I was in New York on nine 11.
I was on the upper east side,

193
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,320
the 70s all the way by the East River.

194
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,530
And uh,
you know,

195
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,590
there's a lot of like old wives tales
told by people who lived in New York

196
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,500
during that time. Dude, you wouldn't
have known anything was going on.

197
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,030
It was a fucking beautiful day.

198
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,750
And even as it went down as a collapsed
and all that, when I walked outside,

199
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
I didn't see anything in the air.

200
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,850
And if they mean that was like a couple
of miles away and if it wasn't on

201
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,850
television, I never would have
even known that it happened.

202
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:41,640
All I remember was walking
around the upper east side

203
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,640
trying to block out what the fuck just
happened. Like a typical Irish, German,

204
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,270
Irish Catholic. I'm sad
feelings, block them out,

205
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,170
act like nothing's happening.
And uh,

206
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,540
I just remember walking around up there
and like the fucking, there was people,

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,690
it was so weird to me
cause upper east side,

208
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:03,700
they're a bunch of people who actually
could afford to buy an apartment.

209
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,520
You know, a lot of them came
from fucking money or what?

210
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,980
I don't know what the hell they did,
but they were,

211
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:12,310
I remember them sitting outside on a
beautiful sunny day with that horror was

212
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,110
going down there and they were
eating, uh, know breakfast and shit.

213
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,270
And everybody felt it had
that weird sort of like,

214
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,590
I feel like I should be doing something,

215
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:25,591
but what can I get the
theremin on the eggs benedict?

216
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,580
Um, I remember one time when I went
to a fucking wedding, this asshole,

217
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,560
it's rich cunt. I told me, I said, yeah,
I just moved to New York City. He goes,

218
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:39,340
where do you live? And I was like, I
lived on 97th, between third and Lex.

219
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,240
And he goes, Oh yeah, what building? I
remember thinking like, what do you mean,

220
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,040
what building can I told him the address?

221
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,460
And I didn't realize what a fucking
conti rich person question that is.

222
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,850
Cause you know,
when those giant high rises,

223
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,670
they always have to have a
name like the Gotham, you know,

224
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,060
the Bilderberg or whatever.
But if you just, you know,

225
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,000
that's like a big thing in New York.
It's a doorman elevator building. Uh,

226
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,940
you know, a ridiculous amount of
square footage with the fucking view.

227
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,170
Or you had what I had on the
upper east side, which I actually,

228
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,330
I mean the only thing I hate to,
I lived on 79th and York,

229
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,810
if you live in New York,

230
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,770
there's a cluster of buildings over
there near that park where they have that

231
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:34,300
pool. Um, it's great fucking park.

232
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:37,090
And they had like pull up bars and shit.
I don't know. I hope they still have him.

233
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,830
He's to go over there
all the fucking time.

234
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:42,310
And occasionally when I go to New York
I still go to that park if I'm in the

235
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:45,340
area, cause most gyms first whatever
reasons don't have pull up ours,

236
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:49,480
they'd like monkey bars placed to do dips.
Um,

237
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,860
and then they had this pool and
they had like a time and shit.

238
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:56,560
It was fucking great. So he could swim
laps with all these other old people.

239
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:00,100
It was awesome. But it was this
cluster of old buildings and um,

240
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,210
I think they would like six floor walk
ups and I lived on the fifth floor and

241
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,990
you had to like fucking
walk like city blocks.

242
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:10,810
I had to walk up to York over to first,
second,

243
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,900
third and then was at Lexington was
next and then down two blocks to 77th

244
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:20,590
street. Which prop four months
of the year. It wasn't bad.

245
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,810
It was actually a nice walk,
but all the rest of it,

246
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,720
either the humidity or how cold it was.
It was a motherfucker.

247
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,310
I used to wait for the cross
town bus just to stay out of it,

248
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:33,390
just to have a little bit of air
conditioning or a little bit of heat. Um,

249
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,050
except when the kids got out of school,

250
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,510
I don't know what the fuck it
is about New York City kids,

251
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:40,210
but they are fucking lunatics.

252
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,180
They have fucking lunatics.

253
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,110
I don't know if it's because
they see too much or whatever,

254
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,680
but they had just completely
fucking out of control.

255
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,500
Okay.

256
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,280
Like their behavior is just fucking,
I just remember just sitting there like,

257
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:58,260
none of these kids have
ever gotten spanked.

258
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,123
Okay.

259
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,050
Or something. Jesus. I mean, I just
would be sitting there just like,

260
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:07,560
I want to beat the shit out of every
fucking kid on this bus. The girls too.

261
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,010
So anyways, I'm fucking
digressing here. So,

262
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,743
you know,

263
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,400
I went down and I saw like after
nine 11 one or that one piece of,

264
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:26,000
of the world trade was standing up,
I went down, I saw that. And uh,

265
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,180
I remember down the comedy
cellar for months app,

266
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,270
like a month after it was still burning.
I'll never forget that smell.

267
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,550
So on went down to DC.
I mean,

268
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,670
I knew that by then you knew that this
was a changing moment in history and it

269
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:40,240
was just like, you know,
I wanted to see like a,

270
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,640
okay,

271
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,790
you know, go over the Pentagon
and see how bad the damage was.

272
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,580
So I didn't realize I was such an idiot.

273
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,070
I didn't realize that the
Pentagon is like the Pentagon.

274
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,650
I thought the Pentagon was also
kind of like the Lincoln Memorial.

275
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,990
Like you could just kind of go to it as
a tourist, which she can, but I just,

276
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,410
there's like a subway stop and you just
get off at the Pentagon and I'm walking

277
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:01,741
around,

278
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:04,500
there's all these people and like playing
close and then you'd see people in

279
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:08,640
like air force outfits over marine
outfits. And so I was thinking all right,

280
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:11,520
they work here. But everybody
else in plain clothes is like me.

281
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,250
I didn't realize that they all kind of
fucking work there and nobody gives like

282
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:17,910
an office. It's a giant fucking office
building and the shape of a Pentagon.

283
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,300
So I start looking around.
I mean it's basically a circle with,

284
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,280
with points on it, right? That's
what a what a what a Pentagon is.

285
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,510
How many sides to a Pentagon bill? Oh, I
don't, I don't know. It's more than five.

286
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,700
It's a triangle. Then there's a hexagon
and then there's a pro Plexxikon.

287
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,150
I don't know what the fuck it is.
You do?

288
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,580
Didn't know what I knew when I had to
know it for the test and that's never come

289
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:45,570
up in my life. You know what
I mean? You've got a quartet,

290
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,410
you got a quintet that's jazz,
Mata, math. I'm into jazz,

291
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,840
but isn't music just numbers put
together beautifully. Sorry. So I'm like,

292
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,330
I'm standing there and this
point he fucking circle going.

293
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:00,210
Do I go to the ride too? I go to laughed.
I kind of go laugh, then I go right.

294
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:03,570
Then I started walking back left and then
I'm just fucking start walking around

295
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,540
this thing. I'm trying to peek
around the corner and they go,

296
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,060
maybe it should have gone the other
way and are basically not realizing it.

297
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,710
I'm looking shifty as hell. And of course
there's like 50 fucking cameras on me.

298
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,460
Like what the fuck is this dude
doing? Right? And I'm walking,

299
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:20,520
I'm looking around where all
of a sudden this fucking,

300
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,570
was it a jeep or a golf cart?
I Dunno what she says. Ooh.

301
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,950
Pulls up next to me in this.
Fuck. This fucking guy gets out.

302
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,710
Like he, you know when powers
booth ever plays a military guy,

303
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:39,160
he was like that with a baret. Like that's
how much he was decorated, it seemed,

304
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,070
no, no, no, he didn't have all that shit.
But he had some shit on his fucking shirt.

305
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,790
All right.

306
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,470
And he had the bra and I remember he
got out and he was like doing thing,

307
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:52,620
you know when someone's a Bowery to snap
your neck and they're smiling at the

308
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,810
same time.
Like that was the look on his face.

309
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,360
Like he was showing me his teeth smiling,

310
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,780
but everything else just basically said
is I'm going to pull you fucking thrown

311
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:05,760
out like macgruber. And um,
he came up and he's just like,

312
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:06,690
hey buddy,
what are you doing?

313
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,090
And he was like looking
through to the back of my head.

314
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:13,230
And immediately I was just like, Oh,
you know, I was just, and I was just,

315
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,150
then I didn't know what to
say and I was like, oh my God,

316
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,180
what if he knew one of the people
that died here and an ah, just go.

317
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,980
It was just a, you know, a comedian.

318
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:26,040
I'm in town playing Teddy's house,
a comedy,

319
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,920
and just then he fucking
took my name and then it,

320
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,300
then it dawned on me why
they were coming up to me.

321
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,850
And the whole thing just
made sense. Like, oh,

322
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,630
this is like a military building built.
This isn't the Jefferson Memorial.

323
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,150
Um, you're walking around one of the
most top secret fucking places and you're

324
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,990
looking around and you look
like a crazy white guy. Right.

325
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,430
So then it just struck me as funny and
then all I was trying to hold back a

326
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,190
laugh, right? Classic White
Privilege here. Right.

327
00:18:56,191 --> 00:19:00,040
I could actually have this guy come up
to me outside the Pentagon and I can

328
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,000
still find the humor in it because I know
I'm not going to get arrested. Right.

329
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,280
Is that what white privilege is?
I don't know.

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm stuck in this
wonderful fucking position.

331
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,910
I'm just going to stare into that now
and people just say white privilege.

332
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:15,040
I'd be like, Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.

333
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,623
Wow.

334
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,680
Ah. Anyways, what was I saying? Okay,

335
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,210
so the fucking guy,
um,

336
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,110
he's taken down my name and then I kind
of have like this shit eating grin on my

337
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,510
face. Cause you know, at that
point they both, they all kind of,

338
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,920
cause it was the guy who drove the jeep
who is like fucking Tom Cruise and taps.

339
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,720
He just couldn't let it go.
Right.

340
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,950
So I kind of feel him staring at me like
a fucking lunatic. And I'm like, well,

341
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:46,370
if this guy here with all this shit on
his shirt, I can feel him letting me go.

342
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,100
You're not going to arrest me,
the driver of the jeep,

343
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,670
join the military to be a fucking
show for go fuck yourself.

344
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:57,500
So now the comic in me is starting to
come up and I want to irritate this guy,

345
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:01,970
so I really start fucking smiling or what
I was again, man, sorry. I go, hey man,

346
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:05,510
you want to come out to the show and blah,
blah blah. And the guy see, you know,

347
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:07,460
he's,
he's Kinda gone down from,

348
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:10,820
I'm going to fucking rip your throat out
to kind of like, I'll, maybe I'll just,

349
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:14,480
you know, I don't know what stick
a bayonet and your side, he's,

350
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:18,590
he's Kinda down to that. Is that less? I
don't know. Whatever the fuck it is. A,

351
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,950
I'll just waterboard you, he sees,
sees is look as craziness is,

352
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,840
I'm just gonna waterboard you now.
And um,

353
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,560
I get to the end and he's that guy,
right?

354
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,090
And he gets in the jeep and the other
guy was just stare and fucking, uh,

355
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,830
like daggers at me,
the jeep.

356
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:37,340
And I was just looking right at him
smiling and he goes, no, he goes,

357
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:40,850
you're free to keep walking
around this thing, you know,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

358
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,650
And I was just like, Nah,
man, I'm cool. I'm cool.

359
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,830
I can only nobody else driving
up to the fucking jeep.

360
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,250
So they go to away and as he would drive
away, I remember the Chi in the jeep,

361
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,340
the guy drive and like yelled,
I think he was trying to make me jump,

362
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:59,000
like it drove wearing just like that.
And I didn't jump. And I just sort of,

363
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,100
without like looking back,
I just put my hand up and waved at him.

364
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,900
And, uh, and that's my fucking
Pentagon story. So anyways,

365
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,930
I'm going to, uh, I'm going to DC and, um,

366
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,450
this is the greatest thing
flying in Friday. This is
the greatest fucking thing.

367
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Every mother fucking time I
fly into DC like an asshole.

368
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,740
I forget that Washington Dulles airport
is like 30 fucking miles. I don't know.

369
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,890
I don't even know where it
is. North, south west of DC.

370
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,160
I don't know what I just know.
It's 30 fucking miles away.

371
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,300
All right. And if I leave here
at like nine in the morning,

372
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:38,380
by the time I get out there,

373
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:42,070
it's going to be right in the middle
of rush hour and it absolutely fucking

374
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:45,430
sucks. And every time I do
it, I always go, ah, fuck.

375
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,690
I should have flown into
Reagan Reagan's right downtown.

376
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:53,830
Every city has a cute little
mom and pop airport like Dallas.

377
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,120
You don't fly into the fucking Bingo.
Bango one. You go to love field.

378
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,820
Just like John Kennedy did way back
in 1963 you're flying into that one.

379
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,820
That's where you want to go.
You don't want to go to the big ones.

380
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,890
You fucking get in. You get
out. It's lovely. Lovely.

381
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,480
It's cute little fucking airport. So
I'm not that. Reagan said small. I mean,

382
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:19,420
it was a fucking, was a giant airport back
in the day and age. I think they just,

383
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,480
I don't know the population or was too
close to the White House, have no focus,

384
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,020
kind of a fucking watch list. Am
I going to be on, on this podcast,

385
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:30,310
all these buzzwords, nine 11
twin towers. I said Pentagon,

386
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,080
Pentagon,
and White House,

387
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,070
and I named both candidates that are
running for president and I'm going to the

388
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:40,990
nation's capitol. All right. You might
not want to want to go to Saturday show.

389
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:43,840
You might want to wait until I
get out of fucking being detained.

390
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,830
God knows that guy driving in the chief's
probably worked his way up, you know,

391
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,830
probably motivated them. You know, like
Obama motivated fucking Trump. You know,

392
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:58,780
when he trashed him at that fucking rich
person breakfast or whatever the fuck

393
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:02,470
it was. Fuck, I gotta take
this phone call. Hang on one
second. Hang on. Hang on.

394
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,940
Okay, I'm back. So anyways, yeah.

395
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,430
Obama made flake when Obama made fun of
fucking Trump at that senior breakfast,

396
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,160
whatever the fuck it was.
And I think that that,

397
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:20,080
like there's theories that that's what
motivated him to run for president, which,

398
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,620
you know,
as much as I don't like the gun,

399
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,180
it's pretty fucking awesome that he
was like, you know what? Fuck this.

400
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,390
I'm going to take that guys who didn't
fucking just sit there and think

401
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:31,180
something like that and then to
actually do it, even if you are a Trump,

402
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:35,170
that's fucking amazing. Um, anyways,

403
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,000
I think I got to read a little
advertising here. No, I don't want to,

404
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,310
I really don't feel it. Some days you
just don't feel like reading. And for me,

405
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:46,330
that's been my entire adult life I
had of it and when I was in school,

406
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,200
you know, so like, yeah, just
handing you shit to read.

407
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,590
Yeah.

408
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,630
You know,
in the words of that English woman,

409
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:57,280
when that Saudi Arabian kid
drove by with his fucking,

410
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,030
okay,

411
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,110
gold wrap, the Lamborghini going,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, stop it.

412
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,360
That's what I wanted to say.
That was the inner me.

413
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,670
Okay.

414
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,720
They'd hand out and you need to read the
chapter one and did champion chill by

415
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:15,560
Monday. Stop it. All right.

Wic whip finding great new wine is tough,

440
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,840
but that's why I've been telling you
about our sponsor club, Debbie Kalib.

441
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,030
Debbie Hamish to here.
I came down when the towers went down.

442
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:57,020
I went down there and I said,

443
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:01,070
I can hear you and how they make it so
easy to get wine personalized to your

palate and delivered right to your door.

445
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:08,180

446
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,210
I could data. Dick Cheney is now
called [inaudible], spelled w.

447
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,180
I. N. C, a new name and
an improved the look.

448
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,320
Okay?

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,150
Okay, I'll go. I'll go with
you with the improved look,

450
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:23,340
I don't know about an hour and improve
name. I don't know how to say it,

451
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,900
but here's the important part.

452
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:29,901
It's still the same amazing wine company
introducing you to new wines and you'll

George W. Bush said, hey man,

454
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,310
I'm Debbie as my club.
I used to own the rangers.

455
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,790
Um, please include all of the fun. I'm
going to include them all. All right.

456
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,540
Branford reference your wine ordering,
drinking experience with wink to cuss.

457
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,230
I only time I've ever ordered wine is
when I'm in the restaurant and I used to

458
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:56,700
feel pressure when they would pour it
and look at you and everything and I just

459
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:59,490
look, I just sent it right back. I'm like,
yeah, dude, it's, it's wine. It's fine.

460
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,380
You know what I mean?
You gotta stay sticky,

461
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:05,760
knows and it's Florida around and fucking,
you know,

462
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:09,610
have it roll around your mouth
and then swallow than you. Um Hm.

463
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,340
What kind of unique he realized how
much of a fucking Dick you have to be to

464
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,910
send back a bottle of wine. That's it.
That's a confidence move right there.

465
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,300
You know what I mean?
Like if I was,

466
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,680
if I was a lady and I was on a date and
my dude sent the bottle of wine back,

467
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,280
I would just, that would be, that would
be the end of the date. All right.

468
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,480
I would just be like,
this guy,

469
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:38,340
he's a cunt and I don't think no means
no in his world. And he's getting drunk.

470
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,570
I'm fucking Outta here. He just sent
back a bottle of wine. All right. Wink.

471
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,930
Wince when you know, when I do
web, you know what I'm doing.

472
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,931
I'm doing that fucking that guy who
fucking choked the fuck's his name when he

473
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:53,830
went to go sing that song.
Um,

474
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,980
that's a Mori where the Buddha
churros and when he started to go,

475
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:01,140
when he just goes whip.
All right.

476
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,280
What works directly with wine makers
and growers from all over the world to

replace it with a bottle.

480
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:19,800
You'll love no questions asked.
Oh,

481
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,350
you can send it back via the
mail so it's not as crazy.

482
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,890
You don't have to stare at the waiter.
He walks back going, all right,

483
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:29,310
I'll get you another bottle
with my dick in it. Um, I don't,

484
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,700
I don't get sent random bottles.
That is true.

485
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,210
I don't just get random bottles.
Oh,

486
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,790
they're acting like I signed up for
this shit. I didn't sign up for it.

487
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,880
I drink enough.
I don't need booze delivered at my door.

488
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,220
At least I can work for it.
But you got this is this,

489
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,630
I mean it's a great company here.
If you,

490
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,660
let's get this back on the rails for the
artist formerly known as kind of Benny

491
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,530
Winc is a personalized wine membership
that recommends that recommends wine

492
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,650
specifically for me based on
results of my palate profile quiz.

493
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,350
I don't drink wine. I drink, I drink
booze. Why do they keep putting words?

494
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,090
I also re listen to this. I also write
all of the law. Is this like my fucking,

495
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,900
is there a robot version of
me out there drinking wine?

496
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,640
I hope it's brushing his teeth.

497
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,440
I also write all of the wine I received
from the club, Debbie and Winc.

498
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,690
So they learn about me with every order
and constantly personalize the wine they

499
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:29,310

507
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:55,721
it's great duty.

508
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,900
It's a waste it this way too much fucking
copy for someone who's dumb as I am.

509
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,390
You want, you get it
right, you're into wine.

510
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:03,760
You'd tell him what you like and then
they send it to you. If you don't like it,

511
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,700
you fucking send it back.
And then they, then they go,
well, what was wrong with it?

512
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:08,740
You say, well, it was too much
of this, and they go, all right,

513
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,490
and then gradually they get you in the
crosshair of your fucking booze hound.

514
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,750
[inaudible] right, and then,
then you have it. That's perfect.

515
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,700

um,

524
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,610
all right. How many more of these fucking
things are there? Two more. Two more.

525
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:58,930
Hang in there, people hang in
there. All right. D s t l d genes.

526
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,630
No one could that possibly stand for

527
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,190
those same titties.

528
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:10,260
Like damn jeans.
Uh,

529
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,730
the problem with jeans is
that really, Oh, it's, oh,

530
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,630
it's pronounced is stilled distill genes,
everybody.

531
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,270
The problem with jeans is that the really
good pairs cost two to $300 easily.

532
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,150
And the bargain brands just fall
apart or look terrible. Yeah.

533
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:30,150
The Dad jeans distilled genes
pronounced distilled Dstl d

534
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,760
I came in. What I said just said
those titties look damn right.

535
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,350
No Damn. See titties looked at, I
can't remember if the fuck I said,

536
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,980
it has revolutionized the fashion
industry by creating timeless luxury grade

537
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:47,770
denim. There's no such thing
as timeless denim. Okay.

538
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:50,500
You go back and you look at the genes from
10 years ago, they're like, oh my God,

539
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:51,161
I can't believe your war.

540
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:55,270
Those that read the fucking hugging your
nuts are hanging off your ass either

541
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:59,650
look like you only have eight kids
or you were an orphan every 10 years.

542
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,850
Genes changed that much. Okay. We'll
decide whether they're timeless,

543
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,440
luxury grade denim,

544
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,490
so you get genes that would cost you
hundreds of dollars starting at 65 bucks.

545
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:11,530
Oh Jesus.
How do they do it?

546
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,140
By refusing to work with the department
stores and retail middlemen. Yeah,

547
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,900
and some eight year olds
sewing them together.

548
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,430
That's the only way you could sell it for.

549
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,210
If you're selling me a three and fair
dollar pair of jeans for 65 bucks,

550
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,550
fuck outta here.
I'll tell you,

551
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,670
there's a kid somewhere in some fucking
country with really tired fingers right

552
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:28,504
now.

553
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,110
He probably got the old school thing
where you gotta use your foot is just sew

554
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:36,580
it together. Sorry. These are wonderful
cheats. There's no markup, no bullshit.

555
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,980
Just great jeans at an unbelievable price.
Go distilled.

556
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,920
No DSTL d.com spelled Dstl d.com.

557
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,860
Uh, define the perfect
pair with the perfect fit.

558
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,100
They'll ship them to you for
free and guarantee the fit.

559
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,730
Or we'll send you a new pair until
they are perfect. See for yourself.

560
00:32:55,731 --> 00:33:00,731
Why a list celebrities have been spotted
and magazines wearing $65 jeans in

561
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:05,030
vogue,
Gq wearing distilled jeans.

562
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,240
Even see celebrities like
me. Oh, look at that.

563
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:13,220
They're making me be fucking
self deprecating. See,

564
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:17,330
I'm one, I'm one level above Kathy

598
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,460
I just pictured them kidnapping homeless
people. Make them try it on right.

599
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,050
And they got them in the cage.

Louganis stay with that tight,

629

balls during the course of the day?

630
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,903
You know what I mean?

631
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,130
I think when you first were under where
you're aware of your fucking balls.

632
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,660
Okay?

633
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,351
It's kind of like the fruit.

634
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:04,600
When you put on a wedding ring you
put on on wedding day like, dude,

635
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:05,860

645
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:43,780
undies.com/birth Jesus.

646
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:47,650
I was a fucking long way to go. Um, hey,

647
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,780
guess what I haven't done since Monday?

648
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,040
Yeah.

649
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,150
I have not flipped out a technology.
I've had a couple of issues. I relaxed.

650
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,710
I tried to figure it out. I was actually
able to figure out how to, uh, you know,

651
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:03,460
just when I download some music, how to
have it automatically go to my phone.

652
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,770
You know, cause sometimes it would do it.
Sometimes it wouldn't. If I was on Wifi,

653
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:12,400
I didn't know how to do it. I was like,
how can I get it to automatically do it?

654
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:16,030
And I just, I, I just googled
it like a normal person

655
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,780
found out the fucking answer,
like a normal person.

656
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,920
And it all went to my phone and I
said, well, I got to give this a try.

657
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,410
I want to download that
new green day album.

658
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,270
I want to see what's going on with that
fucking thing. Right. What's his face?

659
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:36,960
Trey cools on the cover. I don't
know if it's modern drummer drum. Um,

660
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,980
we were in a hounds tooth fucking so,
right. And I'm like, that's right.

661
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,950
They got a new album out.
This advertising is working.

662
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:48,740
So I went and I downloaded the thing and
boom, went right to my phone, you know,

663
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,790
and then I sinked up my
address books and now my fit,

664
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,190
my numbers are all
floating back and forth.

665
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,850
I now know that I could scroll down
and see how many contacts I have,

666
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,340
not only on my fucking

667
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,650
phone, but also on my computer.
But now I can't figure this out.

668
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:09,610
Why is this doing this? Oh, see that.
I just figured something else out.

669
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,000
You hit the little x thing. I have 193
cards people, I gotta tell you something.

670
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,260
Um, overrated. Alright.

671
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,630
The panic of losing all your phone
numbers and all your contacts.

672
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,400
Here's the deal.
Within 10 days,

673
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,600
anybody who's in your life is
going to text you like, hey man,

674
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,000
I haven't heard from you. What's going
on? Then you get them through them.

675
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,990
You just get the, you know, you get
everybody else. I have 193, sorry,

676
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:35,790
my eyes are going, it's
not one 98, one 93. Um,

677
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,980
and after today that'll be up
over 200. And uh, you know,

678
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,320
I still haven't turned
on my other phone yet.

679
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:43,870
I'm going to wait until it just
completely fucking dries out. I mean,

680
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:44,471
what's the point?

681
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:47,620
I have all the numbers that I really
need and I was able to get a few that I

682
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,670
didn't think I was going to
get. Um, and like I said,

683
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:54,490
if you know me and I haven't texted
you when you listen to this podcast for

684
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:59,020
whatever reason, texts me cause
I don't have your number anymore.

685
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,130
All right. And I've actually had like
three or four people going, hey man,

686
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,710
listen to your podcast.
I heard that you lost all your numbers.

687
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,070
Just reaching out man. I was like,
Hey, thanks. I really appreciate it.

688
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:11,780
Do you have so and so's so and so's
and so and so's? And then I just,

689
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,240
I just build it up. You
had built, we get it.

690
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,430
You basically doing exactly what anybody
else would be doing and your situation.

691
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,750
You're, you're talking about
yourself, like you're doing
something groundbreaking.

692
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,760
Okay. You got me. All right.
Let's end with this. Um,

693
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,580
I told you I went down to fucking iron
maiden rabbit hole for some reason.

694
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:31,630
Right now I'm listening to James
Brown in early iron maiden.

695
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,920
I don't know why.

696
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,190
And I'm playing drums along with it and
I'm having the fucking time of my life.

697
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,460
And, uh, I've been
playing to the prisoner.

698
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,880
I still can't do that popup a
bat with a fucking Bass Drum.

699
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:47,410
How fast Clive bird's foot was. I
can get it up to speed though. Um,

700
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,630
I've been fucking with that. And then
of course, um, where eagles dare,

701
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:56,590
which is just fucking ridiculous.
But that's the great thing about youtube.

702
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,073
You know,

703
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,600
everybody breaks everything down and then
you don't even have to fucking develop

704
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:02,620
your years as a musician.

705
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,450
So then you learn how to play shift
that you didn't really figure out some,

706
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:08,650
he gave you the answers to the
test. Every, he's like, wow, man,

707
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,050
you're really fucking good.
And then all of a sudden,

708
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,480
Sunday somebody writes an
original song and they say, Hey,

709
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,080
come up with some drums to this and you
have nowhere to search. And then they go,

710
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,700
oh, that's who you really
are. Um, all right,

711
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,000
that's the podcast here.
Lay Ladies and gentlemen.

712
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,490
That's the Thursday afternoon podcasts.
I was just checking in on you.

713
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:31,090
I hope your, uh, your, your, your, your
week's been going good. Even if it isn't,

714
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,300
it's already Thursday. Look at
that. Look at you. Get Your paycheck

715
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,370
today. You cash it. You have a
couple, two or three. You know,

716
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:41,630
you put on your fucking me undies. You
know, you go out, you get hammered,

717
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,960
you bang the chick down the fucking
way. Right? Next day she comes in,

718
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:49,300
she fucking Rad. Shout you get
fired. And then your boss goes to zip

719
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,500
the recruiter and he fucking
advertises a position.

720
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:57,770
He gets somebody better than
you with more me undies. Right?

721
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,940
But he's got clubbed Debbie, your
breath. So they got to get rid of him.

722
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
Gone call back to all the fucking things,
you know,

723
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:07,460
and they kick him right in the ass
if it's distilled James. All right.

724
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,990
And then that's it. I think that's it.
They mail his ass home through stamps.com.

725
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,590
All right,

726
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,520
go fuck yourselves. Have a great
weekend. You can't enjoy the music.

727
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,030
As we sort of segue into,
uh,

728
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,420
some Monday morning podcast greatest
hits from a podcast from a different time

729
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,340
in a year going by or maybe earlier
this year depending on how funny it was.

730
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:34,850
I had no fucking idea.
I'll see you

731
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,090
exactly that.
This reality

732
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,780
grinding to a memory of a time.

733
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:15,130
I want to do that ted.com just look up
robots and try to find the one with, uh,

734
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,640
with this, this, this
lady is sitting there.

735
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:21,010
She's fucking talking about,
you know,

736
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,250
having robots around the house.

737
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:25,960
Okay.

738
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,440
You know what I mean? It is the
stupidest thing. Okay? First of all,

739
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,880
she's whoring it up for no
particular reason in the beginning.

740
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,160
I don't know why she's wearing
like these hooker boots.

741
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,480
She sitting there talking about robots
to a bunch of egg head nerds and she's

742
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:42,970
still got a horror it up.
It's like,

743
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
can't you just stand on the merit of
the fucking speech that you wrote?

744
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,280
Do you really got to get
people's Dicks half full?

745
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:54,160
Just so they'll keep listening to you?
How fucking insecure are you?

746
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,370
You're talking about robots in the house,

747
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,530
walking down the hallway. What's up?
Fucking high five and a God damn robot.

748
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,950
That right. It's not like it's
a movie. It's fucking real.

749
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,740
That's not compelling enough of a subject.

750
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:10,780
You can't hold the audience's interest.

751
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,410
You still have to put on
your street walker boots.

752
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,360
Okay.

753
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,020
It's weird. She has on street walker
boots, but she has on a modest skirt.

754
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,620
It comes down a little or maybe cause
the boots go up so fucking high.

755
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,660
Okay.

756
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,300
You know what I mean? I mean
the, isn't that basically a rule?

757
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:30,250
If you're going to wear the
fucking thigh high boots,

758
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,330
you basically have to
have on a mini skirt.

759
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,280
All right, so she starts her
speech, right? Not a whore,
just dressed like a whore.

760
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,060
Like she put on half of our call and
Wean costume and then, oh wait a minute,

761
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:46,360
I have to give a speech. So she
goes down there and she's just like,

762
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:50,110
she actually sounds,
what she's talking about is smart,

763
00:44:50,111 --> 00:44:51,550
but she doesn't sound that smart.

764
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,570
So I don't know if some nerd wrote the
fucking speech for her and got like,

765
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:56,404
I dunno

766
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,030
fucking broke out in hives right before
the speech. So they sent her out instead.

767
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:03,650
But she's just up there like,
you know what,

768
00:45:03,651 --> 00:45:08,651
I always allow Gol I remember just seeing
star wars and seeing thethey po going,

769
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,060
wouldn't that just be
awesome to have like a robot?

770
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,930
And that's like two jobs that just to
like kind of talk to and like joke around

771
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:18,764
with.

772
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,890
And she starts talking about how she
feels that robots should be in the fucking

773
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:30,981
house because she wants her own
c three Po my saying that right.

774
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:32,280
Am I pausing at the wrong time?

775
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,690
I go into the c three p
o c three Po c three p o

776
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:38,671
don't know,
whatever.

777
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:41,970
That's such a stupid fucking movie
because one of the most overrated fucking

778
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:44,100
Goddamn motherfucking movies,
a vault.

779
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:46,530
I would rather watch
muppets take Manhattan.

780
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,610
I think that that holds up better because
at least there's adult humor in there,

781
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,160
you know, you know, totally
ripped off. Use the force,

782
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,560
Joel Olsteen that fucking skinny dad gay.

783
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,930
When you were in a tee shirt cheese,
won't she a half a t shirt?

784
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,550
Just think about it. It's going to
happen. He totally stole that whole vibe.

785
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,610
I don't even know what that makes sense.
So you're not, furthermore, I don't care.

786
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,370
Plowing ahead to this lady sitting there,

787
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,850
lady sitting there talking
about these fucking robots.

788
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:19,400
You got to watch the video and about,
I don't know, 10 11 minutes in,

789
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,690
I can't remember where the fuck it is.

790
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,900
They cut to somebody shooting the shit
with a robot and it looks like it's

791
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:30,170
basically a head coming out of a giant VCR

792
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,720
and he's like sitting there like
it's be like if you had a VCR,

793
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,260
their head coming out of it but like a
robot head like bolts for eyes and shit.

794
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,370
But it has like eyelashes for
some stupid reason like blinking.

795
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,460
Like it needs to blink.
Right.

796
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,220
And he's sitting at it
like he's at his desk,

797
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:53,650
like almost face to face with the thing.
He's just like,

798
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,890
Hey fucking r two d two look up.

799
00:46:56,891 --> 00:46:59,890
My girlfriend bought me and he
showed some sort of fucking,

800
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,800
I dunno what the hell.
At some macho chain of a watch.

801
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:06,610
I can't remember what the fuck it was. And
then the robot is just like, oh my God,

802
00:47:06,611 --> 00:47:10,690
that's real. A actress thing, dead shape
and it's movement. It's fucking head.

803
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,730
Can I ask either,

804
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:19,180
this might be the dumbest question
ever or just painfully obvious.

805
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,490
Why the fuck would I need that?
Well, why would I need that?

806
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,800
Like why?
Why won't I just to my friend,

807
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,261
you know what I'm saying?
It was,

808
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:34,980
it's like the baseball kid from way
back in the day. Remember that Shit.

809
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:37,380
I talked about it here when the podcast,
one of these Mondays,

810
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,730
these have the baseball kid, it's
called baseball kid, the baseball kid,

811
00:47:41,731 --> 00:47:44,370
a baseball, his work, you're
willing to do baseball, cable,

812
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:49,390
Phd and it was a cardboard cutout of
a friend basically that you don't have

813
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,300
throwing a fucking baseball to you.
You know?

814
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,070
It was basically for
the kid with no friends.

815
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:59,270
So now they've upgraded that to the
person who has no fucking friends.

816
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,420
You. What's great is that I bet that
guy didn't even have a girlfriend.

817
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:06,250
I bet he bought the watch for himself.

818
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,490
And now he's now part of the sickness
is he just fucking lies to this robot

819
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:16,420
about this life that he doesn't have.
And you know, once you start doing that,

820
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,750
it's an inevitable,
it's an inevitability.

821
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:25,030
It's a fucking a cirrhosis of the liver
that that guy's eventually going to

822
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:29,140
stick his fucking human dick in that
robot mouth in the second dead fucking

823
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:30,730
happens.
That's it.

824
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,180
Okay.

825
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,550
It's the end of the fucking human rights.
I'll tell you right now, this fucking,

826
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:36,650
the scientists out there
fucking robots right now,

827
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,060
they're out there banging robots,
you know,

828
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,450
under the whole platform
of fucking research.

829
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,380
It's actually really scary. Like,
cool, go watch this shit on ted.com.

830
00:48:49,381 --> 00:48:51,930
They've got another one showing
how we're fighting wars now.

831
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:56,100
And like these guys sit in Arizona,
they go to basically go to work,

832
00:48:56,101 --> 00:49:00,750
they go to war and then they come home
after fucking blowing up some bad guys.

833
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,150
Uh, hopefully bad guys, right?

834
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:08,040
And then they fucking go and they sit
down and hang out with their kids and

835
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:10,430
they're sitting there talking about how,
uh,

836
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,780
okay,

837
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,990
you know, now the bad guys are getting the
robots and blah, blah, blah. It's just,

838
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:18,850
it's fucking inevitable.
All those drones,

839
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,390
they're basically eventually all
this shit. They use it over there.

840
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,250
I think eventually they're
going to use over here.

841
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,380
Yeah.

842
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,213
You know?

843
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:26,840
Okay.

844
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,200
In the future there'll be
no more skipping jury duty.

845
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,140
Okay.

846
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,570
The second you skip it,
you're going to wake up in the morning,

847
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,220
peek out the window, and there's going to
be a fucking drone just hovering there.

848
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,870
You have seven x to get to
court or you will be vaporized.

849
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,300
It's going to be one of
those fucking things.

850
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,490
Is this the least interesting
thing you ever heard in your life?

851
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:52,430
I mean it didn't. I just basically
do every science fiction movie.

852
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,490
Has there ever been a science fiction
movie where they predict something great?

853
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,383
That's what I'm going to do.

854
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:59,390
I want to be original here for once in
my fucking life. Let's go the other way.

855
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,320
Okay.

856
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,560
It's going to be a friendly drone.
It's going to be outside that window.

857
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,320
Go back to sleep.
It's okay.

858
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,420
We shut your cloud to go
down to the Jerry Dodi

859
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,820
it now. We don't need you,
so you will be vaporized.

860
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,550
You will be vaporized. That's the
way to do it. I think that that's,

861
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:25,570
that's gonna be the,
the,

862
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:30,571
that that's going to be the funeral in
2020 I think by 2020 we're going to know

863
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:36,530
definitely where you go when you die
and if it's anywhere other than here,

864
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,470
people are just going to
choose to tap out. You know,

865
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:42,740
it's going to be like getting a vasectomy.
Just getting fucking vaporized.

866
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,920
Still an intense fucking procedure that,

867
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,560
that needs a serious
talking before you do it.

868
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,140
But you know, Eh, you know, I'm
just getting 70 to change. You know,

869
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,520
like when people on the east coast moved
to like Minnesota or fucking San Diego

870
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,950
just needed a change.
That's what's going to happen.

871
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:03,810
People just going to get vaporized
here in the future. It's fucking true.

872
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,520
You know, I know you guys are
rolling your eyes right now,

873
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:10,460
but you don't have access to
the information that I do. Okay.

874
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:14,900
So please reserve your
judgment or whatever, whatever.

875
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:19,040
Temper your judgment. Don't be hasty with
you, judge. Whatever that point. Yeah.

876
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,200
Can expression is human

877
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,033
caused

878
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,820
by the stars in the sky.

879
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:58,890
Okay.

880
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,570
Hey, what's going on? It's still bear.

881
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:05,590
It is the Monday morning podcast that
I'm doing at eight 30 at night Pacific

882
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:06,670
coast time.
I uh,

883
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,010
apologize for the late
recording this week.

884
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,180
I had a,
I had a really busy Monday and uh,

885
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,590
I had one window where I could have a,
I could have recorded,

886
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,620
but I was so fucking pissed at my health
insurance people that I just didn't

887
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:27,330
want to, I didn't want to go
on screaming for the weekend,

888
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,970
trying to be more mellow. I don't even
know what the fuck that word means.

889
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:35,010
But anyway,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

890
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:38,310
I do one of these every God damn week
can still, I'm still a little pissed,

891
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,240
you know, people send me questions
and if you have any questions for me,

892
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:46,170
just send them to bill at [inaudible]
dot com or you can go on my myspace page

893
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,800
and send them there. Any questions
you have, I'll answer them.

894
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:52,920
If you have a list of stuff that
you feel is overrated or underrated,

895
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:53,754
I will read that.

896
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,870
And if I say something you think is
stupid during the podcast and you need to

897
00:52:57,871 --> 00:53:00,000
correct me,
you can correct me.

898
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,590
Like this feller last week I was
talking about that creepy commercial,

899
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,670
you know that commercial where they
got the mothers did their advertising

900
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:11,770
batteries and they've got the mother
and the park and she can't find her kid.

901
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:16,500
She's like Michael and uh, you know,

902
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:20,890
well since she takes out
this little device that the
doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo,

903
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:22,350
Doo,
Doo,

904
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,980
all of a sudden a kid comes over the
fucking hill and they don't show wearing

905
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:29,040
any bracelet or any sort of hat
with an antenna on it. And I'm like,

906
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:29,890
they're getting you ready?

907
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,450
You ready for the future where they're
going to want to put microchips and your

908
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:37,230
kids. Okay, so this guy
says, you know what bill,

909
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,460
I was listening to your podcast and I
actually looked up that commercial to see

910
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:44,400
what the deal was.
And it's actually the brick house locator.

911
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,170
It doesn't use it ship, sorry to
shoot down your dreams of the future.

912
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:52,770
Instead it has a key chain type receiver
that the parents clipped to your

913
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,810
children's shoes,
jacket or backpack.

914
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,670
And it's a homing device to let you
know their location in second. Okay.

915
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:00,870
Well,
you know what,

916
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,950
I wasn't saying that there was a chip
in the kid and what I was saying is that

917
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:09,951
they don't show that he has the clip and
it's very subtly getting you ready for

918
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,830
them to put a chip in you in the future.
And uh,

919
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,360
I don't know why, I don't even thought
you're arguing with me on this point,

920
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:21,570
but you're being a little company.
You know,

921
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,060
I realized that the kid
didn't have a chip in it,

922
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,610
but haven't you seen the stories on
the news where these people who work at

923
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:28,530
corporations are like,
yes,

924
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,250
my company put a chip in the and I
don't have a problem to it. I with it.

925
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:35,670
I have access to very sensitive materials.

926
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:41,520
I happened to know the secret
formula to a Kentucky Fried Chicken,

927
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,250
so I need to have them in bed, a fucking
code in my fucking microchip in my og.

928
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:52,140
Really? You know, Colonel
Sanders knew the fucking recipe.

929
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:54,930
They didn't have to put a chip
in. It's fucking goatee. Did they?

930
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,340
You know something. This is
just, I'm not going to make it.

931
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,780
I'm not going to make it in the future.

932
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:05,010
When they become more and
more of a fucking police
state and they're doing this

933
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:09,720
shit, I swear to God. If people
just line up like fucking sheep,

934
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,280
I don't know what I'm going to do and I
swear to God, they're going to be like,

935
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:17,850
well, he ain't doing nothing wrong.
You shouldn't have a problem with it.

936
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,071
You know that,

937
00:55:19,071 --> 00:55:22,770
that fucking argument about how the
government can listen to your phone calls

938
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:27,260
now. And that was people's big argument.
They would just like, well, dude,

939
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,240
if you're not doing anything,
then why would you,

940
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,890
could you please wrap the cord around
your throat and choke yourself?

941
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:39,270
Read a little bit of history before
you open your fucking mouth. You Moron.

942
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:45,890
Every fucking period in history just
has horrific events of maniacs with too

943
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:52,380
much power. Putting people
to death constantly happens.

944
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,270
It's happening right now.
Genocide.

945
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,870
Has genocide ever took any
even taking a weekend off?

946
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,920
It's unreal. It's not happening over in
fucking Europe or over here. People just,

947
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,240
you know, am I getting preachy? I'm
going to shut the fuck up. All right,

948
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:10,830
let's move on to the next thing.
Um, oh, is a question. Hey Bill. Uh,

949
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,660
will you be on the Jim Norton
Hbo Show? Why? Yes. Yes, I will.

950
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:20,700
Um, I had the privilege of performing
with little Jimmy Norton in May.

951
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:25,701
We taped it and it's going to be airing
October 23rd Friday night at midnight.

952
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,150
So, uh, set your Tivo because I
imagined you guys all have lives.

953
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:35,440
You all be out there partying and up come
home, shit faced and watch it. And I,

954
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,490
speaking of which,

955
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:40,780
let's plug little Jimmy show a down and
dirty with Jim Norton is on every Friday

956
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:44,770
night, HBO at midnight
and a, I got to tell you,

957
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:49,150
I was really impressed with the
level of a comedian that they had.

958
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:53,050
There was a lot of guys I didn't know
and I had to gone go on after this dude

959
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:53,980
Sean rouse,

960
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,540
who I had worked with before
and I thought it was hilarious,

961
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,660
but when I saw him,
when I had to go on after him,

962
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:03,460
I was literally standing
in the wings going like,

963
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:08,440
I don't think I could follow
this guy because, uh, I dunno.

964
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,510
Absolutely fucking brilliant
comedian Sean routes.

965
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:16,060
I think it's s e a n r O. U. Sfe. I Dunno,

966
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:21,160
he opens for Doug. Stan hope a lot. So
go over to Doug Stan hopes web website.

967
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,280
I'm sure he's got something on their
own link over there or check Doug.

968
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,730
Stan hope.
Look at me hyping other comedians.

969
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:31,240
There's three fuck fucking hilarious
people that you should go see,

970
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,500
but not this weekend

971
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:38,410
actually go see him this weekend
unless you're an Austin, Texas,

972
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:42,100
because that's where I'm going to be
at the cap city comedy club, goddammit.

973
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,720
And uh, I'm really, really
excited to do this Gig and uh,

974
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,440
but a little disappointed. I kind
of asked some sad news. Well,

975
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,510
let's give you the good news first.

976
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,600
The good news is I'll be working
with my good friend Joe to Rosa,

977
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:59,560
who I do a uninformed
with my XM radio show,

978
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:03,310
our XM radio show,
and he'll be opening up for me too,

979
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:07,510
man show and uh, Joe
fucking hilarious. Um,

980
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:11,050
it's going to be a great
night of comedy this Thursday,

981
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:15,460
Friday and saturday@capcitycomedyclub.com.
You can get all the information. Now.

982
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,623
The reason

983
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:23,010
I booked myself in Austin this weekend
was because the longhorns had a home game

984
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,640
and I've always wanted to go to a,

985
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:29,650
I always wanted to go to a game
there since way, way the fuck back.

986
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,310
I watched the longhorns game
and for some reason I like,

987
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,220
I think the guy's name was cherry
gray or something like that.

988
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,960
He's one of their defensive backs and
either the late seventies, early eighties,

989
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:42,100
must've been early eighties,

990
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,060
because Earl Campbell wasn't playing
for him at that point. So anyways,

991
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,490
I always wanted to go to a game there.
I'm a big time sports geek.

992
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,290
And uh,

993
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,910
in fact when we were booking the
show that the cap city people,

994
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:56,380
we're talking to my agent going,

995
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,490
I don't know if he wants to come down
here that weekend because there's a

996
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,260
longhorn home game and people really
go nuts for those games. And uh,

997
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,090
we don't want it to affect his
numbers. So I was like, well,

998
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,710
I want to go to the game so
I don't give a fuck. I'll,

999
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,360
I'll make less money so I can go to the
game. So this is what ends up happening,

1000
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,930
the longhorns and up,
uh, being undefeated,

1001
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:24,710
kicking the shit out of people and
everybody else starts fucking losing.

1002
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:27,560
And next thing you know.
Then the number one team in the country,

1003
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,770
and I swear to God,
earlier this year,

1004
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:35,420
the fucking game was going to be on in
the afternoon and now I believe they call

1005
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:37,970
it the flex schedule.
They've moved the game time.

1006
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:43,430
They pushed it back to 7:00
PM and my show's at 8:00 PM so

1007
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,940
I don't know what the
fuck I'm going to do now.

1008
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,870
Does that mean nobody's going to come
to my show and I don't get to go to the

1009
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:55,010
football game? I'm such
a fucking, this is why

1010
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,590
I can't even talk. I'm such as Sports
Geek that I'm actually considering.

1011
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,860
You know what? There's a dog.
I'm sitting in my car right now.

1012
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:07,100
There's a fucking dog looking out
at the window looking right at me.

1013
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,550
I got the windows up,
that son of a bitches behind the window.

1014
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,470
It's like he can hear
everything that I'm saying.

1015
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,240
Cody. Yes. God, yes.

1016
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,590
You just fucking staring him.

1017
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:28,350
Maybe you know I was using some
hacky command. Oh, he left. He left.

1018
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,090
He left his, then another person
come up to the window. Right now.

1019
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:36,210
I look like a freak. Okay.
The fuck was I talking about?

1020
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,270
I'm actually such a sports geek and
I'm actually considering going there

1021
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,140
tailgating

1022
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:49,790
and watching like literally the first
hour of the game because then I'll be on

1023
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:52,800
until eight 45 and that, you know
what? Fuck that I'm doing it.

1024
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,370
I'm going to the Goddamn game.
If I just see the first fucking quarter,

1025
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:59,010
I don't give a shit.
God Damn it.

1026
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:02,790
That pisses me off the whole fucking
weekend screwed up. Now you know,

1027
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:03,740
I was driving up,

1028
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,860
I was going to go up to Houston because
I was going to go to south park guitars.

1029
01:01:07,861 --> 01:01:12,360
It's as they got nothing but lefty
guitars out there and I'm Jonesing to buy

1030
01:01:12,361 --> 01:01:16,740
this, this new reissue gold top
Les Paul Because uh, I don't know.

1031
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,890
I played drums and guitar. I'm
done. My life is ridiculous.

1032
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:23,040
I'm like a fucking 12 year old. I'm
not married. I don't have any kids.

1033
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,450
I go to sporting events,

1034
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,950
I played drums and guitars and I babbled
for a half hour on Monday and I tell

1035
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,720
shit jokes on the weekend.
It's like

1036
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,260
sometimes I wake up feeling guilty. How
fucking great my life is. It's just,

1037
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,760
I can't lie to you. It's
fucking awesome. I just,

1038
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:42,420
this is what fucking
level of sports nerd I am.

1039
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,110
This is just for my podcast
listeners up in Canada.

1040
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,520
I've always wanted to go to cocky games
up in Canada and I never, you know,

1041
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,950
I always want to get booked up there,
but you know,

1042
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:57,420
my fucking bookers always like, oh, the
money isn't good, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1043
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,720
Blahs is back when the dollar was
worth more than my fucking shoe laces,

1044
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,020
so I'd never get booked up there.
So this year,

1045
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,780
in December, you know, the industry
shuts down. I said, you know what?

1046
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:14,460
Fuck this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna take a hockey trip up to Canada.

1047
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:17,910
Three Day weekend.
I fly up Friday,

1048
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,740
Friday night I go to a Calgary game.

1049
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:25,140
Then Saturday I drive up to Edmonton.
I go to an Edmonton,

1050
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,300
Vancouver Canucks game in Edmonton.

1051
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,340
And then a Sunday morning I fly over
to Vancouver and I go to a Vancouver

1052
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,210
Canucks game. That is my fucking
weekend. And I know there's a lot of,

1053
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:39,570
you know what, and I bet I'm just
dividing you guys right now. 50, 50.

1054
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:44,430
There was some people right now going,
dude, that is the stupidest fucking,

1055
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,170
most moronic waste of Goddamn
money I've ever heard in my life.

1056
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,300
And then there's other people who

1057
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,920
either they get it or they'd
suffered the same sickness.

1058
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:58,650
I don't know how to categorize
it. I like, dude, that's the shit.

1059
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,940
I Dunno. It's ridiculous. And I'm like
geeking like I'm fucking site the Gulf.

1060
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:09,120
So you guys, we know what, why don't
you let me know next week, okay?

1061
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,330
And don't be on the fence. And I'll
be like, you know, I'm not into it,

1062
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:15,450
but if you're into it,
I want you to go one way or the other.

1063
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,050
I want you need to say, Bill, that's
the greatest shit ever. Defend that.

1064
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,440
I totally get what you're doing. Or just
call me the biggest douche bag ever.

1065
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:25,860
And I'll read out all the funniest
ones. I'll read next week. There you go.

1066
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,590
That's your homework
assignment for the week.

1067
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:33,120
So with that, let's, let's
get to some overrated,

1068
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:37,060
underrated stuff. Um,
all right, overrated. Uh,

1069
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:40,050
I got a new job in Everett Washington,

1070
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:43,890
so this past week I drove
cross country from Worcester,

1071
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,120
Massachusetts.

1072
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,870
I don't know if you've ever had the desire
when you were a kid in high school to

1073
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:52,740
drive across the country, but I can
honestly say I didn't really like it

1074
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:59,400
and it's hilarious to this guy saying
driving across the fucking country is

1075
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:04,200
overrated. Anyways. He says driving
west is a constant uphill battle.

1076
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,940
I had no idea.

1077
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,990
I figured once you were out
of the Appalachian mountains
that it would be flat.

1078
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,390
It is flat,
but not level.

1079
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:16,980
You are constantly driving up no matter
what going through the plains states

1080
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:17,814
suck too.

1081
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:22,200
I was driving through
somewhere in Minnesota at night
and I slammed into a deer

1082
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:27,180
standing in the road. My truck was tall
enough that it didn't get too fucked up,

1083
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:31,830
but still a wow. That's hilarious.
This guy, so you know what?

1084
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:36,120
I bet you'll never listen to those
American songs the same way you get,

1085
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:39,180
like they get annoyed when people sing.

1086
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:41,910
God bless America or what is the,

1087
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,420
what's the one for Purple
Mountain's majesty page?

1088
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,660
He's going to be like, yeah,
dude. Yeah, it fucking sucks.

1089
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,630
So are you from those corporations?
If you get it,

1090
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:58,830
here's one for you and you can look this
up. The same guy I looked up the uh,

1091
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,150
the microchip commercial,

1092
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,480
they actually got a machine now that
rather than digging into a mountain and

1093
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:10,640
they'd take the coal out, they
actually, it's as big as a school. They,

1094
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,510
I don't know how the fuck
they get it up there.

1095
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:16,950
They get it basically to the top of the
mountain and they just filed a mountain

1096
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,160
all the way down to the ground.

1097
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,910
I know that sounds crazy saying
you're out of your fucking mind.

1098
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,470
I saw it on 60 minutes.

1099
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:27,550
This wasn't one of those youtube or
Wikipedia crazy things that I've seen.

1100
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:32,680
So sir, with any luck corporations, we'll
get rid of all the fucking mountains.

1101
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,910
Can you imagine if they do that?

1102
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:41,911
Can you imagine the fucking hurricanes
that were going to have absolutely

1103
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:46,270
nothing to twisters? It's just
going to be a, I'm telling you,

1104
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,540
I really think the second half of my
life is going to be like a fucking will

1105
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:54,520
Smith movie. Except will's not going
to show up cause he's just an actor.

1106
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,930
All right. Underrated. Um, oh I
didn't even answer the question. Yeah,

1107
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:00,460
I've actually driven cross country.

1108
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,030
The first time I moved back from La
and I decided I wanted to get back into

1109
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:08,440
being a comedian because I wasn't ready
to be in la and I packed up all my shit

1110
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:13,441
and I drove from La to New York City
and a three and a half days if that,

1111
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:19,240
like three days I drove
like a fucking maniac.

1112
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:23,890
I drove like 16 hour days at 80
miles an hour, like a fucking maniac.

1113
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,510
No radar detector,

1114
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:30,670
La all the way into New Jersey
did not get pulled over.

1115
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:34,480
And I forget how I did this.
I was trying to go around some traffic.

1116
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:35,320
I did a fucked up,

1117
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:39,190
you turn and I got pulled over right
before the George Washington bridge

1118
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,880
and I'm thinking,
isn't this ironic?

1119
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:47,940
Maybe the police officer will share
in my seeing this as a comedic,

1120
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:51,400
ironic moment and he didn't give a fuck.

1121
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,220
It was one of those deals where he
was Dudley do, right. He was like,

1122
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:56,230
whatever you did was so douchey.

1123
01:06:56,231 --> 01:06:59,650
I'm not even gonna say anything other
than license and registration came up to

1124
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:02,410
window licensing, registration.
Oh, like, you know,

1125
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:05,560
this is me as I'm handing the stuff
to them. You know, it's amazing.

1126
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:08,920
I drove all the way from La and I did and
he just snatched it and walked back to

1127
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:13,390
his car and I was like, Alrighty then.
Yes, I'm getting a ticket. All right.

1128
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,920
Anyways, let's get to underrate
year. Underrated a good mechanics.

1129
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,660
There are a few shops
out there that give a,

1130
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,760
there are a few shops out there that give
the good guys the bad rep of few. No,

1131
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,220
there's a ton that's like me saying,
you know,

1132
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:33,310
there's a couple of comedians out
there that give comedians a bad name.

1133
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:37,930
Now there's a ton of us standing
on stage go and what's the deal?

1134
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,440
Men and women has this crazy,
yes.

1135
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,780
Smell your own farm and to do that,
look at this guy over here.

1136
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:51,150
He knows what I'm talking about.
Um, speaking of which, yeah,

1137
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,150
you know what a good honest mechanic is
underrated and actually found one out

1138
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:58,630
here. It's a good fucking guy.
Uh, what do we got a couple more?

1139
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,190
I'm actually speaking of farts.
Overrated. Your farts. Underrated.

1140
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:06,760
My farts. All right. A
little myopic, but I get it.

1141
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,420
I get it and want to say there
was something else for that.

1142
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:15,590
Oh, and he had a movie review bill.
Whatever you do, don't watch Cloverfield.

1143
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:21,020
Jj Abrams should be beaten for
this monster shit bomb. You know,

1144
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:25,730
I heard that movie sucked. I'm
going to steer clear of it. Um,

1145
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,970
all right. So when he was, let's
start wrapping this thing up here.

1146
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:29,810
That's the flats.

1147
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:33,290
You just spend like the inner
goddess Devita is a fucking podcast.

1148
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,670
Um, I do have to get to a
couple of things that people,

1149
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,000
last week I said Japanese ballplayers
are overrated and I want to,

1150
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:45,890
I want to retract that
statement. Um, I dunno,

1151
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:49,910
I just watched a couple of the guys that
the Yankees got in dice k for the red

1152
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:51,980
sox drives me fucking nuts.

1153
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,940
And it wasn't until game two,

1154
01:08:56,030 --> 01:09:01,030
I think was the game to know game
one of the devil race series that I,

1155
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:06,200
I understood the guy. It's
like I get this guy, he went,

1156
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:10,070
he loads up the faces
and there's nobody out.

1157
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,370
Then he has the other team
right where he wants them.

1158
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:17,120
He doesn't give a fuck until the
whole thing could go down the shitter.

1159
01:09:17,121 --> 01:09:21,470
So I actually was able to relax that
first game when I watched him pitch.

1160
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:24,320
So maybe I was a little bit
harsh and I think I was hard,

1161
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,200
harsh to white guys cause this guy says,

1162
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:30,500
your comment about white guys
can't play baseball pretty untrue.

1163
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,510
If I were to field an all
white baseball team, uh,

1164
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:39,200
that might give any all whatever,
all star team a run for their money,

1165
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:42,320
you know what,
that'd be a great fucking idea.

1166
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,550
It really would add to a lot of racism.
They should have the all Dominican team,

1167
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:51,390
first of all, Japanese team, you know,
or versus the all white team, whatever.

1168
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:55,880
You know what the winner of the all white
teams should all white versus the all

1169
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:56,671
Japanese team.

1170
01:09:56,671 --> 01:10:01,230
She played the ultimate and cut team and
each team is allowed to have two Puerto

1171
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,940
Ricans. Um, anyways, CNC, his,
his, uh, his is all white team.

1172
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,580
I'm not reading all these fucking names.
Lance Berkman,

1173
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:12,920
chase Utley chipper Jones,
chipper Jones like 98 years old.

1174
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:19,230
You can say next. Uh, who
the fuck was that? Ah, Geez.

1175
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,001
I just went blank.

1176
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:24,770
Who the fuck was the guy we used to
play center field for the Braves.

1177
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:30,200
Keep Thinking Darryl Dale Evans.
Dale Evans.

1178
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:33,740
Wasn't she fucking Cowgirl Bill Murphy?

1179
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,290
You're going to go back that far?
I'll wait. Josh Hamilton. Okay.

1180
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:44,090
That's a good one. Uh, might
be seen it right there, right?

1181
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:46,880
There's some guys. Yeah. Okay. I
mean there's no Manny Ramirez there.

1182
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,950
You know Josh Hamilton could be all
right. You're right. You're right.

1183
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:52,940
I was just trying to be funny.

1184
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:56,750
If you price going to defend
the white man anyways.

1185
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:01,940
Okay, let's go. What are we doing
here? What does the left anything? Oh,

1186
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:02,960
the op Ed piece.

1187
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:07,340
Last week some girl did some rant that
she can't find a good guy anymore.

1188
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,760
She's saying that all
guys were pussy fide.

1189
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:15,870
And is that because of rights and all that
type of shit? So here's your rebuttal,

1190
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:19,530
man. This guy has some advice
for you. For the woman who said,

1191
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:23,490
there's no good guys out there.
There's no good guys that you can find.

1192
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:28,890
They've all pussies. Whereof all
the real men gone. Okay. All right,

1193
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:29,701
so here,
first of all,

1194
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:34,350
he starts off with his explanation as to
why so many guys are pussies. He says,

1195
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:38,190
well, most guys are just trying to get
laid seriously. They will do anything.

1196
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:42,350
They are varying techniques for this.
Some work better than others. Um,

1197
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:47,490
first you have the manly men, a
men. This girl was talking about,

1198
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:50,190
they act like complete fucking assholes.

1199
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,160
They're abusive emotionally
and even physically.

1200
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:56,700
Sometimes girls fucking love asshole guys.

1201
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,291
Not all,

1202
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:02,340
but an overwhelming majority of the
female population population definitely

1203
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:07,341
gravitates towards these fucking Douche
bag men and the drama created by they're

1204
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:12,210
being assholes. I got to admit,
when I started being a Dick,

1205
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:16,950
I definitely, uh, did I get
more women? I just think I got,

1206
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,360
I got a higher quality woman
as far as looks anyways,

1207
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:25,320
but they all ended up being psychos.
Um, all right. There's another one.

1208
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:29,430
Most women like asshole guys because it
provides them with an infinite amount of

1209
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:32,100
bullshit to whine about.
Okay,

1210
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,060
I'll be getting some responses to
this also. They love the whole, Oh,

1211
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:39,960
you don't know him? Like I know him.
He's different when we're alone. Shit,

1212
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,450
that's fucking funny. Uh,
it makes them feel special.

1213
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,160
These guys know this and they get tons of
girls is fucking works. I got to admit,

1214
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,400
being an asshole doesn't work.
Not Literally being an Asshole,

1215
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,980
but if you just act like
you don't give a fuck,

1216
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:00,690
it gives him something to work at. I
can't even explain it. It's basically,

1217
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:02,700
I think I did that joke in my,
on my special,

1218
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:07,790
which is basically in the beginning
you actually know what to say,

1219
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:11,670
but your brain keeps saying, don't say
it because you don't want to offend him.

1220
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,470
It's when you shut that,

1221
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,630
that like sensor thing off
and you just start saying,

1222
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,200
you know what I mean? I give them with
the girl and you just want to fuck her,

1223
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,120
but you make the mistake of acting
like you like her. So now you've,

1224
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:31,080
you're taking her out to dinner and it's
like Ben never had to happen because

1225
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:34,590
believe it or not, some women you
know actually just want to fuck too.

1226
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:38,670
So if you kind of thrown out there and
all you want to do is fuck a lot of times

1227
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,920
that takes a lot of that bullshit away.

1228
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,650
So you stop acting like a nice
guy and they stopped backing.

1229
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,610
Like they don't want to jump on a
cock and a, you can have a good time

1230
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,590
anyway. You know what? I don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about this.

1231
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,200
I'm sitting in my car with the windows
up cause I don't want to wake the

1232
01:13:58,201 --> 01:14:01,680
neighbors here and it's starting
to get hot in here. So, uh,

1233
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:04,470
I don't really stand by anything
else that I saved the red.

1234
01:14:04,471 --> 01:14:07,710
Why don't I just read the rest of
the shit that this guy wrote without

1235
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:10,770
commenting on it? All right.
Second is a second group of people.

1236
01:14:10,771 --> 01:14:12,550
You have sensitive artsy guys.

1237
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:17,590
The guys that movies and television have
trained to be timid and understanding

1238
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:21,700
guys like this,
guys like this at first,

1239
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:24,110
but after a while becomes
thought that girl,

1240
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,890
sorry girls like the
sensitive guys at first,

1241
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:30,640
but after awhile it becomes boring and
this guy inevitably falls into the friend

1242
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:31,474
zone.

1243
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:35,470
The guy musters up the courage to tell
the girl how he feels and he gets the I

1244
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,410
really like you but just as a friend shit.

1245
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,600
Then he goes home and hangs himself.

1246
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:45,400
This strategy doesn't work as well
as the asshole method. All right.

1247
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:49,060
I guess this is a final one. Then there's
the guys were above the whole macho,

1248
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:54,010
territorial pissing shit and our email
pussies either these guys never get laid

1249
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:57,220
in high school because they usually don't
deal with these fucking stupid girls

1250
01:14:57,221 --> 01:15:02,221
that are gawking at the asshole
upperclassmen with cars and roid rage sky

1251
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:05,770
something has got some unresolved
high school issues. Um, anyways,

1252
01:15:05,771 --> 01:15:09,760
they go up to girls but
like idiots as themselves,

1253
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:12,790
they almost always get passed
over for asshole job guys,

1254
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,770
I dunno, basically wraps it up. So I don't
think this girl's looking hard enough.

1255
01:15:17,771 --> 01:15:19,480
There are macho assholes everywhere.

1256
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:23,080
It's the dominant strategy for getting
laid that I've noticed if she's looking

1257
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:27,310
for an actual relationship and doesn't
want to just get boned by tons of

1258
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:28,510
insensitive pricks,

1259
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,280
then maybe she should rethink what
she means by saying men are pussies.

1260
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:38,410
Well, there you go sweetheart. In your
face. What do you think about that?

1261
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,260
It is going to sit there
and not type something.

1262
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:46,900
I like both of those things because they
all touched on truth and they also were

1263
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:51,700
unbelievably generic and you also kind of
learned a little bit about both people,

1264
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:55,270
you know, and I think they both have
some anger towards the other sex,

1265
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,910
which I think is healthy.
You know what?

1266
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:01,000
I think I should arrange a meeting where
you guys can both get together and hate

1267
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:02,980
fuck each other.
What are you think about that?

1268
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:08,800
He's screaming at you different points
I think. I think that would be awesome.

1269
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:10,240
It just allow me to videotape it.

1270
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:14,830
I'll fucking squiggle out and he sort
of private parts and I'll do that black

1271
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:18,880
line across your eyes so no
one can recognize you. Like
on the ACBC dirty deeds,

1272
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:22,300
done dirt cheap album,
speaking of which,

1273
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:27,610
I'm going to see ACBC December
6th at the La Forum. Anybody else?

1274
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,600
Anybody else? Um, all right,

1275
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:35,320
what's that worth at? That
is a, you hear that beep.

1276
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:38,620
That means my car just started up and
that is the end of the Monday morning

1277
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:41,440
podcast. Sorry it took so long
for me to put it out there.

1278
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,100
I really try to get them
done in the morning cause I
know I'm on west coast time

1279
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,350
and uh,
and I really appreciate it.

1280
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:49,120
Everybody who listens to
these things every week,

1281
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:54,040
please keep the questions coming and
uh, and that, that isn't everybody.

1282
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:58,090
Have a good week as a congratulations
to the devil rays. Man.

1283
01:16:58,091 --> 01:17:01,960
You're up two games to one. You
bastard. You got a great fucking team.

1284
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:06,130
And uh, I dunno, I kinda like
all the teams that I left,

1285
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:10,910
I'm actually driving right now, which
is illegal out here. I actually,

1286
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,220
with my lights off on a fucking
moron. Okay. There we go.

1287
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:17,330
Actually like all the teams that I left,
I can't figure out who I want to,

1288
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,130
who I want to win
out in the West.

1289
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,790
I really liked the Dodgers because they
got a bunch of old red sox. No Ma, Manny,

1290
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:33,430
uh, Derek Lowe. And I
liked Joe Torry. You know,

1291
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,380
I hated the Yankees, you know, still
hate the Yankees, but you know,

1292
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:39,710
you got to respect Joe Torry and you've
got to admit the Dodgers and making the

1293
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:44,510
red sox and the Yankees looking a
little stupid, you know, red Sox,

1294
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:45,520
obviously getting rid of Manny's,

1295
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:48,290
he's too much to deal with and look
at the fuck he's doing out there.

1296
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:53,210
And then what's the ama pain is
fucking salary. Jesus Christ.

1297
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:58,340
But then you got, what's his face?
Uh, Joe Torry, the Yankees were like,

1298
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,700
you know what, we're so sick of going
to the playoffs for the love of God.

1299
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:06,020
We need to take a year off
from the playoffs, so we're
going to get rid of you.

1300
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,050
And, uh, what's the name of the Dodgers?

1301
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,700
Because they haven't been there in while
and then the Phillies, I don't know. I,

1302
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:18,170
uh, I like the Phillies. I liked
that team. I liked the new stadium.

1303
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,020
And I know everybody talks
about that youtube video.

1304
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:25,790
I could really give a shit about Philly,
like I don't hate them or whatever. But,

1305
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:30,350
uh, I dunno. I Dunno.

1306
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,660
You know what?
I think I might want to see the Dodgers.

1307
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,350
I wouldn't mind if the Dodgers,
the Dodgers were playing the Red Sox,

1308
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:41,600
then I'll root for the Dodgers.
All right. That's it. That's it.

1309
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:44,310
So right now my red sox is still in
until I got to root for the Phillies.

1310
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:47,240
They are thrown down. All right.
And not being wishy washy.

1311
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:50,510
I'm rooting for the fucking fillies.
And uh,

1312
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,320
obviously the red sox, but I can't get
mad at the devil rays. You got to love it.

1313
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,290
Not spending money.
Got All these fucking stuff's coming up.

1314
01:18:57,291 --> 01:19:01,010
They're kicking the shit out
of a pitching. But, uh, oh,

1315
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:04,490
and I want to thank everybody who's
trashing my patriots right now. You know,

1316
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,900
you punch your pussies. How we come
in, they're limping into your town.

1317
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:12,170
Everybody's injured, and now
you're going to talk all your shit.

1318
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:17,740
You bunch of fags, you know what
I mean? I'll tell, you know,

1319
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,950
my favorite team is for fucking talking
shit has to be the San Diego chargers.

1320
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:25,910
I've never seen a team
celebrate more than they do.

1321
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:29,630
You would think that they had actually
won a championship rather than they just

1322
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:33,380
want a regular fees and game in the
middle of October. Those mother fuckers,

1323
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,510
they gain like they stopped a guy for
a four yard gain on first down and they

1324
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:39,800
all start line dancing.

1325
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:44,990
Remember that a couple of years ago
when the Patriots beat him again in the

1326
01:19:44,991 --> 01:19:45,824
playoffs

1327
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:52,170
and they all did Shawne Merriman
dance right there on the 50 yard line.

1328
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,420
Remember that? And then lt got all upset
saying that we didn't have any class.

1329
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,220
I could just made no sense to me.

1330
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:03,170
It's like really your guy has been doing
that the entire game he's getting in

1331
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:07,650
everybody's face. Every time he makes
a play, he's doing that stupid, uh,

1332
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,000
started motorcycle dance that
he does live by the sword,

1333
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:15,720
die by the sword. You're going to be a
con. People going to be a cunt to you.

1334
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,770
And now,
look this week we come limping into town.

1335
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,500
They kicked the shit out of us to
look at lt at the end of the game.

1336
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:26,340
He's all smiling. Hey, good game, good
game. Slapping everybody on the ass.

1337
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,700
He's got no problem with all the
dancing at his teammates were doing.

1338
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,180
I'm telling you, I don't
like that. I don't like that.

1339
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:38,790
You know what I mean? That's uh, that's
really annoying. And you know what?

1340
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:42,990
I think it starts with the coach.
My really talking shit to LTE right now.

1341
01:20:42,991 --> 01:20:46,230
Like you can't kick the shit out of me
or that he even listens to this fucking

1342
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:50,310
podcast. Um, I dunno.

1343
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,080
I was still sticking by it. The
Patriots are going to win the AFC east.

1344
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:57,720
Go Fuck Yourself. I'm not reading any
of the emails to trash me all you want.

1345
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:01,800
They're going to win it. All right.
That's it. That's it for the podcast.

1346
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:05,010
I'm going to go buy some fucking Cheerios,
have a good week everybody.

1347
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,110
And uh,

1348
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:10,210
and that's it. Keep the questions
coming. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

1349
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,700
I felt my heart

1350
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:46,850
light.
I expanded.

1351
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,000
It was just the shadows.

1352
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:57,440
Then a voice spoke in mine.
She said,

1353
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:03,540
dark is not
the APPS.
