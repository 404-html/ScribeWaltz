1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,240
Hey, what's going on is Phil Burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:06,300
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,890
Just checking in on you. Just
checking in, seeing how you're doing,

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:15,860
seeing how your week's going.
Right out of the break out of the gate.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,030
I got to plug something from my best
friend in the world. Paul Versey,

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,900
the pride of Trenton,
New Jersey.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,900
Oh, the the fucking tulip in
the garden at the garden state.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,713
Paul Versey.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,640
It's going to be playing the Gotham
Comedy Club in New York City this Friday,

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,060
eight and 10:00 PM shows and this
Saturday eight and 10:00 PM shows.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,770
That's August 10th and August 11th best
friend in the world with the best club

12
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:56,760
owners in the business. The
[inaudible], the [inaudible] brothers,

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,510
straight shooters.
My whole career,

14
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:03,840
they always gave it to me straight
right from the very beginning. Bill,

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,010
you're not funny. Find
another career. Okay.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,700
Stop bugging us for spots.
Always was straight shooters.

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,410
MMM.

18
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,220
You know, it's funny, he's actually
in Scarface. They actually,

19
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:21,740
that the first pass or that
first cut of that movie, uh,

20
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,880
he actually said the fuzzily brothers.
Hey,

21
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,760
fucked a fucking miss. Ellie brothers,
right. And then they're like, Nah,

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,580
it's got a sound.
It's got a soul sound more Latino.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,610
And it was a bunch of white guys
standing around and they were like a ds.

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,330
[inaudible] hey, it's still it.
It's fucking throw that in there.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,750
Um, speaking of things Latin that
white people don't understand, uh,

26
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,350
what the fuck is going
on over at Taco Bell?

27
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,390
Okay.

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,390
Can somebody explain to me how in such
a sensitive day and age where people are

29
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,171
just,
you know,

30
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:04,171
having to apologize and over any little
fucking thing how they advertise on TV,

31
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,170
that they're bastardized version
of Latin, Latin? Probably the,

32
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:12,880
fuck you supposed to say it.
Latino cuisine. What is God?

33
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:15,700
What is that fucking incest you with?
Shit that they keep,

34
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,660
but every time you think they can't
get us one of their sandwiches,

35
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:24,270
the fuck another sandwich should make a
new sandwich. They somehow do it. They,

36
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,360
they, they'll fucking than pay first.
They just had tacos. They had Burritos,

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,460
they had case studies,

38
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,980
which I don't even know if case of d
is that they even have those in Mexico.

39
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:33,814
I don't know.

40
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,230
I'm just a white guy who grew up in
white schools listening to white history.

41
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,023
Right.

42
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,070
They never took my entire time at school.
They never,

43
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,600
they didn't even bring up Mexico,

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,180
I think it was the Spanish American war.
They would bring up.

45
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:54,420
We thought it was in fucking Mexico
and evidently was in the South Pacific.

46
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,820
We didn't fucking know all, they'd all I
history every year started the same day.

47
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:03,780
It started with the fucking pilgrims
coming over on the May slow up

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,750
the Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria, and
I don't know who was made flower. Was,

49
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:10,340
was that the,

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,340
the fucking Pete Best of the ships
there or was that the Diana Ross?

51
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:20,560
I have no fucking idea. All right.
And then there was that other guy, uh,

52
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,480
Jones or some shit. He's settled
down there and, uh, Virginia,

53
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,580
if I remember correctly, he
settled down to Virginia. Right.

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,680
The fuck is going on with my mix it here,
I don't know.

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,500
And he started banging that, a
native American check, right.

56
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:41,310
He got a fucking Mohawk, got some
moccasins, started using a bone arrow,

57
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,340
and then they suddenly stay, stay, stay.

58
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,270
Tried to say that the native
Americans killed them.

59
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,023
Right?

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,480
I guess cause they didn't like a bang
one of their women. But you know,

61
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,460
I bet I actually think it
might've been the white people.

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,700
They came over and they thought he was
a sell out. They're like, hey dude,

63
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,290
how come you don't have about

64
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,180
buckle on your hat?
You know,

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,710
how come your gun isn't flaring
out like Elmer Fudds at the end?

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,153
You know,

67
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,090
why is your girlfriend got such
a wonderful, beautiful tan there?

68
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,390
And then they took them out and then
he blamed it on the native Americans.

69
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,470
And then they said that,
you know,

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,650
they were standing their
ground and they wiped them out.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,440
And then afterwards they
all moved to Florida

72
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,820
and they fucked each other. Incestuously
just like the food at Taco Bell.

73
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,230
And that's why you now to this day you
have to stand your ground fucking bro.

74
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,630
You know, I finally saw the footage of
that latest stand your ground thing. I,

75
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,500
I just, I don't fucking understand
how anybody can't say that.

76
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:42,550
That's just fucking murder.
Second Degree fucking murder.

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,700
But I, I, you know, you watched this
guy will get acquitted. Two things.

78
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,530
I'm always wrong on the stand.
Your ground footage and,

79
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,860
and the,
did he or did he not make a football move?

80
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,630
I never get those. Right. I'm like,
that's a fucking touchdown there.

81
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,660
After further up the hill,
you know,

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,170
that's murder after further ideal.

83
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,020
Yeah.

84
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060
The white guy was,
was

85
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,770
clearly felt threatened as
the black guy was walking away

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,490
through this latest one. Right? This,
this, this guy, right? Black Dude.

87
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,120
What is his wife or girlfriend? I think
there was a kid in the car. Not sure.

88
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:32,530
Right. They pull in the park in a
handicap spot. So the white dude,

89
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,380
like the pussy that he is weights to,

90
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:40,030
the guy goes in the store and then starts
yelling at this guy's girlfriend or

91
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:44,740
wife. The guy comes walking out,
the guy's yelling at his wife.

92
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,600
So he goes over and he pushes him down
like a big brother sticking up for his

93
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,231
little sister.

94
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,560
He pushed him down like they're on the
playground and this fucking asshole

95
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,410
pulls out a gun.

96
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,620
Like this guy standing over him with an
ax or something and the guy literally

97
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,920
starts to turn to walk away and he sees
him take out the gun and he turns and

98
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:07,850
looks back at him like, what the fuck?
And the guy shoots him in cold blood

99
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,460
Coldplay.
I guarantee you he's going to get off.

100
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,750
He will get off fucking unreal.
It's unreal.

101
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,650
But that's what happens.

102
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,820
That's what happens when you
have a bunch of people fucking,

103
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,883
you know,

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,090
in the same puddle the way that they're
doing with the food over there and Taco

105
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,923
Bell.

106
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,740
How do they get away with it?

107
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,160
All this shit about appropriating
culture and everything and they just,

108
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,210
they just, I don't know. I
think they've just gone so fuck.

109
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,800
It's like the island of Doctor
Moreau meets Mexican food.

110
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,990
It's kind of like Hanna Barbera too,
where they just,

111
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,780
they only had like two or three ideas
that somehow they spun it into like 40

112
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:56,130
different cartoons. All right.
We got an idea for a cartoon.

113
00:06:56,131 --> 00:07:00,030
You ever seen the honeymooners? Yeah.
It's that acceptance in the stone age.

114
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,270
It's called the Flintstones.
Oh, we love it. We love it.

115
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,850
You got any more ideas?
Yeah.

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,020
You know the honeymooners that we
stuck in the stone age and it was the

117
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:14,430
Flintstones now would stick it in the
future. It's called the Jetsons. Oh yeah.

118
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,390
You got any more shows I
had. It's a fucking, uh,

119
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,500
is a bear.

120
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,163
I Dunno.

121
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Then this one is, was a lying there. All
the animals. This one's a fucking, hey,

122
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,380
there's always going to be one tall,
one on one short one.

123
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,980
I think the high watermark
was jinxed the cat.

124
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
All right.
Um,

125
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,570
I like chunks of cash. He was, he was
real. He was, she was fucking cool. Yeah.

126
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,850
Like a,
what'd she scram Outta here?

127
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm sorry. I literally doing a jinx.
The cat impression. Well, what do you,

128
00:07:56,561 --> 00:08:00,910
what do you want from me? Huh?
What do you want from me up?

129
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:05,350
Just a white guy, man. All the
doors swing wide open for me. Um,

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,230
I watched an episode of Max the other day.
I'm loving me TV.

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,370
I'm loving it.
You know,

132
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,370
it's just TV shows. There's
commercials, there's a schedule.

133
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,500
It's how I used to watch TV.
Okay. There's, there's auto shape,

134
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:28,390
old white guys chasing
down people half their age,

135
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,990
rolling over hoods of
cars. It's just like, yeah,

136
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,240
there's a live band that played the
soundtrack. I mean, it's just, it's,

137
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm doing, what I shouldn't
be doing right now is I'm,

138
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm turning the wagon around and I'm
going back to where I fucking was and I

139
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:48,530
will quickly become irrelevant, but
I, I can't, I can't lay off me TV.

140
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,420
I watched this episode of Mannix,
right?

141
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,250
He drives a dodge dart,
like the fucking

142
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,490
gt version of some shit.
I never even heard of that car.

143
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,570
You always had to have the cool car,
right? He's a loner. He's not married,

144
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,320
they're always loaners.

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,060
Zoe's not married that way they can
get laid in every fucking, every shelf.

146
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,930
Okay.

147
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,860
Told this. The show is just totally
designed for unhappily married guys,

148
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,610
right? Like, why did I get married?

149
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,360
I should've stayed single
it fucking solve crime.

150
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Driving around in a cool car and just
fucking banging somebody different 34

151
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,930
times a year. That's basically
how many episodes they did. Right?

152
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:35,700
So I'm watching Mannix and this episode,
well,

153
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,650
this hit hitman in a fucking phone
booth and he's talking about a murder.

154
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:42,080
He just committed and this
woman's staring at him.

155
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,190
Then she starts staring at his
lips and shit. Right? And I'm like,

156
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:51,020
what the fuck is this? Right? It turns
out she's deaf. What? She's deaf, sorry.

157
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,160
Easy joke. Um, so she knows what's up.

158
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,100
So they go to the cops. The cops don't
let, what's the guy look like? What?

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,480
Get out of here. You Deaf Lady, right?
They don't listen to her, but man,

160
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:08,270
x happens to be walking by.
He's a private,

161
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,370
I don't know what he's
doing down at the fucking

162
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,810
at the police station. Maybe he's
down there fucking, you know,

163
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,480
trying to get some work, you know, get a
couple of fucking free donuts and coffee.

164
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,700
I don't know why he's down there,
but he was down there.

165
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,880
He was fucking down there.
Right.

166
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,210
So,
um,

167
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,400
he just, what he sees them yelling to
the chick and he's just like, hey man,

168
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,630
you know, uh, that's an interesting story.
I think I can help you out with that.

169
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:40,831
You know,

170
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:44,220
cause she was like so surprised that she
sought you so upset she couldn't really

171
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,270
give them any details.

172
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,330
So many x because he's Mannix because
he's a loner because he has no woman in

173
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,350
his life that he has to answer to.

174
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,510
He actually has the fucking time spur
of the moment to take on this fucking

175
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,710
case.
Right.

176
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,470
And what's funny is I just like,

177
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,280
who the fuck was paying him the whole
episode? He did, he did the, he did it.

178
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,720
Was it pro bono? Was that free?
Is that the right to expression d?

179
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,803
Okay,

180
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,530
you don't, they will go down to report a
fucking crime. They weren't saying, Hey,

181
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:19,930
help solve this fucking crime.
He takes it on.

182
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,600
So they cut to the next scene and
he's still, the deaf woman is,

183
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:28,780
is freaking out because Manix
is yelling at her, go, come on.

184
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:31,490
You've got to remember, we've got to
look through this again. Right. And,

185
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,780
and her friend is going, Jesus
Christ, dude, take it easy. He goes,

186
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,750
it's a woman's life at stake.
And the deaf lady,

187
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,780
she's fucking hold her head and shit.

188
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,230
He basically just verbally abuses or
until she can fucking remember what this

189
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:49,590
guy looks like at a inch.
It kind of goes from there.

190
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,040
And I dunno,
I don't even want,

191
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm talking about the shit. I'm
just saying, you got to watch me TV.

192
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,170
It's fucking tremendous. It's fucking
Fermentis especially, you know,

193
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,190
you go on all these other shows and it's
like 2018 and then you just turn the

194
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,970
fucking channel and it goes back.
Then I swear to God,

195
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,930
the way they treated women back then,
the parts that they gave them,

196
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:18,310
the way that they talk to
them, their idea, like,

197
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,600
like the women would walk in and
they will nothing but sex objects.

198
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,880
Every fucking woman right comes in and
they just start playing a saxophone.

199
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
Trying to think what they play for.

200
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,200
The deaf woman probably played
like a muted trumpet or something,

201
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:41,370
but still they played it in a sexy way.
Um,

202
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,590
I don't know what I'm talking.
Well, how about those Red Sox,

203
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:46,770
MP Buddy dropping 20 runs,

204
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,950
10 a night on the Toronto Blue Jays.
Like Getty Lee.

205
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:55,200
You liking that shit? Huh?
I'll never forgive that guy.

206
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,560
I remember reading an interview when
he was at a blue jays game and he was

207
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,590
fucking make it fun. Are Red Sox
fans? They were up there, you know,

208
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,340
I'll never forget that. I was
just like, oh, okay. Getty.

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,260
That's how you want to play it.
Huh?

210
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,290
With your fucking 12 string bass guitar
and your songs about space or whatever

211
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,700
the fuck you talking about up there.

212
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,873
MMM.

213
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Honestly I have legit
like a sports dislike.

214
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:28,300
Not An, I'm not an not an honest dislike,
you know? But if I ever met the guy,

215
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:32,920
I would definitely bring
it up. Um, because I am a,

216
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:37,360
I'm childless anyways.
Red Sox keep winning.

217
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,920
Yankee suggest one to,
you know,

218
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:41,020
all the Yankee fans had their
fucking head in the oven.

219
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,020
Then all of a sudden what happens
to get a new picture? He goes up,

220
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:47,430
he strikes fucking everybody out and
then the next night you're the guy you

221
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,440
bought from the fucking Marlin's
was opposite field for a grand slam.

222
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,583
You know,

223
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,780
I was checking out our fucking
schedule, man. I can't wait.

224
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:01,970
I cannot wait for that
fucking astro series.

225
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,660
I can't believe how excited I am about
baseball. I don't know what happened.

226
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,370
I had given up on the,
I know it happened,

227
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:10,730
all the fucking steroids I gave
up on it. I was just like, look,

228
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,670
either legalize them or
get them out of the game.

229
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Stop having me get excited for shit that
you're going to then tell me a fucking

230
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,900
five years later that
it didn't really count,

231
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,600
you know?
Um,

232
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,720
anyway, so excited state Indian series.
Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait. And then,

233
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,180
and to sit here and be this far ahead
of the Yankees knowing that it means

234
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:38,000
absolutely nothing because
of the wild card is just,

235
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,060
it's just such a wonderful feeling,
you know,

236
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,960
knowing that you're counting
down days that mean nothing.

237
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,820
What's your magic number?
Uh,

238
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,160
17 more games plus four
games in the playoffs.

239
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,950
They ruin it. Fucking
greedy. Cons ruined it.

240
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,463
MMM.

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,370
You know, back in the day, I've told
you this before, back in the day,

242
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,250
if you had the best record in the American
league that was winning the pennant,

243
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,790
there was no playoffs to win the pennant.
It was the regular season.

244
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,800
And then you immediately
went to the world series.

245
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,540
So what you had to do was you
had had the best record and they,

246
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,530
and all they had was like, there wasn't
division. So it was just, you know,

247
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:34,660
like eight teams in this division,
eight teams in that division or what and,

248
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:38,390
and that, uh, sorry, not
division. Um, in that league,

249
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,770
like eight teams in the American League,

250
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,670
eight teams in the National League and
whoever the top guys were at the end of

251
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,160
the season, you, you won the pennant
and you went to the world series.

252
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,890
So that's why like,

253
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,000
no one's ever gonna win the way the
Yankees won way back then. First of all,

254
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,980
there's no way you're gonna,
you're gonna fucking,

255
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,280
someone's going to be dumb enough to sell.
You're babe Ruth then.

256
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,920
Then you're going to draft Lou Gehrig,
Mickey Mantle,

257
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,020
a Joe Dimaggio writing a fucking row.
Um,

258
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,790
and then you go to the playoffs.

259
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,610
You only have to win four games
and you got the fucking title.

260
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,140
You know what I mean?
But it,

261
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,980
but I'm not just shitting on the Yankees
cause I know like, uh, back in the day,

262
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,440
um,
in hockey,

263
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,520
all he had to do was you had to win eight.
You had went to playoff series.

264
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,150
Now you have to win twice as many unsure
when the Celtics are winning all of

265
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:26,520
theirs.

266
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,520
I can't imagine you had to play any
more than one or two rounds of 'em

267
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,820
Oh uh, playoffs. Playoffs. That's
actually interesting. Let me see.

268
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:42,000
Nine team,
50 ml,

269
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,190
be steady things,

270
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,320
the standings, this standings. All right,

271
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:55,760
so here it was all right. 1950.

272
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,320
There was one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Just like a guest.

273
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,630
All right. The Yankees, of
course one that won the pennant,

274
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,460
one had the best record, won the
pennant. Tigers were three games back.

275
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,380
Red Sox were for the Indians were six.
And that's the top four.

276
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,260
And then the bottom for this works out
mathematically cause you didn't have

277
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:21,800
inner league play.
The twins were 31 games out.

278
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:24,830
The white sox were 38.
The Orioles were 40.

279
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,360
And the probably Philadelphia
athletics at that time.

280
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,000
We're uh,

281
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,100
46 games up. If not, maybe they weren't
Kansas City at that point, and then,

282
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,250
and the national league,
the Phillies were in first place,

283
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:47,180
then the Dodgers, then the giants,
then the Braves, cardinals, the reds,

284
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:49,740
the cubs and the pirates.
That's it.

285
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,550
So then the Phillies in the Yankees played
for the world series and we all know

286
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,520
fucking one that right.
All right, let's go.

287
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,160
1962

288
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,790
NBA stand day eggs,

289
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,970
the IBA standings.

290
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,450
Okay.

291
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,990
All right.
What do we got here?

292
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,923
Yeah,
there was,

293
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,330
there was, there was, they call them
divisions. There was western divisions.

294
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,950
There was 19.
So the Lakers,

295
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,240
well they Minneapolis, then I think
now they, they moved to la by that.

296
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,560
Then there was the kings who
I believe back then were the,

297
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,223
the

298
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,820
Rochester royals

299
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,570
that became the Cincinnati royals

300
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,780
and then they became the Sacramento Kings,
I think.

301
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,960
What are the royals become? The San Diego
Clippers that became the La Clippers.

302
00:18:56,961 --> 00:19:00,650
I always forget that. Anyways, the Detroit
Pistons, Atlanta Hops, St Louis Hawks,

303
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:01,170
sorry.

304
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,650
They might've been in Atlanta at that
point. And then the Washington Wizards,

305
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,890
which really looked bullets. That's weird.
They were on that long. I had no idea.

306
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,480
And then in the eastern division,
it was the Celtics,

307
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,420
uh,

308
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,500
the San Francisco Warriors,
the 70 sixers in the Knicks,

309
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:18,700
31 games out.

310
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,413
MMM.

311
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,180
Yeah. So that's it. So you just, yeah,

312
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:26,860
I guess you just won and then you play
four games to see who was the champion

313
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,100
stuff. That's something that people don't
fucking bring up a lot. They always go,

314
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:33,670
oh, there's a bunch of fucking white
guys from the YMC a fair enough.

315
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,460
Fair enough. But also you didn't have to
win 20 rounds of the fucking playoffs.

316
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,850
And the only reason why they
have all these rounds now is, uh,

317
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,510
well mostly for money. But
you know, in all fairness,

318
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,210
when there's only nine fucking teams,
I mean,

319
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:52,360
do you really need to also make
the playoffs if you came in second?

320
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,253
MMM.

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,920
I know they just kind of made a lot of
the regular season null and void and a

322
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:04,420
lot of these sports, why am I not getting
any fucking volume here? I just seen it.

323
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,070
I hope this isn't too quiet again.

324
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,670
Okay.

325
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,470
You know, I think I'm gonna have
to break down and actually get it.

326
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,660
God didn't produce on this fucking thing,
you know, and then what do I do then?

327
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,620
What I do and I got somebody
else I got to fucking talk to.

328
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,110
That's not what I want to do. Um,
all right, let's, let's back up here.

329
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,690
All right, let's read a little advertising
hymns. Everybody. Here's a problem.

330
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,490
66% of men lose their hair by age 35.
Hey man,

331
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:31,780
that's offensive

332
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,440
thing is when you start to
notice hair loss, it's too late.

333
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,960
Uh, well shit, where the fuck
was that when I needed it? Easy.

334
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,800
It's easier to keep the hair you have
then to replace the hair you've lost.

335
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,770
Is that hairline slowly starting
to move backward, backwards.

336
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,150
Any bald spots yet?

337
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,200
How will you feel a year from now
if it's business as usual up there?

338
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Why do you guys turn to weird solutions
or do nothing when they can turn to a

339
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:06,160
medicine and science?
You know, I'm really,

340
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,930
what do you mean weird solutions?
Like what?

341
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:12,310
Just fucking aging naturally shaving
your head and all of a sudden everybody

342
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,810
thinks you know Jujitsu or possibly you
have a fatal disease, right? Either way,

343
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,700
you know people are clearing a path.

344
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,770
What hymns does is connect you with real
doctors and medical grade solutions to

345
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:24,610
treat hair loss,

346
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,750
well known generic equivalents to name
brand prescriptions to help you keep your

347
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:32,680
hair. No snake oil pills or gas
station counters. Supplements,

348
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,390
prescription solutions backed by science.
No waiting room,

349
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,890
no awkward doctor visits.

350
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:43,891
Save hours by going to four hymns for
h I m s for him.com answer a few quick

351
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:46,714
questions.

352
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Doctor will review and
prescribe you products or
shipping or shipped directly to

353
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:53,200
your doctor.

354
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,960
I always feel like those guys when they
ask questions about hair loss is the

355
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,510
first thing that has how
much hair is on your back

356
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,710
so they can guess how quickly
you're going to lose your hair.

357
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,410
Cause those hairy mother fuckers,
they lose it.

358
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:09,340
Like you know those kids who can grow
a beard and like fucking junior high.

359
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,800
The second puberty's ended.
All of a sudden,

360
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,390
you know, they start looking
like, like, I dunno, I dunno.

361
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:20,170
Fix somebody picked somebody
that Bill Murray or something.

362
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,901
All right,
order.

363

366
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,640

time that was a, there was a typo.

371
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,840
That wasn't my fault. Somebody

372

Postmates when you want food but
don't want to get up your Ras.

There's Postmates, they're

00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,640
restaurants don't deliver
the Postmates got them,

412

but they'll go down and pick it
up for you. Bring it over to you.

in love with outside of the razor and

439
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,780
why? I guess that's for me, right?

440
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,010
I'm allegedly getting the one wipe

445
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,220
Evidently according to the copy,

446
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:45,360
I am a big fan of their amber and
Labrador calming body cleanser.

447
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,260
Okay.

448
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,830
I want to use that.
Put it right on my fucking head.

449
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,620
Never smelled anything like
it for just five bucks. Yeah.

450
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,910
Can get their daily essential status set.

451
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,430
It comes with the body cleanser one way.

452
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,750
Chari they're amazing,
but wipes,

butter and their best razor.

Sure. You're wondering why.

455
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,880
I'll ask you to be here today.

456
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,430
Keep the blades coming for a couple of
bucks more a month and add in shampoo,

457
00:28:21,431 --> 00:28:24,100
toothpaste, or anything else
you need for the bathroom.

458
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,550
Check it all out of dollar
shave club.com/burr.

459
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,560
That's dollar shave club.com/ [inaudible].
All right.

460
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,100
Can I talk about everything
I wanted to talk about?

461
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,380
Um,
I think that's it.

462
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,210
Football season,
starting up.

463
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,380
Oh, you know what I've got, I always
in the morning, my job is, I get,

464
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,420
I get my daughter out of bed. Right? You
got a whole little ritual. I carry over.

465
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,190
I let her turn on the light,
you know,

466
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,760
let it turn off the light when we
leave the room and all of that stuff.

467
00:28:58,761 --> 00:29:01,270
And then whenever I bring up neat,
my wife always stays in bed.

468
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,123
You know what I mean?

469
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,820
Um, I'm really learning. I'm
learning how to, how to get along.

470
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,420
I'm telling you, it's, it's actually,

471
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:16,290
it's not that hard to get
along with your class.

472
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,790
This is what she got to do.
All right? In the morning.

473
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,133
All right?

474
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,460
You just snuggle up behind them.

475
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,731
I know this is sounding,

476
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:33,680
it's going to be weird and all you
do just caress him a little bit.

477
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,690
Five minutes, you do that
five fucking minutes, right?

478
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,980
The second you start
doing it, they go, oh,

479
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,420
and you just fucking do that.
Keeps him in a good mood.

480
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,990
All right? But you know,
starts to that, that'll get,

481
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:54,110
that'll give you peace until
about 11:00 AM positive.

482
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,550
You get up and you make the breakfast
[inaudible] you feed your kid, right?

483
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:59,980
You're sitting there like fucking,
I always feel like Joe Pesci in casino.

484
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,900
You know, cause I'm sitting here being
a sweetheart, I'm totally calm, relax,

485
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,950
you know, totally enamored with my
beautiful daughter, right? And I,

486
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:13,210
and up in my head I'm like, I'm a
piece of shit, right? So I always,

487
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,590
I always have like that fucking,
I'm a lunatic, right? So anyways,

488
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,550
but here's the thing though,

489
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,960
and this isn't just a woman that just
people in general, they get used to shit.

490
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,450
So you can't do it every day,

491
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,393
all right?

492
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,530
But you got to do some version
of that, okay. Just to,

493
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,040
just to fucking, you know,
they're like rescue dog. She just,

494
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,590
you want to keep them calm.
You want to keep the ears down,

495
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,910
keep the fucking ears down.
All right.

496
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,840
You're going to be good until
about 11 in the morning. All right.

497
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,230
And I ran around 11 in the
morning. They're, they're
starting to read their texts.

498
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,190
They got a couple of phone calls
they can get crazy. So your job is,

499
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:59,030
you have to get out of the
fucking house before that happens.

500
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,083
Okay.

501
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,140
And this is another thing that I learned.
Okay.

502
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,620
When then bitching,
just shut the fuck up and listen.

503
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,880
Every once in a while you
have to make a noise or else,

504
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:16,040
then they get weirded out.
They'll just be like, oh,

505
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,820
I feel like it just like just
staring at me and judging me.

506
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,890
And then you got to keep your voice
down that you can't be like damn fucking

507
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:29,120
listen to you. You can't do that. Cause
then it's a fighter. You can't do that.

508
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,690
You know you're going to want to do that
because for the last 42 minutes you had

509
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:36,410
the solution.

510
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,440
You had the logical solution to whatever
the fuck they were talking about,

511
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,180
but you can't,
you know that that was the old me.

512
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,150
I would just break eight seconds
in. I would just be going, what?

513
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,530
Then don't be friends with her. Don't
pay well, tell him to fuck off. Yeah.

514
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,540
Just stopped hanging out with her and I,
you just can't do that.

515
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,020
You just have to fucking,
you just have to sit there.

516
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,813
Right.

517
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,780
You know what Song I,
you know when the,

518
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,180
when they're in one of those things
where they're just going to go for 40

519
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:09,050
fucking minutes.

520
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,360
Okay.

521
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,290
Is I just think of that
white stripes song,

522
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,693
uh,

523
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,860
Flight Paradis,
you know,

524
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,960
and I just had that fucking
playing in a loop in my head.

525
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,510
Not even the part where he sings,

526
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,760
it's just the guitar while Jane Blue,

527
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,280
it's like haunting and calming
all at the same fucking time.

528
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:38,610
And every once in a while I
just go like, wow, that's,

529
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,850
that's terrible. Then what
happened? And you just,

530
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,670
you just fucking stay in the pocket. If
you can do that, I'm telling you, you,

531
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
you're going to immediately,

532
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,910
40% of your fights are going to go out
the fucking window. Now that other 60%,

533
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,560
I don't know how much I
can whittle that down,

534
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:58,310
but I am telling you guys right now,
I am 40% happier just doing that.

535
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,280
Yeah,

536
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,290
they're rescue dogs.
Remember that you, you know,

537
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,140
you have no idea what the fuck
happened to him before you got it.

538
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,410
Okay.

539
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,410
Okay. So you've got to figure out
what the fuck makes them tick.

540
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,450
Okay. Cause if you don't, they're going
to be, they're going to be on your neck.

541
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,970
Thank you guys so much for listening and
as I want to especially thank anybody

542
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:27,290
who took anything I said on this podcast.
Seriously, um, have a great weekend yet.

543

544
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,690
Um, Oh, you know what? I
talked to [inaudible] who is
going to be headlining the,

545
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,200
the puppy down there and fucking go see
a guy who's played every fucking Romy

546
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:44,560
had to, to get that Goddamn
Gig. A guy who didn't need it.

547
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:48,550
He didn't take any fucking
shortcuts or yard day.

548
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,913
Go down there

549
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,370
and go see my buddy. Do some comedy. All
right. If he can't, I would appreciate it.

550
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,920
All right. And uh, that's it.

551
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,560
I think the giants have their
first preseason game tonight.

552
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,430
I also heard that football's back at
the boys. A bad gay down. Yay. Yay.

553
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,840
All right.

554
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,520
Listen to the music and enjoy a a
bonus half hour by Thursday afternoon,

555
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:14,560
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast,

556
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,670
a classic episode from a Thursday from,
I dunno,

557
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,880
years ago or maybe a couple of weeks
ago. I don't, I don't know how it works.

558
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,053
See you on Monday.

559
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,870
Market share. I got Sharine Sharon,
Sharon. I'll look on the topic.

560
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,280
Like he had a picture of the car and
Bobby was a readiness. They were all,

561
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:49,150
my mother was dying and they
were doing Tommy plays piano,

562
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:52,260
like a kid out in the of
any logs and login palace.

563
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,670
He was dancing with the train.

564
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,740
They were all in love with dye and they
were drinking from that was more like a

565
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,580
app

566
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,413
calming down,

567
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,373
Hi,

568
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,713
my flight

569
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,160
Los Angeles in the Logan
Airport. Everything's going,
everything's going fine.

570
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,890
Right. We take off from a lax. Yeah.

571
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,940
When you look down to the left,

572
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:42,510
you see that little fucking barrier where
Marine Del Rey is where Bravo airspace

573
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,123
is.

574
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:48,100
You know the helicopters go 150 feet off
the fucking surface to transition the

575
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,020
bravo airspace. We're fucking up
and over those cuts. We Bang a left,

576
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,580
we're climbing up. You know, going
back over Hollywood was so high up.

577
00:35:56,581 --> 00:36:00,540
I can see over the Hollywood hills.
I can see into the valley. You know,

578
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,280
I saw it at Ucla campus.

579
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:07,281
Then you see a la coliseum went right
over the fucking rose bowl and then right

580
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:11,280
off into the Mojave desert, flew
right over Vegas. I looked down,

581
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:14,250
I saw this strategy.
Right.

582
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,300
Then you're into Utah.
You go over the continental divide,

583
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,510
the fucking rocky mountains, and then
we out, we're out of the great plagues,

584
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,710
the food supply. Everybody,
that's where they poison it.

585
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,720
Bright there from the halls are Martez.
Oh my God.

586
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,740
Bless America. Right. Flying Right over
our food supply that for some reason,

587
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,530
some reason we're letting
these cunts poison it.

588
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,553
Right.

589
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,830
Some reason we're going after
the terrorist over there,

590
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:47,120
but the fucking ones in the suits
over. Yeah, it's okay. So, okay.

591
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,750
Spray the big casino all over it.
Keep the bugs off at fantastic. Ah,

592
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:56,980
just rinse it under a faucet.
You'll be fine anyways.

593
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,780
Hey,
feed that cow some more cow.

594
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,433
MMM.

595
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,550
Cut The beaks off them.

596
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,510
So you fly over that shit right then.
I don't know.

597
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:12,380
By then the sun started going down and
everything was fine and uh, you know,

598
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,860
I was working on writing some stuff.

599
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:15,820
Yeah.

600
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,330
And a shooting the shit with this guy and
I was telling me he's got this room he

601
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:22,430
has and he's got a garage
right with a room over it,

602
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,010
which is my dream fucking house,
man.

603
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:28,400
I always wanted to have an old house with
a detached garage with a rum over at,

604
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,420
I already told you this shit.

605
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I turned the upstairs into a drum room
slash cigar bar slash hooker lounge slash

606
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,290
sports bar like every man wants,
right?

607
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,783
MMM.

608
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,870
So he basically had that minus the
hookers, minuses, the Gaba minus to drums,

609
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,000
whatever. He had his, his fucking
new pool table and all that shit.

610
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:51,000
So we're just having a great time.
Just a good guy shooting the shit with,

611
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:54,120
he wasn't coughing, he didn't seem
like he had a boa. It was a nice time.

612
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,330
So all of a sudden we,
we started our initial offense,

613
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,920
the Santa to the Boston area, and,
um, we're out over the fucking wall,

614
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,823
you know,

615
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,400
and all of a sudden would, we're just
doing like this circular pattern.

616
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,530
I think we went north of the city
up by Newbury port in Marblehead,

617
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,350
and we're just doing
like this fucking circle.

618
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,890
And we go around and we go around
again and I'm thinking, uh,

619
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,320
this is a home pattern
that seems really low.

620
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,140
Yeah.

621
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,860
And, uh, the guy comes on and
he's like, Eh, we have a knee,

622
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:31,140
a little mechanical issue,
and try to work it out.

623
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:34,350
And then we have the ground shortly.
But I love that we're having,

624
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,280
we're having a mechanical problem. Uh,
but we expect to be on the ground shortly.

625
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,990
That can be taken two different ways.

626
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,180
Either we're going to fix it and I'll be
able to land this fucker or it's going

627
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:47,410
to be a catastrophic failure of something,

628
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:51,580
at which point gravity is going to take
over and land this plane for us. Right,

629
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,570
right. Somebody back deck there. Um,

630
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,930
so long story short,
um,

631
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:06,160
I wasn't even paying attention. That's
the weird part. I wasn't nervous at all,

632
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,560
which was another weird thing. So, uh,

633
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,900
he comes on the fucking thing and he was
going in for the landing and he said,

634
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:18,820
uh, okay, we're gonna begin our initial
to sent to a final whatever, blah,

635
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,400
blah blah at Logan airport.
Uh, just to let you know,

636
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,950
there's gotta be some emergency
vehicles on the runway.

637
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:26,990
There's nothing to be concerned about.
This is just standard procedure, bup, bup,

638
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,310
bup, bup, Ba. It's like
what the foot fucking mean.

639
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,200
It's nothing to be nervous about.
They brought up the fire trucks.

640
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,580
I know what this is for.

641
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,720
This is in case we're all covered in jet
fuel in eight minutes and we're on fire.

642
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,080
At which point you can't
really save any of us.

643
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,610
You just preventing this airplane from
burning down the rest of the airport is

644
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:50,560
we cartwheel down the fucking
runway. So anyways, long story short,

645
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:54,520
there was a flap that was stuck.
Um,

646
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,630
somebody said it was stuck up,
but we had the land faster than normal.

647
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:02,310
So I don't think it was able, I
don't think it was moving, you know,

648
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:07,270
don't you go flaps down or whatever to
slow the fucking thing down when you go

649
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,430
to land. Isn't that what, how
all these years of flying,

650
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:12,310
I believe that that's
what happens. Um, what,

651
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:17,200
what have we had the land faster than
probably what you're supposed to.

652
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,120
Probably outside the envelope
is the pilot say landed not,

653
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:26,530
it didn't even land that heart, you
know, and everybody in the back of plods,

654
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,600
nobody in first class applauds, you know,
cause they don't have any Sol's, uh,

655
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:36,280
including myself, you know,
and as we land and uh,

656
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,730
we pull over whatever and it
was a pretty fucking awesome,

657
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,460
pretty awesome feeling knowing
that the guy was that good.

658
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,230
He basically just prevented
us all from dying.

659
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:50,080
I guess they all do it every
time they landed safely. But uh,

660
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,580
to be able to kind of handle that,

661
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,220
I just can't imagine
being that pilot up there.

662
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,040
You only like comforting
feeling I would have, which you,

663
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:01,630
you'd have more concerned for the people
in the back then you did for yourself

664
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,650
so you can kind of stay
relaxed and just be thinking,

665
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,580
I have to keep my wits so I don't kill
these other people. But other than that,

666
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:13,690
what if, what a responsibility can
you imagine that if I fuck this up,

667
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,570
I'm going to kill 350 people,
you know? And then even worse,

668
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,250
whenever, you know, a plane
goes down, they examine it.

669
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:26,950
And if it comes down to being like, even
though that was a mechanical situation,

670
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,200
you know,
at some point they try,

671
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,000
they'd put it on the pilot
and insurance companies.

672
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:35,720
So you know what it was Chucky's fought
he fuck he wore the wrong kind of shoes

673
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:38,960
and I was pushing too
far. Right, right, right.

674
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:41,900
They figure out something that some
out of blame it on the pilot, you know,

675
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:46,510
so they can kind of keep the lawsuit.
Yeah. At a minimum, I don't know.

676
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,380
I W I don't what the fuck I'm
talking about. So whatever, um,

677
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,560
this guy landed us there safely.
Thank fucking Christ. And, uh,

678
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,120
so I've been back here in my
hometown for the last, uh,

679
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,130
since Friday and I've been, I've
been pretty good. I have not, uh,

680
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,000
I have not hit one of my old,
uh,

681
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,810
eating haunts cause I put on a little
bit of fucking weight there. I was,

682
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:14,630
I was sitting in the Writers'
room writingF is for family,

683
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,400
are pitching jokes as the
writers write it. And um,

684
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,890
okay.

685
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,610
You know, you know the
deal. I get like five,

686
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:27,120
10 outside the fucking zone and I f I
stand in the mirror and I fat shamed

687
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:30,750
myself. I give myself a little
fucking halftime speech, you know,

688
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:35,650
what the fuck was that today?
You know,

689
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,340
and then I get,
I get myself back on the stick.

690
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:44,030
So, uh, I'm telling you
all this shit that I say,

691
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:47,250
despite the fact that I don't know why I
didn't know anything about nutrition or

692
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,140
I know very little.

693
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:52,670
I'm telling you my tricks fucking work
when you just can't stop yourself and you

694
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:53,180
know,
you've got,

695
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,720
you want to eat a large
pizza and you fucking know it
and you know you shouldn't,

696
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,800
you're actually stepping
outside the craving, you know,

697
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:04,170
to be like, dude, what
the fuck are you doing?

698
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,880
Do not shove that fucking wheel
his shit down your throat.

699
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,620
Walk away. All right, drop the fork
or walk away. Right. You know it,

700
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,210
you know what you supposed to do, but
she can't that, that craving, that sugar,

701
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:21,820
salt,
fucking craving it just having you,

702
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:24,310
it's like you're not even controlling
your body. You walk over there,

703
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,490
that's when you just have to fucking
override it with common sense and order a

704
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:34,170
fucking salad
as quickly as possible,

705
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,470
shoved that down your fucking
throat and immediately,

706
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,640
not immediately take about five
minutes, you levels, whatever that is,

707
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:46,641
that craving levels off because you're
full fills you up and then you look at

708
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,850
that page and go, what the
fuck was I thinking? Why the
hell would I ever do that?

709
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,440
So I did that to myself.
I made a game plan before even left.

710
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,310
Um, I went to the airport and they had
one place you could actually get a salad,

711
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:02,970
right? And I fucking shove that down
my throat before I got on the plane.

712
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:04,800
And then I got on the
plane and then I was fine.

713
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,230
Okay.

714
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,350
And I had a banana for the flight,
shove that down my throat.

715
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,170
I kept pounding the water
is to keep the stomach full.

716
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,480
And at one point he had to give in. I
bought, I got a fucking whiskey and uh,

717
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,000
and then that was it. I was like, all
right, you did a great fucking job.

718
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,940
And then all of a sudden the plane
broke and I was like, Oh fuck,

719
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:23,774
I should've got the sun.
Yeah.

720
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,590
Is it too late to order some fun?
Uh,

721
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,430
keep the drinks, come
in their sweet hat. Um,

722
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,510
whatever. We ended up fucking landing
safely and a, I'm back on the stick.

723
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,350
Fiery auto crashes,
some old guy and hopper through.

724
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,760
We'll send things through my actions.

725
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,470
Some will fall in love of life and
drinking from a fountain that is foreign,

726
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:53,690
like an avalanche and
coming down the mountain.

727
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,120
[inaudible]

728
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,423
yeah.

729
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,780
Hey,
what's going on?

730
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:31,950
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

731
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:36,240
August 9th, 2010. How the hell are you?

732
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,510
Are you doing good?
Are you feeling okay?

733
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,323
Um,

734
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,340
I actually tried to do this podcast last
night and I was just too fucking beat

735
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:49,230
from doing the road, but
uh, believe it or not,

736
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:52,920
I had one of my best
road gigs of all time.

737
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,290
I worked the comedy store down in
La Jolla, California, La Jolla,

738
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,800
La j o l l a I think.

739
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,300
I don't know for all you fucking
Caucasians out there. Hey,

740
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:08,280
I'll come at eight fucking Lajolla.

741
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,490
Lajolla okay. No one of the guys
such difficult time assimilating.

742
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:18,590
I know you're not a fucking spell.
Well,

743
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:23,591
Jolla is Ala fuck and h
ow fucking why a buddy,

744
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,930
um, la Jolla, California.

745
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:33,370
And I performed down at the comedy
store and I had a tremendous time.

746
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,510
I stayed down at a hotel
right down on Pacific beach,

747
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,840
underrated Pacific beach.
I had a great time.

748
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,110
Evidently I heard late at night though.
The kids can get a little bit rowdy,

749
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,120
but that's what kids do. They don't
know how to get pussy. They don't,

750
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,400
they're young.
So what do they do?

751
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,270
Walk around with their chest puffed out.
They can,

752
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,000
that's going to make some
broad come over and touch it.

753
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,650
And then when she doesn't, you
start drinking more, right?

754
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,130
And then you see somebody who is getting
some and then what do you do? Ah,

755
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:11,870
you take off your button down, you got
your stupid fucking tank top on. Oh,

756
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,171
a little bit.

757
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:17,030
The folk have muscles all week and then
next thing you know there's a fight is

758
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:18,200
that hour goes down,
Bill.

759
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:22,670
I have no idea how it went down
in the fucking eighties. You know,

760
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:25,760
everybody had their feathered mullets,
you know,

761
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:28,490
they are Bobby Brown
steel toed dance shoes.

762
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,800
You know, back when Bobby
Brown was fucking Bobbi Brown,

763
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,350
Mark Walberg, it just started
lifting weights. Talk in the 80s,

764
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:46,600
talk in the fucking eighties. Um, yeah,
I had an unbelievable time this weekend,

765
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48,790
this week after two
weeks of alcohol abuse.

766
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,240
I'm actually sitting here
drinking a smoothie like a fag,

767
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,530
and I'm loving every second of it.
I'll tell you,

768
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:01,300
it's two days down on the beach. I'm
just like, I get it. I totally get it.

769
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:05,800
This whole east coast angry,
you know, spend your life,

770
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,390
you know, get teeth, grit,
holding a fucking shovel,

771
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,290
waiting for the next nor'easter.
It's just not the way to live

772
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,760
was fucking people down there in La Jolla.
Lajolla,

773
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,300
whatever the fuck you want to call it,
they have life down.

774
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,010
Everybody sat down there was
in great shape, you know,

775
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,190
people riding bikes,
people still rollerblading,

776
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,160
jogging, doing yoga. Sun was shining.

777
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,750
So I went out and got a smoothie.
He said, fuck it. You know,

778
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,751
when in Rome put on some yoga
stretchy pants and some flip flops.

779
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:50,260
And I didn't do that. I didn't
take it that far. But uh, yeah,

780
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,000
I was talking to a buddy of mine down
there and he was explaining to me why, uh,

781
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,670
why sound like a fucking,
well,

782
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:04,480
why should you worry?
What's wrong with that? Um,

783
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,260
he was telling me why, uh, starting
off with juice was a good thing.

784
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,090
Kind of equated it to an, to an
engine. You know, you go out,

785
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,150
you let your car fucking warmup first
before he'd drive it a hundred miles an

786
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,140
hour down the street,
don't you?

787
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,690
So rather than take it one of those
fucking Goddamn breakfast sandwiches,

788
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,910
that'll be the death yet,
you know,

789
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:29,110
having some Nag and broaden your life
and you compound that, compile it,

790
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,740
something with the sea.
That means in addition, um,

791
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,410
you have a breakfast sandwich
with the bacon or the sausage,

792
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,910
which form of dead pig do you want
on this fucking thing, you know,

793
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,250
that'll kill you. So last, like three,

794
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:48,160
four days up in drinking the
smoothie to start off the damn day.

795
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,700
And I'm feeling great and I know right
now all you guys are going to fucking go

796
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:56,701
onto the m podcast and continue your
fucking threads about what a pussy on

797
00:49:57,011 --> 00:50:01,780
becoming. And I gotta be honest with
you, I don't give a shit. You know,

798
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:05,830
I'm like that fucking astronaut who
just think spaces, beauty, beautiful.

799
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,990
And I just let go of the
ship and everybody else is
sitting there and horror,

800
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,240
you know, is I just sort of float away
with that stupid smile on my face.

801
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,960
At least he floated away
doing what he loved.

802
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,920
Yeah. That's where I'm gone. I got a
lot of shit last week on my alleged fan.

803
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,240
You know, only I would get trashed
on my, my, my alleged fan page,

804
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,720
the MM podcast.com if you
haven't visited there, uh,

805
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,900
you're missing out because that's
where all the cool kids are, you know,

806
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,970
with the jeans rolled up,
listened to at the hop. Um,

807
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,370
no,
I,

808
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:48,860
I recommend youtube videos and all that
shit when rather than having to go on

809
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,320
and search them yourself,
you can actually just,

810
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,750
we do it for you at the m and podcasts.

811
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,690
It's sort of a mom and pop store
with no mother or no father.

812
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,380
It's a tragic story and I'm not
going to get into it. But anyways,

813
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:05,210
I got trashed on my own
alleged fan page about my,

814
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:05,930
uh,

815
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:10,250
my alcohol tolerance because last week
I was hung over because the night before

816
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:15,070
he had two whiskeys and to Miller
high life. And uh, everybody's,

817
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,160
but yeah, basically, you know, doing
what people, that's all you had, dude.

818
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:23,400
I can fucking drink a fucking case and
you know, go unload a fucking truck.

819
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:28,310
So can I, when I was in my twenties,
it's called pea and 42 people.

820
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,650
Do you think I'm proud of that shit?
This is the deal. If I have one beer,

821
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,830
just one beer late at night,
I wake up the next day.

822
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:41,690
If I didn't drink a tall glass of water,
I feel the effects. All right. I'm like,

823
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:44,600
it's fucking 14 year NFL vet.

824
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,090
That's what my livers like.

825
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,320
My liver is like the
entire late seventies,

826
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:54,590
Pittsburgh Steelers brains right now.

827
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,600
What's really fucking
bad, whatever. Um, if I,

828
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,460
I can't handle it the way I used to.
All right.

829
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,530
You know what an evil Knievel due
at the end of his fucking life.

830
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:11,330
Was he still jumping off his shit or was
he fucking lane in agony? Slumped over.

831
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:14,810
A fucking Ottoman. I mean, you ask
yourself the tough questions people,

832
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,540
you're going to get the answers you need.
You need to hear

833
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,420
God damn it. That smoothie is delicious.
So that's why. Yes people so you know.

834
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,870
But I am a man and I am competitive
since I got to tell you some fucking

835
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:28,820
drinking and not even drinking stories.

836
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:33,970
I'm just going to rattle off some striking
stats from earlier on in my career.

837
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:36,980
And this is no steroids
by the way, people, okay?

838
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:41,480
This is pre steroids era in baseball.

839
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:47,810
Um, what a fucking joke by the way,
Huh? God Damn a Rod. I don't get,

840
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:52,400
I don't get this shit. The fucking
20 minute memory sports fans have.

841
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,120
Why were they doing the countdown
to a rod 600th home run?

842
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:59,120
Can anybody explain that to me?
Oh,

843
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:02,300
you mean the Gao did roids
and patted his fucking stats.

844
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,010
A monumental achievement.
Look good babe.

845
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:08,900
Ruth looked like he was
in his second trimester.

846
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,780
He's eating a fucking hot dog at
the plate and he banged out. What,

847
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:15,480
713 is that what it is dependent,

848
00:53:15,481 --> 00:53:18,680
not be 713 if I actually got that right,
that the level of,

849
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,450
of patheticness to my social life.
Um,

850
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,960
yeah, I used to, back in the day I could
drink a 12 pack, no fucking problem.

851
00:53:27,961 --> 00:53:31,410
And then I'd go on to Mcdonald's.
I get a quarter pounder with cheese,

852
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,180
a cheeseburger, you know, large
fry, never liked in nuggets.

853
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,200
Coca, what else would I get? I'd
have to get maybe two cheeseburgers.

854
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:45,030
I needed a lot of bread and they
fucking squirrel meat. And then I would,

855
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:47,160
you know, go to bed and I
would wake up literally three,

856
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:51,300
four hours later go to my job.
And other than being sleepy,

857
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:56,040
I felt fine and I would go down
that I unload trucks, you know,

858
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,270
kind of felt like shit.

859
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:00,900
But when the Roach coach showed up at
10 15 I'd go out there and maybe get a

860
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:04,740
slice of pizza,
you know,

861
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,730
just to kind of sop up the rest of
the alcohol. And I was good to go.

862
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,710
I was good to go. But let me
tell you something. You do
that for 20 fucking years.

863
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,980
It catches up with you,
catches up with you.

864
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:20,910
So one day you're 42 you have a
couple of fuck whiskeys, you know,

865
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:24,150
couple of high highlights and you banged
up the next morning and I'm not gonna

866
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:26,700
apologize.
Okay?

867
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,580
There's too many people in this country
that are obsessed with the youth culture.

868
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,820
Now shame when people say that,
you know, says that old people,

869
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,980
because they're not fuckable anymore
and they can't emotionally come to terms

870
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:45,730
with it. We are a youth obsessed
culture. Tell me another.

871
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,810
And then they always got to bring up
Japan. How they respect their elders,

872
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:53,850
you know, really, how much do
they respect them? Are they,

873
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:57,690
are they walking up to them at a
fucking single's bar? You know,

874
00:54:57,691 --> 00:55:01,470
I've always been turned on by 80
year olds. You know your wisdom,

875
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,610
your fucking chicken neck.
Yeah,

876
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,310
I got to have to understand,
I'm like Brett Farve. Okay.

877
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:10,340
Every time people think I'm
going to fucking retire,

878
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,120
I come back for another God damn round.

879
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,280
You know, maybe if I took
the roids that guy's taken.

880
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:20,820
I could actually fucking drink
the way I used to. You know,

881
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,050
I'm actually going to debate a debate
with a buddy of mine. I think he, he,

882
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,740
he took something for last season.
That guy was on the jets. Okay.

883
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:33,600
He looked, he looked
like Nilo Donald. Okay.

884
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,820
And then all of a sudden he has air
quotes off season surgery and this guy

885
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,110
fucking comes back and

886
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,210
when he was like 39 he looked
like fucking George Blanda.

887
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,350
Then he comes back at 40 and all of a
sudden he looks like that kid who took his

888
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:54,351
helmet off and the Superbowl was it
[inaudible] 97 I blocked that out.

889
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:57,480
And you don't have to tell you
guys I was at that super bowl.

890
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,300
I was at that super bowl and Brett Farve
took his helmet off and ran down the

891
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:03,300
street like a Douche. Huh?
That's back when, you know,

892
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:05,730
I think he's the reason why you're
not allowed to do that anymore.

893
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,560
Right in the middle of the super bowl,

894
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,450
he takes his fucking helmet off and
runs down the fucking field, you know,

895
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,570
with an ear piece in his agent going,
yeah.

896
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:19,560
Now smile real big and
yell weedies you know,

897
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,530
to fucking sad in sports. Did you guys
watch any of that hall of fame game,

898
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:30,070
by the way? What was it? The fucking,

899
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,910
the cowboys versus the Goddamn Bengals.

900
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:40,170
How awkward was it watching a t
o and o Cho Sinco when he goes,

901
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:45,220
uh, I'm Batman. And then the other
dude's like, and I'm Robin. Oh,

902
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,820
all right. So you're his ward. I mean,

903
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:52,390
haven't they long talked about the gay
relationship between Batman and Robin,

904
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,440
this fucking teenager
who's have no relation to,

905
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:01,750
uh, Adam West, whatever his fucking name
is. Am I really gonna do that hacky bit?

906
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,330
I think I got to start boozing again.

907
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:09,640
I give this podcast a half a
fucking thumb down. All right,

908
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:13,930
let's get into this shit here. Um, so when
he was, I was down in, uh, Sandy. Oh fuck.

909
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,110
All right. Start off a bill. Regroup.
You actually have some information.

910
00:57:17,111 --> 00:57:21,340
You know what? I got jury duty,
so I need your guys' help. Okay.

911
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,940
This is a free God damn podcast and I
would appreciate a little bit of fucking

912
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:29,650
reciprocation. How to fuck do I
get out of this shit? You know,

913
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,770
I was thinking of memorizing the
Mel Gibson tapes and just go in

914
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,970
and just,
when they say my name,

915
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:44,380
I'm just going to start reciting
some of his dialogue. William Barr.

916
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,820
I'm just going to go sit in here with
you pussy hanging out of the back and get

917
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,260
dress.
Look,

918
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:58,210
we all know the line. I all you're
not line I need to mutter is, is the,

919
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:02,020
the over the top racist one and
I will never get jury duty again,

920
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:07,330
but uh, there's gotta be a better way.
Okay. There has to be a better way.

921
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,120
Is there a race of people out there left
that you can sort of go off on where

922
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:17,620
you can come off as racist but it
doesn't hold the same weight? You know,

923
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,100
I mean I think the Yankees and red sox
of race or or blacks and Jewish people,

924
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,190
you know, you trash either one
of them, your career is fucked,

925
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,130
but then you know you got the
middle of now of level ones,

926
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:34,480
you know like the twins,
you know you go off on Italian people,

927
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,910
I do it all the time.
Oh look at my full can tank top.

928
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,680
Oh nobody gives a shit.

929
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:47,550
Jersey shore is an entire show making
fun of Italian fucking people telling you

930
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:52,180
fucking juice heads and all this shit
and half of those consonants show they're

931
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:55,720
not even Italian.
You know what I mean?

932
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:58,690
Could you do that with blacks
at Jewish people? You could not.

933
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,220
That's what I'm talking about.
That's why they are the upper that,

934
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:06,880
that's why the hair, the tier one,
they're the Yankees and red sox. Alright.

935
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,310
If you want to destroy your career,

936
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:13,090
say some shit about either one of those
groups, that shit is over. All right.

937
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,720
You want to dip your toe into a little
bit of racism. I'd go with the Italians.

938
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,560
Irish people, you can go
off on Polish. You know,

939
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,550
cause that's sort of comes into way ya
now he just sort of making fun of white

940
00:59:25,551 --> 00:59:29,780
people in more of a specific
sort of way. But uh, you know,

941
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:33,320
when no one really knows what the fuck
bad shit happened to any of us, whatever,

942
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:37,400
what a bad ever happened to Italians.
You know, they've got gorgeous women,

943
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,510
you know, some of them a little
hairy. I will give you that, you know,

944
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,900
especially in the tramp stamp area.
Never seen that.

945
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:48,440
Ever see a girl with a little little
extra hair there and you're like, Jesus,

946
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,110
Yo g,
you know,

947
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,750
just thinking of what
that God damn fucking

948
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,130
who has going to look like

949
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,040
it's going to look like decided George
Michael's face and about fucking 1987

950
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:12,020
so a looking at this, going off on
Italian women, I'm not even nervous.

951
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:17,540
I'm not worried about it.
And then you move on to,

952
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,260
I'll tell you know who's
moved up in the rankings,

953
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:23,510
sort of like a Texas tech that turned
its program around there with some genius

954
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,990
new coach was agents.
When I started in stand up comedy,

955
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,400
you could do a half hour on
Asians and nobody gave a shit.

956
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:38,320
She's fucking going off going off on
agents and then somewhere along the line

957
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,360
they were like, wait a minute, didn't
we teach you guys martial arts?

958
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,510
You know when did the master,

959
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:51,170
but I mean the student become
the dose and start yelling at us.

960
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:55,150
So then they turned it around.
I think they've leap frog past the fuck.

961
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,840
I tell you it was a problem with fucking
Italian people is if I can be so bold,

962
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,900
they should pussies are hanging up is um,

963
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,780
the bad shit that you guys do.
I don't even know if it's cool,

964
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:13,310
but it's been so fucking
glamorized that, you know, I mean,

965
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:17,450
look at good fellas,
at least the beginning of Goodfellas.

966
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:22,940
I love that. I hate when the second
fucking, uh, Henry becomes a rat,

967
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,480
you know. I know I've talked about that
before. You know that fucking asshole.

968
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:31,670
Like, she has the balls to come
out in public now and he signs shit

969
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:34,821
I want to go to.
And you know,

970
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:39,821
and the MP I if people like equate
that guy with Ray Liotta character,

971
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,590
this guy was,

972
01:01:42,591 --> 01:01:46,790
was he fucking ran in everybody out at
one after he did exactly what they told

973
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:50,240
them not to do. He got himself into
that fucking situation. Granted,

974
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:52,430
if the movie is exactly how
it went down a real life,

975
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:56,150
so why would you go down
there and get, get the, uh,

976
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:01,160
get the autograph to somebody who
told on his friends. I'm asking you.

977
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,280
So anyways, what I'm saying is, uh, yeah,

978
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:11,190
as much as Italians or Ricoh or
acquainted with fucking organized crime,

979
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:15,650
I think people look at it the way
you look at the beginning of, um,

980
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,680
of good fellas when they're all hanging
out in front of the coffee shop,

981
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:23,670
breaking balls, they got on nice suits.
They got the cars, they got the women.

982
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,970
They're not taking any shit.
You know,

983
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:32,400
it's like fucking Walker, Texas ranger
with dot. I mean, it was even like Walker,

984
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:35,730
Texas ranger was annoying because he's
such a fucking do good are all the time.

985
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:41,880
It's on the right side of the law. He
wears a condom. He's annoying those guys.

986
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:43,440
They don't give a shit.
Joe Pesi, you know,

987
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:47,010
sitting there having a fucking business
conversation and he pushes that girl's

988
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:49,830
head down onto his dick.
Who doesn't want to do that?

989
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,790
Let's talk about racism this week.
People.

990
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:57,060
Out of all the stereotypes I
went to ft say that Italians,

991
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:58,890
they have some of the best
stereotypes out there.

992
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:07,530
Irish, what are we got? Pasty faced
drunks, potato, Wheaton, shitheads.

993
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:11,370
I'm half a, mostly German. And
then I'm, I'm Irish. So basically,

994
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,600
what are you a fucking
Nazi? I got that. And uh,

995
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,680
and then everybody else is
just a fucking booze bag.

996
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,940
Going to church every week.
A and having like 18 kids.

997
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:31,530
Alright. Okay. So now we got to go
all the way down to the cellar here.

998
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,770
The fucking Kansas city royals.
And I'm not equating this to, to,

999
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:41,370
to the people. I'm just saying as far
as the standup comedian, like the team,

1000
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:43,320
you can just fucking,
you know,

1001
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:46,620
you can just score seven runs on them and
there's nothing they could fucking do.

1002
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:48,420
Um,

1003
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,010
I don't really know if that exists now
the way it's so politically correct,

1004
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:59,570
native Americans just because of the odds
of one of them actually being off the

1005
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:03,390
reservation and in the crowd is,

1006
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:12,270
hey, you know what, so many, uh,
um, sent me an email this week and,

1007
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:15,690
uh, this is just a great fucking
email and it's just classic,

1008
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:18,900
just shows how full of Shit I am is,
I'm,

1009
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,010
I always compared like the Yankees and
the red sox to what they're doing until

1010
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:26,880
like, you know, a Walmart
or like a best buy. Um,

1011
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,560
and evidently this guy sent me an email
and of course I didn't do the research,

1012
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:32,940
but one of the higher ups are,

1013
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:36,930
one of the owners of Walmart
actually owns the Kansas city royals.

1014
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,920
So he was basically saying that if that
guy wanted to win as bad as the Yankees

1015
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:47,810
and the Red Sox, um,
do that actually they,

1016
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:52,260
they would say Bruton for Kansas City
is like rooting for Walmart or something

1017
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:56,250
like that. And uh, I think there
might be some validity in that point.

1018
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:02,280
Um, I mean God knows I can't back it
up because I didn't read about it.

1019
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:04,890
So, uh, once again, once again,

1020
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,980
I am exposed to how full of Shit I am,

1021
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:12,390
but there's a passion in my
full of shitness. All right.

1022
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,810
I feel like this is fucking winding
down again. Let's go to, uh,

1023
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:20,800
let's go to the board here.
Um, last week I discussed, uh,

1024
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,840
clapping in the airport for veterans
when they get off the plane. You know,

1025
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:29,140
that point they walk by letting and
everybody's just like, whew, you know,

1026
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:33,280
good game, good game. Uh,

1027
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:36,640
and it was one of those, you know, one
of those weird things where it's like,

1028
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:41,641
it just felt I didn't clap cause
it just felt weird and it was like,

1029
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:44,350
and I'm sitting there feeling
guilty why I want to show this guy.

1030
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:48,400
I appreciate the fact, you know, that
he went over there and everything,

1031
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:49,890
but it's like,
I don't want to Wa

1032
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,680
I know clapping isn't it?

1033
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,640
So we actually had a couple
of veterans chimed in here,

1034
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,280
um, or people in active service. Okay.
And here's what they have to say.

1035
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:08,920
All right. Listening to the late
Yara, your latest podcasts. Uh, yes,

1036
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:11,680
it was a little weird getting
off the plane in Atlanta,

1037
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,760
coming back from 13 months in Iraq and
having strangers clap as I was going up

1038
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:23,960
the escalator. Uh, that being said, I
couldn't keep the rice smile off my face,

1039
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,770
my face, I guess it's better than
nothing or the Vietnam scenario that you,

1040
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:32,620
uh, that you described. Um,
so I wrote the guy back,

1041
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,100
so I was saying clapping
is okay. And he said, uh,

1042
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,090
he goes, yeah, absolutely. Again,

1043
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:43,750
it's weird leaving that militarized
environment and trying to

1044
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,290
readjust to stepping foot in America.

1045
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:50,800
So it's a little weird to have
people actually happy to see you,

1046
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:54,820
let alone clapping a random
hugs and kisses. Not so much,

1047
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:59,800
unless they're from, oh, Jesus, I'm the
worst that can read unless they're hot.

1048
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:04,090
And then all bets are off
of course. Uh, all right.

1049
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,060
So that's that guy's opinion. Um, oh,

1050
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:10,540
did have a guy shake my hand and
thank me for this time. I, uh,

1051
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,020
time in the service guy looked like
he could have been a Vietnam vet,

1052
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:19,110
so it wasn't a patronizing 20 year old
douchebag handshake or a 50 year old

1053
01:07:19,121 --> 01:07:22,030
cubicle farm farm secretary.

1054
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:28,090
A guy looked like he might've actually
meant it and understood what the term

1055
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:29,440
service meant.
I'm sorry,

1056
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:32,080
I don't have the light on in my bedroom
when I bring this over to the fucking

1057
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,870
window here. Okay. Um,

1058
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,300
this didn't really, was supposed to
be interesting and the way I read it,

1059
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:43,060
that sounded like I was fucking
reading a spelling test.

1060
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,740
All right. Here's another
guide Shiming in, uh,

1061
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:51,310
I served in the Marines as a radio
operator. One of the guys in the,

1062
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:54,070
one of those guys in the war
movies with the backpack radios,

1063
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:58,630
that invariably invariably die within
30 minutes of the opening credits. Uh,

1064
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:03,340
my unit participated in the evasion
and returned to Camp Pendleton,

1065
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,630
California via a stopover in Baltimore.
As we came into the main terminal,

1066
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:11,040
we received the awkward standing ovation.
Uh,

1067
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,030
if I had had one of those cyanide pills,

1068
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:17,390
the spy pilots carry between the cheek
and gum, I might have gone for it.

1069
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:23,720
They're asked to be a happy medium
between spitting and being an ass.

1070
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,960
I know you're clapping
so you can tell you,

1071
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,250
tell your friends that you support
the troops. Just knock it off.

1072
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:32,960
I know you're really don't care.

1073
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,220
We don't care that you don't care and
we'll all be better off if you don't.

1074
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,980
What does it say?
UN

1075
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:46,770
athletically clap and or something
like that. Like it's the end of topcon.

1076
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:52,610
Uh, what's more is that every guy in
the world internalizes other guys,

1077
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,600
military service and wants to tell
you about how he almost joined.

1078
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:00,050
But a promising job in
the food industry called.

1079
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,640
So these clowns not only make ya
your walkthrough, the term terminal,

1080
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,750
super awkward,

1081
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,160
but then they follow you into the bar
and ruin your first experience around

1082
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:13,790
women in eight months. See that's
what I felt like it was. I mean,

1083
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:18,380
what are they supposed to do?
Smile and wave. Thank you.

1084
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:23,870
Thank you. 14 confirmed kills right
air and made the altar all star team.

1085
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,870
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It's fucking weird. So I don't know.

1086
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,560
One guy says he doesn't
mind it. Uh, I dunno.

1087
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:34,400
This is how I do it. If I'm in a
bar and I see people in uniform,

1088
01:09:34,401 --> 01:09:37,430
I'll send out around a drinks.
I don't even walk up to him sent down.

1089
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:41,000
They look over, you know,
I give them the, uh,

1090
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,900
more black people used to do when they
do it. When the height of the, the, the,

1091
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,770
the fucking a salad.
Remember that Shit.

1092
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,860
Anybody else used to watch
fat Albert back in the day?

1093
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,880
It's not like the full on 1968 Olympics
or that stupid puff daddy advertisement

1094
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:01,490
in Times Square. It's not like
dad, you know, I love that one.

1095
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:05,690
That puffy has in there like he's fighting
the power in the fashion industry for

1096
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:09,500
is Sean John Close. He's
fighting the power. Everybody,

1097
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:13,190
those goddamn eight year olds who
sewed together as track suits,

1098
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:16,910
they keep repel it and they
keep rebelling, you know,

1099
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,490
but he stay in strong.

1100
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,750
Ah, must be great to always get to
play the victim. God Damn, I'm jealous.

1101
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,840
I'm really fucking jealous of that. All
right, so there you go. I don't know.

1102
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:32,570
We got one for one against,
so it's a tie.

1103
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:36,530
So I need more veterans to chime
in here. Yes. On the clapping.

1104
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,210
No on the clapping.
And this is the thing,

1105
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:39,860
you can't just say yes and the clapping.

1106
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:43,340
Why don't you come up with creative ways
that people can thank you and I don't

1107
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:47,000
care how filthy they are.
Have Fun with this for the love of God.

1108
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:50,720
So I can actually maybe be funny on my
own God damn podcast and actually have

1109
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:54,390
the nerve to get upset that
fucking people were uh,

1110
01:10:55,130 --> 01:11:00,080
trashing me on my own fucking alleged
fan page. I think I need another sip,

1111
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:02,300
a smoothie so I can
become even less funnier.

1112
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,500
This really is anti funny juice. You
know, you have a breakfast sandwich,

1113
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:14,250
you're fucking hilarious. You
breaking balls, you have flies down,

1114
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:19,110
you don't even know it. People
laughing with you and Ya. Um,

1115
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:23,370
so anyways, so let's get onto some
youtube videos of the week. Um,

1116
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,510
I'll wait. Did I talk
about jury duty? I did.

1117
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:31,380
Didn't I did I guys,

1118
01:11:31,381 --> 01:11:33,810
how the fuck do I get out of jury duty?
I don't want to do it.

1119
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:36,540
I've already done it.
I've done it fucking three.

1120
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:39,060
I don't know how many times I've done it.
I can only remember once,

1121
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,500
but I'm gonna say three fucking times.

1122
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,380
This is one of these weird things
where as an American I want to do it.

1123
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,140
It is my God damn duty.
All right.

1124
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,940
I would rather do
community fucking service

1125
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,630
then do jury duty.
I'll tell you what buddy.

1126
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:57,630
You don't show up for that fucking shit.
You just, Jack, what you going to get?

1127
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:04,850
Does anybody know anybody who fucking
blew off jury duty and actually got

1128
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:07,950
arrested for it?
You know,

1129
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:13,050
I figured California's a broke state
so you know, they, they gotta be,

1130
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:17,850
they gotta be like stretched
pretty thin right now. You know,

1131
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:18,471
my problem is,

1132
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:22,770
is I fucking responded to it when I was
living in New York and I actually sat on

1133
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,760
a juror jury as an alternate
juror and this dude,

1134
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:29,070
they busted this dude trying to break in.

1135
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:33,690
It was actually hilarious trying to pick
a lock to break into a building and he

1136
01:12:33,691 --> 01:12:37,410
was trying to say that he was taking a
piss and one of the best part, you know,

1137
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:40,640
and that's why he was turned
into the doorway. And, uh,

1138
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:44,460
one of the funniest things was
when the cop was testifying saying,

1139
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:47,010
do you think there's any way
that he was actually urinating?

1140
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,260
And the dude was working
on the deadbolt locks.

1141
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:54,000
So his hands were basically up where
his chest was. So he goes, well,

1142
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:58,830
unless he was trying to be in his
own face with the longest dick ever.

1143
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,500
No, he wasn't trying to pee.
He said it much more, uh,

1144
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:05,460
a much more cleaner way. But, uh,

1145
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:09,330
I sat there as an alternate juror and I
felt bad. I felt bad for the fucking guy.

1146
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,290
You know,

1147
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:15,000
I don't have it in me to send someone to
jail for doing some shit that I've done.

1148
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,640
You know, it's just
fucking ridiculous. Uh,

1149
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,140
well cause I never got caught.
Now I can judge this guy.

1150
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,830
I never tried to break into somebody's
house, but I did other things.

1151
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,890
I had a couple failed attempts
to steal cars. This is,

1152
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,670
this is what my attempts to steal cars.

1153
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:36,720
I would check to see if the door was
unlocked and if it was unlocked then I

1154
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,570
would get in it. And then I
would look in the visor for keys.

1155
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,890
And when that didn't happen,
I just got out because I had no skills.

1156
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,350
You know, you can go on youtube and learn
how to hot wire a car. And it's funny,

1157
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:53,310
they show you how to hot wire a car all
under the guise of in case you run out

1158
01:13:53,311 --> 01:13:56,760
of gas or a case, you lose your
keys. That's it. Run out of gas.

1159
01:13:56,761 --> 01:14:01,761
That's stupid in case you lose your
keys and you're in the middle of fucking

1160
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:06,840
nowhere and a, you need
to hot wire your car. And,

1161
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:08,910
uh, you know, you can
actually fucking do it.

1162
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,220
You know when you can drink a fucking
juggle your own urine in the process.

1163
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,660
They try to make it like that.

1164
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:17,980
Like it's a survivalist thing and there's
all these comments underneath it. Hey,

1165
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:22,300
thanks a lot man. I just got that 68
Mustang I always wanted. You know,

1166
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:27,160
who knows if they're
joking or not, but I dunno.

1167
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,180
So anyways, how do I get out of it? See,

1168
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:35,020
this is why you want to have as
many friends as possible. This is,

1169
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:39,010
this is a true belief that
I have come to in my life.

1170
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,970
You cannot have enough
friends who are cops.

1171
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,580
You just can't.
All right.

1172
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:50,200
And I don't give a fuck how much you
hate authority. You're going to loose.

1173
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,850
All right?
You've seen those guys.

1174
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:55,600
Those guys can accidentally or on
purposely kill you and be like,

1175
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:59,920
oh Yo, I, I had a muscle
spasm. Sorry about that.

1176
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:00,820
And they walk.

1177
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,960
So you want these guys on your side,

1178
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,780
there's a cop lives on your block.

1179
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:11,950
Bake a cake that works two fold.
One,

1180
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:15,370
you get on his good side. And
two, if you do some bad shit,

1181
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:19,060
if he doesn't recognize you, he's
too fat to catch you. You know?

1182
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,350
And maybe when he reaches
down for his gun, his did,

1183
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:24,610
he is his fucking love handles,
you know,

1184
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:28,240
are pushing the gun a little bit back
around to the s area and he can't pull it

1185
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:32,830
out. His old service revolver.
Um, no actually, you know,

1186
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,750
I know a couple of cops out here in La
and there were a couple back in New York

1187
01:15:37,751 --> 01:15:42,370
and yeah, when I have new DVDs that
come out, I fucking send them out. Hey,

1188
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,680
you go fellas,
remember this face,

1189
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,790
remember this face for,
I'm speeding around in my fucking hybrid.

1190
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:56,140
I really am a Douche. Um,
anyways, it's fucking plow ahead.

1191
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,040
I'd also make friends with the
veterans on your street. You know,

1192
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,150
maybe they actually smuggled
back a grenade or some
shit and you'll be privy to

1193
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:08,230
see what it looks like when he fucking
throws it at somebody on a 4th of July.

1194
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:11,800
Just for the fuck of it.
Um, anyways. Yeah. Okay.

1195
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:14,980
So those are my two questions this week.
Veterans. I want you to chime in, okay?

1196
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:18,540
Cause it's a tie right now. All right? Um,

1197
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,660
about how people are supposed
to show appreciation, okay?

1198
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:24,790
It's one guy says he
doesn't mind the clapping,

1199
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:26,200
but both of you said it was awkward.

1200
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:29,980
The other person said he wanted to
take a fucking cyanide pill. All right?

1201
01:16:29,981 --> 01:16:34,981
So we're all over the map here and if you
can come up with a creative way that a

1202
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:39,670
legal or not legal way that people can
thank veterans as they get off the plane,

1203
01:16:39,671 --> 01:16:42,640
please let me know. And I actually,
uh, what do you think of mine?

1204
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:46,420
You send down a round of drinks and then
you don't go down there and have the

1205
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:49,690
fucking awkward conversation with them.
You know,

1206
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,900
like, what am I going to say to
you? I never went to war, you know,

1207
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,150
just start fucking doing
quotes from platoon.

1208
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,790
All right, let's fucking
plow ahead here. Um,

1209
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:08,530
youtube videos of the work of the
week, of the work of the week. Uh,

1210
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,400
youtube videos. All right, guy
search. This guy walks into traffic,

1211
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,880
gets hit.
This guy is such a fucking moron.

1212
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,050
I actually thought that this was fake
because I don't know how he doesn't see

1213
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:25,280
this. He walks into traffic doing
a silly dance, and I swear to God,

1214
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:27,710
I believe he gets hit
by an ice cream truck.

1215
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,030
And I'll tell you right now,
if that doesn't put a smile on your face,

1216
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,660
you're not American. You're not
American. You're a fucking commie.

1217
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:40,340
Pinko son of a bitch. Do you know in
Russia the ice cream trucks are gray?

1218
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,690
Slate Gray.

1219
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,530
They don't even have a picture of the ice
cream on the side of it and they don't

1220
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:49,030
play a fucking happy little
pedophile jingle has a drawer.

1221
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:52,640
They drive down the street. They
don't, they just played the,

1222
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,890
I am Bra shy of Russia.

1223
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,900
I'd take out a comb and then I brush up.
That's what they do.

1224
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:03,700
Just something fucking like that,
you know, except they sing it. Um,

1225
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:06,620
slayer goes to church.

1226
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:11,480
I think I might have recommended this one
before someone else did. Um, but it's,

1227
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:14,030
it's just awesome. Um, next one,

1228
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:19,031
our best judge Judy ending ever
best judge Judy ending ever.

1229
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:24,950
And this actually made me watch some of
those, uh, like I fucking hate judge Judy.

1230
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:28,730
I Hate Judge Carol. I hate all
those mother fuckers. Okay.

1231
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:32,570
This one is some lady screaming
at this guy going, you know,

1232
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,900
you don't come in here and
disrespect this quite like that.

1233
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:41,630
Disrespect what court?
It's a fucking TV show.

1234
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:45,350
You dump cunt.
You're not a fucking judge.

1235
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:50,720
I'm so sick of these fucking people who
get TV shows about a job and they think

1236
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:54,430
that that, that their, their fucking job
now is still the job that they're show.

1237
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:58,370
No, you're a TV star. It's
not a fucking court. A law.

1238
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,530
Even though it has the
authority of a court of law.

1239
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:04,040
How many quarts do you know out there?
Okay.

1240
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,070
That cease to exist if
they get bad ratings.

1241
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,283
You know what I mean?

1242
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,250
Actually left that comment on one of
those fucking youtube video. Thanks man.

1243
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,560
It was fucking girl show boat.

1244
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:19,130
There was show boat and slam it down the
hammer screaming and yelling and then,

1245
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:19,311
you know,

1246
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:22,100
they go to the commercial and then the
producer comes up and whispers in their

1247
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:25,310
ear like, yeah, that was great television.
That was great. Tell them, hey,

1248
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,930
do more yelling, yell more. ESPN is
making a killing with the yelling.

1249
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:35,420
I fuck ain't out. Maybe it's my hatred
of women. I don't know what it is.

1250
01:19:35,421 --> 01:19:40,220
But those fucking women judges, that's
my nightmare of what being married is.

1251
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,970
You know, cause you're legally bound to
them and they can take half your shit.

1252
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,310
So now they can fucking
yell at you like that.

1253
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:49,670
Banging a hammer hammer on
some fucking coffee table.

1254
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,680
Oh, I'll tell you right now,
you can take half of my shit.

1255
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:57,770
I'll fucking walk just to get away
from you and you fucking goddamn

1256
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,710
menopause. Chicken neck fucking screaming
at me. Go fuck yourself, Judge Judy.

1257
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:07,070
There's no fucking way I
would stand there. Okay.

1258
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:12,030
And get yelled at like that because a
third of my swing set is on my neighbor's

1259
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,864
property.

1260
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:17,580
You're gonna fucking yell at me like that
cause cause why are you yelling at me

1261
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:20,250
like that? You don't even feel
it, Judge Judy. All you, Oh,

1262
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:23,010
you want to do is get good ratings.
You're fucking grand standing.

1263
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,430
Go Fuck Yourself. Please tell me you're
not naked under that robe. You Amaze.

1264
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:32,340
She ate it. Old Whore. Sorry.

1265
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:33,960
I don't like those fucking shows.

1266
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,640
That's the same thing with
like that Donald Trump.

1267
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,810
If you actually think Donald Trump
is rich and you're a fucking idiot,

1268
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:41,310
you're a goddamn idiot.

1269
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:46,680
He needs that job to keep his,
his face out there.

1270
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,850
What do they call it? Your Q rating.
Is that what they say in the business?

1271
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,810
How recognizable you fucking faces.

1272
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,150
Go Down to Atlantic city and talked to a
couple of people about Donald Trump and

1273
01:20:57,151 --> 01:21:01,860
his fucking, he, you know, he is,
he is rich. But he's like, you know,

1274
01:21:01,861 --> 01:21:04,560
he's the rich version of that
guy who lives on your street,

1275
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:08,630
who has like four old cars and different,
uh,

1276
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:13,260
levels of restoration in a fucking old
refrigerator just rusting out on his

1277
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:16,740
front property. That guy, the
guy who makes you a fucking
property value go down.

1278
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,110
He does that at like the skyscraper level.

1279
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,570
I'm not saying it doesn't
have more money than you or I,

1280
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,520
but you know what I mean enough already.

1281
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:26,580
If you really had all these
successful businesses going on,

1282
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:31,820
you don't have time to see if Ozzy's
wife is better than Cindy Lopper do you?

1283
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,480
I don't think you do. All
right, last week on the podcast,

1284
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:41,470
um, I read some hate mail
from single mothers, uh,

1285
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,210
who got mad at me when I was talking
about stay at home moms with husbands who

1286
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,190
give them money. And uh, I
actually got some shit from a,

1287
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,470
from actual stay at home moms. So, uh,

1288
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:57,471
one person chimed in on that actually
brought up a decent point that was

1289
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:01,380
delivered in a very extreme way,
which is how we do it on this podcast.

1290
01:22:01,381 --> 01:22:04,500
But I think that this is a little
bit of point in here, said,

1291
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:07,050
I just listen to the August 2nd podcast.
He says,

1292
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:11,130
isn't it funny how martyred the
women who choose to bang some loser,

1293
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:15,840
he's talking about single mothers here
who they probably bitch at incessantly.

1294
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,050
This guy sounds like he's
going through a divorce. Um,

1295
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:23,340
and they end up single parent.
Wait a minute.

1296
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,900
I really can't read this week. People.
It's a lack of alcohol in my system.

1297
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,370
All right, let's start over again. Bill,

1298
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:33,250
isn't it funny how martyred the women who
choose to bank some loser and end up a

1299
01:22:33,251 --> 01:22:37,140
single parent like to make
themselves and in his quotes,

1300
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:42,060
I am a single mom. I do it all by myself.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1301
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,280
And the guy goes on to say,

1302
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,820
who told you to get knocked up
before you got an education?

1303
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,770
It's a great fucking point.

1304
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:54,570
Who told you to let some loser
who won't even stick around?

1305
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,180
Oops.
Stick it in you.

1306
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:03,870
When you know what is going to come of it.
You got loaded.

1307
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,110
Found some hottie who works
a part time construction job.

1308
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,160
Hang on, let me keep scrolling
down and let them knock you up.

1309
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:15,520
You chose the loser.
You didn't do birth control.

1310
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:19,630
You didn't wait till you
had your education or your
career going and we need to

1311
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:22,810
celebrate you for being the
poor, pitiful victim. You are.

1312
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,120
Cry me a river cunts.

1313
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:29,830
I have no more sympathy for you than
the people who complain about having no

1314
01:23:29,831 --> 01:23:34,750
money but never run out of beer cigarettes
or lottery tickets and our sporting a

1315
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:38,530
pony keg for a gut from
all the overeating they do.

1316
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:48,130
There you go. People, that is the extreme
opinion of the week. We might've had a,

1317
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,570
a new segment there now obviously.
Um,

1318
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,720
what makes that thing funny is it is, it
is so extreme, but he's also, you know,

1319
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:59,080
he's ignoring the fact that there's a,

1320
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,490
there's different levels of information
that is passed on to people at different

1321
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:07,300
levels of, uh, uh, you know,

1322
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:12,220
look at super rich people have access
to all the fucking information you need.

1323
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:14,710
And even their kids could get fucking
knocked up. But you know what I mean?

1324
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:18,850
As if you really look at the educational
system and the inner city schools and

1325
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:20,740
that type of shit. I mean, Jesus Christ,

1326
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,490
it's fucking horrific
what goes on in there.

1327
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:26,710
And it's absolutely pathetic.

1328
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:33,140
I Dunno that w that people in general
don't give a shit that the more poor you

1329
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:39,250
are, the worst, the fucking free education
that you're supposed to get. His.

1330
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:43,810
So I mean I, I, I do great
it a little bit on a,

1331
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:47,140
on a, uh, what do they call that?

1332
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:51,460
What was that shit when you a scale
grading scandal. Fucking remember,

1333
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,100
I'm a moron. I don't know. I grew
up in the suburbs, so I had a,

1334
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:58,540
I had a decent education and I remember
when I started working in a warehouse

1335
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:02,590
and I started working with
these other kids from Brockton.

1336
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:08,050
And uh, the education that they got
was a way more street education.

1337
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:12,760
Then they got like a, you know, the
x's and o's from school, you know,

1338
01:25:12,761 --> 01:25:17,020
and a lot of them had fucking kids
real young just like their parents did.

1339
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:21,210
And for all you fucking people out
there were picture and blacks and Puerto

1340
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,800
Ricans. These kids were
white. They were white,

1341
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:28,780
but they were listening to that hip hop.
Now I'm fucking around.

1342
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:32,720
No, seriously. So, but that
there is, there is like a, uh,

1343
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:34,760
there,

1344
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:39,760
there is a great point in there where
it's like you weren't born a single mom,

1345
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:43,450
you know what I mean?
Like if somebody is handicap,

1346
01:25:43,451 --> 01:25:47,380
I'd never make some fun of somebody
fucking handicapped. Okay. I wouldn't,

1347
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,300
all right. It's just, you know, it was
an accident or you were born that way,

1348
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:57,130
but you weren't born
pregnant. I don't know. Yeah.

1349
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:57,970
And it's,

1350
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,970
and it's really hard for me from where
I came from to imagine why someone would

1351
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:07,640
want to be, there's actually people
out there who want to have a kid at 16.

1352
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:12,580
MMM. I guess a lot of it comes
down if their parents did it.

1353
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:17,570
I have no fucking idea.
MMM. Yeah. I Dunno.

1354
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,220
But yeah. Any single moms
out there, I mean, did it,

1355
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,580
is there any sort of
responsibility on yourself?

1356
01:26:23,581 --> 01:26:27,210
Do you ever sit down and just be like,
wow, I, you know, no pun intended,

1357
01:26:27,211 --> 01:26:31,220
really fucked myself over here,
you know,

1358
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:38,150
I dunno. I'm of that opinion that
that's how you grow in life. Okay. Okay.

1359
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,480
You know, you can't blame
other peoples for your failure.

1360
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:44,750
Like Peyton manning does every
God damn Sunday he loses.

1361
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:49,980
We had protection issues.
Oh, that actually works.

1362
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:52,680
That's what the single moms should do.

1363
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:55,770
They should come out just like at the end
of one of those Peyton manning fucking

1364
01:26:55,771 --> 01:27:00,010
bad games. He has come out with a
towel around your neck and just say,

1365
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,860
hi, we have protection issues. Um, I don't
know if there was a hole in the condom.

1366
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,460
Oh wait. He didn't even wear one. Um,

1367
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:09,990
it was because look,

1368
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:14,970
he had a condom on initially and then
he went and he put it in my ass and he

1369
01:27:14,971 --> 01:27:19,100
wanted to go back to my vagina. So I
made him take it off because, you know,

1370
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,980
I didn't want to get an infection,
so I didn't get infected for anybody.

1371
01:27:22,981 --> 01:27:23,461
One drink.

1372
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:28,461
But now I have a child and you have no
idea how difficult it is to try to raise

1373
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:33,880
this child. I know it has to be
unbelievably fucking difficult,

1374
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,320
but at the end of the day,

1375
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:38,650
you're the one who laid on your
back and took a hot one. Okay.

1376
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:44,820
So for all you ladies, all
the foodies out there, um,

1377
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:48,090
yeah, don't do that.
This is what you want.

1378
01:27:48,091 --> 01:27:53,091
You want to get married first so you're
legally bound to that son of a bitch.

1379
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,750
So when he knocked you up and then leaves
like the piece of fucking garbage that

1380
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:02,910
he is, he's going to
owe you money. You know,

1381
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:07,280
and I know what you're saying, but what
some of these guys, they just blow it off.

1382
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:08,420
They become dead beat dads.

1383
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:12,740
They'd rather go to fucking jail and he
was then you married a fucking loser.

1384
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,690
Okay. Do you understand that
you're married a fucking loser

1385
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:24,280
and I think this day and age women have
no business complaining about a what?

1386
01:28:26,161 --> 01:28:28,960
They make an hour.
Okay.

1387
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:34,030
Cause if you listen to the beyond say
catalog of music that she's put up,

1388
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,120
if you could sit through that hours
and hours of shit that she has put out,

1389
01:28:39,641 --> 01:28:42,250
evidently you guys,

1390
01:28:42,251 --> 01:28:47,230
your booty licious you're independent
women and a, if you like it,

1391
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:50,590
you got to put a ring on it.
I mean right there is the trilogy.

1392
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:53,110
That's all the information you need

1393
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:58,700
to get ahead in life. I don't know what
the fuck I'm saying. Look, you know,

1394
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:02,100
I'm trying to be, uh, uh, not devil's,
I'm trying to be mediated here.

1395
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:05,880
I understand that shit happens.
I mean,

1396
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:10,470
who out there in their fucking
career never had a girl who was late,

1397
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:15,960
never took a chance.
You know, we all have,

1398
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:19,680
so this guy is wrong for
judging them that harshly,

1399
01:29:19,681 --> 01:29:22,920
but these single moms to 100%

1400
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:28,470
paint themselves as these fucking victims.
You're not all right.

1401
01:29:28,471 --> 01:29:31,890
You know God damn well,
it's not easy to raise a kid.

1402
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:36,060
How do you not fucking know that I
knew that it's 16 that was the horror,

1403
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,470
the fucking horror when I was 16
to get somebody fucking knocked up,

1404
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,730
you know? And I was so fucking
nervous about knock at somebody up.

1405
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,500
I didn't get laid till I was 19.

1406
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:50,430
That's the only reason I
could have got laid at 14.

1407
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,360
Me coming down the fucking hall
with my orange hair and my freckles,

1408
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:58,290
I was beaten. The ladies off
me. He was like, listen ladies,

1409
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:03,660
I'd love to have a threesome in the
seventh grade. Okay, I get it. You know,

1410
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:07,980
I'm like that White Rhino,
um, rare, um, desirable,

1411
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,230
like the hope diamond.
Oh,

1412
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:15,840
it was pathetic.
But even then in 19,

1413
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:18,840
I started my fucking
bang and career and um,

1414
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:21,810
I'm so full of Shit.

1415
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:23,850
All they would do is just make
sure the girl was on the pill.

1416
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,310
This is back when we thought I aids.

1417
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:28,620
You could only get if you were
gay or if you were a trucker.

1418
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:34,020
And um,
you know,

1419
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:36,630
I'm completely full of Shit.
I think if I was a fucking woman,

1420
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,070
I probably have six kids by now.

1421
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:43,950
All right,
there you go.

1422
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:46,830
We need veterans and we need single
moms to fucking chime in here.

1423
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:50,280
Do you think that guy's being too harsh?
Obviously. Obviously he's a little harsh.

1424
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:54,120
All right. Um, oh, here's this thing.
I wanted to re, uh, about the royals.

1425
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:57,390
I actually saved this here. If I
can go back for a second. I bill,

1426
01:30:57,391 --> 01:31:00,960
I've heard you many times talk about
how the Red Sox and Yankees are ruining

1427
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:04,550
baseball with how many stars they
are able to buy. Unlike other teams.

1428
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,090
I agree with you to a certain extent.

1429
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,840
I think there should be a salary cap to
make it more fair for everyone in the

1430
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:13,020
league. However, here is a fun fact.

1431
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:16,830
The owner of the royals is
a recent CEO of Walmart.

1432
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:20,280
The royals are one of the few teams.
Hang on here.

1433
01:31:20,281 --> 01:31:25,281
One of the few teams used as an example
of how teams without enough money can't

1434
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:29,070
compete yet their owner is
a multibillionaire dude,
that guy's not a mall.

1435
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:32,400
You're not United CEO of Walmart
and you're a multi billionaire.

1436
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:36,810
I bet as a CEO he probably makes some
disgusting amount, like 10 million a year.

1437
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:41,760
Um, well, and I don't
know if I agree with this.

1438
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:44,820
You're acting as if
Walmart owns the royals.

1439
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:47,400
It's a CEO of Walmart.

1440
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,780
Can we find out how much those guys make?
Hasn't,

1441
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:55,350
one of them written a book like the secret
to success and he sits there and his

1442
01:31:55,351 --> 01:32:00,040
fucking seersucker suit with his hand
on his fuck his head in his hand.

1443
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,271
And that, that, you know,

1444
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:05,080
that smile that Jay Leno smile where
you don't show your teeth, you know,

1445
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:10,960
that's supposed to be like the relaxed.
It's EA. It's easy. I mean he's going,

1446
01:32:10,961 --> 01:32:13,520
you interviewed them many in it
and he talked to the guy who uh,

1447
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:18,210
please a trumpet, um, how teams can
compete with a number of about, yeah.

1448
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:20,440
It's not about how much
money the team has.

1449
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:24,700
It's about how much the owners are
willing to invest on the team. No,

1450
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:28,330
it is about how much it is
about how much money you have.

1451
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:32,230
You don't have enough money to
invest into the fucking team.

1452
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,980
Listen to this standard. It's not
about how much money the team has,

1453
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:38,020
it's about how much the
owners are willing to invest.

1454
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:43,021
So I guess he's making the leap now that
because this guy is a CEO for Walmart,

1455
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:48,940
that he's now a multibillionaire.
God dammit. I love when I list,

1456
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:51,430
when I find out my listeners
are just as dumb as I am.

1457
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,790
He's not a multibillionaire.

1458
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:58,720
Walmart itself takes in
billions of dollars every year.

1459
01:32:58,721 --> 01:33:02,620
And I know that because I've
never looked it up. Okay.

1460
01:33:02,621 --> 01:33:07,300
But they don't pay a CEO
multi billions of dollars.

1461
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:12,190
I bet the Walmart family, the
upper echelon, the JP Morgans,

1462
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:16,270
the incest you was family that
continues to fuck each other.

1463
01:33:16,271 --> 01:33:19,240
So the money stays in their family.

1464
01:33:19,241 --> 01:33:21,850
I law the fucking Rothchild family.
Right.

1465
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:25,270
That's how you end up with a kid in
the attic, if you know what I'm saying

1466
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:29,080
though yet. Cause I don't know what
I'm saying. All right. So anyways,

1467
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:31,990
he says the Walmart guy doesn't
give a fuck about baseball,

1468
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,500
so he doesn't risk the money on his. But
see, this is why I love being in bars.

1469
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:36,970
This is what this guy's doing right now.

1470
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:42,040
He just assumed that because the CEO of
Walmart is one of the owners of Kansas,

1471
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:46,210
the Kansas city royals, that that
guy's a multi fucking billionaire.

1472
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,600
And then with that knowledge that
he just pulled out of his ass,

1473
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:53,530
he's now going to complete the
fucking dismount with this statement.

1474
01:33:53,531 --> 01:33:56,020
The Walmart guy doesn't
give a fuck about baseball,

1475
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:58,180
so he doesn't risk his money on his team.
Yeah,

1476
01:33:58,181 --> 01:34:02,230
he doesn't give a fuck about baseball.
He just bought a God damn team. Um,

1477
01:34:02,231 --> 01:34:04,060
if he had the passion of Steinbrenner,

1478
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:08,730
we would be talking about how the royals
and Yankees are ruining baseball and

1479
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:12,130
see now that right there, if you
don't know what my podcast is about,

1480
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:13,450
it's that email right there.

1481
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:18,190
What you do is you start off with a piece
of information that actually is a fact,

1482
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,660
and then you just run with it. You
know, if we were smart on this podcast,

1483
01:34:22,661 --> 01:34:27,040
what we would do is you'd be like, Oh
wow, that guy's a CEO at Walmart. Well,

1484
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:32,110
let's find out how much he makes a year.
Does he own it by himself?

1485
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:37,870
You know, let's find out what it
takes to run a fucking baseball team.

1486
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:38,621
I mean,

1487
01:34:38,621 --> 01:34:42,850
you completely ignored the fact that
Kansas City is not a major media market.

1488
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,110
That's another way that a,

1489
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:48,250
the red sox and Yankees make a ton of
cash with the yes network and Nessun.

1490
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,440
I mean, how many people even
live in Kansas City? Huh?

1491
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:57,930
With your fucking rib
shacks out there. Um, I,

1492
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:00,980
I do know what you're saying
because I know people in Pittsburgh,

1493
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,370
they went through the roof when they
found out that the pirates were one of the

1494
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:07,940
most profitable teams
in the league because a,

1495
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:11,420
they don't spend shit on the team and
then they get all that welfare money from

1496
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:15,860
the Red Sox, Yankees and whoever else
goes over the fucking salary cap.

1497
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:21,080
Um, so there is an element of truth in
that shit. But uh, I'll tell, you know,

1498
01:35:21,081 --> 01:35:23,990
my favorite baseball team is right now.
I mean, I always root for the Red Sox,

1499
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:25,520
but I fucking love the devil race.

1500
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:31,510
The devil rays remind me of like the
orals in the 70s you know what I mean?

1501
01:35:31,941 --> 01:35:36,860
Where they just were a fucking,
just an unbelievable franchisee.

1502
01:35:36,861 --> 01:35:40,690
Orals in the 70s I
swear to God, they, the,

1503
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:44,120
the level of pitchers that
they just one after another,

1504
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:48,590
I don't know how they ended up
getting him. Frank Tenana, Jim Palmer,

1505
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:53,390
they just always had these, these
potentials. Cy Young winning, I'm

1506
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:58,990
winning pitchers and then like the
fucking third baseman in shorts,

1507
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:01,460
shorts starts for like almost 30 years.

1508
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,710
They were bringing up a
fucking hall of Famer.

1509
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:07,970
They had like Frank Robinson,
Brooks Robinson,

1510
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,930
cal Ripkin jr from the sixties
seventies into the 80s.

1511
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,690
I guess frank and Brooke retired.
There was a little bit of a gap there.

1512
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:17,540
Who to fuck paid poop play third base

1513
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:23,010
for the Orioles in the 79 world series?
Uh,

1514
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,730
going back too far,

1515
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,880
I first thought thought I had
was Doug to Sensei Bobby gritch.

1516
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:33,380
Those are like angels, I believe.
California angels, Rod Carew.

1517
01:36:33,381 --> 01:36:37,970
Why am I thinking of those guys? You
know, it's funny as I can remember,

1518
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:41,990
all of the fucking pirates from the,
I guess cause they won.

1519
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:46,340
Okay.
Eddie Murray played first base.

1520
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:50,480
Willie Stargell played first
base for the pirates. Lily.

1521
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:55,430
I can go right around the infield.
Tim Foley was second base. I can't,

1522
01:36:55,431 --> 01:36:59,510
I can only do half the fucking ed art.
Omar Marino,

1523
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:05,930
Dave Parker. John Can Deliria
Kent to Colby. How come?

1524
01:37:05,931 --> 01:37:09,810
I can't remember even the fucking orals.
Remember that guy?

1525
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,030
You remember that guy in the Orioles?

1526
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:13,280
Maybe you can find this
picture on the MM podcast.

1527
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,330
There was a guy in the Orioles who broke
his jaw and through the whole world

1528
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,820
series he had half a football helmet.

1529
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:23,390
Literally like the gray face mask.

1530
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:29,330
I can't remember his fucking
name either. Ah, gives a shit.

1531
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:33,920
I love saying is the fucking that
the devil rays in my God damn team.

1532
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:37,130
I think that that they're the shit.
They don't have a lot of money.

1533
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:41,390
They got a low payroll and they just
have the best prospects in the league and

1534
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:42,690
they're doing it the old school way.

1535
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:46,280
I got nothing but respect for him and
I'm slowly getting back into baseball.

1536
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:50,660
Most of you know when David Ortiz
tested positive for some shit, I just,

1537
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:52,790
I had to tap out.
You know what I mean?

1538
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:57,030
That was like finding out the lone
rangers. A transvestite. It's just, yeah,

1539
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:58,770
there's too much information. I
don't want to know that. Okay.

1540
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:03,270
It's one of my heroes and it, it just,
you know, part of me died that day, so,

1541
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:06,990
but I'm gradually coming back and I'm
coming back because of teams like the

1542
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:10,200
devil race. I just want those teams
to fucking knock off the bigger teams.

1543
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:14,400
I don't give a fuck. What do you can
chant 2007 at me. I don't give a fuck.

1544
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:18,870
All right. Hey, Ron hit
his 600th, whole broad,

1545
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,191
Eh,

1546
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:24,450
you mean the Gao took steroids and had
a good 400 of those fucking home runs on

1547
01:38:24,451 --> 01:38:27,690
roids that guy.
But Gal came back who's allegedly clean,

1548
01:38:27,691 --> 01:38:30,600
but he's just as big as he
was when he was on roids.

1549
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:35,100
Does any doctors out there can anybody
for the love of God explained to me how

1550
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:39,060
the fuck you do roids get off a roids
and you come back and you'd just as

1551
01:38:39,061 --> 01:38:43,080
fucking big.
I think that means you're Rhonda,

1552
01:38:43,081 --> 01:38:44,310
then you're onto the next shit.

1553
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:49,370
Although somebody I know who's really
into baseball stats was telling me that

1554
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:51,930
when,
when he was on the shit,

1555
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,250
he was hitting a home run
like every fucking 14 at bats.

1556
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,500
And then,
uh,

1557
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:02,490
he got off the shit and then it went
to like 18 at bats and now it's down to

1558
01:39:02,491 --> 01:39:06,240
like every 23 at bats. So maybe he's
not on the shit. I don't fucking know

1559
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,380
why. Why am I just openly trashing
people with no information?

1560
01:39:10,381 --> 01:39:12,930
Cause that's what this fucking
podcast is about. All right.

1561
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,100
A few weeks ago I talked about how
I, uh, or maybe it was last week,

1562
01:39:17,101 --> 01:39:21,450
how I was really into breaking bad and
that made everybody want to come out here

1563
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:23,820
and start telling me what
their favorite TV shows are.

1564
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:25,350
So here are some of
you guys can check out.

1565
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:30,100
This is one I didn't even know
exist existed. Uh, moral Orel

1566
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,300
and that was like a claymation show.
Is that what it was?

1567
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:38,940
And it was on adult swim
and it got canceled,

1568
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:41,700
but it really attach religion I guess.

1569
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,750
Then I watched a little bit of it.
It was so fucking depressing.

1570
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:48,000
I don't know if I can watch it.
I have to watch it now.

1571
01:39:48,001 --> 01:39:50,040
I guess it's just available on DVD.

1572
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,190
Go on Youtube and check
out a couple of clips.

1573
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:59,330
There's one where the fucking father is
walking around and it's a first person

1574
01:40:01,921 --> 01:40:06,600
shooter. Um, for those of you play
video games or watch porno, um,

1575
01:40:06,601 --> 01:40:10,110
it's in the first person and he just
keeps looking down at this whiskey glass

1576
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:11,010
and he keeps drinking it.

1577
01:40:11,011 --> 01:40:16,011
Any hears his wife talking to their
child behind closed doors and the kids

1578
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:20,810
going, why does daddy drink? I don't like
it when he drinks and she's just going,

1579
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:25,020
oh, you got to understand
he's just a different person.
When he drinks it's okay.

1580
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:27,720
And she's giggling and laughing
like he has no drinking problem.

1581
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,550
Then she walks out into the hall,

1582
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:34,551
does not see the father and she breaks
down crying for like 20 seconds.

1583
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:39,750
It's fucking brutal. And then she looks
up and sees him who the whole time,

1584
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:43,020
by the way, keeps taking sips of his
whiskey. When she finally sees him,

1585
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,790
she immediately stops crying,

1586
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,240
shuts down all of her emotion and
walks the other way down the hallway.

1587
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:56,800
It's fucking, and I have to watch it.
All right, here's some other ones.

1588
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:59,170
People recommended true blood.
I don't know what that is.

1589
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:02,290
Psych and somebody
recommended honor entourage.

1590
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:05,950
Evidently they still haven't picked up
the fact that it always ends the same way.

1591
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,030
There's a problem and then they all
get on a jet and go to Vegas and it all

1592
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:14,910
works out. Um, underrated.
Overrated for this week. Uh,

1593
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:21,070
overrated. The dollar menu at fast food
joints, underrated, illegal immigrants.

1594
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,600
Um, person. It did not give an
explanation on either one of those.

1595
01:41:25,601 --> 01:41:29,260
And I'm going to actually chime in.
Um,

1596
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:34,870
overrated. This is cause I was in
a touristy place down in San Diego,

1597
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:39,890
La Jolla. Um, overrated would be, uh,

1598
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:43,540
any breakfast place that you have
to fucking stand in line for.

1599
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,890
You know, that's the one
that the chick usually went.

1600
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:53,860
All right,
I got another fucking a underrated for ya.

1601
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,100
Underrated a fucking device that like
you let you know the batteries are gonna

1602
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,260
wear out.
Sorry about that.

1603
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:02,860
I was right in the middle
of the underrated overrated
in my fucking Olympus ls

1604
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:07,240
10. Just fucking conked out on me.
Sorry about that. I was saying,

1605
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:08,860
let me continue here.

1606
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:12,220
Let me just give you guys a breather so
you can figure out what the fuck just

1607
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:14,980
happened. Because the way I'm going
to edit this thing, I know it's,

1608
01:42:14,981 --> 01:42:18,280
it's just going to be really
choppy. Basically. Uh,

1609
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:21,460
my battery's ran out so I was in the
middle of the underrated any of those

1610
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:26,110
fucking breakfast places that have the
long lines at cause they have the best.

1611
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:30,790
It's fucking eggs. It's never
worth the long line. Okay.

1612
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:33,580
I'm not saying to go to some
shit place that has rubber eggs,

1613
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:37,870
but there there's a, there's
another place close by, you know,

1614
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:40,420
and every time he'd go to those
places with the long lines,

1615
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:42,070
it's usually for the chicks because they,

1616
01:42:42,071 --> 01:42:45,400
they're just addicted to sugar and
they want to go in and get the fucking

1617
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:48,730
stuffed French toast with the chine
cream cheese and the fucking ice cream on

1618
01:42:48,731 --> 01:42:51,820
top. Fuck all of that. All
right. You're a goddamn man.

1619
01:42:51,821 --> 01:42:56,080
Go get bacon and eggs at a fucking
diner and get on with your morning. Um,

1620
01:42:56,710 --> 01:43:01,240
I, and, uh, underrated,
I would say is a surfing.

1621
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:06,760
I was down there, I am absolutely in San
Diego, absolutely fucking terrified of,

1622
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:11,080
uh, the ocean. And I
watched these guys surf.

1623
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:13,810
I had my little flip camera there cause
I was hoping someone was going to get

1624
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:17,560
eaten by a shark or at the very least
attacked and I could have this fucking

1625
01:43:17,561 --> 01:43:20,800
awesome video of this guy
getting eaten by a shark.

1626
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,750
And then he'd stick my
head in and be like,

1627
01:43:22,751 --> 01:43:26,590
I'm going to be at the Hampton Beach
Casino this fucking Thursday, you know,

1628
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:31,840
the ultimate fucking promo video or
I guess Friday I'm going to be there,

1629
01:43:31,841 --> 01:43:35,650
you know? But, um, yeah, I
actually, I came real close.

1630
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:37,840
I was going to actually do a,

1631
01:43:37,841 --> 01:43:41,230
I was going to take a surfing class when
I was down there and become the world's

1632
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:44,860
first redheaded surfer,
you know,

1633
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:48,790
and if I actually dominated in that sport,

1634
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:53,791
do you realize that redheads would fucking
be dominating the surfing world from

1635
01:43:56,011 --> 01:43:59,860
fucking snowboarding all
the way to fucking surface?

1636
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:02,670
And that would be it.
And when that ever happened,

1637
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:06,270
you'd know that Jesus was
coming. Um, all right,

1638
01:44:06,271 --> 01:44:10,590
that's the fucking podcast for this week.
Uh, just to let you guys know this week,

1639
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:15,110
on a Thursday, August 12th,
fuck, I'm going to be at the, uh,

1640
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:17,880
Newport Yachting Center in Newport,
Rhode Island.

1641
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,580
And on Friday the 13th,

1642
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:24,330
I'm going to be at the Hampton
ballroom casino and a Hampton Beach,

1643
01:44:24,331 --> 01:44:28,000
New Hampshire. Um, please come out. Uh,

1644
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:31,940
these are big venues, so bring as
many friends as you possibly can.

1645
01:44:31,941 --> 01:44:35,470
Tickets are selling well. So I want to
tell everybody I really appreciate it.

1646
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,080
All the support out there and a,

1647
01:44:38,081 --> 01:44:42,550
and next week I'm playing a brand
new comedy club in Portland,

1648
01:44:42,551 --> 01:44:43,384
Oregon.

1649
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:47,320
And I'm hoping there's a lot of you in
Portland right now out there in Oregon

1650
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:52,300
going, Holy Shit, I don't even know. I had
no idea that there was a club out there,

1651
01:44:52,301 --> 01:44:55,590
nor did I know that bill's coming out
there where I'm letting you know I'm going

1652
01:44:55,591 --> 01:44:58,480
to be in Portland, Oregon.
Um, not this weekend,

1653
01:44:58,481 --> 01:45:01,780
the following weekend, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday. So let's see.

1654
01:45:01,781 --> 01:45:02,920
This Thursday's the 12th.

1655
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:05,230
So that would be the night when I
just look at the fucking calendar.

1656
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:10,000
Why don't I just look at the fucking
calendar? Yeah. The 19th, 20th and 20.

1657
01:45:10,001 --> 01:45:13,440
First I am going to be at the,
um,

1658
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:18,460
at the, at helium helium
comedy club in Philly. Well,

1659
01:45:18,461 --> 01:45:21,420
the same guy opened one out there
in Portland, Oregon. All right.

1660
01:45:21,421 --> 01:45:25,740
Helium Comedy Club. I'm going to be out
there on the 19th 20th and the 21st.

1661
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:29,660
So for the love of God, come
on out, check out the new digs.

1662
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,970
I got a brand new hour.
And once again,

1663
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,390
thanks to everybody who listens to the
podcast and also please don't take the

1664
01:45:35,391 --> 01:45:38,660
podcast seriously. All right. There's
always people doing that shit.

1665
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:43,140
I got an email from somebody who
came out to my show down in La Jolla.

1666
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:48,220
It was saying how he
had to drag his wife to,

1667
01:45:48,221 --> 01:45:49,990
to my show because,
uh,

1668
01:45:49,991 --> 01:45:54,050
all her girlfriends was saying that I
was misogynistic and anti fucking won

1669
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:58,750
women because a,
their husbands listen to my podcast at,

1670
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:03,360
uh, you know, I'm not
anti women, I just, I,

1671
01:46:03,361 --> 01:46:08,000
I just trash them.
So why don't you lighten up fucking horse,

1672
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,770
uh, come out to my shoe. All
right, my house phone is ringing.

1673
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:14,440
That's probably the landlord.

1674
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:17,830
Where's the rent? I will talk to you guys
next week. Everybody have a great week.

1675
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:18,664
Second,
he's

1676
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:25,890
arguing with her diet and natural death.
He caught a nasty virus.

1677
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:28,870
There was the ever present
football player, rapist.

1678
01:46:28,871 --> 01:46:33,370
They were all in love with time. They
were doing. Holly caught a bullet.

1679
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:36,990
It all in head his leg. Well, why? We
should have been up there and got him.

1680
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:40,930
And they were all in love with dye and
they were drinking from a fountain that

1681
01:46:40,931 --> 01:46:43,930
was pouring like an avalanche
is coming down the mountain.

1682
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:50,360
Cheesy it show taste

1683
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:55,350
my glows.
